2500|$|In Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, the Matrix {{rules have}} changed, {{thanks to the}} setting's {{constant}} evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was {{moved away from the}} wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary.

This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or mixed reality. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so [...] "deckers" [...] have once again become [...] "hackers".

50|$|Bluetooth is a {{wireless}} technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio {{waves in the}} ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (<b>PANs).</b> Invented by telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994, it was originally conceived as a concept of {{a wireless}} communication technology to increase computer chip capabilities as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.|$|R
50|$|HomeRF used {{frequency}} hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and in theory could achieve {{a maximum of}} 10 Mbit/s throughput; its nodes could travel within a 50-meter range of a wireless access point while remaining connected to the <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (<b>PAN).</b> Several standards and working groups focused on wireless networking technology in radio frequency (RF). Other standards include the popular IEEE 802.11 family, IEEE 802.16, and Bluetooth.|$|E
50|$|To reach {{requirements}} for wireless LAN applications, Wi-Fi has fairly {{high power consumption}} compared to some other standards. Technologies such as Bluetooth (designed to support wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (<b>PAN)</b> applications) provide a much shorter propagation range between 1 and 100 m and so in general have a lower power consumption. Other low-power technologies such as ZigBee have fairly long range, but much lower data rate. The high power consumption of Wi-Fi makes battery life in mobile devices a concern.|$|E
50|$|A <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (<b>PAN)</b> is a {{computer}} network used for communication among computer and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices {{that are used in}} a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters. A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.|$|E
50|$|ANT is {{primarily}} incorporated into {{sports and fitness}} sensors, though it may additionally be used for other purposes. The transceivers are embedded in equipment such as heart rate monitors, watches, cycling power meters, cadence meters, and distance and speed monitors to form wireless <b>personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (<b>PANs)</b> monitoring a user's performance. ANT Wireless has been attempting to diversify the protocol's applications into other sectors, including health, home automation, and industrial applications.|$|R

50|$|The IEEE {{does not}} test {{equipment}} for compliance with their standards. The non-profit Wi-Fi Alliance {{was formed in}} 1999 to fill this void — to establish and enforce standards for interoperability and backward compatibility, and to promote wireless local-area-network technology. , the Wi-Fi Alliance consisted of more than 375 companies from around the world. The Wi-Fi Alliance enforces {{the use of the}} Wi-Fi brand to technologies based on the IEEE 802.11 standards from the IEEE. This includes wireless local area network (WLAN) connections, device to device connectivity (such as Wi-Fi Peer to Peer aka Wi-Fi Direct), <b>Personal</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (<b>PAN),</b> local area network (LAN) and even some limited wide area network (WAN) connections.

We quantify how synchonous acknowledgments affect common lowpower routing metrics, such as ETX. We identify metrics for detecting modal changes in link quality.
