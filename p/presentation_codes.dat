50|$|Although conceptually simple, this {{architecture}} is {{not conducive to}} large-scale application development because, inevitably, {{a great deal of}} functionality is duplicated in each JSP. Also, the Model 1 architecture unnecessarily ties together the business logic and presentation logic of the application. Combining business logic with presentation logic makes it hard to introduce a new 'view' or access point in an application. For example, in addition to an HTML interface, you might want to include a Wireless Markup Language (WML) interface for wireless access. In this case, using Model 1 will unnecessarily require the duplication of the business logic with each instance of the <b>presentation</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{developed}} a SMIL-based collaborative multimedia authoring tool supporting {{a mechanism for}} conceptually representing the temporal relations between different media. Among the many editors that make up our system, the temporal relation editor provides users with an intuitive mechanism for representing the conceptual flow of a presentation by simple and direct graphical manipulations. Our system proposes TRN (Temporal Relation Network) as its internal multimedia presentation representation. The TRN corresponds exactly to the conceptual temporal structure of the multimedia presentation. A TRN is composed of media objects, delay objects {{and a set of}} temporal relationships among objects. A media object is associated with a duration. A parallel relationship found in a TRN can be collapsed into a single par (parallel) synchronization block. This collapsible synchronization block facilitates the determination of the playing time of each component and can be the basic unit for reusability of already prepared blocks of <b>presentation</b> <b>code.</b> In addition, our system allows users in different places to design together a multimedia presenta-tion collaboratively in reviewing the same presentation at the same time...|$|R

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used request processing model in multithreaded web servers is thread-per-request, in which an individual thread is bound to serve each web request. However, with the prevalence of using template techniques for generating dynamic contents in modern web servers, this conventional request processing model lags behind and cannot provide efficient resource management support for template-based web applications. More precisely, although content <b>code</b> and <b>presentation</b> <b>code</b> of a template-based dynamic web page can be separated into different files, they are still processed by the same thread. As a result, web server resources, especially database connection resources, cannot be efficiently shared and utilized. In this paper, we propose a new request scheduling method, in which a single web request is served by different threads in multiple thread pools for parsing request headers, performing database queries, and rendering templates. The proposed scheme ensures the high utilization of the precious database connections, while templates are being rendered or static contents are being served. We implemented the proposed scheme in CherryPy, a representative template-enabled multithreaded web server, and we evaluated its performance using the standard TPC-W benchmark implemented with the Django web templates. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme reduces the average response times of most web pages by two orders of magnitude and increases the overall web server throughput by 31. 3 % under heavy loads...|$|R

40|$|Object-oriented {{programming}} languages provide e#ective {{means to}} achieve better reuse and extensibility levels, which increases development productivity. However, the object-oriented paradigm has several limitations, sometimes leading to tangled code and spread code. For example, business <b>code</b> tangled with <b>presentation</b> <b>code</b> or data access code, and distribution, concurrency control, and exception handling code spread over several classes. This decreases readability, and therefore, system maintainability. Some extensions of the object-oriented paradigm try to correct those limitations allowing reuse and maintenance in practical situations where the original paradigm does not o#er an adequate support. However, in order to guarantee that those benefits will be achieved by those techniques {{it is necessary to}} use them together with an implementation method. Our objective is to adapt and to analyze an object-oriented implementation method to use aspect-oriented programming in order to implement several concerns to a family of object-oriented system. In particular, we are interested in implementing persistence, distribution, and concurrency control aspects. At the moment we are particularly interested to present some results and get feed back about a performed experiment to identify if and when a progressive approach is better than a non-progressive one. In a progressive approach, persistence, distribution, and concurrency control are not initially considered in the implementation activities, but are gradually introduced, preserving the application's functional requirements. This approach helps in dealing with the inherent complexity of the modern applications, through the support to gradual implementations and tests of the intermediate versions of the application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Wireless {{networks}} {{differ in}} bandwidth, size and access costs each requiring {{a set of}} protocol functions to enable devices to communicate efficiently. Portable multimedia devices such as PDA’s and laptops will also vary greatly however all these devices will require optimal multimedia delivery. A traditional method is for sources to limit their transmission rates to accommodate lower bandwidth links, even though high-bandwidth connectivity is available to many participants. This method similar to others does not provide optimum throughput to heterogeneous clients due to its quest for a common denominator bandwidth. In addition, {{due to the divergence}} of users and applications, traditional protocol stacks are frequently enriched with additional functionality such as transport protocol functionality, synchronization and <b>presentation</b> <b>coding</b> which can lead to a performance bottleneck due to the insufficient processing power and memory of portable devices. Chameleon is 100 % Java middleware for multimedia streaming to heterogeneous mobile clients, which allows the dynamic configuration of protocols with respect to application requirements and available network resources.

We especially concentrate on the secondary quality transformation technique (SQT) of the middleware which enables clients to not only subscribe to media groups in accordance with available resources and network capacity but to also adapt media quality within each quality group dynamically in accordance to resources constraints.

The teachers were provided with quality instructional materials including two haiku poems, a listening map, and an excerpt of Saint-Sa??ns Aquarium. In addition, an instructional DVD illustrating a guided improvisation of a creative dance was provided. Data sources included videotapes of three interdisciplinary dance and literacy lessons, audio recordings of post-lesson teacher interviews, and written lesson plan templets. Videotaped data was transcribed, and teacher learning tasks were identified and coded using a task <b>presentation</b> <b>coding</b> system. The students??? movement responses were coded using a scoring rubric and a qualitative content analysis was conducted on the transcribed post-lesson teacher interviews and lesson plan templets. Findings revealed five themes: (1) The instructional materials, particularly the DVD, contributed to teacher confidence in their understanding of structured improvisation in creative dance; (2) Each of the teachers identified similar dance concepts as viewed on the DVD, specifically changes in levels, use of smooth/fluid dynamics, and mirror and shadow partner relationships; (3) The classroom teachers used the teaching materials, particularly the music and haiku poems, to access their students??? prior knowledge; (4) The classroom teachers used scaffolded instructions, open-ended tasks, and task constraints as strategies to elicit diverse student movement responses. These strategies are identified in the research on creative dance instruction in schools; and (5) Student movement responses varied in the level of competency in four components: musicality, spatial awareness, movement clarity, and integration of poetry themes...|$|R
