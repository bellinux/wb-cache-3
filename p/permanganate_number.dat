40|$|This paper {{dealt with}} {{chemical}} processing and physical properties of wood for pulp of nine woods. The analyses consisted of pulp screen yield, alkali consumption, <b>permanganate</b> <b>number,</b> breaking length, and tearing factor. This analysis {{is very important}} in determining the suitability of wood species as raw material for pulp paper production. Results of chemical pulping process indicated that pulp screen yield in a range of 32. 70 - 47. 71 %, alkali consumption 12. 20 - 15. 50 %, <b>permanganate</b> <b>number</b> 9. 75 - 20. 70, breaking length value 2. 60 - 4. 40 km, bursting factor 27. 51 - 51. 27, tearing factor 74 - 132, and folding endurance 4. 5 - 59. 5 df. The results revealed that all wood species were suitable for pulp and paper production. Chemical processing of these wood species produced high pulp screen yield, low alkali consumption, pulp easily bleached pulp and good physical pulp properties. Two of the species, Horsfieldia sylvetris Warb and Calophyllum inophyllum L. resulted in the best quality of pulp...|$|E
40|$|Mixed {{hardwood}} chips {{were treated}} with lignin-degrading fungi to study the effect of fungal pretreatment on bleaching characteristics of kraft pulp. Pretreated wood chips were subjected to reduced active alkali doses in comparison to untreated chips. Comparable results were obtained for pretreated chips with reduced alkali dose as was obtained with higher dose of alkali in case of untreated chips. Fungal treatment made the process more energy-efficient, and 4. 8 % less chlorine was consumed {{in comparison to the}} control process. Pretreatment with Ceriporiopsis subvermispora was responsible for reduction of 4. 7 % in lignin contents, 14. 3 % <b>permanganate</b> <b>number,</b> and overall reduction of 15. 5 kg/T of Cl 2 consumption. The pollution load in terms of COD and BOD at the CD stage was reduced by 32. 6 % and 41. 5 % respectively, whereas 12 % reduction in AOX compounds was observed in effluent of pretreated pulp...|$|E
40|$|One hundred {{different}} 5. 5 -year-old Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla wood clones were cooked to kappa number 15 - 17. 5 {{and the resulting}} kraft pulps oxygen-delignified to kappa 9. 5 - 11. 5 under fixed conditions, except for chemical charges. Thirteen samples showing large variations in effective alkali requirement, pulp yield and O-stage efficiency and selectivity were selected for brightness reversion studies. These samples were bleached to 90 - 91 % ISO by DEDD and DEDP sequences and their brightness stability and chemical characteristics determined. Heat reversion of the eucalyptus kraft pulps was strongly influenced by the wood supply, with brightness loss varying {{in the range of}} 2. 1 - 3. 6 and 0. 8 - 1. 7 %ISO for ODEDD and ODEDP bleached pulps, respectively. Pulps bleached by the ODEDP sequence showed reversion values 1. 3 - 1. 9 % ISO lower than those bleached by the ODEDD sequence. Pulp carbonyl content decreased by 35 - 40 % during the final peroxide bleaching stage. Carbonyl and carboxyl groups correlated positively with brightness reversion, as did <b>permanganate</b> <b>number</b> and acid soluble lignin. Pulp final viscosity and metal and DCM extractives contents showed no significant correlation with brightness reversion. Pulping, oxygen delignification and ECF bleaching performances also showed no correlation with brightness reversion...|$|E

The weather, number of swimmers and the chlorine gas addition were continuously registered, and the pH was checked a few times at each bath. In bath 1, an indoor pool with aluminium sulphate precipitation {{about once a week}} and with sand filters back-washed every 2 days, less than 10 bacteria/ml. were found in all samples. In bath 2, an outdoor pool with aluminium sulphate precipitation twice a week and with sand filters back-washed twice a week, also few bacteria were found. In bath 3, an outdoor pool with only filtering through sand filters back-washed about every 14 days, high bacterial counts were found every day except the first, when the filters had been newly back-washed. In bath 4, an outdoor pool with only filtering through sand filters back-washed about once a week, high bacterial counts were found now and then during the first 4 days when the weather was warm, but few bacteria were found the last 2 days when the weather was cold and windy, and there were few swimmers...|$|E
40|$|Quatro espécies de bambu do gênero Dendrocalamus (D. giganteus, D. asper, D. latiflorus e D. strictus) foram testadas, em laboratório, para a produção de pasta para papel, através do processo sulfato. Previamente aos cozimentos, determinaram-se as dimensões e os pesos dos colmos, sua densidade básica e as dimensões das fibras. Os cozimentos, efetuados pelo processo sulfato, determinaram rendimento em pasta celulósica branqueável um pouco inferiores àqueles das principais espécies arbóreas usadas para a mesma finalidade. Dendrocalamus giganteus superou as demais espécies, tanto em rendimento como nas características físico-mecânicas do papel. Four bamboo {{species of}} Dendrocalamus (D. asper, D. latiflorus, D. giganteus and D. strictus), were studied to {{determine}} their feasibility for pulp and paper production by the sulphate process. Data was taken on culm characteristics, as well as basic density and fiber dimensions on sample basis. Five cookings involving the four species were carried out in electrically heated rotary autoclave of 20 litres capacity at 14 % of active alkali as Na 2 O, 25 % of sulfidity 1 : 4 ratio of material to liquor and maximum temperature of 160 ± 2 °C during 60 minutes. Unbleached yield and <b>permanganate</b> <b>number</b> of pulps were determined. Handmade sheets with 60 g/s. m. were conditioned at 65 % RH and 21 ºC and their strenght properties tested.
