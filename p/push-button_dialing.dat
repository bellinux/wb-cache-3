50|$|After initial {{customer}} {{trials in}} Connecticut and Illinois, approximately one {{fourth of the}} central office in Findlay, Ohio, was equipped in 1960 with touch-tone digit registers for the first commercial deployment of <b>push-button</b> <b>dialing,</b> starting on 1 November 1960.|$|E
50|$|As {{telephone}} companies continued to levy surcharges for touch-tone service long after any technical justification ceased to exist, a push-button telephone with pulse dialing capability represented {{a means for}} a user to obtain the convenience of <b>push-button</b> <b>dialing</b> without incurring the touch-tone surcharge.|$|E
5000|$|From the 1960s onward, {{the rotary}} dial was {{gradually}} supplanted by dual-tone multi-frequency <b>push-button</b> <b>dialing,</b> first {{introduced to the}} public at the 1962 World's Fair under the trade name [...] "Touch-Tone". Touch-tone technology primarily used a keypad in form of a rectangular array of push-buttons for dialing.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s {{interactive}} response systems in some industries required additional signaling beyond the ten digits. In 1968, the # key and the * key {{were added to}} the <b>push-button</b> <b>dial</b> pad, and the 2500-type telephone entered production. The additional keys were located {{on either side of the}} '0' button to fill the matrix of 4-by-3 keys. These keys were initially unused by most customers, but would later be used for vertical service codes, and voice mail menu navigation. In 1974, when modular connectors were introduced, the 2500 telephone was fitted with modular connectors for the handset cord as well as the line cord, resulting in type designations suffixed with M, e.g. 2500DM. The 2500 is still commonly encountered today and it is still produced by several companies.|$|R
25|$|There are {{numerous}} types of knitting machines, ranging from simple spool or board templates with no moving parts to highly complex mechanisms controlled by electronics. All, however, produce {{various types of}} knitted fabrics, usually either flat or tubular, and of varying degrees of complexity. Pattern stitches can be selected by hand manipulation of the needles, or with <b>push-buttons</b> and <b>dials,</b> mechanical punch cards, or electronic pattern reading devices and computers.|$|R
50|$|The {{essential}} elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location. In addition, most telephones contain a ringer which produces a sound to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad used to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone. Until approximately the 1970s most telephones used a rotary dial, which was superseded by the modern DTMF <b>push-button</b> <b>dial,</b> first introduced to the public by AT&T in 1963. The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The dial may be located either on the handset, or on a base unit to which the handset is connected. The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telephone network to the receiving phone. The receiving telephone converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver, or sometimes a loudspeaker. Telephones permit duplex communication, meaning they allow the people on both ends to talk simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|As direct {{distance}} dialing {{expanded to}} {{a growing number of}} communities, local numbers (often four, five or six digits) were extended to standardized seven-digit named exchanges. A toll call to another area code was eleven digits, including the leading 1. In the 1950s, AT&T conducted extensive studies of product engineering and efficiency and concluded that <b>push-button</b> <b>dialing</b> was preferable to rotary dialing.|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{with which}} 123 I activity {{is measured by}} a dose calibrator depends on the composition and geometry of the source. The present study assessed the variability of current commercial dose calibrators in assaying liquid 123 I samples. Methods: A calibration procedure for 123 I measurement was performed on 177 dose calibrators (11 manufacturers) at 138 sites in North America and Europe. Using the standard 123 I <b>push-button</b> or <b>dial</b> setting, activity in a 5 -mL 123 I calibration source in a 10 -mL U. S. Pharmacopeia type 1 glass vial (actual activity previously determined using a National Institute of Standards and Technologyâ€“traceable standard metrology chamber) was measured. A portion of the source was then transferred to a plastic syringe (10 -, 5 -, and 3 -mL sizes at differ-ent sites), and the activity in the syringe was measured. Cali-bration factors (CFs) for converting the dose calibrator reading...|$|R
50|$|From {{as early}} as 1836 onward, various {{suggestions}} and inventions of dials for sending telegraph signals were reported. After the first commercial telephone exchange was installed in 1878, {{the need for an}} automated, user-controlled method of directing a telephone call became apparent. Addressing the technical shortcomings, Almon Brown Strowger invented a telephone dial in 1891. Before 1891, numerous competing inventions, and 26 patents for <b>dials,</b> <b>push-buttons,</b> and similar mechanisms, specified methods of signalling a destination telephone station that a subscriber wanted to call. Most inventions involved costly, intricate mechanisms and required the user to perform complex manipulations.|$|R
