The proposed scheme uses a 1 : r channel dimension expansion on the CS measurements for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> channel <b>noise.</b> Simulation results show that optimizing the choice of r and the power allocation between the r transmissions significantly improve the system performance when compared to existing CS-communication schemes. Moreover, we consider the asymptotic behaviour of our CS system as the channel signal-to-noise ratio grows without bound and show that the proposed scheme achieves the optimal scaling exponent.

Taking into account the enormous high peaks of air traffic noise and its concentration at a limited number of airports, the Law for <b>Protection</b> <b>against</b> Aircraft <b>Noise</b> of 1971 sought to balance two conflicting demands, the first being the legitimate demand by industry, business and the public for an efficient air-traffic-system, and secondly, the understandable and by no means less legitimate claims of the affected people for protection and compensation. The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called [...] "Lärmschutzzonen" [...] (<b>protection</b> areas <b>against</b> aircraft <b>noise)</b> for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet air craft, and the law also authorised the Federal Department of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the [...] "Bundesrat," [...] the representation of the German Federal States.|$|R
