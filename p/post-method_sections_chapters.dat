40|$|Initiated by {{studying}} the characteristics of our 1 st generation opto-electronic packet switch (VIVALDI), we identified the impacting factors {{for the performance of}} a generic system under a burst-like traffic environment. Analyzing the complex relationship between system resource (i. e. connectivity and throughput) and performance (i. e. packet delays), a novel architecture based on a revolutionary principle of group switching was designed that produced significant reduction in the hardware required and the difficulties in operations, and yet still achieved an acceptable level of performance. The centre of the architecture lays a novel solid state switching device with ultra fast response characteristics – in the order of microseconds. The deployment of this new device further reduces the required level of system complexity – making the architecture a truly practical solution. An experimental demonstrator was designed and built to verify the feasibility of the new device in the application of optical switching. This thesis is structured in five sections. The first <b>section</b> (<b>chapter</b> 1 & 2) states the motivations and goals of our research work and looks at the currently available methods of optical switching. The second <b>section</b> (<b>chapter</b> 3) discusses the analysis conducted on the 1 st generation VIVALDI architecture. The results and analytical methods used form a foundation for our more advanced architecture. The third <b>section</b> (<b>chapters</b> 4 - 7) presents the origination of the group switching principle and the architectural design of the novel system. Simulations are used to assess the performance of the system. In the fourth <b>section</b> (<b>chapter</b> 8), we discuss the results of our experimental work from the optical core demonstrator. Finally, in <b>section</b> five (<b>chapter</b> 9), we conclude our findings from the project and provide guidelines to future research works.

In the first <b>section</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 2) I use data from field mapping, isotopic geochronology, whole rock geochemistry and trace element concentrations in zircons to examine the petrology, geochemistry and ages of the Haquira East porphyry copper deposit of southern Peru. In the second <b>section</b> (<b>Chapters</b> 3 - 6) I investigate the timing, temperature, zonation and lifespan of the magmatic-hydrothermal alteration and Cu-Mo mineralization by applying field mapping, whole rock geochemistry, petrography, geothermometry, spectral, X-ray and cathodoluminiscense imaging of rock samples. The timescales of the magmatic-hydrothermal system was constrained by isotopic dating, diffusion of titanium in quartz and the novel approach of oxygen diffusion via δ¹⁸O of quartz analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. These data are also used construct cross-sections and 3 D models. In the final <b>section</b> (<b>Chapter</b> 7) I describe the production and evaluation of a calibration for portable X-ray spectrometers that could potentially be applied to further investigate porphyry copper deposits.

40|$|This essay {{engages in}} {{a reading of}} the Zhongyong (中庸 Doctrine of the Mean) through the lens of a reader and student of the Stoics. This, I hope, shall prove to be rewarding. True, what {{separates}} Confucius’s school from that of Zeno is considerable, and should be neither overlooked nor understated; a comparative approach is possible, however, and the very foundations for such an undertaking {{are to be found in}} a famous saying from the Lún yŭ (論語 Analects) in which the Master states that “by nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart” (17. 2). 1 This essay focuses on the first thirteen chapters of the book.

It also examines the evolution of major economic groupings, such as the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the steps being taken to establish the Free Trade Area of the Americas, and recent decisions taken by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Council, all of which directly or indirectly influences Latin American and Caribbean products' access to the region's principal markets. The second <b>section</b> (<b>chapters</b> III, IV and V) deals with Latin American and Caribbean trade and trade policy in 1997 - 1998 and includes a discussion of the trade policies and performance of the countries of the region from June 1997 to August/September 1998, an assessment of the various export promotion tools that comply with multilateral trading regulations and standards, and an analysis of the composition of the region's trade deficits during the 1990 s. The third <b>section</b> (<b>chapters</b> VI and VII) explores the concept of regional convergence and outlines the main stages to be observed in the regional integration process during the period from June 1997 to August 1998.
