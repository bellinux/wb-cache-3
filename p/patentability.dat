25|$|Macrossan {{sought a}} review of the patent examiner's finding, by way of a hearing before a UKPO hearing officer - she held that the {{application}} related to a computer program as such, a method for doing business as such, and a method for performing a mental act as such, and thus was excluded from <b>patentability</b> on each of those three grounds.|$|E
25|$|Aerotel sued Telco Holdings Limited for patent {{infringement}} in February 2005 and Telco counterclaimed for revocation of the patent. The action {{started in}} the Patents County Court, but HHJ Fysh QC transferred it to the High Court in November 2005. In February 2006, Telco applied for summary judgment on its counterclaim, basing the application on the exclusion to <b>patentability.</b> This application succeeded before Lewison J who ordered revocation of the patent on 3 May 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{filing of}} an {{international}} application results in an international search performed by a patent office, accompanied with a written opinion regarding the <b>patentability</b> of the invention which {{is the subject of}} the application. An applicant may also request an international preliminary examination performed by a patent office. The PCT does not provide that the searches and examinations are to be performed by one central patent office, as the WIPO does not perform searches and examinations. In contrast, the European Patent Convention (EPC) places the European Patent Office (EPO) in charge of performing searches and examinations for European patent applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for granting patents, requirements {{placed on the}} patentee, {{and the extent of}} the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant <b>patentability</b> requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others, or at least to try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without permission.|$|E
25|$|In Pioneer, the United States Supreme Court laid to {{rest the}} {{question}} of whether sexually reproduced plants were statutory subject matter under section 101. The Court made clear that if inventors of new varieties of plants are able to meet the stringent <b>patentability</b> standards of section 101 and section 112, they will be entitled to utility patent protection. Additionally, the Court clarified that section 101 can also be reconciled with the PPA and the PVPA. In fact, the three statutes may provide overlapping protection and are not mutually exclusive. Thus, inventors of new plant varieties are free to apply for protection under each regime and may benefit from the protection provided by each regime.|$|E
25|$|TRIPS-plus {{conditions}} mandating standards beyond TRIPS {{have also}} {{been the subject of}} scrutiny. These FTA agreements contain conditions that limit the ability of governments to introduce competition for generic producers. In particular, the United States has been criticised for advancing protection well beyond the standards mandated by TRIPS. The United States Free Trade Agreements with Australia, Morocco and Bahrain have extended <b>patentability</b> by requiring patents be available for new uses of known products. The TRIPS agreement allows the grant of compulsory licenses at a nation’s discretion. TRIPS-plus conditions in the United States FTA’s with Australia, Jordan, Singapore and Vietnam have restricted the application of compulsory licenses to emergency situations, antitrust remedies, and cases of public non-commercial use.|$|E
25|$|Cooley and Tukey {{published}} {{a more general}} version of FFT in 1965 that is applicable when N is composite and not necessarily a power of 2. Tukey {{came up with the}} idea during a meeting of President Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, a fast Fourier transform algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, Richard Garwin recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3. Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at IBM's Watson labs) for implementation. Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short six months. As Tukey didn't work at IBM, the <b>patentability</b> of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.|$|E
2500|$|There is no general {{prohibition}} on the <b>patentability</b> of business methods in Australia. Their <b>patentability</b> {{is determined by}} applying the tests {{used to determine the}} <b>patentability</b> of any type of invention. However, in the decision of Grant v Commissioner of Patents [...] FCAFC 120, at paragraph , the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia held that a business method will only be patentable if it has a physical aspect, being a concrete, tangible, physical, or observable effect or phenomenon. Accordingly, 'pure' business methods, being those that do not have a physical aspect, are not patentable in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|These {{provisions}} have {{no legal}} consequence {{as regards the}} <b>patentability</b> in national or regional patent offices designated [...] in a PCT application, as the law of most national or regional offices [...] requires that they draw their own conclusions {{based on their own}} national or regional patent law. This is in complete compliance with the PCT since [...] provides that, as far as substantive conditions of <b>patentability</b> are concerned, national and regional patent laws prevail: ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{controversy}} {{has been over}} the TRIPS Article 27 requirements for <b>patentability</b> [...] "in all fields of technology", {{and whether or not}} this necessitates the granting of software and business method patents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{judgment}} briefly {{mentions the}} TRIPS {{agreement and the}} fact that its lack of a list of exclusions from <b>patentability</b> and its requirement that patents should be available in [...] "all fields of technology" [...] puts political pressure on Europe to remove or reduce the categories of non-inventions. However, Jacob had previously ruled that TRIPS does not have direct effect on UK law and thus did not affect the case in question. Instead, cases relating to the exclusions from <b>patentability</b> must be decided by simply {{trying to make sense of}} the language of the EPC without bias for or against exclusion.|$|E
2500|$|... {{three of}} the thorniest issues in the <b>patentability</b> thicket: (1) the {{continued}} viability of business method patents, (2) what constitutes sufficient physical transformation or machine-implementation to render a process patentable, and (3) {{the extent to which}} computer software and computer-implemented processes constitute statutory subject matter.|$|E
2500|$|The EPO Boards of Appeal, in T 154/04 further {{states that}} the {{examination}} of {{whether there is an}} invention within the meaning of [...] has to be strictly separated from and not mixed up with the other three <b>patentability</b> requirements referred to in [...]|$|E

2500|$|This has not {{happened}} in most cases. [...] A 2005 report by the WHO found that many developing countries have not incorporated TRIPS flexibilities (compulsory licensing, parallel importation, limits on data protection, use of broad research and other exceptions to <b>patentability,</b> etc.) into their legislation to the extent authorized under Doha.|$|E
2500|$|... {{an unfortunate}} and {{apparently}} unconscious, though clear, commingling of distinct statutory provisions which are conceptually unrelated, namely, those {{pertaining to the}} categories of inventions in § 101 which may be patentable and to the conditions for <b>patentability</b> demanded by the statute for inventions within the statutory categories, particularly the nonobviousness condition of § 103.|$|E
2500|$|According to some, {{the fact}} that the PCT does not deal {{directly}} with the scope of patentable subject matter, in relation to computer programs, adds [...] "weight to the contention that, having been born out of administrative inconvenience rather than any great principle, restrictions on <b>patentability</b> of programs should be limited to the maximum possible extent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Judge Rader also filed [...] "additional reflections" [...] to {{the ruling}} (not joined by any other judges) expressing {{his view of the}} patent statute as {{allowing}} very broad <b>patentability</b> under §101, and his understanding that natural laws are restricted to [...] "universal constants created, if at all, only by God, Vishnu, or Allah."

In the European Commission, Bolkestein was {{responsible}} for internal market taxation and customs union issues. Some of the more politically sensitive items in his portfolio were the draft community patent regulation and the draft directives on the <b>patentability</b> of computer-implemented inventions and services in the internal market, the so-called [...] "Bolkestein Directive", which has {{become the focus of}} heated debate.|$|E
2500|$|An accused {{infringer}} has {{the right}} to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a counterclaim. [...] A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries. [...] Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for <b>patentability</b> in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a prior publication, for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated. [...] An example is the UK Certificate of contested validity.|$|E
2500|$|However, if the claimed {{subject-matter}} [...] "specifies an apparatus or a technical process {{for carrying out}} at least {{some part of the}} scheme, that scheme and the apparatus or process have to be examined as a whole." [...] In such a case, the {{claimed subject-matter}} is considered to be of a technical nature and is not barred from <b>patentability</b> under [...] It then has to be assessed, as a second step, whether the invention involves an inventive step, considering that the [...] "features which do not contribute to the technical character of the invention cannot support the presence of an inventive step".|$|E
2500|$|We have {{observed}} with regret that the briefs {{filed by the}} Solicitor General for Acting Commissioner Parker in Parker v. Flook, a case which, as the Court noted, [...] "turns entirely on the proper construction of § 101," [...] badly, and with a seeming sense of purpose, confuse the statutory-categories requirement of § 101 with a requirement {{for the existence of}} [...] "invention." [...] This they do by basing argument on the opening words of § 101, [...] "Whoever invents or discovers," [...] thereby importing into the discussion of compliance with § 101 a requirement for [...] "invention" [...] in a <b>patentability</b> sense.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, the USPTO {{took the}} {{position}} that [...] "methods of doing business" [...] were not patentable. [...] With the emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of patent applications on internet or computer enabled methods of doing commerce, however, USPTO {{found that it was}} no longer practical to determine if a particular computer implemented invention was a technological invention or a business invention. [...] Consequently, they took {{the position that}} examiners would not have to determine if a claimed invention was a method of doing business or not. [...] They would determine <b>patentability</b> based on the same statutory requirements as any other invention.|$|E
2500|$|Once filed, {{a patent}} {{application}} is [...] "prosecuted". A patent examiner reviews the patent application {{to determine if}} it meets the <b>patentability</b> requirements of that country. [...] If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their patent agent or attorney through an Office action, to which the applicant may respond. [...] The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent. [...] In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an opposition proceeding between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.|$|E

Watson was opposed to Healy's attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the [...] "laws of nature." [...] Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; he said, [...] "The {{nations of the world}} must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, as opposed to its nations." [...] He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs.

2500|$|When {{examination}} of Novartis' patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic {{companies that were}} already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. [...] The application {{was rejected by the}} patent office and by an appeal board. [...] The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the <b>patentability</b> of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. [...] That section, 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if [...] "they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy." [...] At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Section 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. [...] Novartis lost that case and did not appeal. [...] Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India's Supreme Court, which took the case.|$|E
2500|$|Independently {{from the}} {{possibility}} to intervene in opposition proceedings (and then to become party to the proceedings), anyone may also file observations under [...] After publication of a European patent application, and a fortiori after grant of a European patent, anyone may file observations regarding the <b>patentability</b> of the invention which {{is the subject of}} the application (during examination proceedings) or patent (during opposition proceedings). In contrast to an intervener however, a person filing observations during opposition proceedings does not become party to the proceedings. This notably means that such person does not acquire the [...] "bundle of procedural rights" [...] created [...] "in respect of the opponent", such as the right to be heard before any decision is taken. Observations by third parties, which must be filed in writing, may be filed by post or online. According to Board of Appeal 3.3.08, the observations have to be signed [...] "in order to allow an identification of the third party" [...] and, unless [...] "adopted by a party to the proceedings as its own" [...] or by the competent organ of the EPO of its own motion, [...] "anonymous third party observations are to be disregarded altogether." ...|$|E
