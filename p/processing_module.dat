25|$|For speech perception, {{the model}} starts with an {{external}} acoustic signal (e.g. produced by an external speaker). This signal is preprocessed, passes the auditory map, {{and leads to}} an activation pattern for each syllable or word {{on the level of}} the auditory-phonetic <b>processing</b> <b>module</b> (ES: external signal, see Fig. 5). The ventral path of speech perception (see Hickok and Poeppel 2007) would directly activate a lexical item, but is not implemented in ACT. Rather, in ACT the activation of a phonemic state occurs via the phonemic map and thus may lead to a coactivation of motor representations for that speech item (i.e. dorsal pathway of speech perception; ibid.).|$|E

The hypothetical locations of primary motor and primary sensory maps are given in magenta, the hypothetical locations of motor plan state map and sensory state maps (within sensory-phonetic <b>processing</b> <b>module,</b> comparable to the error maps in DIVA) are given in orange, and the hypothetical locations for the mirrored phonetic map is given in red. Double arrows indicate neuronal mappings. Neural mappings connect neural maps, which are not far apart from each other (see above). The two mirrored locations of the phonetic map are connected via a neural pathway (see above), leading to a (simple) one-to-one mirroring of the current activation pattern for both realizations of the phonetic map. This neural pathway between the two locations of the phonetic map {{is assumed to be}} a part of the fasciculus arcuatus (AF, see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a throughput-scalable {{parallel}} and pipeline architecture for high-throughput compu-tation of multilevel three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (3 -D DWT). The computation of 3 -D DWT for each level of decomposition is split into three distinct stages, and all the three stages are implemented in parallel by a processing unit consisting of an array of <b>processing</b> <b>modules.</b> The <b>processing</b> unit for the first level decomposition of a video stream of frame-size (M×N) consists of Q/ 2 <b>processing</b> <b>modules,</b> where Q {{is the number of}} input samples available to the structure in each clock cycle. The processing unit for a higher level of decomposition requires 1 / 8 times the number of <b>processing</b> <b>modules</b> required by the processing unit for its preceding level. For J level 3 -D DWT of a video stream, each of the proposed structures involves J processing units in a cascaded pipeline. The proposed structure...|$|R

It was used in bichromatic analyzers which Liston designed for Abbott Laboratories, beginning with the ABA-100. The ABA-100 was a single-reagent double-channel kinetic analyzer for ultra-micro chemical analysis and simultaneous bichromatic spectrophotometry. One module of the instrument performed the chemical processing, dispensing the reagent and sample for the reaction and performing the spectrophotometry measurements. A second module monitored and controlled the <b>processing</b> <b>module</b> and calculated and reported results. Later models incorporated specialty microprocessors instead of memory chips.|$|E

40|$|Runtime {{reconfigurable}} system-on-chip {{designs for}} FPGAs pose manifold {{demands on the}} underlying system architecture and design tool capabilities. The system architecture has to support varying communication needs of a changing number of processing units mapped onto diverse locations. Design tools should support an arbitrary placement of <b>processing</b> <b>modules</b> and the adjustment of boundaries of reconfigurable regions {{to the size of}} the actually instantiated <b>processing</b> <b>modules.</b> While few works address the design of flexible system architectures, the adjustment of boundaries of reconfigurable regions {{to the size of the}} actually instantiated <b>processing</b> <b>modules</b> is hardly ever considered due to design tool limitations. In this paper, a technique for circumventing this restriction is presented. It allows for a rededication of the reconfigurable area to a different number of individually sized reconfigurable regions. This technique is embedded in the design flow of a runtime reconfigurable system architecture for Xilinx Virtex- 4 FPGAs. The system architecture will also be presented to provide a realistic application example...|$|R
