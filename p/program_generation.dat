50|$|Over time, layers were equated to features, where {{a feature}} is an {{increment}} in program functionality. The paradigm for program design and generation was recognized {{to be an}} outgrowth of relational query optimization, where query evaluation programs were defined as relational algebra expressions, and query optimization was expression optimization. A software product line (SPL) is a family of programs where each program is defined by a unique composition of features. FOSD has since evolved into the study of feature modularity, tools, analyses, and design techniques to support feature-based <b>program</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Increased {{complexity}} of ASICs lead to requirements of more complex test programs with longer development times. An automated test <b>program</b> <b>generation</b> could simplify and speed up this process. Teradyne Inc. together with Robert Bosch GmbH agreed to developed a concept and a tool chain for an automated test-program generation. To achieve this a tester independent programming language was required. Hence, UTSL, {{a programming language}} that enables detailed description of tests that can be translated into the ATE specific programming language was developed. The ATE manufacturers need to provide a Test Program Generator that uses the UTSL test description as inputs and generates the ATE-specific test code with optimal resource mapping and better practice program code.|$|E
50|$|The VAL robot {{language}} is permanently stored {{as a part}} of the VAL system. This includes the programming language used to direct the system for individual applications. The VAL language has an easy to understand syntax. It uses a clear, concise, and generally self-explanatory instruction set. All commands and communications with the robot consist of easy to understand word and number sequences. Control programs are written on the same computer that controls the robot. As a real-time system, VAL's continuous trajectory computation permits complex motions to be executed quickly, with efficient use of system memory and reduction in overall system complexity. The VAL system continuously generates robot control commands, and can simultaneously interact with a human operator, permitting on-line <b>program</b> <b>generation</b> and modification.|$|E

Moreover, partial differential equations(PDEs) problems can be solved by parallel programs which are generated by P-NCAS supports. P-NCAS employs the Single Program Multi Data (SPMD) and uses a decomposition method for the parallelisation. These enable users of P-NCAS to input problems described by PDES, algorithm and discretisation scheme etc., and to view and edit all details through the visualisation and windows for edition. At last, parallel program will be outputted in C language by P-NCAS and also include documents which show everything has inputted in the beginning.|$|E
