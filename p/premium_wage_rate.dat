The policy is a promise by the firm that it will announce acertain output level and a <b>wage</b> <b>premium</b> <b>rate,</b> and if it actually produces more than the announced output level, then it will pay each employee a <b>wage</b> <b>premium</b> uniformly. In the first stage, each firm independently decides whether or not to adopt the policy. In the second stage, each firm independently chooses its actual output. It is then shown that there exists an equilibrium in which at least one firm adopts the policy. ...|$|R

They may, for example, choose shift work because of compensating wages but {{it is also possible that}} they prefer shift work. The previous empirical evidence is mixed. We study if there are compensating wages for shift work by estimating a switching regression model with endogenous switching using French matched employer–employee data for male full time blue collar workers. It is crucial to adjust for selectivity and not to pool data for shift and day workers. A main result is that there is a significant shift <b>premium,</b> the <b>wage</b> <b>rate</b> for shift workers is 16 percent higher than for day workers. A second main result is that the shift premium is significant for shift work choice. This premium compensates workers who do not self–select into shift work. A 1 percentage point increase in the premium increases the shift work probability by 0. 87 percentage points. shift work premium; compensating wage differentials; switching regression model with endogenous switching...|$|R
40|$|When {{entering}} {{the job market}} registered nurses (RNs) face job alternatives with differences in wages and other job attributes. Previous studies of the nursing labor market have shown large earnings differences between similar hospital and non-hospital RNs. Corresponding differences are found {{in some of the}} analyses of shift and regular daytime workers. In {{the first part of this}} paper I analyze the wage differentials in the Norwegian public health sector, applying a switching regression model. I find no hospital premium for the shift RNs and a slightly negative hospital premium for the daytime RNs, but it is not significant for the hospital job choice. I find a positive shift <b>premium.</b> The <b>wage</b> <b>rate</b> is 19 % higher for the shift working hospital RNs and 18 % for the sample of primary care workers. The shift premium is only weakly significant for the shift work choice for the sample of hospital RNs, and not for the primary care RNs. I identify some selection effects. In the second part of the paper I focus on the shift compensation only, and present a structural labor supply model with a random utility function. This is done to identify the expected compensating variation necessary for the nurses to remain on the same utility level when they are “forced” from a day job to a shift job. The expected compensating variations are derived by Monte Carlo simulations and presented for different categories of hours. I find that on average the offered combination of higher wages, shorter working hours and increased flexibility overcompensates for the health and social strains related to shift work.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{existence}} of a net union premium and of the extent of rationing by quality of the resulting excess supply. The net union premium was estimated by relating changes in wages to changes in union status of the same worker in longitudinal panels (NLS and MID), and by two cross—section wage level regressions, a "prospective't and "retrospective" which permit more direct observation of selectivity in hiring. Over a half of the cross—section differential of over 20 % for the "same " (stan-dardized) worker is a net union rent and much of the rest reflects a quality adjustment in hiring, as measured by wages. This conclusion was less reliable for older workers.

We present an econometric framework taking into account self selection into volunteering and simultaneity between the volunteering decision and the determination of income in order to test these two models and to identify the underlying motives. We find strong statistical evidence for the investment model with a highly robust and significant impact of volunteering on the <b>wage</b> <b>rate.</b> On average the <b>wage</b> <b>premium</b> as the difference in the <b>wage</b> <b>rate</b> between one person volunteering and not volunteering amounts up to 15. 7 percent.

As far as the consumption model is concerned we find no convincing statistical evidence for its validity. The strong evidence for the investment model requires the consideration of voluntary activities in the estimation of wage equations. Moreover, we conclude that the existence of the <b>wage</b> <b>premium</b> is a decisive factor for people to volunteer or not and therefore reflects an important argument in the recruitment process of volunteers for several organisations...|$|R

The relation has an important policy implication that it is the cash constraint that obstructs rural households from entering into a market of off-farm wage activities.
