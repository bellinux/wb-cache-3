40|$|Curriculum, {{as one of}} {{the three}} {{educational}} message systems (with pedagogy and assessment), can be understood as potentially complicit with disconnections and missed opportunities for creating connections in teaching and learning. This is particularly the case if the curriculum is removed from the lived experiences and situated aspirations of groups of learners. At the same time, curriculum can function as the vehicle for creating and sustaining meaningful connections in teaching and learning if it engages respectfully with those experiences and helps to fulfill those aspirations. This chapter explores curriculum’s capacity to create educational connections by interrogating a previously marginalized field of educational provision and research: <b>post-compulsory</b> vocational <b>education</b> and training, incorporating senior secondary schooling, Technical and Further Education Colleges and their non-Australian equivalents, and private providers. Framed by selected concepts from contemporary curriculum theorizing, the chapter draws on evidence presented in recent issues of VOCAL: The Australian Journal of Vocational Education and Training in Schools.

More broadly, this field makes a distinctive and important contribution to wider research endeavours related to teaching and learning. Separately, curriculum and <b>post-compulsory</b> vocational <b>education</b> and training are both contested and politicized fields of scholarship, policy, and practice. This chapter examines these two fields in combination, in order to identify the opportunities for creating productive and sustainable connections in teaching and learning that they exhibit, {{as well as some of}} the obstacles to such a creation. In doing so, we also consider what those opportunities and obstacles might prognosticate for enabling and empowering curriculum connections more widely. ...|$|R

40|$|Participation in <b>post-compulsory</b> {{computing}} <b>education</b> {{has declined}} over recent years, {{both in the}} senior years of secondary school and at university. This trend has been observed in most developed countries, despite reported and projected skills shortages in Information Technology (IT) industries. Within the computing education enrollment mix, girls and women continue to be under-represented and recent years have seen female participation fall even more rapidly than that of males. This article reports on findings of an Australian study which explored secondary school students’ beliefs about and attitudes towards computing education and careers in IT. Factors that might discourage girls in particular from pursuing <b>post-compulsory</b> computing <b>education</b> and careers are discussed, along with broader implications for school education {{in an era when}} information and communication technologies {{are an integral part of}} our daily lives. Findings include the persistence among both boys and girls of inaccurate and outdated views of the field of IT and low expectations of both school IT curricula and pedagogy in terms of their relevance and interest for students. Many of the issues identified as discouraging students in general from pursuing computing education appear to have a greater discouraging effect on girls, and this is compounded by stereotypical views of the field as male-dominated and unwelcoming to women and girls. <br /...|$|R

The aim of this research was to identify the relationship between digital leisure experiences and perceived family functioning in <b>post-compulsory</b> secondary <b>education</b> Spanish students. The sample was composed of 1, 764 Spanish young people 15 - 18 years old; all of them were <b>post-compulsory</b> secondary <b>education</b> students. Students’ digital leisure activities were measured by an opening question by which they indicated the three most important leisure activities for them, and family functioning was measured by the answers from the Spanish adaptation for FACES IV questionnaire (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale). A descriptive analysis about digital leisure activities of young people was used. The family functioning coefficient of each subject was determined and, finally, the relationship between students’ family functioning perceived and students’ digital leisure practices assessed by a factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). Young people give importance to digital leisure activities, highlighting social network participation, playing videogames and browsing the Internet. Cohesion, flexibility and family functioning are healthier when children don´t point to any digital activity into their preferred leisure practices. The results suggest that new research should be conducted to confirm whether this negative association between family functioning and digital leisure is causal or due to other factors...|$|R

40|$|In {{relation}} to the <b>post-compulsory</b> religious <b>education</b> program of a Catholic secondary college for boys, this research study set out to ascertain the role of art as a medium for the self-revelation of God in the linking of aesthetic and religious experience. In other words, this research study proposed to provide {{a group of students}} with a space and opportunity for a ‘calling to attend’ experience of God; that is, an experience that was compelling. The theoretical framework called on two types of concepts: first, those related to the theological investigation of revelation and its connection with the aesthetic and religious experience; and secondly, those developed from current educational research and research into Religious Education paradigms. The development of this research study therefore: established the context within which the study was situated; discussed a theological framework from Hans Urs von Balthasar and its links with this research study; examined the theory of Bernard Lonergan that art was a carrier of meaning for religious experience; discussed the role of revelation, aesthetic and religious experience and the religious imagination located within the ‘graced nature’ concept of Catholic theology; and sought to determine the contribution such a learning experience could make to the religious development of post-compulsory students in a boys’ senior secondary college. This study operated within a constructivist paradigm using case study and qualitative research methods. A focus group provided the research instrument for data gathering and included: participant observation; field notes; focus group discussions; and transcript analysis of the taped conversations of participants. The findings of this research study provided direction for further research and practice in <b>post-compulsory</b> religious <b>education</b> classroom program...|$|R
