30|$|Demand for {{investment}} includes gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and inventory changes. The former is always positive and endogenous in this PEP model, {{while the latter}} can be either positive or negative in the SAM and is usually treated as exogenous in CGE models. Total investment expenditure is characterized by savings-investment equilibrium, with savings endogenous. GFCF equals {{to the difference between}} total investment expenditure and the cost of inventory changes and is distributed in fixed shares among commodities, given by Cobb-Douglas production function. Therefore, the investment demand for each commodity is negatively associated with its <b>purchaser</b> <b>price.</b>|$|R

When a fixed asset or inventory is bought, it may be reasonably clear what its market value is, namely the <b>purchaser's</b> <b>price.</b> But as soon as it is bought, its value may change, and it may change even before it is put to use. Things often become more complicated to measure when a new fixed asset is acquired within some kind of lease agreement.

This research provides a joint exploration of foreign venture capitalists’ (VCs) participation in Canada and outcomes of VC exits. Using binary logistic regression and multivariate linear regression, this paper reports {{that the presence of}} foreign VCs in the Canadian market is accompanied with mixed exit-related outcomes. On the one hand, foreign VCs’ participation is associated with higher likelihood of a successful exit through initial public offering (IPO), greater capital availability, and shorter time to exit. On the other hand, the relation between foreign VCs’ participation and lower <b>purchaser</b> <b>price</b> per dollar of VC investment in exit through merger and acquisition (M&A) raises concerns about the monetary returns to Canadian investee firms and Canadian syndicate VCs.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{costs of}} trading different goods vary {{independently of the}} relative costs of producing them. The costs of trade are also often high. As a result, producer price elasticities of demand in economies that trade are usually much lower than <b>purchaser</b> <b>price</b> elasticities. Trade costs could thus explain why cross-country variation {{in the composition of}} output is much less sensitive to variation in relative production costs (or comparative advantage) than is predicted by standard open-economy models, in which demand elasticities are infinite. However, this sensitivity is greater in countries with lower trade costs – which are consequently ‘more open’.

40|$|We {{present a}} model for an energy market that {{includes}} a green certificate for suppliers of energy from renewables and a purchaser commitment to buy these certificates. We show that price and volume effects in the energy market are ambigous under {{a wide range of}} alternative levels of the purchaser commitment. We calibrate our model to data for the Norwegian economy. Simulations shows a downward movement in energy prices as the government starts increasing the level of the purchaser commitment. This implies that the producer of ordinary energy pays for the restriction in the market while energy consumption and consumer surplus increases. When the purchaser commitment increases above a certain level, the <b>purchaser</b> <b>price</b> increases and the volume effect is negative. Although the effects are sensitive to elasticities of demand and supply of both technologies, the main results are robust against a variety of combinations of elasticities. The article discusses effects both under autarky and free trade of both energy and green certificates. The results vary denpendent upon whether only one or a majority of actual countires introduces a domestic market or allows for international trade both in energy and the green certificate instrument.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the determinants of}} coupon values at the brand level {{within the context of}} a complex marketing program. A two-equation, fixed-effects, panel-data model accounts for the bidirectional causality between brand prices and discount levels. The empirical model is fitted with data on household purchases of ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and captures the industry's 1996 price cuts and discount reductions. Higher brand prices cause coupon values to rise, supporting the price discrimination hypothesis. Coupon values fall with in-store displays and more intense advertising but rise when couponed products are featured in store flyers. Discount levels are positively related to brand market share and the size of discounts redeemed for rival cereals. Coupon values fall with increasing brand loyalty among RTE cereal <b>purchasers.</b> Cereal <b>prices</b> are positively affected by coupon values, advertising expenditures, input costs, and the prices of competing brands. Inventory levels are negatively correlated with brand price. [EconLit citations: Q 130, D 120, L 130 ]. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 19 : 223 - 243, 2003. *...|$|R
