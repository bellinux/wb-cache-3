5|$|Ensuring a <b>plasmid</b> accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a <b>plasmid</b> containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into <b>plasmid</b> vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the <b>plasmid</b> but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that chromosomal copies of <b>plasmid</b> toxin-antitoxin systems may serve as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a <b>plasmid</b> from progeny without suffering {{the effects of the}} toxin. An example of this is an antitoxin on the Erwinia chrysanthemi genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F <b>plasmid</b> toxin counterpart.|$|E
5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial cell culture. In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted <b>plasmid</b> expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the <b>plasmid</b> insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the <b>plasmid</b> and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the <b>plasmid</b> thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E
50|$|High {{copy number}} <b>plasmids,</b> also called relaxed <b>plasmids,</b> require {{a system to}} ensure that {{replication}} is inhibited once the number of <b>plasmids</b> in the cell reaches a certain threshold. Low copy number <b>plasmids,</b> also called stringent <b>plasmids,</b> require tighter control of replication.Relaxed <b>plasmids</b> are generally regulated through one of two mechanisms: antisense RNA or iteron binding groups.|$|R
40|$|The {{incompatibility}} {{reactions of}} a group of 90 R <b>plasmids,</b> isolated from the fecal Escherichia coli of calves, pigs, and chickens, have been determined against reference <b>plasmids</b> of the incompatibility groups F 11, I, N, P, and W. Twenty <b>plasmids</b> belonged to incompatibility groups F 11, I, N, or P. Forty-nine <b>plasmids</b> were compatible with all of the five reference <b>plasmids.</b> Eight <b>plasmids</b> exhibited marked incompatibility with representatives of two or more of the above groups, whereas two strains showed incompatibility reactions consistent with the coexistence of two compatible <b>plasmids.</b> In addition, 19 <b>plasmids</b> remain untyped because they showed intermediate reactions with one or more reference <b>plasmids...</b>|$|R
40|$|Eleven pheromone-responding <b>plasmids</b> {{encoding}} erythromycin or gentamicin resistance {{were isolated}} from multiresistant clinical Enterococcus faecalis isolates. The <b>plasmids</b> were classified into six types {{with respect to}} their pheromone responses. The three erythromycin resistance <b>plasmids</b> responded to different pheromones. Of the eight gentamicin resistance <b>plasmids,</b> four <b>plasmids</b> responded to same pheromone. Southern hybridization studies showed that the genes involved in regulation of the pheromone response were conserved in the drug resistance <b>plasmids...</b>|$|R
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by <b>plasmid</b> genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the <b>plasmid</b> DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative <b>plasmid</b> integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti <b>plasmid</b> by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti <b>plasmid</b> could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti <b>plasmid</b> {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the <b>plasmid</b> survive after cell division. If the <b>plasmid</b> is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} <b>plasmids</b> of isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila and A. salmonicida from Japan, France, the UK and Ireland {{have been}} characterized. Three classes of <b>plasmids</b> transmissible to Escherichia coli were found: <b>plasmids</b> of incompatibility group C, <b>plasmids</b> of incompatibility group U, and <b>plasmids</b> incapable of stable inheritance in E. coli, not belonging to any defined incompatibility group...|$|R
40|$|Esamining 12 <b>plasmids</b> in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, {{we found}} {{two types of}} {{interaction}} in their transfer (inhibition and facilitation), using donor cells carrying two compatible <b>plasmids.</b> (i) Ten <b>plasmids</b> representing incompatibility groups P- 1, P- 2, P- 5, P- 6, and P- 7 were all transmissible at a high frequency, 10 - 2 to 10 - 1, except for one with a lower frequency of about 10 - 3. The transfer of P- 5 <b>plasmids</b> was inhibited by P- 2 <b>plasmids</b> reciprocally or unilaterally, and the unilateral transfer inhibition was observed in other combinations between <b>plasmids</b> belonging to groups P- 1, P- 2, P- 6, and P- 7. It was characteristic of Pseudomonas <b>plasmids</b> that most <b>plasmids</b> with high transferability inhibited the transfer of other coexisting <b>plasmids</b> without distinct inhibition of their own transfer. (ii) Two <b>plasmids,</b> Rms 149 of P- 8 group and Rlb 679, which was not classified, were transmissible at an exceptionally low frequency of 10 - 7 to 10 - 6, but their transfer was facilitated by <b>plasmids</b> with high transferability...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{ability of}} Staphylococcus aureus conjugative <b>plasmids</b> to {{mobilise}} non-conjugative resistance <b>plasmids</b> from clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis was studied. <b>Plasmids</b> {{which could not}} be transferred by transduction or mixed-culture transfer were transferred from phage-typable and non-typable S. aureus and from S. epidermidis. <b>Plasmids</b> encoding single resistance determinants were transferred by mobilisation whereas multiple-resistance <b>plasmids</b> were transferred as co-integrates between the conjugative and non-conjugative <b>plasmids.</b> This study demonstrates that mobilisation is a useful tool for the transfer and study of staphylococcal <b>plasmids</b> and illustrates how antibiotic resistance could be transferred between staphylococci in uiuo...|$|R
5|$|Another example {{application}} involves {{both the}} CcdB toxin and CcdA antitoxin. CcdB {{is found in}} recombinant bacterial genomes and an inactivated version of CcdA is inserted into a linearised <b>plasmid</b> vector. A short extra sequence {{is added to the}} gene of interest that activates the antitoxin when the insertion occurs. This method ensures orientation-specific gene insertion.|$|E
25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, <b>plasmid</b> origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the <b>plasmid</b> curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the <b>plasmid.</b> This allows for easy <b>plasmid</b> curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX <b>plasmid,</b> another pKDsg-XXX <b>plasmid</b> with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 <b>plasmid</b> lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a <b>plasmid</b> curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 <b>plasmid.</b> Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 <b>plasmid.</b> After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing chloramphenicol indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 <b>plasmid</b> due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the <b>plasmid.</b> Additional <b>plasmid</b> mini-preps demonstrated that neither <b>plasmid</b> was retained in the cells, therefore indicating <b>plasmid</b> curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2008, Yamanaka et al. {{found that}} they could {{transfer}} the four necessary genes with a <b>plasmid.</b> The Yamanaka group successfully reprogrammed mouse cells by transfection with two <b>plasmid</b> constructs carrying the reprogramming factors; the first <b>plasmid</b> expressed c-Myc, while the second expressed the other three factors (Oct4, Klf4, and Sox2).|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Yeast" [...] {{means an}} {{artificial}} group or assemblage of uni/few cellular organisms under Domain Eukaryote and kingdom Fungi. So, unlike bacteria; yeasts are eukaryotic. Yeast are organisms that naturally harbour <b>plasmids.</b> Notable <b>plasmids</b> are 2 µm <b>plasmids</b> - small circular <b>plasmids</b> {{often used for}} genetic engineering of yeast, and linear pGKL <b>plasmids</b> from Kluyveromyces lactis, {{that are responsible for}} killer phenotypes.|$|R
5000|$|GoldenBraid overcomes {{the problem}} of {{designing}} numerous destination vectors by having a double loop, which is the [...] "braid," [...] to allow binary assembly of multiple constructs. There are two levels of destination <b>plasmids,</b> level α and level Ω. Each level of <b>plasmids</b> {{can be used as}} entry <b>plasmids</b> for the other level of <b>plasmids</b> for multiple times because both levels of <b>plasmids</b> have different type IIS restriction sites that are in inverted orientation. For counterselection, the two levels of <b>plasmids</b> differ in their antibiotic resistance markers.|$|R
25|$|Challenges {{underlying}} <b>plasmid</b> recombination {{and loss}} of protospacer sequences also impact the no-SCAR method and require further improvements. Poor <b>plasmid</b> recombination underlies frequency of escape difficulties that may impact the efficiency of genetic manipulation.|$|E
25|$|To be virulent, the {{bacterium}} must contain a tumour-inducing <b>plasmid</b> (Ti <b>plasmid</b> or pTi), of 200 kb, which contains the T-DNA {{and all the}} genes necessary to transfer it to the plant cell. Many strains of A. tumefaciens do not contain a pTi.|$|E
25|$|A <b>plasmid</b> {{composed}} of the H19 gene regulatory sequences that drive {{the expression of the}} 'A' strand of Diphtheria Toxin (DT-A), is undergoing clinical testing as a treatment for superficial bladder cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. The <b>plasmid,</b> designated BC-819 (or DTA-H19), embodies a targeted therapy approach, in that the <b>plasmid</b> enters all dividing cells, but the DT-A expression is triggered by the presence of H19 transcription factors found only in tumor cells, thus destroying the tumor without affecting normal cells.|$|E
40|$|Conjugative <b>plasmids</b> are key {{agents of}} {{horizontal}} gene transfer (HGT) that accelerate bacterial adaptation by vectoring ecologically important traits between strains and species. However, although many conjugative <b>plasmids</b> carry beneficial traits, all <b>plasmids</b> exert physiological costs-of-carriage on bacteria. The existence of conjugative <b>plasmids,</b> therefore, presents a paradox because non-beneficial <b>plasmids</b> should {{be lost to}} purifying selection, whereas beneficial genes carried on <b>plasmids</b> should {{be integrated into the}} bacterial chromosome. Several ecological solutions to the paradox have been proposed, but none account for co-adaptation of bacteria and conjugative <b>plasmids.</b> Drawing upon evidence from experimental evolution, we argue that HGT via conjugation can only be fully understood in a coevolutionary framework...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extensive}} DNA homology among IncHI 1 <b>plasmids,</b> ApaI and XbaI restriction digests of <b>plasmids</b> from Peruvian Salmonella typhi varied considerably from other IncHI 1 <b>plasmids</b> isolated previously.

50|$|<b>Plasmids</b> {{can also}} be {{classified}} into incompatibility groups. A microbe can harbour different types of <b>plasmids,</b> however, different <b>plasmids</b> can only exist in a single bacterial cell if they are compatible. If two <b>plasmids</b> are not compatible, {{one or the other}} will be rapidly lost from the cell. Different <b>plasmids</b> may therefore be assigned to different incompatibility groups depending on whether they can coexist together. Incompatible <b>plasmids</b> (belonging to the same incompatibility group) normally share the same replication or partition mechanisms and can thus not be kept together in a single cell.|$|R
25|$|A. tumefaciens infects {{the plant}} through its Ti <b>plasmid.</b> The Ti <b>plasmid</b> {{integrates}} {{a segment of}} its DNA, known as T-DNA, into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells. A. tumefaciens has flagella that allow it to swim through the soil towards photoassimilates that accumulate in the rhizosphere around roots. Some strains may chemotactically move towards chemical exudates from plants, such as acetosyringone and sugars. The former is recognised by the VirA protein, a transmembrane protein encoded in the virA gene on the Ti <b>plasmid.</b> Sugars are recognised by the chvE protein, a chromosomal gene-encoded protein located in the periplasmic space.|$|E
25|$|By {{releasing}} intact {{host and}} <b>plasmid</b> DNA, certain bacteriophages {{are thought to}} contribute to transformation.|$|E
25|$|Exposing intact yeast {{cells to}} alkali cations {{such as those}} of cesium or lithium allows the cells to take up <b>plasmid</b> DNA. Later {{protocols}} adapted this transformation method, using lithium acetate, polyethylene glycol, and single-stranded DNA. In these protocols, the single-stranded DNA preferentially binds to the yeast cell wall, preventing <b>plasmid</b> DNA from doing so and leaving it available for transformation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Plasmids</b> {{belonging}} to Escherichia coli incompatibility group Q {{are relatively small}} (approximately 5 to 15 kb) and able to replicate in a remarkably broad range of bacterial hosts. These include gram-positive bacteria such as Brevibacterium and Mycobacterium and gram-negative bacteria such as Agrobacterium, Desulfovibrio, and cyanobacteria. These <b>plasmids</b> are mobilized by several self-transmissible <b>plasmids</b> into an even more diverse range of organisms including yeasts, plants, and animal cells. IncQ <b>plasmids</b> are thus highly promiscuous. Recently, several IncQ-like <b>plasmids</b> have been isolated from bacteria found in environments as diverse as piggery manure and highly acidic commercial mineral biooxidation plants. These IncQ-like <b>plasmids</b> belong to different incompatibility groups but have similar broad-host-range replicons and mobilization properties to the IncQ <b>plasmids.</b> This review covers the ecology, classification, and evolution of IncQ and IncQ-like <b>plasmids...</b>|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{nature of}} {{penicillin}} (Pc) and tetracycline (Tc) resistance <b>plasmids</b> in Staphylococcus epidermidis were studied and {{compared with those}} in S. aureus.

One of these <b>plasmids</b> also encoded for cadmium resistance and another encoded for resistance to ethidium bromide, traits also associated with S. aureus Pc <b>plasmids.</b> Endonuclease fingerprinting of the Pc <b>plasmids</b> from the two species revealed extensive heterogeneity. Two S. epidermidis strains were also transduced for tetracycline resistance.

25|$|The no-SCAR {{technique}} uses a two-plasmid system; this {{is because}} co-transformation of both cas9 containing <b>plasmid</b> and the sgRNA <b>plasmid</b> results in cell death.

In order to circumvent this issue, multiple plasmids are used in order to maintain expressional control of both cas9 and sgRNA.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 <b>plasmid</b> was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 <b>plasmid</b> contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX <b>plasmid</b> containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX <b>plasmid</b> was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E

In general, ΔpAMβ 1 was transferred more efficiently than the pGKV <b>plasmids.</b> Using electroporation, {{we were able to}} demonstrate that failure of efficient transfer for the pGKV <b>plasmids</b> was, except for one case, caused by incompatibility of these <b>plasmids</b> with resident <b>plasmids</b> of the recipient strain...|$|R
40|$|Campylobacter spp. {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} bacterial pathogens in retail meat, particularly poultry, and is a leading cause of diarrhea in humans.

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of <b>plasmids,</b> particularly large ones, in Campylobacter spp. isolated from various Oklahoma retail meats, and to explore PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis) as a tool in facilitating the detection of these <b>plasmids.</b> One hundred and eighty nine strains (94 Campylobacter jejuni and 95 Campylobacter coli) were screened for the presence of <b>plasmids</b> using both alkaline lysis and PFGE. <b>Plasmids</b> were detected in 119 / 189 (63 %) using both methods. Most of the <b>plasmids</b> detected by alkaline lysis were smaller than 90 kb and only three were larger than 90 kb. <b>Plasmids</b> over 70 kb in size were detected in 33 more strains by PFGE of which 11 strains contained larger than 90 kb <b>plasmids.</b> <b>Plasmids</b> were more prevalent in Campylobacter coli (73. 5 %) than in Campylobacter jejuni (52 %).
