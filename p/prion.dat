5|$|All known <b>prion</b> diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist <b>prion</b> infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for <b>prion</b> production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring <b>prion</b> protein are resistant to infection by scrapie <b>prion</b> protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious <b>prion</b> protein that causes vCJD.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by <b>prion</b> diseases, as the <b>prion</b> protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a <b>prion</b> disease to transmit from one species to another. The human <b>prion</b> disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a <b>prion</b> that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of a prion-like domain arises {{from the study of}} fungal prions. In yeast, prionogenic proteins have a portable <b>prion</b> domain that is both necessary and sufficient for self-templating and protein aggregation. This has been shown by attaching the <b>prion</b> domain to a reporter protein, which then aggregates like a known <b>prion.</b> Similarly, removing the <b>prion</b> domain from a fungal <b>prion</b> protein inhibits prionogenesis. This modular view of <b>prion</b> behaviour has led to the hypothesis that similar <b>prion</b> domains are present in animal proteins, in addition to PrP. These fungal <b>prion</b> domains have several characteristic sequence features. They are typically enriched in asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine and glycine residues, with an asparagine bias being particularly conducive to the aggregative property of prions. Historically, prionogenesis has been seen as independent of sequence and only dependent on relative residue content. However, this {{has been shown to be}} false, with the spacing of prolines and charged residues having been shown to be critical in amyloid formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prions</b> (PrPSc) {{are shed}} from {{sheep and goats}} in birth fluids, feces and other excrement. The {{concentration}} of the <b>prions</b> is uncertain, but is not directly proportional to infectivity. Sheep ingest {{a considerable amount of}} soil, so soil represents a plausible environmental reservoir of scrapie <b>prions,</b> which can persist in the environment for years. Longevity of the <b>prions</b> and the attachment of soil particles likely influences the persistence and infectivity of <b>prions</b> in the environment.|$|R

5|$|A <b>prion</b> like protein, called MAVS, {{has been}} shown to misfold as part of the innate immune {{response}} against pathogenic viruses, similarly the cellular <b>prion,</b> PrPC {{has been shown}} to have anti HIV properties, and it is hypothesized that the misfolding of the <b>prion</b> in TSEs may be an antiviral response against an unknown virus.|$|E
5|$|Antiprion {{antibodies}} {{capable of}} crossing the blood-brain-barrier and targeting cytosolic <b>prion</b> protein (an otherwise major obstacle in <b>prion</b> therapeutics) have been described.|$|E

40|$|<b>Prions</b> defy {{molecular}} biology’s central dogma. Misfolded {{proteins that}} self-perpetuate, <b>prions</b> were first {{isolated in the}} early 1980 s {{as the cause of}} a fatal sheep disease called scrapie. Since then, <b>prions</b> have been implicated in human neurodegenerative diseases, composing a rogue’s gallery of deadly disease agents. Susan Lindquist, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, has found that <b>prions</b> may have a little-appreciated positive side. Lindquist casts these seeming biochemical misfits in a surprising evolutionary role: Her studies have revealed that <b>prions</b> might help cells adapt to a host of environmental pressures. Lindquist explains this still-contentious idea to PNAS readers...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of biotechnology {{increases the risk}} of using biochemical weapons for mass destruction. <b>Prions</b> are unprecedented infectious pathogens that cause a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases by a novel mechanism. They are transmissible particles that are devoid of nucleic acid. Due to their singular characteristics, <b>Prions</b> emerge as potential danger since they can be used in the development of such weapons. <b>Prions</b> cause fatal infectious diseases, and to date there is no therapeutic or prophylactic approach against these diseases. Furthermore, <b>Prions</b> are resistant to food-preparation treatments such as high heat and can find their way from the digestive system into the nervous system; recombinant <b>Prions</b> are infectious either bound to soil particles or in aerosols. Therefore, lethal <b>Prions</b> can be developed by malicious researchers who could use it to attack political enemies since such weapons cause diseases that could be above suspicion.

5|$|Many viruses, {{including}} HIV {{which needs}} CD4 and CXCR4, need a receptor to attach to and enter into host cells. The host <b>prion,</b> PrPc {{may be a}} receptor protein for an as yet undiscovered TSE virus, explaining why animals lacking host <b>prion</b> do not become infected with experimental <b>prion</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prion</b> {{aggregates}} {{are extremely}} stable and accumulate in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death. This structural stability means that prions {{are resistant to}} denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult. <b>Prion</b> structure varies slightly between species, but nonetheless <b>prion</b> replication is subject to epimutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication.|$|E
5|$|Research into fungal prions {{has given}} strong {{support to the}} protein-only concept, since {{purified}} protein extracted from cells with a <b>prion</b> state has been demonstrated to convert the normal form of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the <b>prion</b> state. It has also {{shed some light on}} <b>prion</b> domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a <b>prion.</b> Fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic <b>prion</b> domains may vary between species—e.g., characteristic fungal <b>prion</b> domains are not found in mammalian prions.|$|E

40|$|Chronic wasting disease (CWD) of {{deer and}} elk {{is a highly}} {{communicable}} neurodegenerative disorder caused by <b>prions.</b> Investigations of CWD are hampered by slow bioassays in transgenic (Tg) mice. Towards the development of Tg mice that will be more susceptible to CWD <b>prions,</b> we created a series of chimeric elk/mouse transgenes that encode the N terminus of elk PrP (ElkPrP) up to residue Y 168 and the C terminus of mouse PrP (MoPrP) beyond residue 169 (mouse numbering), designated Elk 3 M(SNIVVK). Between codons 169 and 219, six residues distinguish ElkPrP from MoPrP: N 169 S, T 173 N, V 183 I, I 202 V, I 214 V and R 219 K. Using chimeric elk/mouse PrP constructs, we generated 12 Tg mouse lines and determined incubation times after intracerebral inoculation with the mouse-passaged RML scrapie or Elk 1 P CWD <b>prions.</b> Unexpectedly, one Tg mouse line expressing Elk 3 M(SNIVVK) exhibited incubation times of, 70 days when inoculated with RML prions; a second line had incubation times of, 90 days. In contrast, mice expressing full-length ElkPrP had incubation periods of. 250 days for RML <b>prions.</b> Tg(Elk 3 M,SNIVVK) mice were less susceptible to CWD <b>prions</b> than Tg(ElkPrP) mice. Changing three C-terminal mouse residues (202, 214 and 219) to those of elk doubled the incubation time for mouse RML <b>prions</b> and rendered the mice resistant to Elk 1 P CWD <b>prions.</b> Mutating an additional two residues from mouse to elk at codons 169 and 173 increased the incubation times for mouse <b>prions</b> to. 300 days, but made the mice susceptible to CWD <b>prions.</b> Our findings highlight the role of C-terminal residues in PrP that control the susceptibility and replication of <b>prions.</b> © 2013 SGM...|$|R
40|$|The Chatham petrel (Pterodroma axillaris Salvin) is an {{endangered}} species endemic to the Chatham Islands. It is currently restricted to a population of less than 1000 individuals on South East Island. The key threat to breeding success is interference to chicks by broad-billed <b>prions</b> (Pachyptila vittata Forster), when they prospect for burrows for their oncoming breeding season. Management involves patrols around known Chatham petrel burrows and culling broad-billed <b>prions</b> found in the burrows. While relatively successful, these patrols disturb Chatham petrels, are labour and resource intensive, give only short term (hourly) protection and involves killing a native, protected species. This study investigated alternative methods of protecting the known population of Chatham petrel chicks. Three options were investigated: the possibility of exploitation of different habitat preferences whether microhabitat features around a Chatham petrel burrow attracted broad-billed <b>prions,</b> {{and the effectiveness of}} a burrow entrance flap that allows Chatham petrels to enter their own burrow but discourages broad-billed <b>prions</b> from entering. Alteration to breeding habitat has contributed to burrow competition. Habitat characteristics for both Chatham petrels and broad-billed <b>prions</b> were quantified and selection ratios compared. Both Chatham petrels and broad-billed <b>prions</b> selected characteristics indicative of mature forest. Chatham petrels are habitat specific and preferred habitat is now limited. Broad-billed <b>prions</b> are generalists and are not limited by habitat availability. All breeding Chatham petrel burrows have been replaced with artificial burrow chambers and tunnels that assist monitoring and reduce burrow collapse. This study investigated whether artificial boxes, logs and tracks attracted broad-billed <b>prions</b> to Chatham petrel burrows, increasing interference to chicks. Prospecting broad-billed <b>prions</b> were not attracted to Chatham petrel burrows. The presence of logs or tracks did not directly increase chick interference levels, but logs increased the number of broad-billed <b>prions</b> near a burrow. The burrow entrance flap exploited behavioural differences between the two species. Chatham petrels had a high incentive to push through a flap due to their investment in their burrow and chick, while prospecting broad-billed <b>prions</b> were influenced by the ease in entering potential burrows. This trial found 90 % of Chatham petrels entered their burrows through the artificial flap. Flaps acted as barriers to most broad-billed <b>prions,</b> with only 22 % entering the burrow through the flap compared to the control burrows. This study has provided several alternative methods for alleviating the effects of burrow competition between broad-billed <b>prions</b> and Chatham petrels. Habitat preferences should be used to guide searches for unknown Chatham petrel burrows and when establishing a second colony of Chatham petrels. Reducing the presence of logs decreases the number of broad-billed <b>prions</b> around Chatham petrel burrows. While not proven in this study this may potentially decrease interference. Artificial burrow entrance flaps have the potential to provide a low cost, low labour strategy for protecting Chatham petrel chicks...|$|R
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} <b>prion</b> diseases {{were considered to}} be caused by the <b>prion</b> protein, PrP; in 2015 Multiple System Atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new <b>prion,</b> the misfolded form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the <b>prion</b> protein is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for Scrapie), after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the <b>prion</b> is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E

5|$|Familial <b>prion</b> disease {{occurs in}} {{families}} with a mutation in the PrP gene, and mice with PrP mutations develop <b>prion</b> disease despite controlled conditions where transmission is prevented.

50|$|The {{origin and}} mode of {{transmission}} of the <b>prions</b> causing CWD is unknown, but recent research indicates that <b>prions</b> can be excreted by deer and elk, and are transmitted by eating grass growing in contaminated soil. Animals born in captivity and those born in the wild have been affected with the disease. Based on epidemiology, transmission of CWD {{is thought to be}} lateral (from animal to animal). Maternal transmission may occur, although it appears to be relatively unimportant in maintaining epidemics. An infected deer's saliva is able to spread the CWD <b>prions.</b> Exposure between animals is associated with sharing food and water sources contaminated with CWD <b>prions</b> shed by diseased deer.|$|R
5000|$|The 1997 prize {{was awarded}} to Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner for his {{discovery}} of <b>prions.</b> This award caused a long stream of polemics.

5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other <b>prion</b> proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the <b>prion</b> protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{proteins}} {{of particular}} amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein {{with the same}} amino acid sequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the <b>prion</b> folding it changes function. In turn it can convey information into new cells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the alternate <b>prion</b> form. In some types of <b>prion</b> in fungi this change is continuous and direct; the information flow is Protein→Protein.|$|E
50|$|Transmissible spongiform {{encephalopathy}} diseases {{are caused by}} <b>prions.</b> <b>Prions</b> are proteins that occur normally in neurons of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS).

5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication.

In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective <b>prion</b> decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease.
