5000|$|The {{pressure}} is actually {{created by the}} resistance to {{the flow of the}} oil around the engine. [...] So, the pressure of the oil may vary during operation, with temperature, engine speed, and wear on the engine. Colder oil temperature can cause higher pressure, as the oil is thicker, while higher engine speeds cause the pump to run faster and push more oil through the engine. Because of variances in temperature and normal higher engine speed upon cold engine start up, it’s normal to see higher oil pressure upon engine start up than at normal operating temperatures, where normal oil pressure usually falls between 30 and 45 psi. [...] Too much oil pressure can create unnecessary work for the engine and even add air into the system. To ensure that the oil pressure does not exceed the rated maximum, once pressure exceeds a <b>preset</b> <b>limit</b> a spring-loaded pressure relief valve dumps excess pressure either to the suction side of the pump, or directly back to the oil pan or tank.|$|E

SROSS C and C2 carried a gamma-ray burst (GRB) experiment and a Retarded Potential Analyzer (RPA) experiment. The GRB experiment operated from 25 May 1992 until reentry on 14 July 1992. The instrument consisted of a main and a redundant CsI(Na) scintillator operating in the energy range 20-3000 keV. The crystals were 76 mm (main) and 37 mm (redundant) in diameter. Each had a thickness of 12.5 mm. A 'burst mode' was triggered by the 100-1024 keV count rate exceeding a <b>preset</b> <b>limit</b> during a 256 or 1024 ms time integration. In this mode, 65 s of temporal and 2 s of spectral data prior to the trigger are stored, {{as well as the}} subsequent 16 s of spectral data and 204 s of temporal data. The low resolution data consists of 2 energy channels (20-100 keV and 100- 1024 keV) from 65 s before the trigger to 204 s after the trigger in 256 ms integrations. The 20-1024 keV rates are also recorded with a 2 ms resolution for 1 s prior to 1 s after trigger and a 16 ms resolution for 1s prior to 8 s after the trigger. Energy spectra are conducted with a 124 channel PHA. Four pre-trigger spectra and 32 post-trigger spectra are recorded for every burst with a 512 ms integration time.

40|$|Abstract − Assessment {{of power}} {{transformer}} condition {{is very important}} for utilities, to ensure continuous power transmission and power supply. Therefore, different techniques are used for condition assessment, as off-line diagnostics and on-line monitoring. The off-line diagnostics has some time period between consecutive diagnoses, and during that period the condition is unknown. Diagnostic tools in monitoring system usually comprise comparison of values of monitored quantities to <b>preset</b> <b>limits,</b> and alarming if these limits are exceeded. In this way weak diagnostic capabilities are achieved. Therefore, a new diagnosis model for assessment of condition of oil immersed power transformers was developed. This model is aimed to continuously and automatically diagnose transformer condition. The diagnosis principle is interpretation of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data using several standardized interpretation methods. Then, on the basis of obtained diagnoses an overall diagnosis is inferred using VAC, VEV or VSC inference methods in a similar way as it is done by the human diagnostician. The diagnostic model shows excellent application flexibility, high robustness and significant diagnostic accuracy...|$|R

40|$|CLIP is an {{implementation}} of CLP(Intervals) built {{on top of}} Prolog. It has been developed using the simplest model of constraint solving in which constraints are decomposed into sets of primitive constraints and a simple constraint queue is used to repeatedly apply primitive constraint contractions until some termination condition applies (e. g. no significant change occurs, or a <b>preset</b> <b>limit</b> {{on the number of}} contractions is reached). The simple semantics and implementation make it relatively straightforward to prove that the system is sound. In this paper we show how to implement more complex constraint solvers in CLIP. In particular, we demonstrate that several of the box-narrowing algorithms from the Newton and Numerica systems can be easily implemented in CLIP. The principal advantages of this approach are (1) the resulting solvers are relatively easy to prove correct, (2) new solvers can be rapidly prototyped since the code is more concise and declarative than for imperative languag [...] ...|$|E

The color-scale bar on the right in Inset (A) yields the number of spikes within a burst. The diagram for the duty-cycle evolution is shown in Inset (B). By combining these diagrams, we can partition the parameter plane into regions {{of different kinds of}} behaviors and classify the regimes: tonic-spiking (single spike), square-wave and plateau-like bursting, quiescence, and chaotic behaviors with the variability of spikes exceeding some <b>preset</b> <b>limit.</b> It is easy to see that both diagrams give consistent results. They reveal with clarity the region of tonic-spiking where both DC and SN take minimum values, below which there is the bursting region at the right bottom corner of the diagram. Bursting emerges from tonic spiking through the spike-addition cascade in two different ways: one is regular and reversible; the corresponding transitions are foliated by the bifurcation curves. The second kind of transitions is due to the clove-shaped regions (shown in red in Figure 4) corresponding to well-developed chaotic dynamics in the model.|$|E
