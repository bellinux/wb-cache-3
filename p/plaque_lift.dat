40|$|For the {{identification}} of RNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTVd), we subjected a tomato cDNA expression library prepared from viroid-infected leaves to an RNA ligand screening procedure. We repeatedly identified cDNA clones that expressed a protein of 602 amino acids. The protein contains a bromodomain and was termed viroid RNA-binding protein 1 (VIRP 1). The specificity of interaction of VIRP 1 with viroid RNA was studied by different methodologies, which included Northwestern blotting, <b>plaque</b> <b>lift,</b> and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. VIRP 1 interacted strongly and specifically with monomeric and oligomeric PSTVd positive-strand RNA transcripts. Other RNAs, for example, U 1 RNA, did not bind to VIRP 1. Further, we could immunoprecipitate complexes from infected tomato leaves that contained VIRP 1 and viroid RNA in vivo. Analysis of the protein sequence revealed that VIRP 1 is a member of a newly identified family of transcriptional regulators associated with chromatin remodeling. VIRP 1 is the first member of this family of proteins, for which a specific RNA-binding activity is shown. A possible role of VIRP 1 in viroid replication and in RNA mediated chromatin remodeling is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway {{infections are}} {{a major cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. Treatment of established infections is difficult, even with microbiologically active agents. Thus, prevention of infection is an important goal of management. Isolates from cystic fibrosis patients appear to originate from the environment but adapt to the milieu of the airway of the cystic fibrosis patient and evolve toward a common phenotype. Identification of the antigens expressed early in infection may lead to novel targets for vaccine development. Immunogenic peptides were identified in a J 404 random nonapeptide phage display library with serum from cystic fibrosis patients obtained within the first year of P. aeruginosa infection. One hundred sixty-five reactive clones were verified by <b>plaque</b> <b>lift</b> assays, and their inserts were sequenced. The sequenced nonapeptides were compared with the published sequence of strain PAO 1, identifying homologies to 76 genes encoding outer membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of these were proteins involved in small-molecule transport, membrane structural proteins, and secreted factors. An in silico analysis was performed that suggested that the occurrence of multiple matches to predominantly outer membrane and secreted proteins was not attributable to random chance. Finally, gene expression array data from early isolates of P. aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis patients was compared with the results from phage display analysis. Eleven outer membrane and secreted proteins were common between the two data sets. These included genes involved in iron acquisition, antibiotic efflux, fimbrial biogenesis, and pyocin synthesis. These results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of this novel approach and suggest potential targets for future development...|$|E
40|$|Resistance {{proteins}} {{are part}} of the plant’s immune system and mediate a defence response upon recognizing their cognate pathogens. They are thought to be present in the cell {{as part of a larger}} protein complex. The modular architecture of R proteins suggests that they form a scaffold for various interacting proteins, involved in pathogen recognition, downstream signalling or protein stabilization. However, few common interactors have been found for the CC-NB-ARC domains despite extensive screenings for downstream interactors. The objective of thesis was to get new insights in the structure, function and localization of R proteins by using the potato resistance genes Rx 1 and Gpa 2 as a model system. Initially, a novel T 7 phage display method was developed to facilitate high throughput selection of interacting molecules (Chapter 2). However, the use of a T 7 cDNA phage library to identify interactors of the CC-NB-ARC domains of Rx 1 resulted in the discovery of a large set of highly basic peptides (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4, the functional role of the CC-NB-ARC domain in mediating disease resistance was explored by creating chimeric proteins between Rx 1 and Gpa 2. This resulted in the observation that the CC-NB-ARC is able to confer both virus and nematode resistance in potato. Furthermore, it was shown that the CC-NB-ARC of Rx 1 and the LRR of Gpa 2 are incompatible and vice versa. This phenomenon was studied in more detail in Chapter 5, in which a docking model for the interacting surface of these domains was constructed based on the individual structural domains. Finally, the subcellular localisation was investigated to get a better understanding about the R proteins function in the cell (Chapter 6). The lytic T 7 phages form a powerful platform for the display of large cDNA libraries and offer the possibility to screen for strong interactions with a variety of substrates. To visualise these interactions directly by fluorescence microscopy, we constructed fluorescent T 7 phages by exploiting the flexibility of phages to incorporate modified versions of its capsid protein (Chapter 2). By applying translational frameshift sequences, helper plasmids were constructed that expressed a fixed ratio of both wild-type capsid protein (gp 10) and capsid protein fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). The frameshift sequences were inserted between the 3 ’-end of the capsid gene and the sequence encoding EYFP. Fluorescent fusion proteins are only formed when the ribosome makes a - 1 shift in reading frame during translation. As far as we know this is the first report of using a translational frameshift for a biotechnological purpose. The phages formed in this way have capsids composed of three different variants of their capsid protein; EYFP-fused versions derived by frameshift translation, non-fused versions derived by regular translation from the helper plasmid, and versions that display peptides encoded in the library ligated in the phage genome. Using standard fluorescence microscopy, we could sensitively monitor the enrichment of specific binders in a cDNA library displayed on fluorescent T 7 phages. Closely monitoring the effect of the selection procedure enables fine tuning, and obviates the need for more laborious ELISA or <b>plaque</b> <b>lift</b> assays. Furthermore, with the fast pace of developments in single molecule detection technologies and sorting systems, these fluorescent phages open the way to high throughput platforms for the direct selection of binding molecules. In Chapter 3, cDNA phage display was applied as an alternative method to identify additional downstream Rx 1 interactors, which could further resolve the Rx 1 signalling pathway. In a pilot experiment the value of T 7 phage display to identify specific interactors was demonstrated by using an antibody raised against the PVY coat protein. Screening of a PVY-infected N. benthamiana cDNA phage display library resulted in the selection of peptides harbouring the known PRIKAI epitope. Next, phage display was explored as technique to discover proteins interacting with the potato R protein Rx 1. The system turned out to be prone to pick up interactors binding to matrices like Ni-NTA or to fusion proteins like thioredoxine. A possible way to circumvent this weakness was to design the selection procedure in such a way that it alternates between different matrices and to limit the number of selection round. This adapted approach resulted in the identification of a series of highly basic protein fragments and random peptides, for which a specific interaction could be shown. Two cDNA sequences encoded the ribosomal proteins L 19 and L 36 a, which showed a stunted growth phenotype upon gene silencing in N. benthamiana using VIGS and a slightly reduced Rx-mediated HR. The nematode resistance protein Gpa 2 and the virus resistance protein Rx 1 provide an excellent test system to investigate the exchangeability of recognition and signalling domains and explore the evolutionary flexibility of R proteins, for they confer resistance to completely unrelated pathogens (Globodera pallida and potato virus X, respectively). In Chapter 4, we provide evidence for the hypothesis, that, via intergenic sequence exchanges and various types of mutations, NB-LRR proteins have the potential to alter resistance specificities towards taxonomically unrelated pathogens in relatively short evolutionary time periods. Both the regulatory sequences and CC-NB domains of the paralogs Gpa 2 and Rx 1 are non-pathogen specific and exchangeable. Remarkably, the genetic fusions of the CC-NB of Rx 1 with the LRR of Gpa 2 (Rx 1 CN/Gpa 2 L) and the reciprocal domain swap (Gpa 2 CN/Rx 1 L) were not functional when driven by the endogenous promoters or 35 S promoter. Gain of wild type resistance was obtained by re-introducing the first five LRRs of Rx 1 in Rx 1 CN/Gpa 2, restoring the compatibility between the N-terminal part of the LRR and the ARC 2 domain. Decreasing the expression levels for Gpa 2 CN/Rx 1 L resulted in extreme resistance against PVX, indistinguishable from wild type plants. Our results indicate that not only coding sequences, but that also optimizing the expression levels may play a role in generating novel resistances. The CC, NB-ARC, and LRR domains of the Rx 1 and Gpa 2 proteins interact with each other and recognition of the elicitor mediated by the LRR is translated in an activation of the NB-ARC. The available functional and evolutionary data make Gpa 2 a suitable candidate for structural modelling of the individual domains and their interaction (Chapter 5). A structural model of the NB-ARC / LRR interaction could function as a framework for the interpretation of known empirical data and the design of new experiments to test R protein operational mechanisms (Zhang 2009). Therefore, computer aided modelling of the 3 D structure domain models for the NB-ARC and the LRR domains were obtained and used as basis for a domain docking study. The functional interaction between the domains was studied via a detailed analysis of their incompatibility in chimeric Gpa 2 and Rx 1 proteins. A large set of sequence exchanges between the two proteins was created for that purpose. Both in the LRR and in the ARC 2 domain small regions could be identified in which the amino acids differing between Gpa 2 and Rx 1 led to domain incompatibility. Five of the ARC 2 positions required for LRR compatibility and three known autoactivating positions from the RX 1 LRR were used as constraints in domain docking computation to limit the potential search space. The resulting docking model indicated an important role in the NB-ARC-LRR interaction for electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. A loop region rich in acidic residues in the ARC 2 domain was found close in space to a patch of basic residues grouped together in the LRR. Hydrophobic residues on both the NB and the ARC 2 contacted hydrophobic residues on the surface of the LRR. A correlation analysis of the NB-ARC and LRR subdomains detected coevolution between the interacting surfaces, which supports a direct interaction between these two domains. Site-directed mutagenesis and pull-down experiments were used to test the role of surface features that might play an important role in the interdomain docking interface. In Chapter 6, we have made use of the characteristic of the Rx 1 protein that it remains functional when its domains are co-expressed as separate polypeptides. This allowed us to create fluorescent constructs, not only of the full length protein, but also of the separate subdomains. Most of these tagged constructs still form functional proteins. C- and N-terminal fusions of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) variants to Rx, made it possible to study its subcellular localization in Nicotiana benthamiana cells. Contrary to our expectations we observed the presence of Rx 1 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Rx 1 does not contain known nuclear localization signals and the size of the protein (140 kDa including GFP) exceeds the limit for passive diffusion through the nuclear pore. Fluorescent fusions of a series of deletion constructs, CC-NB-ARC, NB-ARC, NB-ARC-LRR, CC and LRR showed three distinct patterns of subcellular localization. The NB-ARC-LRR and LRR constructs have a cytoplasmic localization and are mostly absent in the nucleus. The NB-ARC and CC-NB-ARC constructs showed equal fluorescence intensities in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The CC alone fused to GFP, however, seems to preferentially accumulate in the nucleus resulting in a three to four times higher fluorescence intensity in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm. The diffusion behaviour inside the nucleus for both the complete CC and a CC fragment containing the two predicted helices downstream of the central turn, showed that their nuclear accumulation coincides with a significantly reduced nuclear diffusion as compared to unfused GFP and the other CC fragments. This difference might point to a potential interaction between the CC and an unknown nuclear component. Furthermore, SGT 1 and Rar 1 are thought to function as chaperones involved in stabilizing R proteins. Both the silencing experiments with these two proteins and the P-loop mutation show that the nuclear localisation of Rx 1 is probably conformation dependent. Two approaches were followed to see if CP recognition or Rx 1 signalling pathway were linked to a certain cellular compartment. At one hand the Rx 1 protein itself or its subdomains were directed to either the nucleus or the cytoplasm by fusion to exogenous targeting signals (Nuclear Export Signals or Nuclear Localization Signals). On the other hand the elicitor, the PVX coat protein, was directed to the nucleus or cytoplasm. The PVX coat protein is a much smaller protein and can under normal circumstances diffuse freely between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The surprising result was that no effect was found for retargeting Rx 1, but when the elicitor was targeted to the nucleus, it could not activate Rx 1 anymore, indicating that recognition might to take place in the cytoplasm. In the final chapter, the results obtained in this thesis are put into perspective by studying parallels in scientific literature on NB-LRR proteins with similar functions in other organisms...|$|E

40|$|A PCR based {{strategy}} {{was developed to}} screen a Xenopus oocyte λgt 10 cDNA library. The PCR-based lift pool (LP) method follows the same two tiered strategy as conventional screening of phage libraries by filter hybridization. Two rounds of plating, one at high density to detect the clone, and one at low density to purify the clone to homogeneity, are performed. In the first round, lysates from high density plates, termed plate pools (PP), serve as template for PCR. In the second round, phage particles adhering to <b>plaque</b> <b>lifts</b> of low density plates are washed off nitrocellulose filters to create LPs, which are used as template for PCR. The integrity of the plaques on the low-density plates is preserved. Once a positive LP has been identified, plaques on the corresponding plate are screened individually by PCR. Using isoform specific primer pairs for Xenopus myosin 7 a and myosin 1 d, two lambda clones were isolated. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis confirmed their identities as myosin isoforms (GenBank accession numbers: DQ 100353 and AF 540952). This method offers a time saving, cost-effective alternative to other hierarchical pooling strategies for the repeated screening by PCR of an arrayed lambda phage library...|$|R
40|$|Idiotype (Id) 16 / 6 marks a {{variable}} (V) region structure that occurs {{frequently in the}} human immunoglobulin repertoire. The basis of the Id has been traced to a germline heavy chain gene segment, VH 18 / 2 (VH 26). To pursue the molecular basis for the frequency of Id 16 / 6, we have analyzed polymerase chain reaction-generated C mu, C gamma, and VH 3 family V gene libraries derived from the circulating and tonsillar B cells of four normal individuals and from the B cells of two patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The frequency of VH 18 / 2 in these libraries was compared with three control VH genes, VH 56 P 1, VH 21 / 28, and VHA 57. <b>Plaque</b> <b>lifts</b> from C mu and C gamma VH cDNA libraries were screened with gene-specific oligonucleotide probes. The frequency of VH 18 / 2 ranged from 4 to 10 % of JH+ plaques (two of five times that of control VH genes). In four VH 3 family-specific libraries derived from rearranged DNA, VH 18 / 2 represented 19 - 33 % of VH 3 + plaques. Hybridizing VH 18 / 2 plaques were 98 - 100 % homologous to the germline VH gene; mutations when present were often in framework 3. Extensive variation {{was seen in the}} complementarity determining region 3 sequences of these rearranged V genes. The high frequency of VH 18 / 2 expression in the B cell repertoire was confirmed by sequencing randomly picked JH+ plaques. In two patients with active SLE the frequency of use of VH 18 / 2 was not greater than that observed in normal subjects. These results show that VH 18 / 2 is overrepresented in the B cell repertoire of normal subjects and suggest that the immune repertoire may be dominated by relatively few V genes...|$|R
