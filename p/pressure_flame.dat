40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this note to present an {{evaluation}} of the experimental evidence for and against "anomalous" temperatures of OH in flames. Experimental studies have been carried out on low <b>pressure</b> <b>flames,</b> and on flames burning at atmospheric pressure. The results have usually been interpreted by using relations which are applicable only to isothermal systems. Attempts to correct for self-absorption have been made by using isointensity methods. For spectral lines with Doppler contour it has been demonstrated by quantitative calculations that the isointensity methods do not correct for self-absorption unless self-absorption is weak. In particular, Shuler's method, without allowance for the effect of frequency on intensity, has been shown to yield nonlinear plots for strong self-absorption and to be inferior to conventional procedures in the absence of self-absorption. Extensive studies on the effect of self-absorption in falsifying experimental data have been carried out by Cowan and Dieke.

40|$|Planar laser induced {{fluorescence}} (PLIF) {{images of}} OH as temperature indicator and kerosene (Jet A 1) {{were used to}} characterized the flame structure of a new lean pre-mixed prevaporized (LPP) injector at realistic test conditions. The measurements {{were part of a}} test series in the Single-Sector combustor (SSC) at pressures of 3 bar, 6 bar, and 12 bar. Flames with equivalence ratios Œ¶ referring to the nozzle between 0. 5 (lean blow-out) and 0. 7 were studied. While the kerosene LIF provided qualitative images of the fuel distribution, absolute OH concentrations were determined by calibrating the OH LIF by simultaneous measurements of the laser absorption. Assuming equilibrium conditions in these lean high <b>pressure</b> <b>flames</b> temperature distributions were deduced from the OH concentration. The high temperature sensitivity of this method enables the statistical evaluation of the temperature images on the single-pulse basis. The measurement of OH LIF in technical kerosene/air flames leads generally to the problem of interference with kerosene LIF and to the problem of laser absorption due to the OH radical itself. To reduce the influence of the kerosene interference the exciting laser had to be tuned to a rotational line of OH at 283 nm with a high transi-tion moment, which increased the laser absorption problem. To overcome the difficul-ties the kerosene LIF (340 - 380 nm) and the LIF of OH and kerosene at 305 - 325 nm were detected simultaneously by 2 cameras. A third camera measured the intensity distributions of laser light sheet in front of and beyond the combustor to determine the laser absorption. For these experimental conditions of lean high <b>pressure</b> <b>flames</b> this experimental set-up and a fast correction algorithm for laser absorption provides not only reconstruction of the OH distribution, but also the calibration of the OH LIF to the well known absorption line strength of the OH transition.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of laser saturated fluorescence (LSF) for OH concentration measurements in high <b>pressure</b> <b>flames</b> was studied theoretically and experimentally. Using a numerical model describing {{the interaction of}} hydroxyl with nonuniform laser excitation, the effect {{of pressure on the}} validity of the balanced cross-rate model was studied along with the sensitivity of the depopulation of the laser-coupled levels to the ratio of rate coefficients describing: (1) electronic quenching to (sup 2) Sigma (+) (v double prime greater than 0), and (2) vibrational relaxation from v double prime greater than 0 to v double prime = 0. At sufficiently high pressures and near-saturated conditions, the total population of the laser-coupled levels reaches an asymptotic value, which is insensitive to the degree of saturation. When the ratio of electronic quenching to vibrational relaxation is small and the rate of coefficients for rotational transfer in the ground and excited electronic states are nearly the same, the balanced cross-rate model remains a good approximation for all pressures. When the above ratio is large, depopulation of the laser-coupled levels becomes significant at high pressures, and thus the balanced cross-rate model no longer holds. Under these conditions, however, knowledge of the depletion of the laser-coupled levels can be used to correct the model. A combustion facility for operation up to 20 atm was developed to allow LSF measurements of OH in high <b>pressure</b> <b>flames.</b> Using this facility, partial saturation in laminar high pressure (less than or equal to 12. 3 atm) C 2 H 6 /O 2 /N 2 flames was achieved. To evaluate the limits of the balanced cross-rate model, absorption and calibrated LSF measurements at 3. 1 and 6. 1 atm were compared. The fluorescence voltages were calibrated with absorption measurements in an atmospheric flame and corrected for their finite sensitivity to quenching with: (1) estimated quenching rate coefficients, and (2) an in situ measurement from a technique employing two fluorescence detection geometries...|$|R

The use of chemiluminescent emissions has been used in the past in an effort to characterise the flame reaction zone and the corresponding heat release, however most efforts have been with low <b>pressure</b> or atmospheric <b>flames.</b> Chemiluminescent measurements have been used {{in the case of the}} Continuously Variable Resonant Combustor (CVRC) in an attempt to validate a CFD simulation of the same system, although the CVRC operates at a higher pressure.

To bridge the gap between the experimental and numerical data a spectroscopic model was created to study the validity of chemiluminescent based measurements in the CVRC. It was found that the CVRC combustion medium is optically opaque for the chemiluminescent emissions produced by OH* and optically transparent for the chemiluminescent emissions produced by CH*. Unfortunately, the emissions produced by CH* are largely influenced by the emissions produced by CO 2 *. As such, both OH* and CH* are poor indicators of the heat release in the CVRC and therefore chemiluminescence measurements are not useful in validating the CVRC CFD simulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Concerns about {{damaging}} the Earth's ozone layer {{as a result}} of high levels of nitrogen oxides (known collectively as NOx) from high-altitude, high-speed aircraft have prompted the study of lean premixed prevaporized (LPP) combustion in aircraft engines. LPP combustion reduces NOx emissions principally by reducing the peak flame temperatures inside an engine. Recent advances in LPP technologies have realized exceptional reductions in pollutant emissions (single-digit ppm NOx for example). However, LPP combustion also presents major challenges: combustion instability and dynamic coupling effects between fluctuations in heat-release rate, dynamic pressure, and fuel pressure.
