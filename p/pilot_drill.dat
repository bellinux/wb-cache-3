40|$|Drilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{machining}} processes in the aerospace industries. However, maintaining delamination free and high productivity in the machining of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) can be a challenge due to the excessive thrust force or the relative low feedrate. The paper presents an improved method for machining the 2 -mm thickness CFRP plate with three proposed patterns of pilot holes in high-speed <b>drilling.</b> <b>Pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> pattern (a), well adopted in the past, can reduce the thrust force dramatically, but it significantly increases both dynamic loading and drilling torque and causes excessive tool wear that occurred on the periphery of the drill tool. The paper also provides a FEA simulation, which is used to solve the Johnson-Cook constitutive material model and related damage modelling, and to further explain the excessive drill tool deflection induced by the <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> pattern (a) in comparison with none <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling.</b> The paper then describes another two patterns, <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> pattern (b) and pattern (c), that have provided advantages of reducing both the thrust force and drilling torque significantly and conducive to achieve delamination free drilling performance, as well as extending tool...|$|R
40|$|POSTER ABSTRACTMicrodamage reduces bone {{mechanical}} properties and thus could possi-bly contribute to implant failure. The {{objective of this}} study was to investi-gate whether the diameter of mini-implants (MI) affects microdamage gen-eration and whether this differs between the mandible and maxilla due to their contrasting cortical thicknesses. Methods: Maxillary and mandibular quadrants of 5 dogs were randomly assigned to receive, in situ, no interven-tion (control), <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> only, or <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> plus one of three diameters of MI: 1. 4 (n= 18), 1. 6 (n= 18), and 2. 0 mm (n= 18). Microdamage was as-sessed on basic fuchsin stained sections using epifluorescence microscopy. Results: No microdamage was found in the non-drilling controls. Pilot drill-ing produced only minimal microdamage in the maxilla but more microdamage in the mandible. There was significantly higher microdamage generated in the mandible, compared to the maxilla (p< 0. 05). In the maxil-la, although insertion of all implants produced higher microdamage than the control and <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling,</b> there were no differences between the 3 MI diame-ters. In the mandible, insertion of implants generated significantly higher microdamage than the control, but it did not produce higher microdamage than <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling.</b> Similarly, no differences in microdamage were found be-tween 3 MI diameters. Conclusion: Insertion of MIs in the mandible pro-duced higher microdamage than in the maxilla, which may explain that the higher MI failure rate in the mandible. Implant diameter did not affect over-all microdamage burden in either jaw. Microdamage was mostly generated by <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> through the cortex in the mandible, while microdamage in the maxilla was mainly produced when manual inserting MIs after pilot drill-ing...|$|R

5000|$|A {{hole saw}} (also styled holesaw), {{also known as}} a hole cutter, is a saw blade of [...] (ring) shape, whose annular [...] creates a hole in the {{workpiece}} without having to cut up the core material.

40|$|Objective:  To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} mini-screw implant (MSI) diameter (1. 6 vs 2. 0 mm) and shape (tapered vs cylindrical) {{and the amount of}} microdamage generated during insertion. Materials and Methods:  Thirty-six cylindrical and 36 tapered MSIs, 6 mm long, were used in this study. Half of each shape was 1. 6 mm in diameter, while the other half was 2. 0 mm. After <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling,</b> four and five MSIs were inserted, respectively, into fresh cadaveric maxillae and mandibles of dogs. Bone blocks containing the MSIs were sectioned and ground parallel to the MSI axis. Epifluorescent microscopy was used to measure overall cortical thickness, crack length, and crack number adjacent to the MSI. Crack density and total microdamage burden per surface length were calculated. Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the effects of jaw, and MSI shape and diameter. Pairwise comparisons were made to control the overall significance level at 5 %. Results:  The larger (2. 0 vs 1. 6 mm) cylindrical MSIs increased the numbers, lengths, and densities of microcracks, and the total microdamage burden. The same diameter cylindrical and tapered MSIs generated a similar number of cracks and crack lengths. More total microdamage burden was created by the 2. 0 -mm cylindrical than the 2. 0 -mm tapered MSIs. Although higher crack densities were produced by the insertion of 1. 6 -mm tapered MSIs, {{there was no difference in}} total microdamage burden induced by 1. 6 -mm tapered and 1. 6 -mm cylindrical MSIs. Conclusions:  <b>Pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> is effective in reducing microdamage during insertion of tapered MSIs.

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and prospectively evaluate a technique enabling simultaneous performance of a mandibulotomy and insertion of endosseous implants in the same area. Methods. In five edentulous patients such a procedure was performed. The <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> of the implants was done before performing the mandibulotomy. After tumor resection, reconstruction, and restoration of the continuity of the mandible, the final drilling and insertion of the implants were completed. In total, 20 implants were inserted. All patients received radiation therapy within 6 weeks after surgery. Implant-supported overdentures were fabricated 6 months after irradiation. At regular time intervals, a standardized clinical and radiographic evaluation was performed. Results. No complications with respect to the combination of implant insertion and mandibulotomy were observed either during or after surgery. In addition, no adverse mucosal reactions were observed during the course of radiotherapy, no cases of osteoradionecrosis developed, and no implants were lost.

The postoperative recovery, dry matter intake (DMI) and average {{daily weight gain}} (ADG) was evaluated in 36 Nellore steers, nine of which were randomly selected {{for the control group}} and 27 others were rib biopsied. Every 30 days, rib biopsy was performed in nine steers, using a corded-electric pistol-grip drill coupled with a hole saw of a 3 mm diameter <b>pilot</b> <b>drill</b> bit.

Methods: Seven consecutive patients were analyzed retrospectively, the 3 D accuracy of placement of the fibula grafts and dental implants was compared to the virtual plan. Results: Six out of seven flaps survived for an average follow-up time of 9. 4 months. The outcome was compared to the virtual plan, superimposed on the mandible. For the fibula segments, the mean deviation (SD) was 3. 0 (1. 8) min and the mean angulation (SD) was 4. 2 degrees (3. 2 degrees). For the implants, the mean deviation (SD) was 3. 3 (13) mm and the mean angulation (SD) was 13. 0 degrees (6. 7 degrees). The mean (SD) mandibular resection plane deviation was 1. 8 (0. 9) mm. Conclusions: A patient-specific reconstruction plate is a valuable tool in the reconstruction of mandibular defects with fibula grafts and dental implants. Implant angulation showed a greater deviation from the virtual plans in patients with a sharp ventral fibula rim, where the guide is removed after <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> of the implants.

This material is very challenging to machine and current drilling methods are based on non-conventional machining technologies; the traditional view is that microdrills are too fragile to be used for drilling this high-strength aerospace alloy. The work investigated mechanical microdrilling under various cutting condi-tions. Mechanical microdrilling may offer the chance of improved hole quality and surface integrity. Initially a review of literature was undertaken with a view to identify the best drill geometry for the production of micro holes in nickel-based alloys. Based on this review the best available commercial micro drills were selected. A special strategy was introduced for selecting the <b>pilot</b> <b>drill</b> in order to ensure gradual loading of the twist drill and reduce the chance of drill breakage. For the cutting tests, 0. 5 mm diameter twist drills were used in drilling tests to a depth of 5 mm. The effect of processing parameters such as drill feed rate, spindle speed, and peck depth were evaluated, and the tool wear mechanism was also investigated. The cutting performance was characterized by the number of holes produced before drill breakage. The results show that deep-hole mechanical microdrilling of nickel-based superalloys is technically feasible and offers good hole definition and potentially competitive lead times...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this pilot study is to set a mini-invasive {{surgical}} protocol for the rehabilitation of edentulous posterior maxilla, consisting of the positioning of short or standard implants in combination with sinus lifting, with the adjunct of coral-derived hydroxyapatite (Duravit Crestal Sinus Lift & Novocore Plus by B&B Dental Implant Company S. r. l.,Bologna, Italy). Method: 12 patients with residual bone height < 4 mm were included in this pilot study. After the elevation of a full-thickness flap, the cortical bone has been perfored with a <b>pilot</b> <b>drill.</b> The guide path has expanded with a compactor-expander 2 mm wide, then 3 mm wide and then, depending from the bone thickness, 4 mm wide compactor was used. All these compactor were used 1 mm inside the sinus. Coral-derived hydroxyapatite was placed by injector into the surgical cavity and the pushed into the sinus to elevate the membrane. Finally the implant was placed. All implant site were underprepared to achieve implant primary stability. After implant placement, the flap was repositioned and sutured with 4. 0 non-adsorbable sutures. All patients received a standard post-surgical and maintenance protocol. Periapical radiographs were taken immediately after implant placement, at the prosthetic phase, and at each follow-up visit. Patients were left healing for 4 months before prosthetic phase. 12 implants have been inserted. All implants supports a screw-retained single-crown prosthesis. Result: All 12 implant placed achieved osseintegretion. Overall implant success and survival rates were 100 % and average marginal bone loss was 0. 60 ± 0. 2 mm at 1 year follow-up visit.

40|$|Self-advancing tool bits {{that are}} hybrids of drills and stepped taps make it {{possible}} to form threaded holes wider than about 1 / 2 in. (about 13 mm) without applying any more axial force than is necessary for forming narrower pilot holes. These self-advancing stepped-tap drills were invented for use by space-suited astronauts performing repairs on reinforced carbon/carbon space-shuttle leading edges during space walks, in which the ability to apply axial drilling forces is severely limited. Self-advancing stepped-tap drills could also be used on Earth for making wide holes without applying large axial forces. A self-advancing stepped-tap drill (see figure) includes several sections having progressively larger diameters, typically in increments between 0. 030 and 0. 060 in. (between about 0. 8 and about 1. 5 mm). The tip section, which is the narrowest, is a <b>pilot</b> <b>drill</b> bit that typically has a diameter between 1 / 8 and 3 / 16 in. (between about 3. 2 and about 4. 8 mm). The length of the pilot-drill section is chosen, according to the thickness of the object to be drilled and tapped, so that the pilot hole is completed before engagement of the first tap section. Provided that the cutting-edge geometry of the drill bit is optimized for the material to be drilled, only a relatively small axial force [typically of the order of a few pounds (of the order of 10 newtons) ] must be applied during drilling of the pilot hole. Once the first tap section engages the pilot hole, it is no longer necessary for the drill operator to apply axial force: the thread engagement between the tap and the workpiece provides the axial force to advance the tool bit. Like the pilot-drill section, each tap section must be long enough to complete its hole before engagement of the next, slightly wider tap section. The precise values of the increments in diameter, the thread pitch, the rake angle of the tap cutting edge, and other geometric parameters of the tap sections must be chosen, in consideration of the workpiece material and thickness, to prevent stripping of threads during the drilling/tapping operation. A stop-lip or shoulder at the shank end of the widest tap section prevents further passage of the tool bit through the hole...|$|E
40|$|The Directional Drilling {{technique}} is now widely used internationally {{to install and}} replace underground conduits. Drilling mud is used during both the <b>pilot</b> <b>drilling</b> and pullback processes as a multifunctional medium. Mud loss and other damage can occur due to hydrofracture or blowout {{in the vicinity of}} the borehole as a result of high mud pressure. Current design methods, either simple rules of thumb or the Delft equation, are used to estimate maximum drilling mud pressure associated with shear failure, and these implicitly or explicitly assume that the initial ground stress condition is isotropic (i. e. K 0 = 1). A new approach to estimate the limiting mud pressure is introduced in this paper which considers the effect of different initial geostatic stress conditions (K 0 ≠ 1). The limiting drilling mud pressure has been studied based on different ratios of shear strength to effective vertical stress (Cu/P’ 0) and different initial geostatic stress conditions (K 0), and the results are compared with current industry methods. The studies indicated that soil type and initial ground stress condition control the mode of mud loss. Blowout is the dominant failure mechanism in normally consolidated (NC) and lightly overconsolidated (LOC) clay. Hydrofracture will be expected in heavily overconsolidated (HOC) clays where the coefficient of lateral earth pressure exceeds 1. 8.

50|$|The {{now defunct}} National Geothermal Program (a Canadian {{government}} research program {{that ended in}} 1986) demonstrated that Canada has a geological environment favourable to geothermal development (Jessop, 2008a, 2008b)(Chapter 3). This program defined high temperature resources suitable for geothermal exploration and development, particularly in British Columbia, Yukon and the Northwest Territories. Medium and low temperature geothermal resources were also defined within sedimentary basins and abandoned mines throughout Canada. <b>Pilot</b> projects <b>drilled</b> at Meager Creek, British Columbia and Regina, Saskatchewan further proved that geothermal power production in Canada is feasible. Now 25 years since the program ended advancements in technologies have further increased the economic potential of these geothermal resources.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes wood {{splitting}} is undesirable. Methods to prevent splitting in woodworking are the butterfly joint, truss connector plates, or metal straps. Columns may be hollowed {{in the center}} to prevent splitting. Nail points may be blunted or <b>pilot</b> holes <b>drilled</b> to prevent splitting of lumber while nailing or screwing. End grain sealers are liquid products usually containing wax which helps prevent rapid drying of the ends of lumber resulting in splits. Metal end plates or S-shaped pieces of metal may be driven into the butt ends of a timber. Splitting is the primary reason building codes do not allow notching {{in the bottom of}} joists and beams.|$|R
