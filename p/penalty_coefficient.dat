40|$|A {{simplified}} ration optimization {{method was}} applied to a beef cattle fattening system to evaluate the utilization of food by-products under various situations. The method was extended to reduce feed costs (i. e., economic factors) and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions (i. e., environmental factors) by introducing <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficients</b> of nitrogen and phosphorus contents in each ingredient of the diet in the objective function in traditional linear programming. Six regional food by-products, five commercial concentrates and two roughages were used as ingredients of the fermented total mixed ration. Constraints for the feed formulation were based mainly on nutrient requirements in the Japanese Feeding Standard for Beef Cattle. The replacement price (or acquisition cost) of food by-products {{was defined as the}} maximum price of food by-products when the feed cost with the use of food by-products was below the cost with the use of conventional concentrates. The results showed that although the replacement prices were not greatly affected by the penalty levels, they were associated with the changes in the substitution rate of food by-products for concentrates and the price of concentrates. The replacement prices were about 16 (yen/kg, as-fed basis) against the present price level of concentrates, when food by-products were substituted for a half of concentrates. Feed compositions were altered and nitrogen and phosphorus excretions were decreased by the changes of penalties, in spite of the small change in the replacement price of food by-products. Both nitrogen and phosphorus penalties greatly reduced the nitrogen and phosphorus excretions, indicating that nitrogen and phosphorus <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficients</b> should be introduced together in the objective function in order to reduce both excretions efficiently...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{energy management}} strategies {{for a new}} hybrid pneumatic engine concept which is specific by its configuration {{in that it is}} not the vehicle but only the engine itself which is hybridized. Different energy management strategies are proposed in this paper. The first is called Causal Strategy (CS) and implements a rule-based control technique. The second strategy, called Constant <b>Penalty</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (CPC), is based on the minimization of equivalent consumption, where the use of each energy source is formulated in a comparative unit. The balance between the consumption of different energy sources (chemical or pneumatic) is achieved by the introduction of an equivalence factor. The third strategy is called Variable <b>Penalty</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (VPC). In fact, it is beneficial to consider the equivalence coefficient as variable within the amount of pneumatic energy stored in the air-tank i. e. state of charge, because the choice of propulsion mode should be different if the tank is full or empty. In this case, the <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficient</b> appears as a non linear function of the air-tank state of charge. Another way to adapt the <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficient</b> is to recognize a reference pattern during the driving cycle. The coefficient value can then be changed according to an optimized value found for each of the reference cycles. This strategy is called Driving Pattern Recognition (DPR). It involves a technique of sliding window pattern recognition. The concept is to convert the whole driving cycle into smaller pieces to which the equivalence factor can be appropriately adapted. This strategy is based on the assumption that the current driving situation does not change rapidly and thus the pattern is likely to continue into the near future. The identification window size is a parameter which has to be adjusted to attain the maximum of identification success over the reference cycle. We propose to define reference patterns as statistical models. The pattern recognition method is based on a correlation function. To improve analysis, all the results obtained with different energy management strategies are compared with a Dynamic Programming approach (DP) considered as the optimal solution. Results show that about 40 % of fuel saving can be achieved by DP. The VPC and DPR strategies give better results than the CPC strategy, not so far from the results obtained with DP...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This article {{presents}} an investigation which studied how training of sigma-pi networks with the associative reward-penalty (A R-p) regime may {{be enhanced by}} using two networks in parallel. The technique uses what has been termed an unsupervised &quot;'adaptive critic element &quot; (ACE) to give critical advice to the supervised sigma-pi network. We utilise the conventions that the sigma-pi neuron model uses (i. e., quantisation of variables) to obtain an implementation we term the &quot;'quantised adaptive critic&quot;, which is hardware realisable. The associative reward-penalty training regime either rewards, r = 1, the neural network by incrementing the weights of the net by a delta term times a learning rate, ~, or penalises, r = O, the neural network by decrementing the weights by an inverse delta term times {{the product of the}} learning rate and a <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficient,</b> ~ × Arp. Our initial research, utilising a &quot;'bounded &quot; reward signal, r * E { 0, [...] ., 1 }, found that the critic provides advisory information to the sigma [...] pi net which augments its training efficiency. This led us to develop an extension to the adaptive critic and associative reward-penalty methodologies, utilising an &quot;unbounded &quot; reward signal, r * E {- 1, [...] ., 2 }, which permits penalisation of a net even when the <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Arp, is set to zero, A,p = O. One should note that with the standard associative reward-penalty methodology the net is normally only penalised if the <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficient</b> is non-zero (i. e., 0 < Arp ~< 1). One of the enigmas of associative reward-penalty (AR-I,) training is that it broadcasts sparse information, {{in the form of an}} instantaneous binary reward signal, that is only dependent on the present output error...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that large neural networks with many unshared weights {{can be very}} difficult to train. A neu-ral network ensemble consisting of a number of indi-vidual neural networks usually performs better than a complex monolithic neural network. One of the moti-vations behind neural network ensembles is the divide-and-conquer strategy, where a complex problem is de-composed in 60 different components each of which is tackled by an individual neural network. A promis-ing algorithm for training neural network ensembles is the negative correlation learning algorithm which pe-nalizes positive correlations among individual networks by introducing a penalty term in the error function. A <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficient</b> is used to balance the minimization of the error and the minimization of the correlation. It is often very difficult to select an optimal penalty co-efficient for a given problem because as yet there is no systematic method available for setting the parameter.

40|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} (EAs) {{were shown}} to be effective for complex constrained optimization problems. However, inflexible exploration-exploitation and improper penalty in EAs with penalty function would lead to losing the global optimum nearby or on the constrained boundary. To determine an appropriate <b>penalty</b> <b>coefficient</b> is also difficult in most studies. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional dynamic diversity evolutionary algorithm (Bi-DDEA) with multiagents guiding exploration-exploitation through local extrema to the global optimum in suitable steps.
