40|$|In this thesis, {{results of}} the {{investigation}} of a new low-dimensional cobaltates Ba 2 -xSrxCoO 4 are presented. The synthesis of both polycrystalline and single crystalline compounds using the methods of conventional solid state chemical reaction and floating-zone optical furnace is first introduced. Besides making polycrystalline powders, we successfully, for the first time, synthesized large single crystals of Ba 2 CoO 4. Single crystals were also obtained for Sr doped Ba 2 -xSrxCoO 4. Powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction results indicate that pure Ba 2 CoO 4 has a monoclinic structure at room temperature. With Sr doping, the lattice structure changes to orthorhombic when x ≥ 0. 5 and to tetragonal when x = 2. 0. In addition, Ba 2 CoO 4 and Sr 2 CoO 4, have completely different basic building blocks in the structure. One is CoO 4 tetrahedron and the later is CoO 6 octahedron, respectively. ^ Electronic and magnetic properties were characterized and discussed. The magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity show that Ba 2 CoO 4 has an antiferromagnetic (AF) ground state with an AF ordering temperature TN = 25 K. However, the magnitude of the Néel temperature TN is significantly lower than the Curie-Weiss temperature (: 2 ̆ 6 thetas;: ∼ 110 K), suggesting either reduced-dimensional magnetic interactions and/or the existence of magnetic frustration. The AF interaction persists in all the samples with different doping concentrations. The Néel temperature doesn 2 ̆ 7 t vary much in the monoclinic structure regime but decreases when the system enters orthorhombic. ^ Magnetically, Ba 2 CoO 4 has an AF insulating ground state while Sr 2 CoO 4 has a ferromagnetic (FM) metallic ground state. Neutron <b>powder</b> <b>refinement</b> results indicate a magnetic structure with the spin mostly aligned along the a-axis. The result from a μ-spin rotation/relaxation (μ+SR) experiment agrees with our refinement. It confirms the AF order in the ab -plane. We also studied the spin dynamics and its anisotropy in the AF phase. The results from inelastic neutron scattering show that spin waves have a clear dispersion along a-axis but not along c-axis, indicating spin anisotropy. ^ This work finds the strong spin-lattice coupling in this novel complex material. The interplay between the two degrees of freedom results an interesting phase diagram. Further research is needed when large single crystal samples are available. ...|$|E

Lattice parameters and unit cell volume are found to increase with increasing the average A-site ionic radius 〈rA〉. The substitution of calcium by monovalent element (Na) in La 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3 drives the system from a charge ordering state to a ferromagnetic behaviors observed near room temperature for all our substituted compounds with a Curie temperature TC slightly decreasing from 297  K for x= 0. 05 to 278  K for x= 0. 2. Magnetic entropy change |ΔSM|, deduced from magnetization measurements versus magnetic applied field at several temperatures, shifts to higher values with increasing Na content and reaches 1. 14  J/kg K and 3. 1  J/kg K for La 0. 5 Ca 0. 3 Na 0. 2 MnO 3 under magnetic applied field of 2  T and 7  T respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of several lithium transition metal oxide systems has been undertaken {{with the aim}} of synthesising an optimised LiM 0 ₂ compound (M = Mn, Co or Co/Ni mixtures) for application as a cathode in rechargeab 1 e lithium batteries. Attention has been focused on systems which show promise for application as cathodes in rocking-chair cells which do not contain metallic lithium anodes. A novel lithium cobalt oxide, LT-LiCoO₂ (LT for low temperature), has been synthesised at 400 °C. This compound has near-cubic symmetry and can be indexed to either a trigonal unit cell (space group R 3 m) with a= 2. 830 (1) Å and c=l 3. 875 (8) Å, or to a face-centred cubic unit cell (space group Fd 3 m) with a= 8. 002 (1) A. The near-cubic symmetry is maintained on delithiation. Neutron and X-ray <b>powder</b> diffraction <b>refinement</b> of the LT-LiCoO₂ sample has shown it to be best described as a layered structure (R 3 m symmetry) with approximately 6 % of the cobalt cations in the predominantly lithium layer and vice versa. An acid-leached sample LT-Liₒ₄. 4 CoO₂ was, however, shown to have a defect spinel structure...|$|R
40|$|IBM 360 {{computer}} {{program has been}} written which generates multiplicity data for the crystal forms in any space group. The input data consist of the unit cell dimensions, lattice centring indicator, system type, equivalent positions of the space group, {{and the range of}} h, k, l and 20. The program calculates structure factors for all reflexions over the powder pattern, and sorts hem into forms using the IBM OS SORT/MERGE program. The form indices {hkl} are taken as those of the last member of the form generated, and the multiplicity m{hkl} as the number of reflexions encountered through the form. The {hkl}, m{hkl} data serve as input for the Rietveld <b>powder</b> profile <b>refinement</b> program for the refining of structural parameters with powder data. Previously, these had to be deduced from the International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography Volume 1, which is difficult to use with the higher symmetry systems, As the {hkl} and multiplicity generation is {{a major part of the}} effort needed to set up the Rietveld program, the present program reduces significantly the work involved in these refinements. The program gives [{hkl}, m{hkl}] cards in about 30 - 50 seconds of CPU time...|$|R
40|$|New skutterudite {{compounds}} CaxCo 4 Sb 12 (0 <x≤ 0. 2) {{have been}} prepared by traditional metallurgical synthesis. The compounds have been characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and neutron <b>powder</b> diffraction. Rietveld <b>refinement</b> of the structures against neutron powder diffraction data (on Ca 0. 1 Co 4 Sb 12, Im 3 ̄, a= 9. 0429 Å, χ 2 = 1. 55; wRp= 1. 52) enabled the location of Ca in the voids of the skutterudite structure to be verified. The large displacement ellipsoid for Ca is consistent with "rattling" in the cage of the crystalline structure. XRD combined with EPMA analyses showed that the maximum occupancy of Ca atoms is about 0. 2. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|CoSeO$_ 4 $ has a {{structure}} consisting of edge-sharing chains of Co$^{ 2 +}$ octahedra which are {{held together by}} SeO$_ 4 ^{ 2 -}$ tetrahedra via shared oxygen atoms {{at the edges of}} the octahedra. DC magnetization measurements indicate a transition to an ordered state below 30 K. <b>Powder</b> neutron diffraction <b>refinements</b> suggest an ordered state with two unique antiferrromagnetic chains within the unit cell. Isothermal magnetization measurements indicate a temperature-dependent field-induced magnetic transition below the ordering temperature. From neutron diffraction, we find this corresponds to a realignment of spins from the canted configuration towards the c-axis. The dielectric constant shows a change in slope at the magnetic ordering temperature as well as a quadratic dependence on the external magnetic field. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
