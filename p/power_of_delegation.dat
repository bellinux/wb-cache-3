2500|$|The medical {{establishment}} controlling the London teaching hospitals, including the Royal College of Surgeons, {{was restricted to}} Anglicans and dominated by the aristocracy who saw perfect animal design as proof of a natural theology supporting their ideas of God-given rank and privilege. Since the 1820s large numbers of private medical schools joined by the new London University had introduced the [...] "philosophical anatomy" [...] of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire based on unity of plan compatible with the transmutation of species, implying ideas of progressive improvement and supporting radical demands for democracy. This anatomy had already spread from Paris to the medical schools of Edinburgh, and the new London schools attracted Scots, including Grant. Numerous journals now promoted these radical ideas, including Thomas Wakley's The Lancet (started in 1823 with support from William Cobbett and William Lawrence, whose 1819 publication of evolutionary ideas the Crown had prosecuted for blasphemy). In response, the {{medical establishment}} gave support to the idealist biology of Joseph Henry Green (1791–1863) and of his younger protégé Richard Owen (1804–1892), based on the vitalism of German Naturphilosophie and Platonic idealism, which saw anatomical forms as [...] "archetypes" [...] in the Divine mind, imposed through [...] "descensive" [...] <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> divine authority in accordance with traditional hierarchies.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} agency losses (agency shirking and agency slippage) in the process <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>delegation</b> in EU trade policy. The central question is whether a conflictual situation exists between {{the interests of the}} member states and those of the European Commission (agency shirking), or whether the structure <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> in itself stimulates the agent to adopt a different position from the principals (agency slippage). Drawing on the principal-agent approach, I argue that agency losses are due to the structure <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> and that the existence of multiple principals with diverging preferences facilitates agency. I find empirical evidence that the Council-Commission relationship on trade politics has different dynamics depending on the negotiating stage. In the initial negotiating stage, when defining the negotiating mandate of the Commission, the relationship is cooperative. Conflict between the Commission and the Council only breaks out in a latter stage of negotiations, when the Commission makes concessions at the international level.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{explores the}} views of nurse {{managers}} in Tanzania regarding desirable attributes for effective management of their health services. The mixed method study utilised an initial questionnaire (n= 78) and subsequent responses from two semi-structured focus group interviews (n= 14) with purposive samples of consenting nurse managers who had completed the original questionnaire. Overall, ‘Skills’ were considered the most important dimension, followed by ‘Knowledge and Learning’. Specific skills, such as decision making, were considered essential. Culture was perceived {{to be a key}} influence on management potential, with education providing a pathway to overcome early and subsequent barriers. A lack <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> was highlighted. An overall transactional style perpetuates as a means of maximising scant resources which impedes trust and sharing <b>of</b> <b>power</b> through <b>delegation.</b> The provision <b>of</b> culturally appropriate management education, relevant to the local context, is essential for the development of nursing in Tanzania...|$|R

Power delegation consisted in having the experimenter transfer to a substitute the responsibility for conducting the experiment. Four conditions <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>delegation</b> were attained by varying {{the sex of the}} persons designated as source and recipient <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> The combinations <b>of</b> sex of experimenter (E) and sex of substitute (ES) were: male and female (MF), female and female (FF), female and male (FM), and male and male (MM). Thirty-two mixed-sex dyads participated. After E introduced ES as his substitute the two subjects answered a human relations questionnaire. The discussion was tape-recorded for subsequent analysis. After completing the task the subjects were asked to select one of them as the group representative. The measurements of interest were (1.) frequency of task-oriented behavior by female subjects and (2) number of female representatives. The results showed a significant effect for sex of BS. The interaction effect of sex of E and ES was also significant. Comparisons between means showed condition FF significantly larger than all others; no other comparison between means yielded significant results. No significant difference was found between the numbers of females chosen as representatives under the four conditions, but the predicted trend was observed. The main findings of this study were that the female subjects tended to behave in a more task-oriented manner when the recipient <b>of</b> <b>power</b> was a female and more so when both the source and recipient <b>of</b> <b>power</b> were females. These findings seem to warrant further research into the effects of situational variables on female role differentiation in small groups...|$|R

The model demonstrates a positive correlation between constituent preferences for public goods and intergovernmental grant receipts, and this correlation has likely biased the existing literature towards finding a flypaper effect. The model also motivates using measures <b>of</b> the political <b>power</b> <b>of</b> state congressional <b>delegations</b> as an instrument for grant receipts.

Focusing on agricultural issues in the Doha Round, this article analyses the impact of agency losses (agency shirking and agency slippage) in the process <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>delegation</b> in EU trade politics. Are agency losses the result <b>of</b> the <b>delegation</b> structure, which stimulates the agent to adopt a different position from the principals (agency slippage), or do conflict situations arise because of conflicting interests between the interests of the Member States and those of the European Commission (agency shirking) ? Based on information collected from "Agence Europe" and interviews with European officials, the main conclusions are that: (1) the Council-Commission relationship can be conflict-laden or co-operative depending on the negotiating stage at the international level; (2) a low degree of interest alignment among Member States increases the Commission's discretion at the international level; (3) inter-institutional conflict weakens the EU negotiating position at the international level because the other WTO members know that the EU is divided and ask for further concessions.
