40|$|This article {{reports on}} 2 {{connected}} studies that provide {{data about the}} flow of research to foreign language (FL) educators in majority Anglophone contexts. The first study investigated exposure to research among FL educators in the United Kingdom using 2 surveys (n = 391; n = 183). The data showed (a) some limited exposure to research via professional association publications and events, (b) negligible direct exposure to publications in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), (c) barriers to exposure caused by poor physical and conceptual access, despite generally positive perceptions of research, and (d) the importance of university-based teacher educators for research–practice interfaces. The second study investigated the potential for indirect exposure to research from 7 professional publications over 5 years in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We systematically reviewed {{the extent to which}} these professional publications referenced 29 SSCI journals that aim to publish pedagogy-relevant research. In our corpus of 8, 516 references in 284 articles in professional journals, the mean proportion of references to all 29 SSCI journals, combined, was 12. 43 % per <b>professional</b> <b>article.</b> The overall mean number of references to each SSCI journal was 0. 17 per <b>professional</b> <b>article.</b> The emerging picture is rather bleak, and we propose action from academic journals and researchers to promote a more international, systematic, and sustainable flow of research...|$|E

Significant facets of the directories which will be incorporated in the discussion include scope of coverage, update frequency, identification of any e-mail alerts or RSS feeds offered, and resource selection criteria. Factors determining whether a site is given in-depth or brief coverage in this article include authority, currency, and whether sites are annotated and classified (the quality of the metadata). We also consider whether a site is broadly or narrowly selective. Broadly selective sites include many more resources, which can be an advantage, especially if they cover some of the more unusual topics in academia. At other times, one may be looking for a listing of a few good sites, so the more narrowly selective sites are more appropriate. Subject portals that cover only one topic are not included (as that would require a book); all the sites listed here cover many fields of study. Sites that meet all of our criteria are covered in more-in-depth reviews. We include shorter reviews for sites that, while not meeting all of our criteria, still offer considerable merit and deserve inclusion in our article. Last, in Appendix A, we provide a comparison chart summarizing some of the key facets of the sites reviewed. A literature review was conducted {{in the early stages of}} our project, and no comparable surveys of directories of Internet resources were discovered...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a medical and social view of taking healing hemp (cannabis). It is a {{theoretical}} thesis elaborated based on {{the analysis of the}} available Czech and foreign information sources and professional publications. The thesis target is to map the issue of taking healing hemp by means of the information from the available foreign and Czech literature. The thesis focuses on the most important issues dealt with by the professional as well as lay public and {{on the development of the}} solution of this issue. I was captured by this issue after my internship in Belgium, where I had the opportunity to travel through neighbouring Netherlands and to get to know, from the viewpoint of a foreigner, the opinions and access of the inhabitants to the hemp as healing and relaxing mean. The first chapter deals with using the healing hemp in the historical context. Hemp represents one of the oldest crops and for this reason the history of hemp in the period of antiquity, Middle Ages and modern times is described. The following chapter focuses on the individual substances contained in hemp. In this chapter, the endo-cannabinoid system and three kinds of substances contained in hemp strains are analysed canabinoids (THC), canabidiols (CBD), canabinols (CBN). The chapter presents the profile of one of the most important personalities associated with hemp, professor Raphael Mechoulam, the main icon and discoverer of THC. The chapter three devotes to toxicology and addiction when taking hemp, which occurs quite rarely among users of hemp drugs. In this chapter, influence of hemp on the memory of user is treated, as well as the influence of hemp on the occurrence of lungs diseases discussed constantly in connection with smoking and in the last part of this chapter, the addiction and influence of hemp on users psyche is analysed. The following chapter is devoted to the issue of the drug policy, especially defining the status of healing hemp in the law, research of healing hemp and legalization of hemp in the Czech Republic. This chapter is devoted in detail to the legalization of hemp in the world, especially in the states like California, Israel, Canada and Netherlands where the hemp was legalized for healing purposes many years ago. The present science brings a wide spectrum of clinical research examining the effects of hemp during the treatment of many diseases. For this reason, the chapter dealing with hemp in connection with medicine is present in the thesis. Six areas were chosen from individual medicine branches on which this chapter is focused. The reader learns about the healing effects of hemp in the area of oncological diseases, psychiatric diseases, palliation of pain, dermatological diseases, multiple sclerosis and HIV/AIDS. In the last chapter, the opinions and experiences of the professional public in connection with hemp are described. This part deals with the contribution of the newest knowledge presented at the Prague conference about healing hemp. In this part of thesis, also the international hemp Cannafest Trade Fair is mentioned held in 2015 in Prague. It follows clearly from the thesis that the health and social issues connected with healing hemp is the topic of extensive and long-lasting discussions at present. In the area of the lay public, there is interest in this form of medical treatment which is supported quite a lot. The thesis may be used as information source by medical/paramedical and social employees and organizations supporting the legal use of healing hemp. It could represent the base of a <b>professional</b> <b>article</b> for the journal dealing with this topic as e. g. professional journals "Legalization" or "Health. " Last but not least, the thesis should serve as complex of information for the persons who decided to take the hemp or consider this possibility...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to {{the first}} issue of Public Communication Review for 2012. There have been some delays in {{publishing}} this second volume because of changes to roles and the teaching and research commitments of editorial staff, which academics will understand. We apologise to authors whose work has been delayed and we are working on speeding up the review and publication process. This issue did not have a pre-planned theme, but two important perspectives on issue management and crisis communication are provided. In the first, we have given more space than the usual article length to an analysis of a major crisis at a university in Europe. While this occurred a few years ago, the article by Martial Pasquier and Etienne Fivat from the Institut de Hautes Études en Administration Publique (the Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration – IDHEAP) provides a forensic analysis of a crisis unfolding, the actions taken by management (and desirable actions not taken), and the repercussions and effects that continued long after the initial incident. The article provides a ‘thick description’ of actions and thinking inside a crisis, as well as media and public reactions, and is informative for organisations and their communication staff. The second perspective on this theme is provided by an experienced Australian practitioner in a <b>professional</b> <b>article.</b> Tony Jaques has a long career working in issue management consulting, along with some academic teaching, and he provides salutary reminders of how crises often arise out of issues that are poorly handled or not addressed at all by management. Tony also explores the future of issue management including evolution from reactive responses to a proactive form of agenda-setting and framing by governments and policy-makers, the impact of social media, the relationship between issue management and crisis management, and the positioning of issue management within organisations. Before these two thematically related articles, this issue presents an analysis of a recent health communication campaign. In our lead article, Deborah Wise and Melanie James from the University of Newcastle in Australia use discourse analysis to examine one particular element of the communication campaign to promote use of a vaccine that prevents the development of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Types 16 and 18 which cause 70 per cent of cervical cancers. In a similarly detailed approach to that of Pasquier and Fivat, Wise and James analyse one brochure using discourse analysis to explore its text and visual content, paying attention to framing, presuppositions, register, modality, foregrounding and backgrounding of particular issues or themes, as well as omissions (what is not said). Their sentence-by-sentence analysis contributes understanding of the techniques of discourse analysis and illustrates the role and importance of deep knowledge to achieve effective communication through an information resource such as a brochure. This issue also includes an article based on a paper presented to the Third International PR History conference in Bournemouth, UK in 2011 by Robert Crawford and the editor. While being circumspect about publishing our own work, this article addresses an important gap in Australian PR scholarship – the lack of a comprehensive localised history of the development of public relations practice and the role and influence of PR socially, culturally and politically. Hence, the title refers to an ‘outside in’ perspective, noting that most PR histories to date have been written about PR for PR. This article examines a significant national cultural event, Australia Day, to identify how it was established, maintained in spite of opposition over many decades, repositioned to adapt to a changing social, cultural and political environment, and finally institutionalised with the Bicentenary celebrations of European settlement (1988) and celebrations for the new millennium. This article prompts us to issue a reminder to our readers to submit articles, tell your colleagues about Public Communication Review, and refer your students to the free online site – [URL] As a ‘young’ journal, we do need to attract more quality submissions to achieve our goals of promoting scholarship across the diverse field of public communication and contributing to the dissemination of research in Australia and Asia Pacific. So please spread the word. And we hope you find the work of authors published in this issue informative and stimulating. Jim Macnamara Editor March 201...|$|E
