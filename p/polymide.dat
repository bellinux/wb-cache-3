Our results suggest that aluminium atoms react preferentially with five and six-fold rings of polyimide when those chemical groups are present on the surface. The compound formation is accompanied by charge transfer from the metal atoms to polyimide and charge rearrangement among the polyimide atoms.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports a}} {{high-speed}} capacitive humidity sensor integrated on a polysilicon heater. A response time of 1. 0 s and a sensitivity of 30. 0 fF/%RH have been obtained. High speed is achieved using multiple polyimide columns having diameters {{of a few}} microns and allowing moisture to diffuse into them circum-ferentially. Using structures that eliminate the air-gap capacitance between the columns, the simulated sensor output drifts by only 1 % when the relative dielectric constant in the air region changes from 1 to 10. A polysilicon heater is used to measure relative hu-midity levels 80 %RH. An accuracy of 3 %RH has been ob-tained using this method, with measurement errors of 0 5 C and 2 %RH in temperature and relative humidity, respectively. The heater also reduces the recovery time after wetting, enables the sensor to recover from contamination and aging, and allows the sensing film to be reset on demand during self-test protocols.
