25|$|Some {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs are}} used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders, and noncancerous <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>dyscrasia.</b> In some cases they are often used at lower doses, {{which means that the}} side effects are minimized, while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain. Cyclophosphamide is sometimes used to treat lupus nephritis, a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or melphalan is commonly used as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Recently, bortezomid in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating AL amyloidosis.|$|E

40|$|Background: Quantitation of serum κ and λ {{immunoglobulin}} free light chains (FLC) {{is central}} to the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>dyscrasias,</b> including multiple myeloma. At present, laboratory FLC tests offer the only means of quantitating FLC in urine and blood and often have a slow turnaround time that prevents early myeloma diagnosis or identification of relapse. We have developed a rapid lateral-flow test (Seralite™) that simultaneously quantitates kappa and lambda FLCs in blood or urine in 10 minutes using highly-specific anti-κ and anti-λ FLC monoclonal antibodies (Campbell et al., 2013 JIM). Methods: Seralite™ validation was conducted by retrospective analysis of sera from patients with <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>dyscrasias</b> from MRC UK Myeloma IX and XI trials. Specifically, 1, 975 (MIX n= 1, 231, MXI n= 744) samples at trial entry were used to assess the utility of Seralite™ for diagnosis. Results: Seralite™ displayed excellent clinical concordance with Freelite™ and immunofixation electrophoresis for identification of abnormal FLC levels. Additionally, cohorts of samples from patients with light chain only myeloma, nonsecretory myeloma, and intact immunoglobulin myeloma (IgAκ/λ, IgGκ/λ, IgMκ/λ, IgDκ/λ) were assessed through diagnosis, response to therapy, plateau and relapse. Seralite had excellent concordance with Freelite™ for the quantitation of serum FLC from diagnosis through monitoring.

50|$|POEMS {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Crow-Fukase syndrome, Takatsuki disease, or PEP syndrome) {{is a rare}} and complex medical syndrome that involves a combination of syndrome-defining signs and symptoms due to the dysfunction of multiple organs. The syndrome {{is associated with a}} <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>dyscrasia</b> in almost 100% of cases, pathological overexpression of certain cytokines in >95% of cases, and the lymphoproliferative disorder termed Castleman's disease in ~15% of cases. (Rare cases of POEMS have been associated with polyclonal rather than clonal plasma cells; these cases are not plasma cell dyscrasias but rather appear to be caused by the over-activity of non-malignant immune cell responses in chronic infections or autoimmune diseases.) POEMS is an acronym standing for the characteristic signs or symptoms of the syndrome: Polyneuropathy, Organomegally, Edocrinopathy, Plasma cell disorder (typically, the plasma cell burden is low in POEMS patients), and Skin changes (e.g. hemangioma, hyperpigmentation). The syndrome is defined by the presence of; both of two major criteria, peripheral neuropathy and a clonal <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>dyscrasia</b> (increased bone marrow plasma cells in ~67% of cases; ≥1 plasmacytoma in ~33% of cases); at least one other major criteria (Castleman's disease, sclerotic bone lesions, elevated serum levels of the cytokine VEGF); and at least one minor criterion (organomegaly, extravascular volume overload ascites,, endocrinopathy hypogonadism,, skin changes, papilledema, and/or hematological manifestations thrombocytosis). The monoclonal protein in POEMS patients is typically identified as IgA or IgG which in >95% of cases contains a λ chain that is restricted to either of two members of the V lambda 1 subfamily viz., IGLV1-40*01 and IGLV1-44*01 (there are 29 other members in the V lambda family). That is, the myeloma protein in POEMS is almost invariably a clonal λ light chain variant. Deletion of chromosome 13 and chromosomal translocations but not increases in chromosome number have also been reported to occur in POEMS patients.|$|E
50|$|Light chain {{multiple}} myeloma is diagnosed {{in patients who}} have: a) the criteria for diagnosis of {{multiple myeloma}} except having a serum free light chain ratio outside the normal range of 0.26 to 1.65 without evidence of an intact immunoglobulin or free heavy chain; or b) an extreme free light chain ratio, i.e. outside the range of 0.02 to 100 (with the light chain having the lower concentration being present at >10 milligrams/liter) regardless of the stage of their <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>dyscrasia.</b> At the time of diagnosis, 30% to 50% of light chain multiple myeloma patients have severe renal dysfunction or renal failure due to light chain myeloma cast nephropathy or the nephrotoxic effects of free light chains on renal tubular cells. Patients are treated similarly to patients suffering the counterparts those with multiple myeloma except that the focus is treating or preventing kidney damage using chemotherapy to reduce production of the monoclonal light chain and thereby stopping, reversing, or preventing kidney injury.|$|E
5000|$|The clonal {{plasma cells}} {{involved}} in plasma cell dyscrasias exhibit {{a high degree}} of genetic instability. For example, the clonal plasma cell population formed by initial genetic alterations that lead to multiple myeloma contains cells that develop further genetic changes that enhance their survival, proliferation, tissue-injuring, and metastatic capacities. This allows the new cell clones to crowd out older cell clones and thereby establish a more malignant disease. Repetition of such genetic changes underlie the evolution of a clinically silent <b>plasma</b> <b>cell</b> <b>dyscrasia</b> to an overt malignancy. The progressive genetic changes in clonal plasma cells include accumulating numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms, increases and decreases in gene and chromosome copy numbers, and chromosomal translocations. Genes affecting include those regulating genome stability itself (e.g. KIF2B) as well as cellular activation, proliferation, and apoptosis (e.g. CIDEC, TP52, ATM, KRAS, NRAS, Wnt, and NF-κB). In the most malignant form of plasma cell dyscrasias, primary plasma cell leukemia, the plasma cell population contains >1900 distinct DNA alterations in >600 genes.|$|E
