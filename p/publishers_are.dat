25|$|The book {{market in}} China {{traditionally}} orders books during book fairs, {{because the country}} lacks a national book ordering system. In 2006, 6.8 million titles were sold, not including {{an unknown number of}} banned titles, bootleg copies and underground publishing factories. Seven percent of all <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> located in Shanghai. Because the industry lacks a national distribution system, many titles from publishers in the provinces can only be found there.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, in {{an article}} in The New Republic, Alexander S. Heard stated that much of Sedaris' work is insufficiently factual to justify being marketed as nonfiction. Several {{published}} responses to Heard's article argued that Sedaris' readers are aware that his descriptions and stories are intentionally exaggerated and manipulated to maximize comic effect, while others used the controversy as a springboard for discussing the liberties <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> willing to take when calling books 'nonfiction'.|$|E
25|$|According to H. L. Oldie, {{writing in}} Russian is {{an easier way}} for Ukrainian authors to be {{published}} and reach a broader audience. The authors {{say that it is}} because of Ukraine's ineffective book publishing policy: while Russian <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> interested in popular literature, Ukrainian publishers rely mostly on grant givers. Many Ukrainian publishers agree and complain about low demand and low profitability for books in Ukrainian, compared to books in Russian.|$|E

25|$|Westminster Council {{recently}} announced that 120 tonnes of free newspapers were collected in six months from the 70 extra recycling bins that were sponsored by Associated Newspapers and News International. This figure falls short of the councils 400 tonnes per annum target. During the six-month period the council also collected 465 tonnes of waste paper from its own 153 on-street recycling bins. The free newspapers <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> responsible for producing approximately 100 tonnes of free newspaper waste every day.|$|E
25|$|Book <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> {{companies}} that have two components to consider: profit-orientation and a cultural dimension. They usually publish titles which are produced by external authors. The sales of books in the receiver markets are {{the main part of}} the revenue model of a book publisher. Other revenues can be generated in the rights and licensing markets. Further sources for revenues are utilization rights generating revenue outside of the printing sector. For example, successful manuscripts are used for film, television, magazines and merchandising.|$|E

25|$|On various Internet forums, some gamers have {{expressed}} disapproval of publishers having creative control since <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> {{more apt to}} follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and {{the product of a}} fully financed one grows larger.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of the size of {{development}} teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios {{need to be able to}} pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450. The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{the cases}} in which the Court had allowed a {{religious}} motivation to exempt a person from a neutral, generally applicable law involved the assertion of both the right of free exercise along with some other right. Thus, religious <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> exempt from a law requiring them to obtain a license if that license may be denied to any publisher the government deems nonreligious. The government may not tax religious solicitors. The government may not require the Amish {{to send their children to}} school because their religion demands otherwise, and Amish parents, like all parents, have the right to direct the education of their children. Because Smith and Black were not asserting a hybrid right, they could not claim a religious exemption under the First Amendment from Oregon's ban on peyote.|$|E

25|$|Bangkok is {{the centre}} of Thailand's media industry. All {{national}} newspapers, broadcast media and major <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> based in the capital. Its 21 national newspapers had a combined daily circulation of about two million in 2002.

The Bangkok Post and The Nation are the two national English language dailies. Foreign publications including The Asian Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Straits Times and the Yomiuri Shimbun also have operations in Bangkok. The large majority of Thailand's more than 200 magazines are published in the capital, and include news magazines as well as lifestyle, entertainment, gossip and fashion-related publications.|$|E
25|$|The Cologne {{newspaper}} war {{and legal}} battles {{were not the}} only problems free papers encountered. In Paris, hawkers who distributed free papers were attacked, and papers were destroyed and burned. The most common newspaper war however is the clash between publishers or, to be more precise, between local publishers and entrepreneurs like in Cologne. In many cities publishers turned the market that has been quiet for decades into a battlefield. Local <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> now responsible for almost half of the total circulation of free daily newspapers. They have a monopoly in Belgium, the UK, Singapore, Melbourne, Austria, Argentina and Iceland. However, in other markets (France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Korea, Denmark, Finland, Italy, USA) local publishers have a substantial market share. In some French and Italian markets three titles are competing; in Seoul there were six titles in October 2004. There are 3 free daily papers in London.|$|E
25|$|The Library {{serves as}} a legal {{repository}} for copyright protection and copyright registration, and as the base for the United States Copyright Office. Regardless of whether they register their copyright, all <b>publishers</b> <b>are</b> required to submit two complete copies of their published works to the Libraryâ€”this requirement is known as mandatory deposit. Nearly 15,000 new items published in the U.S. arrive every business day at the Library. Contrary to popular belief, however, the Library does not retain all of these works in its permanent collection, although it does add an average of 12,000 items per day. Rejected items are used in trades with other libraries around the world, distributed to federal agencies, or donated to schools, communities, and other organizations within the United States. As is true of many similar libraries, the Library of Congress retains copies of every publication in the English language that is deemed significant.|$|E
