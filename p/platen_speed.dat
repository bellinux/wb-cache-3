40|$|The surface {{characteristics}} of a Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 chalcogenide layer after the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process was examined by X-ray diffraction, Auger electron microscopy and optical profiling to identify the dominant CMP mechanism of the new memory material. The platen speeds and applied pressure were varied up to 60 m/s and 4 psi, respectively, to understand the CMP variable effect on the surface quality of Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 layer. The amount of Te hillock and surface roughness increased with increasing <b>platen</b> <b>speed</b> and applied pressure of CMP. Te segregation was {{the main cause of}} the increasing surface roughness. Stress and thermal effects were observed through the CMP-induced phase transformation from FCC to HCP and Te segregation. The surface properties of the Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 thin films showed a strong correlation with phase transformation and Te segregation. The results show that the surface quality can be improved by reducing the <b>platen</b> <b>speed</b> and pressure...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric stacks {{containing}} porous low-k {{materials were}} investigated regarding {{their ability to}} pass CMP processes as used in Cu interconnect technology. Beside the low-k material itself, the impact of layout, cap layer materials and different diffusion barrier materials has been proven. Advanced consumables, partly specially designed for future technology nodes, have been tested within these experiments. Compatibility of the slurries with the low-k stacks, dishing and erosion, impact of polishing parameters like down force and <b>platen</b> <b>speed</b> on low-k stack integrity were examined. Low-k stacks based on a porous MSQ material capped with PECVD-SiC or with a MSQ-hard mask {{were found to be}} promising candidates. Low-k stacks based on porous SiO 2 -aerogel could not meet the stability requirements at present and need additional efforts for adhesion enhancement between cap layer and porous material. Consumables used within the experiments enable an efficient processing with low dishing and erosion as well as an excellent surface quality...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that there is}} a minimum hardness requirement for abrasive particles to be used in CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) slurries. For copper CMP, the common abrasives are various types of alumina and silica. It has also long been suspected that a softer organic based abrasive could significant reduce the defects during polishing. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated the usefulness of an organic particle as abrasive in formulating copper CMP slurry. The unexpected consequence of using such soft hydrophilic particles is its low sensitivity of material removal rate for copper towards polishing down force and <b>platen</b> <b>speed.</b> In addition, due to its unique particle surface properties, the slurry gives high selectivity in removal rate for copper over barrier, cap, and dielectric materials. In this paper, some basic physical and chemical characteristics of the particles and slurry will be first presented. The performance of this new slurry in relation to conventional slurries on blanket and patterned wafers will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{mechanical}} planarization (CMP) {{was known}} as a process to gain superfine surface finish with high precision mechanical parameters. It widely used within semiconductors wafer manufacturing and hard disk (HDD) industries. There’re very few research done in HDD compared with silicon wafer. Micro defect formation caused by first step polishing in multistep polishing reducing the “good sector” and areal density in HDD substrate platter. In this study, micro defect reduction became the main objectives and as main response with others parameters including material removal rate and micro waviness. A 2 level 4 factor fractional factorial with center points Resolution IV, Design of Experiment (DOE) with total of 12 experimental runs was chosen for main effect and interaction screening purposes. All key factors such as <b>platen</b> rotation <b>speed</b> (rpm), applied pressure (g/cm 2), slurry distribution points and slurry flow rate (ml/min) were then being optimized using Response Surface Method (RSM) setup of a set of full factorial 4 factors with center point, single replicate, 8 axial point and 2 alpha significance value with total 31 random runs. Results shows that all the input factors were affecting MRR and MD count except micro waviness which not respond to all input factors applied. Optimum input parameter setup were then established with setup of applied pressure (103. 1 g/cm 2), slurry distribution points (4 / 5 points), slurry flow rate (381. 6 ml/min) and <b>platen</b> rotation <b>speed</b> (15. 7 rpm). Predicted composite desirability gained to be 0. 998, which can be satisfactory accepted. Verification runs from the parameter setup shows and concluded that the desired MD and MRR successfully achieved with 1. 688 % variation...|$|R
50|$|Most {{low-cost}} consumer printers place small ink tanks {{directly on}} the carriage with the printheads. These tanks can have extremely small liquid volumes, as low as 10 mL, and consequently require frequent replacement. It should be also noted that every cartridge replacement is usually automatically followed by head-cleaning cycle of the printer to remove air bubbles from system, further reducing usable ink amount. More expensive, business-grade printers use progressively larger ink tanks on the printhead, but as the <b>platen</b> width and <b>speed</b> of the printer increases it eventually becomes impractical to have the tanks integrated with the printheads due to the high mass and inertia the liquid volume adds to the printheads and the reduced accuracy of printing that occurs.|$|R
40|$|Several recent {{series of}} {{investigations}} {{were conducted on}} corrugated board performance in the areas of: loaded container endurance in cyclic humidity, predictive models for edge compression strength (ECT), effects of lightweight facings, measurement of transverse shear rigidity, effects of adhesive level, and out-of-plane crushing on ECT. The course of this program prompted exploration and review of several aspects of ECT testing methods: specimen height, test duration, and fixture-clamping effects. In this review, ECT values are shown {{to be influenced by}} the combination of the selected testing technique with the specific structural and strength characteristics of the board being tested. The effect of specimen height on selected single wall C-, E-, F-, and N-flute boards is measured and rationalized using a simplified beam-theory approach. Apparent loss of ECT in a C-flute crushed board is explored to determine whether mitigation is possible by selection or modification of testing method. Investigations of <b>platen</b> <b>speed</b> effects on C-flute substantiate previous work. Lightweight facings on A- and C-flute corrugated boards are observed to display localized buckling, which affects the ECT value. An analytical model that combines the measured bending stiffness of the facings and the compression strengths of the fluting and facings provides an improved predictive accuracy and is applied to a series of laboratory and commercial corrugated boards...|$|E
