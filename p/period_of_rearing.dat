In grouped rats, fluoxetine decreased Acet-Tub without changes in Tyr/Glu-Tub. In isolates, fluoxetine did not affect Acet-Tub but increased Tyr/Glu-Tub. Finally, fluoxetine altered serotonin metabolism in grouped, but not in isolated animals. Therefore, isolation-rearing changes the hippocampal responses of the serotonergic and microtubular system to fluoxetine.

Results of this study in 1984 and 1985 showed that fish could be successfully reared in net pens and that growth and physiological development of the off-station reared fish proceeded at a faster rate than in fish reared at a hatchery. Transfer of fish from the hatchery to off-station sites at Social Security Pond (pond) and Rock Creek (backwater) during early March increased the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing</b> in 1986 by about four weeks. The increased <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing</b> allowed all treatments of fed fish to reach a minimum weight of YU fish/lb by release. Differences in growth of fed fish between regular density treatments and additional, high density treatments (double and triple the regular densities) were not significantly different (P > 0. 05), but growth of all fed fish reared off-station was again significantly better than that of hatchery reared fish (P < 0. 05), Mortalities in all groups of fed fish were low. Physiological development of fed fish was similar in all treatments. At release, development of fish at Social Security Pond appeared to be somewhat ahead of fish at Rock Creek on the same dates however, none of the groups of fed fish achieved a high state of smoltification by release. Unfed fish grew poorly over the redring period, and at release were significantly smaller than either fed groups at the off-station sites, or the control groups reared at the hatchery (P < 0. 05). Development of unfed fish toward smoltification was much slower than of fed fish. Mortality of all groups of unfed fish, including the barrier net, was relatively low. Health of all fish reared off-station remained good over the rearing period, and no outbreaks of disease were noted. On-site marking and transfer of fish from the hatchery did not appear to have an adverse effect. Estimated costs of rearing fed fish at regular, double, and triple the regular density were lower than for rearing a similar poundage of fish in a hatchery.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was a comphensive {{assessment}} of the food of pikeperch fry in the monoculture rearing from the stage of summer fry to the stage of autumn fry in ponds with three different types of management and assessment of the influence of individual treatments for pikeperch production. The experiment was performed in small ponds in experimental facility of FFPW in Vodňany. The variants of pond treatment were: a) ponds with additional prey fish (fry of common carp (C. carpio) and grass carp (C. idella)), b) ponds with installed substrate from heather, c) control variant without any support of natural food of pikeperch. All treatments had four repetitions. Rearing of pikeperch fry lasted 97 days. In all treatments, the opportunistic food strategy of pikeperch fry was recorded during the whole <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing</b> and the main recorded food was macrozoobenthos, especially insect larvae. Bigger species of zooplankton had also been often found in the stomachs of pikeperch. Considerable development of macrozoobenthos in all experimental ponds was probably caused by the presence of submerged macrophytes. Thus, this factor made harder to estimate influence of installed substrates from heather for production of pikeperch fry and composition of its food. In the treatment with prey fish, the total length (F (9. 450) = 91. 1; p < 10 - 3) and weight (F (9. 450) = 61. 9; p < 10 - 3) of pikeperch fry were for the whole <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing</b> significantly higher in comparison to the other treatments. In addition, the survival of pikeperch in the treatment with prey fish reached to 56 - 92, 4 % at the end of rearing. In the treatment with substrate from heather, the total length and weight of pikeperch was significantly higher in comparison to the control treatment only in the first term of sampling. In the rest of pikeperch fry rearing period were the values comparable or higher in control treatment. Thus, for the rearing of pikeperch from the stage of summer fry to the stage of autumn fry is appropriate to stock prey fish in ponds. In comparison to installation of artificial substrate, the diversity of water environment, which is subsequently able to provide sufficiently wide natural food for reared pikeperch, seems to be more decisive...|$|E

Backfat thickness was determined at mating, at 105 day of gestation and after weaning and were correlated with selected reproductive indicators including placenta weight. The study was carried out 20 primiparous and 20 multiparous sows of Polish Landrace breed. The nutrition and housing conditions were the same for all pigs. Backfat and loin depth (P 2, P 4, P 4 M) were measured using PIGLOG 105 device. The evaluation of reproductive performance included the weight of placenta at parturition, the number of born piglets, litter weight, piglet body weight at birth, at 21 and at weaning (28 days). Multiparous sows were characterized by greater fatness than primiparous sows in all <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> use. In all examined sows the backfat depth during gestation increased and decreased after lactation. Those changes were more pronounced in multiparous sows than in primiparous sows (P ≤ 0. 01).

L-carnitine supplementation increased antibody titer against Newcastle disease of chicks and the highest levels were observed in those with the supplement of L-carnitine in the soybean oil dietary treatment. Results of this experiment showed that the growth performance and blood biochemical responses of broiler chicks to dietary supplementation with L-carnitine in dietary oil source and soybean oil, in comparison to sunflower oil, is the better plant oil for growth and immunological performance of broiler chicks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{maximize}} the feed consumption and reduction of feed wastage in aquaculture {{can be achieved}} by use of feed attractants to enhance feed intake, growth and nutrient utilization in culture practices. Against this background the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of feed attractants which contains combination of natural flavour extracts (choline, chloride and BHT), amino acids (alanine, valine, glycine, proline, serine and histidine), natural attractants (glutamic acid, tyrosine and betaine) and named as Aquasavor. This was incorporated at 0, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 % levels in the diet having 30 % protein and fed over a period of 120 days to the juveniles of freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) in 25 m 2 cement cisterns. The prawns were stocked at 50 numbers per cistern. The feeding was done daily twice at the rate of 10 % of the body weight during the first month and 5 % during the subsequent <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing.</b> Growth assessment of prawns and water sampling was carried out fortnightly. The best growth, Feed conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR), Protein efficiency ratio (PER) and net production of prawns were recorded with treatment feed having 1. 0 % attractant. The results suggested that feed attractant, Aquasavor is effective in promoting growth, survival and feed utilization in prawn. A level of 10 g/kg diet was found optimum for M. rosenbergii in field condition...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the work}} was to study the piscicultural {{biological}} and physiological reasoning of using the natural ceolites of Kammenoyarskyi field in the Astrakhan region {{in the composition of}} productive diets for sturgeons (by the example of yearlings of hybrids of Russian sturgeon and Lenskiy sturgeon). The hybrid of Russian and Lenskiy sturgeon is enough perspective for rearing in industrial conditions because of its high biological flexibility and exterior properties. It has shown good results as an object of commercial farming in world scale alongside the traditional sturgeon species. While establishing the volume of adding the ceolites into the diet the previous data, received during the rearing of bester, carp and trout, have been taken into account. The effectiveness of these rations has been assessed by piscicultural (growth rate, coefficient of weight storage, survival rate etc.) and physiological properties (red and white blood). As a result of the investigations the possibility of using 3 and 6 % of natural ceolites in the composition of productive sturgeon diets has been stated. It has been revealed that introduction of ceolites into the diet has positive effect on the figures of growth rate of hybrid’s fry and its physiological state. Absolute gain of fry for the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rearing</b> in the test reservoirs with 3 and 6 % of ceolites in re-spect to control was equal to 114. 4 and 105. 2 % accordingly. The survival rate was 100 % in all variants...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of Giant otter was {{studied in the}} central Brazilian Amazon at the Xixuaú Reserve, Roraima (0 º 48 ’S, 61 º 33 ’W), in order to gather preliminary information on spatial use of habitat. Through the period 2000 – 2003, 80 animals have been recorded {{in the study area}}, of which 9 solitary (11. 2 %) and 71 (88. 7 %) in groups of an average of 4. 46 individuals (n= 15; biggest group= 9). For 4 Giant otter groups, dry season home ranges were estimated at approximately 8 km in average (n= 6; minimum size 4. 6 km, maximum size 10. 5 km), along watercourses of 52. 8 m of average width (n= 8). Groups’ home ranges in the study area can overlap. An expansion in direction of flooded forest areas has been observed during the flooded season as well as a temporary contraction during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> cub <b>rearing.</b> The periodic and complete counting of the animals allowed estimating the density of the species in the study area (1 animal/ 1 km) ...|$|R
40|$|Commercial capture-based {{aquaculture}} of the Atlantic {{bluefin tuna}} (ABT), Thunnus thynnus (L.), has been {{prominent in the}} Mediterranean for over a decade. Owing to several limitations encountered in working with the species, including its high commercial value, {{there has been little}} research carried out relating to this species. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine several health parameters of captive ABT. These included an examination of coronary artery lesions, haematology, plasma biochemistry, assessment of immune function and changes in fatty acid (FA) flesh content through the on-growing period. Arteriosclerosis in fish is a pathologic condition of uncertain etiology and involves the main coronary artery in teleosts. Apart from reports of their widespread occurrence in salmonids, they have been described from a restricted number of wild ABT specimens but have not received further attention. This investigation analysed the effect <b>of</b> size and <b>period</b> <b>of</b> net-pen <b>rearing</b> on the prevalence and severity of arteriosclerotic lesions in ABT. Coronary arteries from wild and captive fish were investigated and prevalence was 100...|$|R

It can be found at: [URL] scales have long been used to reconstruct fine-scale habitat transitions such as the movement of juvenile fish from freshwater, estuary, and ocean environments. Despite the importance of life history information to fisheries management and conservation, few studies have validated that scale morphology accurately describes fish movement between these habitats. Therefore, we tested the accuracy of using scale morphometric criteria to identify the movement of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from freshwater to marine portions of the Columbia River estuary by comparing scale morphometric classification, scale chemistry, and otolith chemistry. Nearly one-half of all fish collected in the saline portion of the estuary and approximately one-quarter in the freshwater portion exhibited morphometric patterns (i. e., scale checks and intermediate growth) often associated with <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> estuary <b>rearing.</b> Depending upon the criteria used to define scale checks, otolith chemical results indicated that 33 – 53...|$|R
