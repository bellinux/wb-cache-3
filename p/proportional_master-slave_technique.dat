40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{parallel}} checking of passive constraints in object-oriented databases. It presents a parallel algorithm for constraint checking {{based on a}} <b>master-slave</b> <b>technique</b> and discusses its implementation on a parallel object-oriented database system. The system is named PRACTIC {{and is based on}} class concurrency. Passive constraints, unlike active database rules, are independent and can be executed using AND-parallelism. Simulation shows that the proposed algorithm offers considerable speed-up, which mainly depends on the number of constraints and the total constraint execution time, while it is only slightly affected from the distribution of constraints and the constraint scheduling policy. Finally, it is explained how the PRACTIC system enhances the algorithm's performance using features, like nested query parallelism and constraint overlapping...|$|R
40|$|Switched Ethernet is {{increasingly}} used in real-time communication {{due to its}} intrinsic features such as micro segmentation and high throughput. However, COTS switches may impose long blocking times due to their FIFO queues and can also experience buffer over ow in outgoing queues due to uncontrolled packets arrival. Reconciling the use of ordinary switches {{with the needs of}} real-time communication requires an adequate overlay protocol. In this paper we focus on using a <b>Master-Slave</b> <b>technique</b> to overcome the COTS switch limitations in real-time applications, namely the FTT-SE protocol. We extend the protocol for large scale networks and we present the worst-case delay analysis using the Network Calculus formalism for such a network. Moreover, we assess the end-to-end delay of traffc with simulation...|$|R
40|$|An {{asymmetric}} MOSFET-C band-pass filter(BPF) with on chip {{charge pump}} auto-tuning is presented. It is implemented in UMC (United Manufacturing Corporation) 0. 18 μm CMOS process technology. The filter system with auto-tuning uses a <b>master-slave</b> <b>technique</b> for continuous tuning {{in which the}} charge pump OUtputs 2. 663 V, {{much higher than the}} power supply voltage, to improve the linearity of the filter. The main filter with third order low-pass and second order high-pass properties is an asymmetric band-pass filter with bandwidth of 2. 730 - 5. 340 MHz. The in-band third order harmonic input intercept point(HP 3) is 16. 621 dBm,wim 50 Ω as the source impedance. The input referred noise iS about 47. 455 μVrms. The main filter dissipates 3. 528 mW while the auto-tuning system dissipates 2. 412 mW from a 1. 8 V power supply. The filter with the auto-tuning system occupies 0. 592 mm~ 2 and it can be utilized in GPS (global positioning system) and Bluetooth systems...|$|R

Dynamic {{analysis}} of structuresThis paper presents a systematic approach {{to study the}} effects of long-term time-dependent behaviour due to ageing of concrete, concrete creep, concrete shrinkage and cable relaxation on the dynamic properties of concrete bridges. An equivalent stress relaxation model is introduced to obtain the equivalent creep coefficients of prestressing tendons. Based on this, the time integration method for prestressing tendons is developed. A bridge is modelled properly by finite element method using the <b>master-slave</b> <b>technique</b> to ensure compatibility between the concrete member and tendons. Time-dependent analysis is then conducted using time integration considering the interaction among various time-varying factors. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} updated finite element model, dynamic properties of the concrete structure are investigated by the subspace iteration method. The effects of long-term time-dependent behaviour on the dynamic properties of typical concrete bridges are then examined in detail. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London. link_to_subscribed_fulltextThe 21 st Australian Conference on the Mechanics of Structures and Materials, Melbourne, Australia, 7 - 10 December 2010.

40|$|The {{co-ordination}} and synchronization {{control of}} motion of multiple motors is a challenging problem, since the synchronization {{of each individual}} motor can be influenced by many factors. This paper presents the concept and implementation of a scheme that uses a real time control approach to realize drive synchronization of the multiple motors. The basic principle of the control is the speed of both master and slave are measured and compared {{in such a way}} to get speed synchronization of both motors regardless of different modes of operation. A new Master-Slave configuration is developed. Imperfect synchronization can be corrected on-line using ARM This paper discusses an implementation where a continuously variable speed operation is provided for the multiple motors by using a single low cost ARM controller. These controllers implement variable speed drives with minimum external hardware thus increasing the reliability. A new master-slave control scheme using ARM is developed. Imprecise synchronization the <b>master-slave</b> <b>technique</b> is designed to reduce the synchronization error under the assumption the slaves can follow the master instantly. More recently there has been a large interest in electronic synchronization, because it offers certain advantages in terms of flexibility and reliability...|$|R
40|$|Switched Ethernet {{technology}} has been introduced to be exploited in real-time communication systems due to its features such as its high throughput and wide availability, hence being a cost-effective solution. Many real-time switched Ethernet protocols have been developed, preserving the profits of traditional Ethernet technology, to overcome the limitations imposed by using commercially available (COTS) switches. These limitations mainly originate from the non-deterministic behavior of the Ethernet switches inherent {{in the use of}} FIFO queues and a limited number of priority levels.   In our research we focus on two particular real-time communication technologies, one based on COTS Ethernet switches named the FTT-SE architecture and the other using a modified Ethernet switch called the HaRTES architecture. Both architectures are based on a <b>master-slave</b> <b>technique</b> supporting different and temporally isolated traffic types including real-time periodic, real-time sporadic and non-real-time traffic. Also, they provide mechanisms implementing adaptivity {{as a response to the}} requirements imposed by dynamic real-time applications. Nevertheless, the two mentioned architectures were originally developed for a simple network consisting of a single switch, and they were lacking support for multi-hop communication. In industrial applications, multi-hop communication is essential as the networks comprise a high number of nodes, that is far beyond the capability of a single switch.   In this thesis, we study the challenges of building multi-hop communication using the FTT-SE and the HaRTES architectures. We propose different architectures to provide multi-hop communication while preserving the key characteristics of the single-switch architecture such as timeliness guarantee, resource efficiency, adaptivity and dynamicity. We develop a response time analysis for each proposed architecture and we compare them to assess their corresponding benefits and limitations. Further, we develop a simulation tool to evaluate the solutions...|$|R
40|$|In this study, at first, Parallel Virtual Machine is reviewed. Since It {{is based}} upon {{parallel}} processing, it is similar to parallel systems in principle in terms of architecture. Parallel Virtual Machine is neither an operating system nor a programming language. It is a specific software tool that supports heterogeneous parallel systems. However, it {{takes advantage of the}} features of both to make users close to parallel systems. Since tasks can be executed in parallel on parallel systems by Parallel Virtual Machine, there is an important similarity between PVM and distributed systems and multiple processors. In this study, the relations in question are examined by making use of <b>Master-Slave</b> programming <b>technique.</b> In conclusion, the PVM is tested with a simple factorial computation on a distributed system to observe its adaptation to parallel architects...|$|R

Based on the differential and integral inequalities (DII) approach, a simple linear control is proposed to realize practical synchronization for master-slave chaotic systems with uncertain input nonlinearities. Besides, the guaranteed exponential convergence rate can be prespecified.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaA {{classical}} {{method of}} transfering time and frequency from one network node to {{another is the}} <b>Master-Slave</b> (MS) <b>technique.</b> This method, though fairly simple and easy to implement, is plagued with the problems introduced by the variable propagation path delays between network nodes. The master slave returnable timing system (MSRTS) technique {{presented in this paper}} offers the flexibility and simplicity of the well established MS approach; however, it provides for a novel automatic delay compensation feature. Delay compensation between two nodes is achieved by measuring the delay between the two nodes and then using this knowledge about the delay to automatically update the phase of the transmitting node such that the phase at the receiving node is independent of the delay between the two nodes. A theory and analysis of this system is presented here in a noise free environment and an extension is made to cover the propagation of internally generated noise (clock phase noise) through the network...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{protocol}} for routing in Bluetooth scatternets. The protocol uses the available battery {{power in the}} Bluetooth (BT) devices as a cost metric in choosing the routes. We evaluate the throughput performance {{as a function of}} packet arrival rate and number of piconets. A throughput of about 120 Kbps/piconet is shown to be achieved in a 5 -piconet scatternet. We propose two techniques, namely a) battery power level based master-slave switch and b) distance based power control, to increase the network lifetime in scatternets. The <b>master-slave</b> switch <b>technique</b> is motivated by the fact that a piconet master has to handle the packet transmissions to/from all its slaves, and hence may drain its battery soon. We propose a role switching idea where each BT device in a piconet may have to play the master role depending on its available battery power. In the second technique, we propose that the BT devices choose their transmit powers based on their distances from their respective masters. Our performance results show that a considerable gain in network lifetime can be achieved using these two power saving techniques...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} bus voltage regulation, two commonly-used {{methods have been}} proposed. The first one is the droop control method. This is a simple technique to achieve current sharing. The bus voltage is first measured, and afterwards {{the amount of energy}} that each source will supply is calculated [22]. The second method is <b>master-slave</b> control. This <b>technique</b> depends on communication between converters: a master controller regulates the DC voltage and sends the set-points to the other converters [23, 24, 25], with a very good load sharing ability even if the converters are not identical. However, neither the droop control, which has an inevitable disadvantage of bus voltage deviation, nor a common master-slave control, which requires communication between converters, is able to provide a comprehensive solution to the DC bus regulation together with the partial shading problems or PV module failures with an appropriate control strategy.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{provides}} the necessary tools for the dynamic modelling of flexible mechanisms using the master-slave approach. The numerical modelling {{of this kind}} of structures within the finite-element context encounters three main difficulties: the mod-elling of beams, the time-integration of the equilibrium equations and the treatment of the joint constraints. Due to the presence of large displacements and rotations, the geometrically exact beam theory (also known as the Reissner-Simo beam theory) has been chosen for its suitable description of the kinematics and the demonstrated accuracy it gives. The finite-element interpolation of large rotations is not unique and it strongly influences the strain-invariant properties of the underlying model and the conserving characteristics of the resulting time-integration schemes. These schemes are affected by the character of the differential equations, which in turn depend on the modelling of the kinematic joints. In the present thesis, they are modelled by resorting to the <b>master-slave</b> approach, a <b>technique</b> that retains the minimum set of degrees of freedom within the equations of motion and ha...|$|R
