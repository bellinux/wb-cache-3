5|$|The large armlet of pierced gold (opus interrasile) showed {{traces of}} {{hematite}} {{on the reverse}} side, which <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used {{as a type of}} jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the niello technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.|$|E

I <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> put I Love My Chick on another album that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more {{appropriate}} for." ...|$|R
25|$|The Second World War {{was from}} 1939 to 1945, {{so most of}} the {{importance}} has dropped. There <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an increase in wagon sheet production. It is thought that there is also damage again on the water tower {{at the back of the}} site.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{flag was}} never {{adopted by the}} Confederate Congress, never flew over any state capitols during the Confederacy, and was never officially used by Confederate veterans' groups. The flag <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> relegated to Civil War museums {{if it had not}} been resurrected by the resurgent KKK and used by Southern Dixiecrats during the 1948 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Muller— {{the film}} editor for The Trial, Chimes at Midnight and the CBS Special Orson Bag was {{fortunate}} to work on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version— was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing, but {{with the addition of}} ad hoc sound and music, it <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rather successful.|$|E

60|$|The trap {{was placed}} upon a small stone {{by the side}} of a larger one. It was in a very snug and {{sheltered}} place, almost out of view. In fact it <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed by any ordinary passer-by.|$|R
50|$|Duns {{are similar}} to brochs, but are smaller and <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> capable of {{supporting}} a very tall structure. Good examples {{of this kind of}} dun {{can be found in the}} Outer Hebrides of Scotland, on artificial islands in small lakes.|$|R
25|$|The unique {{horizontal}} stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small foreplane was directly {{controlled by the}} pilot and pulled the stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish pitch control, increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small foreplane was lessened, and if the project had developed further, it <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> replaced by a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of leading edge slats causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.|$|E
25|$|At 2:30p.m., Major General Meade {{had learned}} of Miles's {{difficulties}} subduing Cooke's force and ordered Major General Humphreys {{to take one}} of his divisions back to Sutherland's Station to support Miles. By the time Humphreys arrived back at Sutherland's Station with Hays's division, he found out that Miles's final attack had been successful. Miles and Hays camped near Sutherland's Station to protect their roadblock of the railroad. Humphreys later wrote that the whole Confederate force <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> captured if the II Corps had been able to continue to Sutherland's Station that morning. Other than the 600 taken prisoners, Confederate casualties at Sutherland's Station are unknown. Miles had 366 casualties.|$|E
25|$|After over a year, Kidd {{was sent}} to England for {{questioning}} by the Parliament of England. The new Tory ministry hoped to use Kidd {{as a tool to}} discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but Kidd refused to name names, naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation that he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the High Court of Admiralty in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous Newgate Prison, and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.|$|E

50|$|While Buckner was {{singled out}} as {{responsible}} for the loss, many observers—as well as both Wilson and Buckner—have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.|$|R
25|$|The third White Rose {{trial was}} {{scheduled}} for 20 April 1943, Hitler's birthday, which was a public holiday in Nazi Germany. Judge Freisler had intended to issue death sentences against Wilhelm Geyer, Harald Dohrn, Josef Söhngen and Manfred Eickemeyer. Because {{he did not want}} to issue too many death sentences in a single trial, he therefore wanted to postpone his judgment against those four until the next day. However, the evidence against them was lost, and the trial finally took place on 13 July 1943. In that trial, Gisela Schertling—who had betrayed most of the friends, even fringe members like Gerhard Feuerle—changed her mind and recanted her testimony against all of them. Since Freisler did not preside over the third trial, the judge acquitted for lack of evidence all but Söhngen, who was sentenced to a six months' term in prison. After her acquittal on 19 April, Traute Lafrenz was placed under arrest again. She spent the last year of the war in prison. Trials kept being postponed and moved to different locations because of Allied air raids. Her trial was finally set for April 1945, after which she <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> executed. Three days before the trial, however, the Allies liberated the town where she was held prisoner, thereby saving her life.|$|E

500|$|Groves {{appreciated}} the early British atomic {{research and the}} British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project, but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them. He considered British assistance [...] "helpful but not vital", {{but at the same}} time, acknowledged that [...] "without active and continuing British interest, there <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no atomic bomb to drop on Hiroshima." [...] He considered Britain's key contributions to have been encouragement and support at the intergovernmental level, scientific aid, the production of powdered nickel in Wales, and preliminary studies and laboratory work.|$|E

500|$|Jackson's {{appearance}} {{during the}} [...] "What More Can I Give" [...] performance was later edited out of American Broadcasting Company's airing of the show. The company {{were forced to}} take the action after representatives of Jackson informed them that CBS had demanded that the singer not perform on a network show before a Jackson special being broadcast on their channel the following month. CBS executives, however, denied their insistence on Jackson's removal from the footage. They stated that if the singer {{had appeared in the}} broadcast footage, they most <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> forced to delay Jackson's show, so that it would not appear too soon after the airing of United We Stand: What More Can I Give.|$|E
500|$|The ontogeny, or the {{development}} of the individual from juvenile to adult, is poorly known for Heterodontosaurus, as juvenile specimens are scarce. As shown by the juvenile skull SAM-PK-K10487, the eye sockets became proportionally smaller as the animal grew, and the snout became longer and contained additional teeth. Similar changes have been reported for several other dinosaurs. The morphology of the teeth, however, did not change with age, indicating that the diet of juveniles was {{the same as that of}} adults. The length of the juvenile skull was suggested to be 45mm. Assuming similar body proportions as adult individuals, the body length of this juvenile would have been [...] Indeed, the individual <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> smaller, since juvenile animals in general show proportionally larger heads.|$|E
500|$|Wiescamp showed Skipper W as a halter horse {{three times}} when the {{stallion}} was four years old. Skipper W was named grand champion stallion at the three shows he attended, the 1948 National Western Stock Show in Denver, the 1948 Colorado State Fair, and the 1948 New Mexico State Fair. Wiescamp later remarked that [...] "I'm glad now that we didn't show him more, because {{he would have been}} before the public so much that he <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sold." [...] However, Skipper W's American Quarter Horse Association, or AQHA, show record does not show any record of these wins, which is not unusual for horses shown in the 1940s, as the record keeping was not always the best {{during the early years of}} the AQHA.|$|E
5000|$|As for August 31, 1939 Union Touring was the last, 10th team in Polish {{football}} League, {{with only}} 3 points (goals difference 15-51). Even though the 1939 season never ended (see: Polish September Campaign) {{and the team}} played only 12 out of 18 planned games, most <b>probably</b> it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> relegated to the A-Class.|$|R

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} month of the season, Ruth {{concluded}} he was finished even as a part-time player. As early as May 12, he asked Fuchs to let him retire. Ultimately, Fuchs persuaded Ruth to remain at least until after the Memorial Day doubleheader in Philadelphia. In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor him. In Chicago and St. Louis, Ruth performed poorly, and his batting average sank to [...]155, with only two additional home runs for a total of three on the season so far. In the first two games in Pittsburgh, Ruth had only one hit, though a long fly caught by Paul Waner <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a home run in any other ballpark besides Forbes Field.|$|E
500|$|Machinima {{has been}} used in music videos, of which the first {{documented}} example is Ken Thain's 2002 [...] "Rebel vs. Thug", made in collaboration with Chuck D. For this, Thain used Quake2Max, a modification of Quake II that provided cel-shaded animation. The following year, Tommy Pallotta directed [...] "In the Waiting Line" [...] for the British group Zero 7. He told Computer Graphics World, [...] "It <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> quicker to do the film in a 3D animated program. But now, we can reuse the assets in an improvisational way." [...] Scenes of the game Postal 2 {{can be seen in the}} music video of the Black Eyed Peas single [...] "Where Is the Love?". In television, MTV features video game characters on its show Video Mods. Among World of Warcraft players, dance and music videos became popular after dancing animations were discovered in the game.|$|E
500|$|The full cabinet met on 14:30 on August 9, {{and spent}} most of the day debating surrender. As the Big Six had done, the cabinet split, with neither Tōgō's {{position}} nor Anami's attracting a majority. Anami told the other cabinet ministers that, under torture, a captured American P-51 Mustang fighter pilot had told his interrogators that the United States possessed 100 atom bombs and that Tokyo and Kyoto would be bombed [...] "in the next few days". The pilot, Marcus McDilda, was lying. McDilda, who had been shot down off the coast of Japan two days after the Hiroshima bombing, knew nothing of the Manhattan Project and simply told his interrogators what he thought they wanted to hear to end the torture. The lie, which caused him to be classified as a high-priority prisoner, probably saved him from beheading. In reality, the United States would have had the third bomb ready for use around August 19, and a fourth in September 1945. The third bomb <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used against Tokyo.|$|E
50|$|Engelbrektsson <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the Archbishop of Nidaros, had the King of Denmark had the {{complete}} control of Norway.

50|$|Imbibition is {{a special}} type of {{diffusion}} when water is absorbed by solids-colloids causing an enormous increase in volume. Examples include the absorption of water by seeds and dry wood.
