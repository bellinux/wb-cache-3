50|$|Prior to 1887, the {{purchase}} of horses was the responsibility of individual regimental colonels, {{in the case of}} cavalry regiments, or of agents acting on behalf of the artillery and engineers. This system worked well enough in peacetime but rapidly broke down during war when demand exceeded supply, prices rose and, the price that could be paid per horse being set by the Government, regimental <b>purchasing</b> <b>officers</b> and agents were frequently left with the most inferior animals. Consequently, in 1887 the Remount Department was set up in order to ensure the uniformity and suitability of the animals purchased for the army, and their training. Owners were encouraged to register a proportion of their horses with the Department, the Department having the option of purchasing these animals for a fixed sum in time of emergency. In recompense for this, the owners were paid a pension of 10/- per year for each animal.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{introduces}} {{a framework for}} measuring B 2 B relationship value and tests whether relationship value changes across various relationship levels. It measures relationship value in monetary terms and tests whether higher level relationships have higher value both for buyers and sellers. Design/methodology/approach – The data was collected using structured interviews with marketing managers and <b>purchasing</b> <b>officers</b> within the food manufacturing sector in New Zealand. The data was subjected to ANOVA statistical analysis. Findings – The findings suggest that lower level relationships (transactional) could be dropped for minimal additional financial gain but firms were willing to forego extremely attractive scenarios to keep their cooperative partners. Originality/value – Implications suggest that managers value cooperative relationships {{and are willing to}} forego very attractive prices {{in order to keep the}} non-price value components. If managers can ascertain what these valued components are and how they can be utilized, they can make themselves a highly valued partner...|$|R

Thisarticle describes practical experiments with procurement dataset of a major governmental organization in Singapore.

The goal of such analytics is to deliver beneficial information to procurement office that plans and manages relationships with external sellers. In the article we describe the characteristics of the procurement dataset specifics and its implications on the future purchase problem that we attempt to solve using Markov chains model. Our analysis showshigh diversity of purchase descriptionsresulting in low ability to detect sequential patterns of <b>purchasing</b> <b>officers.</b> The solution presented in the article is additional dataset preprocessing involving use of hierarchical clustering. Our experiments with various similarity measures show an improvement allowing a practical deployment within our procurement analytics system prepared for the case study governmental organization...|$|R
