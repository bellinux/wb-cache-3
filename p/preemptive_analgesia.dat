Methods: A total of 60 children undergoing urological surgery {{were randomly assigned to}} either the <b>preemptive</b> epidural <b>analgesia</b> (Preempt EA, n= 31) group or the postoperative epidural analgesia (Postop EA, n= 29) group. Epidural infusion was started before the surgical incision in Preempt EA group and after the peritoneal closure in the Postop EA group. Blood samples were collected preoperatively (before anesthesia induction), 1 h and 24 h after surgery. Plasma TNF-α and IL- 2 levels were measured by ELISA. Postoperative pain was assessed using the FACES pain scale, and postoperative analgesia was evaluated 1 h and 24 h after surgery. Results: Although TNF-α levels were increased 1 h and 24 h after surgery compared to preoperative levels in both groups, the levels were significantly higher in the Postop EA group.

However, conflicting evidence exists about the efficacy of such <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> {{for the management of}} postoperative pain. This study compares the efficacy of intraplantar administration of indomethacin (a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) and MK 886 (an inhibitor of 5 -lipoxygenase-activating protein), separately or in combination to produce <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> in a model of surgical incisional pain in male Wistar rats. All incised rats (5 to 6 rats per group) had allodynia at 2, 6, and 24 h after surgery as evaluated using von Frey filaments. MK 886, but not indomethacin (50 to 200 µg/paw), reduced the allodynia when injected either 1 h before or 1 h after surgery. The effect of preoperative MK 886 (160 µg/paw) against incisional allodynia had a magnitude apparently similar to that produced by postoperative MK 886. Pre-, but not postoperative MK 886 (80 µg/paw) reduced the allodynia but the effect was seen only at 6 h after surgery. In contrast, MK 886 (40 µg/paw) intensified the allodynia observed 2 h after the incision either injected before or after surgery. MK 886 or indomethacin alone did not provide <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> in the model of incisional pain.

40|$|PURPOSE: This two-part review {{summarizes}} the current knowledge of physiological mechanisms, pharmacological modalities and controversial issues surrounding <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia.</b> SOURCE: Articles from 1966 to present {{were obtained from}} the MEDLINE databases. Search terms included analgesia, preemptive; neurotransmitters; pain, postoperative; hyperalgesia; sensitization, central nervous system; pathways, nociception; anesthetic techniques; analgesics, agents. Principal findings: In Part I of this review article, techniques and agents that attenuate or prevent central and peripheral sensitization were reviewed. In Part II, the conditions required for effective preemptive techniques are evaluated. Specifically, <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> may be defined as an antinociceptive treatment that prevents establishment of altered central processing of afferent input from sites of injury. The most important conditions for establishment of effective <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> are the establishment of an effective level of antinociception before injury, and the continuation of this effective analgesic level well into the post-injury period to prevent central sensitization during the inflammatory phase. Although single-agent therapy may attenuate the central nociceptive processing, multi-modal therapy is more effective, and may be associated with fewer side effects compared with the high-dose, single-agent therapy. CONCLUSION: The variable patient characteristics and timing of <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> in relation to surgical noxious input require individualization of the technique(s) chosen.

40|$|Abstract: In this randomized, double-blinded study, the {{preemptive}} {{effects of}} intravenous and epidural fentanyl analgesia {{were compared with}} post-incisional analgesia in 40 patients undergoing orthophedic surgery of the lower extremities. Patients were randomly allocated {{to one of two}} groups; intravenous or epidural analgesia, with twenty patients in each group. General anesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 - 6 mgkg- 1 and maintained with 0. 8 - 1. 0 % isoflurane and 66 % nitrous oxide in 33 % O 2. The trachea was intubated after administration of vecuronium 0. 1 mgkg- 1. Patients in the epidural analgesia groups then received, by random allocation, 2 µgkg- 1 fentanyl with 0. 9 % saline (total volume 0. 15 mlkg- 1) after epidural catheter replacement 15 minutes before (<b>preemptive</b> epidural <b>analgesia</b> group-PEEA) or 15 minutes after (epidural analgesia group-EA) the surgical incision. Patients in the analgesia groups received, by random allocation, 2 µgkg- 1 fentanyl intravenously immediately after induction (<b>preemptive</b> intravenous <b>analgesia</b> group-PEIV) or 15 minutes after the surgical incision (intravenous analgesia group-IV). Visual analogue pain scores (VAS) and postoperative morphine consumption in the preemptive groups were consistently lower than in the analgesia groups, although there was no statistical significance. Similarly, the first analgesic requirement time was longer in the PEEA group than in the EA group. Differences in the plasma concentration of glucose and cortisol were neither consistently nor significantly different between the study groups. In regard to these findings, we believe that with the management of patients with 2 µgkg- 1 fentanyl intravenously or epidurally before painful stimuli lowers the VAS and postoperative analgesic use.

40|$|Advancements in the {{surgical}} approach, anesthetic technique, and {{the initiation of}} rapid rehabilitation protocols have decreased the duration of hospitalization and subsequent length of recovery following elective total hip arthroplasty. We assessed the feasibility and safety of outpatient total hip arthroplasty in 150 consectutive patients. A comprehensive perioperative anesthesia and rehabilitation protocol including preoperative teaching, regional anesthesia, and <b>preemptive</b> oral <b>analgesia</b> and antiemetic therapy was implemented around a minimally invasive surgical technique. A rapid rehabilitation pathway was started immediately after surgery and patients {{had the option of}} being discharged to home the day of surgery if standard discharge criteria were met. All 150 patients were discharged to home the day of surgery, at which time 131 patients were able to walk without assistive devices. Thirty-eight patients required some additional intervention outside the pathway to resolve nausea, hypotension, or sedation prior to discharge. There were no readmissions for pain, nausea, or hypotension yet there was one readmission for fracture and nine emergency room evaluations in the three month perioperative period. This anesthetic and rehabilitation protocol allowed outpatient total hip arthroplasty to be routinely performed in these consectutive patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty.

40|$|Objective: Long-term pain is {{a common}} sequela of thoracotomy, {{occurring}} in approximately 50 % of patients 2 years after thoracic surgery. Despite this alarming statistic, {{little is known about}} the factors responsible for the transition of acute to chronic pain. The aim of the present study is to identify predictors of long-term post-thoracotomy pain. Design: Follow-up was for 1. 5 years for patients who had participated in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of <b>preemptive,</b> multimodal <b>analgesia.</b> Setting: Subjects were recruited from a tertiary care center. Patients: Thirty patients who had undergone lateral thoracotomy were followed up by telephone, administered a structured interview, and classified according to long-term pain status. Main Outcome Measures: Present pain status was measured by a verbal rating scale (VAS). Measures obtained within the first 48 h after surgery were compared between patients with and without pain 1. 5 years later. These include VAS pain scores at rest and after movement, McGill Pain Questionnaire data, patient-controlled morphine consumption (mg), and pain thresholds to pressure applied to a rib contralateral to the thoracotomy incision. Results: Fifty-two percent of patients reported long-term pain. Early post-operative pain was the only factor that significantly predicted long-term pain. Pain intensity 24 h after surgery, at rest, and after movement was significantly greater among patients who developed long-term pain compared with pain-free patients. A significant predictive relationship was also found at 24 and 48 h using the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Cumulative morphine was comparable for the two groups. Pain thresholds to pressure applied to a rib contralateral to the incision did not differ significantly between the groups.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{controversy}} over <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> continues unabated, with studies both supporting and refuting its efficacy. The timing of an analgesic intervention and {{presence of a}} placebo control may have {{significant impact on the}} interpretation of results and may have led to the premature conclusion that <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> is of limited clinical utility. A review of the recent literature using strict definitions of preemptive and preventive analgesia is required in order to clarify the broader issue of the benefits of perioperative analgesia. RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 27 studies, published from April 2001 to April 2002, were found to evaluate preemptive (n = 12) or preventive analgesia (n = 15). Evidence for a benefit of preventive analgesia was strong, with 60 % of studies finding reduced pain or analgesic consumption beyond the clinical duration of action of the analgesic intervention. Evidence for a benefit of <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> was equivocal, with 41. 7 % of studies demonstrating that preincisional treatment reduces pain or analgesic consumption {{to a greater extent than}} does postincisional treatment. SUMMARY: Studies that used a preventive design had a greater likelihood of finding a beneficial effect. The application of preventive perioperative analgesia (not necessarily preincisional) is associated with a significant reduction in pain beyond the clinical duration of action of the analgesic agent, in particular for the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists. The classical definition of <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> should be abandoned in favor of preventive analgesia. This will broaden the scope of inquiry from a narrow focus on preincisional versus postincisional interventions to one that aims to minimize postoperative pain and analgesic requirements by reducing peripheral and central sensitization arising from noxious preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative inputs.

40|$|Background {{literature}} Targets of {{a preventive}} approach to acute pain management Predictors of acute and chronic postsurgical pain History and recent progress in <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> Controversy and confusion about <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> Preventive analgesia • What is preemptive analgesia?The classic definition of <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> requires {{two groups of}} patients to receive identical treatment before or after incision or surgery. The only {{difference between the two}} groups is the timing of administration of the pharmacological agent relative to incision. The constraint to include a postincision or postsurgica I treatment group is methodologically appealing, because in the presence of a positive result, it provides a window of time within which the observed effect occurred, and thus points to possible mechanisms underlying the effect: the classic view assumes that the intraoperative nociceptive barrage contributes to a greater extent to postoperative pain than does the postoperative nociceptive barrage. However, this view is too restrictive and narrow in part because we know that sensitization is induced by factors other than the peripheral nociceptive barrage associated with incision and subsequent noxious intraoperative events. • What is preventive analgesia? A broader approach to the prevention of postoperative pain has evolved that aims to minimize the deleterious immediate and long-term effects of noxious peri operative afferent input.

40|$|Whether {{preemptive}} analgesic {{interventions are}} more effective than conventional regimens in managing acute postoperative pain remains controversial. We systematically searched for randomized controlled trials that specifically compared preoperative analgesic interventions with similar postoperative analgesic interventions via the same route. The retrieved reports were stratified according to five types of analgesic interventions: epidural analgesia, local anesthetic wound infiltration, systemic N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists, systemic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and systemic opioids. The primary outcome measures analyzed were the pain intensity scores, supplemental analgesic consumption, and time to first analgesic consumption. Sixty-six studies with data from 3261 patients were analyzed. Data were combined by using a fixed-effect model, and the effect size index (ES) used was the standardized mean difference. When the data from all three outcome measures were combined, the ES was most pronounced for preemptive administration of epidural analgesia (ES, 0. 38; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 28 - 0. 47), local anesthetic wound infiltration (ES, 0. 29; 95 % CI, 0. 17 - 0. 40), and NSAID administration (ES, 0. 39; 95 % CI, 0. 27 - 0. 48).

Aim {{of this study was}} to present our experience in total intravenous anesthesia in 77 patients, who underwent live and cadaveric donor renal transplantation at Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Adana Teaching and Research Center. Material and Methods:Induction of anesthesia was performed with propofol(2 mg/kg) and fentanyl(1 &# 956;g/kg), and rocuronium bromide(0. 4 - 0. 5 mg/kg) was given before intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with total intravenous anesthesia(propofol, 50 mcg/kg/min; remifentanil, 0. 25 mcg/kg/min infusion). Intraoperative fluid, urine volumes were recorded. For <b>preemptive</b> multimodal <b>analgesia,</b> pre-incisional intravenous paracetamol(15 mg/kg), intramuscular morphine(0. 1 mg/kg) were given. Postoperative analgesia was maintained with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia(meperidine 10 mg bolus, with a lockout time of 20 minutes). Postoperative pain was recorded using Visual Analogue Scale, level of sedation was assessed by Ramsey Sedation Scale. Results:Study included 64 (83. 1 %) live donor transplantations and 13 (16. 9 %) cadaveric donor transplantations. Mean total fluid administration was similar between live and cadaveric donor kidney transplantation patients however mean intraoperative urine output was significantly higher in live donor kidney transplantation patients(p< 0. 001). 57. 1 % of patients had no pain at 5. minutes postoperatively(Visual Analog Scale Score= 0), at 15. minutes postoperatively mean visual analog scale score was 2. 6 and the first analgesic requirements were recorded at 39. 6 minutes. According to Ramsey Sedation Scale, majority of patients(54. 5 %) had response to commands at postoperative 5 th minutes and 85. 7 % of patients were completely cooperative-oriented after 30 minutes. None of patients had deep sedation or respiratory depression. Conclusion:Total intravenous anesthesia can be considered as a safe method in patients with renal transplantation, may contribute to early postoperative recovery and transfer to the transplantation unit.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of ketoprofen used in <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> on the intensity of pain and requirement for analgesics in the perioperative period. Sixty patients scheduled for elective lumbar disc prolapse surgery were randomly divided into two groups. In the PRE group (n = 30) ketoprofen was administered one hour before incision. In the POST group (n = 30) ketoprofen was used immediately after the surgery. The operation was performed under general anesthesia. Postoperative analgesia was realized by NCA (Nurse Controlled Analgesia) and the „required ” dose of ketoprofen was 100 mg. After the operation, pain intensity was measured using visual-analog scale (VAS), ketoprofen requirements, the time to the first dose of ketoprofen, and levels of prostaglandin E (PEG) in blood seru...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effect of <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> of {{dexmedetomidine}} in combined with sufentanil on the stress reaction after anesthesia. Methods: A total of 120 patients who were admitted in our hospital from May, 2014 to August, 2015 for laparscopic surgery {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the observation group and the control group with 60 cases in each group. The patients in the observation group were given dexmedetomidine in combined with sufentanil for preoperative analgesia before anesthesia, while the patients in the control group were given sufentanil. The changes of immunological stress indicators and stress hormone indicators before and after operation, and the occurrence of adverse reactions in the two groups were compared. Results: The comparison of DTER, FEIR, CD 3 +, and CD 4 + before operation between the two groups was not statistically significant. DTER, CD 3 +, and CD 4 + levels after operation in the observation group were significantly elevated when compared with the control group, while FEIR level was significantly lower than that in the control group. The comparison of three stress hormone indicators before operation between the two groups was not statistically significant. ACTH, Cor, and ALD levels after operation in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The occurrence rate of adverse reactions in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Conclusions: <b>Preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> of dexmedetomidine in combined with sufentanil for patients underwent laparoscopic surgery has a small effect on the stress reaction, with a low recurrence rate of adverse reactions; therefore, it can be served as a first choice for <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> of laparoscopic surgery...|$|E
40|$|Arginase {{deficiency}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder of the urea cycle {{in which a}} defect in conversion of arginine to urea and ornithine leads to hyperammonemia. Patients with urea cycle disorders may show increased protein catabolism due to inadequate intake of energy, protein and essential amino acids; infections, fever and surgery. A 12 -year-old girl with arginase deficiency, ASA II who weighed 40 kg was scheduled for bilateral adductor, quadriceps and gastrocnemius tenotomies. She had mental retardation, spasticity and flexion posture of thelower limbs. Metabolic homeostasis was restored with appropriate diet. Successful anesthetic management allowed the patient to be discharged 48 hours after surgery. Increased levels of arginine and ammonia during or after surgery may lead to serious complications such as hypotension, cerebral edema, convulsions, hypothermia and spasticity. Thus special attention {{must be given to}} metabolic homeostasis and nutrition of the patients with arginase deficiency in the perioperative period. Primary goals should be to minimize stress levels by effective anxiolysis, provide an adequate amount of protein-free energy with proper fluid management and to obtain an effective <b>preemptive</b> and postoperative <b>analgesia.</b> In addition to a high level of knowledge, successful anesthesia requires professional communication among nursing staff, dietitians, pediatric metabolism specialist, surgeon and anesthesiologist...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOutpatient {{surgical}} procedures for adult hip and knee reconstruction are gaining interest on a worldwide basis {{and have been}} progressively increasing {{over the last few}} years. Preoperative screening needs to concentrate on both the patient's comorbidities and home environment to provide a proper alignment of expectations of the surgeon, the patient, and the patient's family. Preoperative multidisciplinary patient information covering all aspects of the upcoming treatment course is a mandatory step, focusing on pain management and early mobilization. Perioperative pain management includes both multimodal and preventive <b>analgesia.</b> <b>Preemptive</b> medications, minimization of narcotics, and combination of general and regional anesthesia are the techniques required in joint arthroplasty performed as an outpatient surgical procedure. A multimodal blood loss management program should be used with preoperative identification of anemia and attention directed toward minimizing blood loss, considering the use of tranexamic acid during the surgical procedure. Postoperative care extends from the initial recovery from anesthesia to the physical therapist's evaluation of the patient's ambulatory status. After the patient has met the criteria for discharge and has been discharged on the same day of the surgical procedure, a nurse should call the patient later at home to check on wound status, pain control, and muscle weakness, which will be further addressed by physiotherapy and education. Implementing outpatient arthroplasty requires monitoring safety, patient satisfaction, and economic impact...|$|R
40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of <b>preemptive</b> thoracic epidural <b>analgesia</b> (TEA) comparing conventional postoperative epidural analgesia on thoracotomy. Material and Methods. Forty-four patients were randomized in to two groups (preemptive: Group P, control: Group C). Epidural catheter was inserted in all patients preoperatively. In Group P, epidural analgesic solution was administered as a bolus before the surgical incision and was continued until the end of the surgery. Postoperative patient controlled epidural analgesia infusion pumps were prepared for all patients. Respiratory rates (RR) were recorded. Patient’s analgesia was evaluated with visual analog scale at rest (VASr) and coughing (VASc). Number of patient’s demands from the pump, pump’s delivery, and additional analgesic requirement were also recorded. Results. RR in Group C was higher than in Group P at postoperative 1 st and 2 nd hours. Both VASr and VASc scores in Group P were lower than in Group C at postoperative 1 st, 2 nd, and 4 th hours. Patient’s demand and pump’s delivery count for bolus dose in Group P were lower than in Group C in all measurement times. Total analgesic requirements on postoperative 1 st and 24 th hours in Group P were lower than in Group C. Conclusion. We consider that preemptive TEA may offer better analgesia after thoracotomy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPain {{behavior}} and awareness {{are characterized by}} heightened alertness and anxiety, which begin to disappear {{as soon as the}} curative process starts. The present study aimed to quantify c-fos expression in rat spinal cords and brains after a surgical stimulus and with preoperative or postoperative acupuncture. Animals were randomly divided into preoperative and postoperative groups and were then further divided into control, manual acupuncture (MA), or electroacupuncture (EA) groups. Expression of c-fos was quantified using immunohistochemistry. The collected data were analyzed using the t test at a 5 % probability level. Presurgery and postsurgery spinal cord c-fos expressions were similar in all of the treatment groups. In the control rats, c-fos expression was higher before surgery than after surgery, contradicting the expected outcome of acupuncture and <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia.</b> After treatment, the expression of c-fos in the brains of the rats in the MA and the EA groups was reduced compared with that of the rats in the control group. These findings suggest that acupuncture used as <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> in rats is a useful model for studying its application in human treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background Nowadays, {{increasingly}} more <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> studies focus on postoperative pain; however, {{the impact of}} <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> on perioperative opioid requirement is not well defined. This study {{was carried out in}} order to evaluate whether preoperative intravenous flurbiprofen axetil can reduce perioperative opioid consumption and provide postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thyroid gland surgery. Methods Ninety patients undergoing elective thyroid gland surgery were randomly assigned to three groups. Group A (Control) was administered Intralipid &# 174; 2 ml as a placebo 15 min before the cervical plexus block {{and at the end of}} the surgery; Group B (Routine analgesia) was administered a placebo 15 min before the cervical plexus block and flurbiprofen 50 mg at the end of the surgery; Group C (<b>Preemptive</b> <b>analgesia)</b> was administered intravenous flurbiprofen 50 mg 15 min before the cervical plexus block and a placebo at the end of the surgery. Sufentanil administration during the surgery and the 24 h satisfaction score on analgesic therapy were both recorded. The analgesic efficacy was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the surgery, based on visual analog scales. Results Ninety patients were involved in the study. One patient from Group B did not have their scheduled surgery; eighty-nine patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the patient demographics between the three groups. Visual analog scales: 1, 2, 4 h for Group A was significantly higher than Groups B and C (P &# 60; 0. 05); Sufentanil administration during surgery: Group C was obviously lower compared to Groups A and B (P &# 60; 0. 05); 24 h satisfaction score: Groups B and C were higher than Group A (P &# 60; 0. 05). Conclusion Preoperative administration of intravenous Flurbiprofen axetil reduced analgesic consumption during surgery, but not postoperative pain scores. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> for mandibular third molar surgery by, reviewing of randomized controlled trials. In many of the studies, the preemptive use of NSAIDs before, tooth extraction demonstrated that the postoperative pain was better controlled beyond the expected, effect time, compared without such preemptive use. On the other hand, some studies reported that, compared to the administration before removal of the tooth, postoperative administration was, associated with better suppression of postoperative pain. This suggests that in postoperative pain after, removal of mandibular third molars, peripheral sensitization caused by reactive inflammation, following the tooth extraction and secondary central sensitization are more important factors than, direct central sensitization caused by surgical tissue damage. Accordingly, when a mandibular third, molar is removed, central sensitization due to tissue damage should be suppressed by, preadministration of analgesics. In order then to suppress postoperative peripheral sensitization, the, readministration of analgesics is considered more effective. Furthermore, although acid NSAIDs are, effective analgesics, the associated adverse events are of concern. Accordingly, acetaminophen (1000  mg), which, is devoid of anti-inflammatory effects but is a weak cyclooxygenase inhibitor, can be used for, <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> administration...|$|E

40|$|Background: Most {{studies of}} <b>preemptive</b> or {{preventive}} <b>analgesia</b> restrict outcomes to pain and analgesic {{consumption in the}} acute postoperative period. The potential longer-term effects on these and other domains of functioning have received little empirical attention. The {{purpose of this study}} was to follow up patients who had received general anesthesia plus epidural fentanyl and lidocaine before (group 1) or after (group 2) incision or general anesthesia plus a sham epidural (group 3). Methods: Patients were contacted approximately 3 weeks and 6 months after surgery. A follow-up pain questionnaire and the McGill Pain Questionnaire were administered by telephone. The Mental Health Inventory and Pain Disability Index were mailed to patients, completed, and mailed back. Results: One hundred thirty-one of the 141 patients (93 %) were reached 3 weeks after surgery (n = 41, n = 48, and n = 42 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively), and 109 (77 %) were reached at 6 months (n = 35, n = 37, and n = 37 in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that that even after controlling for age and presence or absence of preoperative pain, Pain Disability Index scores (mean ± SD) at the first follow-up were significantly lower in group 1 (17. 3 ± 12. 8) and group 2 (18. 1 ± 17. 0) compared with group 3 (26. 3 ± 18. 3). McGill Pain Questionnaire and Mental Health Inventory scores did not differ significantly among the groups. There were no significant differences at the 6 -month follow-up. Conclusion: The short-term beneficial effects of preventive epidural analgesia translated into less pain disability 3 weeks after surgery. Progress in understanding the processes involved in postsurgical recovery and the risk factors for chronic postsurgical pain would be aided by baseline and postsurgical measures of relevant psychological, emotional, and physical variables...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesLiterature on <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> is controversial. Reliability {{of results}} and {{difficult}} reproducibility of research contribute for non-elucidation of the subject. The {{aim of this}} study is to test the efficacy of oral ketoprofen (150 mg) preemptively administrated two days before third molar surgery, compared with postoperative administration in the same patient. MethodsThirteen patients underwent surgical removal of bilateral third molar in two separate procedures. In a random and double blind procedure, oral ketoprofen 150 mg was administered every 12 hours two days before surgery and, after the procedure, the same drug was administered for three days. On the other side, a control (placebo) was used orally every 12 hours two days before surgery and, after the procedure, ketoprofen 150 mg was administered every 12 hours for three days. Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analogue scale, nominal scale, and amount of rescue analgesics consumed. ResultsThere was no statistically significant difference in postoperative pain between the preemptive treatment and control. ConclusionIn this experimental model, <b>preemptive</b> <b>analgesia</b> was not effective in reducing postoperative pain in surgical extraction of third molar compared with the postoperative administration of the same drug...|$|E
