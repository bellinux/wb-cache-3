50|$|Control is {{an issue}} with jigsaws. The blades are small, weak and entirely {{unsupported}} at the lower end. Good cut control requires the presence of blade rollers, which keep the blade aligned just above the sole plate.

To guide a jigsaw on curved cut, it must be steered (turned) and not forced to move sideways. The usage of sharp blades is important as well to get high quality cuts.|$|R

5000|$|In 1963, the American Company, Ingersoll Milling Machine Co. in Rockford, Illinois, {{developed}} the first carbide <b>plate</b> <b>saw</b> {{that was used}} to cut steel plates with carbide tipped circular saw blades. The positive cutting angle of the teeth minimized the life of the tool.Between 1963 and 1969, professor Pahlitzsch and engineers Arno Willemeit and Horst Doepcke at the University of Braunschweig, developed new carbide tip geometry with a negative cutting angle and a pair of teeth which split the chip into three parts. With this development in tip geometry it became economical to saw alloy steel billets.In 1969, Advanced Machine & Engineering Co.

AME began to build these machines for the company Metalcut Inc., another Rockford based company.The machine was sold on the global market under the name Metalcut 12 and was exhibited at trade shows in Milan, Italy and Chicago. Its cutting efficiency was eight times faster than band saws and four times faster than HSS circular cold saws and revolutionized the production sawing market.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of annular discs is important, as several machine components such as flywheels, clutch <b>plates,</b> circular <b>saw</b> <b>plates</b> etc. {{can be considered as}} annular discs for the purpose of analysis. The work presented in this paper is a modal analysis of annular disc structure by using finite element analysis software (ANSYS). Natural frequencies and maximum deformation of structure of three different materials are used for comparative {{study of the}} variation in characteristics of the structure for various ratios of inner to outer radius conditions. It is found that as aspect ratio approaches to unity (one) natural frequency approaches to its maximum value. Also the natural frequencies and deformation increases with increasing number of nodal diameters. Based on the results of finite element analysis of the three materials it is compared and concluded that the Nimonic 90 disc exhibits good behavior in case of natural frequencies and MP 35 N disc exhibits good behavior in case of deformation as the deformation is less in this compared to the other two materials...|$|R
