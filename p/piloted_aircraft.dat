40|$|A six {{degree of}} freedom, fixed base {{simulation}} {{study of the}} use of a flight director by general aviation pilots in an instrument landing system approach was conducted. An autopilot command law was used to drive the flight director needles. Time histories of the <b>pilot</b> <b>aircraft</b> display system responses and standard deviations and means of the glide slope and localizer errors were obtained. The <b>pilot</b> <b>aircraft</b> display system responses with the flight director were very similar to the autopilot aircraft responses. Without the flight director, the <b>pilot</b> <b>aircraft</b> display system exhibited less damping than with the flight director. The sensitivity of the flight director command laws was judged to be about as high as it could be by the test subjects. Thus, further improvement in the <b>pilot</b> <b>aircraft</b> display system performance by increasing the gains in the command laws was precluded...|$|R

Aircraft {{produced}} during this time included the CAC Sabre jet fighter, GAF Jindivik remotely <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and Nomad civil aircraft. Under the ASTA banner, engines for the Dassault Mirage III jet fighters were produced, as well as assembly of the F/A-18 multirole combat aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).|$|E

Because offensive uses of the Predator are classified by the US, U.S. military officials have reported an appreciation for the intelligence and reconnaissance-gathering abilities of RPAs but declined to publicly discuss their offensive use.|$|E

25|$|The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator is an American {{remotely}} <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft</b> (RPA) {{built by}} General Atomics and used {{primarily by the}} United States Air Force (USAF) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Initially conceived in the early 1990s for aerial reconnaissance and forward observation roles, the Predator carries cameras and other sensors but has been modified and upgraded to carry and fire two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or other munitions. The aircraft, in use since 1995, has seen combat in war in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the NATO intervention in Bosnia, Serbia, Iraq War, Yemen, Libyan civil war, the intervention in Syria, and Somalia.|$|E
25|$|After major {{modifications}} and upgrades, including {{installation of a}} two-stage turbocharger in place of its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status {{in the summer of}} 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major Level 2 performance milestones within NASA's ERAST program: to fly a gasoline-fueled, piston-engine remotely <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft</b> for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission.|$|E
25|$|The {{target market}} is the U.S. Air National Guard and foreign nations that cannot afford the F-35, but want an {{aircraft}} to perform ISR and light attack missions better than turboprop planes. Buying and sustaining the Scorpion would cost less than A-10 or F-16 upgrades. For air patrol, the Scorpion requires radar and the capability of supersonic flight, similar to the unsuccessful 1980s-era Northrop F-20 Tigershark. The market for light fixed-wing attack jets had declined in the 1980s as richer countries opted for more capable aircraft and poorer countries pursued turboprops and attack helicopters. It is uncertain if the Scorpion will be cheaper or outperform turboprops or remotely <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft</b> (RPA) in terms of range, endurance, low-altitude performance, and sensors.|$|E

40|$|A {{pilot model}} {{analysis}} was performed that relates pilot control compensation, <b>pilot</b> <b>aircraft</b> system response, and aircraft response characteristics for longitudinal control. The results show that a higher aircraft short period frequency is required to achieve superior <b>pilot</b> <b>aircraft</b> system response in an altitude control task than is required in an attitude control task. These results were confirmed by a simulation study of target tracking. It was concluded that the pilot model analysis provides a theoretical basis for determining the effect of control task on pilot opinions...|$|R

25|$|The Israeli Air Force will {{purchase}} {{as many as}} 100 F-35 Lightning II {{fighter jets}} from the United States. The aircraft will be modified and designated F-35I. They will use Israeli-built electronic warfare systems, outer-wings, guided bombs, and air-to-air missiles. As part of a 2013 arms deal, the IAF will purchase KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft and V-22 Osprey multi-mission aircraft from the United States, as well as advanced radars for warplanes and missiles designed to take out radars. In April 2013, an Israeli official stated that within 40–50 years, <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft</b> would be phased out of service by unmanned aerial vehicles capable of executing nearly any operation that can be performed by piloted combat aircraft. Israel's military industries are reportedly {{on the path to}} developing such technology in a few decades. Israel will also manufacture tactical satellites for military use.|$|E
25|$|Following on {{from the}} Delta 1, the Ministry of Supply {{requested}} that Fairey conduct a further model programme {{for the purpose of}} transonic investigations. However, Fairey did not find this proposal attractive, believing that a <b>piloted</b> <b>aircraft</b> would be mandatory if the project was to produce any worthwhile data. Fairey commenced work on a highly swept twin-engine aircraft; however, the Ministry lacked enthusiasm for the twin-engine configuration, largely due to an existing rival project underway to produce a twin-engine supersonic aircraft - this would become the English Electric Lightning. In February 1949, it was suggested that Fairey examine the prospects for a single-engine transonic aircraft as an alternative; {{by the end of the}} year, the company had produced their new project, out of which the Fairey Delta 2 (FD2) would directly originate. Accordingly, the Ministry issued Air Ministry Specification ER.103 for the project, ordering that a pair of prototype aircraft be produced.|$|E
