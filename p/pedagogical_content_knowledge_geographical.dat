A crucial aspect of teachers' competence is their subject-specific professional knowledge – entailing both <b>content</b> and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> (Kunter et al., 2013). <b>Content</b> <b>knowledge</b> involves conceptual knowledge (i. e., knowledge of concepts, including principles and definitions) as well as procedural knowledge (i. e., knowledge of procedures, including action sequences and algorithms used in problem solving). <b>Pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> refers to knowledge of the subject matter for the purpose of teaching (Shulman, 1986). The symposium addresses teachers' <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> in mathematics, and how these types of knowledge relate to teachers' competence to teach mathematics. The objectives of the symposium are threefold. First, it aims at presenting valid instruments to assess teachers' <b>content</b> and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> (Depaepe, Lemonidis, Lindmeier, Troebst), as well as methodological sound instruments to capture teachers' subject-specific competence, in a more enacted way and in close relation to real-life teaching demands (Lindmeier). Second, it aims to disentangle the development of teachers' <b>content</b> and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> through an ascertaining cross-sectional study of in-service teachers', pre-service teachers', and school students' <b>content</b> and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> (Depaepe) as well as through an experimental study on the role of prior professional knowledge for the development of <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> (Troebst).

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{educational}} reform, investigating teachers’ <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> has implications for many involved in education, from policy makers and curriculum designers to those in teacher education. This thesis proposed a model, designed by the researcher, used to examine Shulman’s (1986) theory of <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In particular, it addressed primary teachers’ <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> required for teaching measurement. By examining teachers’ mathematics <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{a greater understanding of}} teachers’ professional knowledge was gained enabling improvement of teacher quality, by being able to identify more clearly individual teacher’s needs for professional development. This study addressed four specific research questions. How evident is the teacher’s depth of mathematical knowledge of measurement within their teaching? How do teachers show that they understand and address the needs of students when teaching? How to teachers demonstrate their general pedagogical knowledge when teaching? How is a teacher’s knowledge and practice impacted by other factors when teaching and what are these major factors? A qualitative research model was used in which four teachers of Years Three and Four participated, providing four individual case studies. Each teacher was interviewed at the commencement of the study, was observed and recorded throughout their teaching of a sequence of measurement lessons, interviewed prior to and following each lesson, and finally responded to a reflective questionnaire two weeks after the sequence of lessons had concluded. Due to the extensive nature of the data, a series of vignettes was written, based upon identified teaching episodes, significant to addressing the research questions. These vignettes contributed to the cross case analysis (Yin, 2010), along with the other data. The study found that the teachers’ knowledge varied considerably in each of the areas of knowledge of teaching, knowledge of students and knowledge of mathematics. Consequently, the teachers were rated differently in relation to their <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge,</b> ranging from very weak to strong. These differences were examined in terms of the model, providing evidence that the model effectively explained variations in teachers’ <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Factors such as self-efficacy, teacher beliefs and the culture of the school were also shown to influence each teacher’s <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The model was shown to be dynamic and it clearly identified how and why <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> varied from one teacher to another. This study has shown that the model used to represent <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> demonstrated theoretical, methodological and diagnostic value. This study concludes with a discussion of implications for policy and practice at system level and for teacher education courses for preservice teachers. The findings of this study provide further understanding of teacher <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge,</b> which is an essential step towards improving teacher quality and teaching practice. The evidence suggests that this model could be used for further research into <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> beyond the teaching of measurement...|$|R

Pedagogical literacy is a reflexive concept in which reading and writing (through a knowledge-transforming model) about <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> is the essential means through which the teacher's pedagogical reasoning develops...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> of secondary school teachers. A total of 254 math-ematics school teachers from various secondary schools in Negeri Sembilan were randomly selected to participate in the study. A set of multiple choice questions were given to teachers during the data collection process. The questions were developed by the researcher. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to validate the instrument. A good model fit was found for measurement model of <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> using several fit index tests including CMINDF, GFI, CFI, TLI, and RMSEA. The findings revealed that the subject <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> and knowledge of students has a stronger covariance value than the subject <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> and knowledge of pedagogy and a stronger covariance between knowledge of students and knowledge of pedagogy. Teachers should be able to recognize their type of <b>knowledge,</b> particu-larly <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> to transfer their knowledge effectively to the students...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine a preservice {{mathematics}} teacher’s weaknesses in her <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the concept of function when she taught an episode on exponential functions to a group of high school students. During her planning and teaching of a lesson to the group of high school students, I observed the results of her lack of teaching experience and incomplete <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> on her <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The results of her teaching experience showed the preservice secondary teacher had misconceptions and during her teaching she passed on these misconceptions to her students...|$|R

40|$|Resulting in the {{development}} of a framework labelled Literary <b>Pedagogical</b> <b>Content</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (LPCK), this thesis aimed to describe the complex interplay of three components in primary school classrooms: content, pedagogy, and children's literature. A case study research design elicited descriptive evidence of nine teachers' understandings of the teaching of children's literature, recognising that teacher knowledge bases involve complex, situated knowledge. The thesis, underpinned by constructivism and through the use of semi-structured interviews, built on Shulman's formulation of <b>Pedagogical</b> <b>Content</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (PCK) by considering teachers' alignment with Literary Theory...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in teachers’ knowledge for teaching mathematics for {{nearly a quarter of}} a century, little {{attention has been paid to}} the knowledge of mathematics teacher educators. The responses of 57 MERGA members to an online survey addressing beliefs about mathematics and its teaching, mathematics <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> and mathematics <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> are reported. Teacher educators found the items addressing <b>pedagogical</b> <b>content</b> <b>knowledge</b> more difficult than mathematics content questions or endorsing beliefs, and the type of employment appeared to be a more important influence on outcomes than the level of mathematics studied...|$|R
