50|$|Harmony Flats was {{originally}} established {{to preserve a}} habitat for the rare and declining Geometric Tortoise (<b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus).</b> This tortoise is now unfortunately locally extinct, but the reserve still protects about 220 species of plant (many of them endangered) {{as well as a}} range of animal species, such as the tiny Parrot-beaked tortoise (Homopus areolatus), various snakes and a large variety of birds. This {{is one of the few}} remaining spots of the critically endangered vegetation type “Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos”.Local volunteers and community organisations are now heavily involved in protecting and managing the reserve.|$|R
50|$|The {{diminutive}} Geometric Tortoise (<b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus)</b> {{is one of}} the world's {{most beautiful}} chelonians with its domed carapace and stunning egg-yolk and black radiating pattern. It is the Fabergé Egg of the tortoise world. Fully grown, it reaches only five to six inches. In South Africa, the Turtle Conservancy, along with its partner organizations, has purchased over 1,000 acres of the last remaining habitat for this critically endangered tortoise, which we are calling the Geometric Tortoise Preserve. We need to preserve this critical habitat to save this beautiful tortoise from extinction.|$|R

40|$|The {{geometric}} tortoise <b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus,</b> {{found in the}} Western Cape, {{is one of the}} world's rarest tortoises. The cryptic colouration and sedentary behaviour of the {{geometric tortoise}} causes problems when conducting counts using standard capture-recapture methods. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the detection probability of a geometric tortoise in the field on a purely experimental basis. Plaster of Paris tortoise models were placed in predetermined transects in the natural habitat. Observes surveyed these transects for the tortoise models. Three group and two individual experiments were conducted. These experiments suggest that a large percentage of geometric tortoises are not found during a census. In individual experiments no observer detected more than 50 % of the models, but in some cases this percentage was slightly higher in group experiments. The effect of the size of the tortoise, density of the habitat, level of experience and searching ability of the observers are discussed. Estimates of the various detection probabilities are derived and suggestions made for conducting tortoise counts. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Food and non-food plant {{characteristics}} were studied for the geometric tortoise, <b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus,</b> {{to test the}} hypothesis that feeding preferences in tortoises may be influenced by the mechanical properties of plant leaves. Twelve focal feeding observations made between 8 October and 31 October 2002 were synthesized with literature reports to develop species lists of food and non-food grasses and geophytes in renosterveld habitat. Failure load and tensile strength were determined in the field for leaves of food and non-food plants that were spatially available to the tortoises and present in relative abundance {{during the course of the}} study. Leaves of geophyte food plants were fleshy and succulent with a low failure load and tensile strength. Leaves of food plant grasses had significantly higher failure loads and tensile strengths compared to leaves of food plant geophytes. In non-food plants there was no significant difference in failure load between grasses and geophytes, but tensile strength was significantly higher in the grasses. Non-food plant grasses and geophytes overall had significantly higher failure load and tensile strength values than did food plants. Two non-food plants that overlapped in mechanical strength to the food plants either have toxic/unpalatable chemicals in high amounts or are recent invasive species to the renosterveld. Thus, these studies support the hypothesis that leaf biomechanical properties may be an important factor in determining the diet of the geometric tortoise and perhaps tortoises in general.     </span...|$|R
40|$|To help assess habitat {{requirements}} of Critically Endangered geometric tortoises, we used thread-trailing to measure daily activity, movements and refugia of adult <b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus</b> in autumn and spring 2002. We found strong differences between seasons, {{and effects of}} weather, individuals and sex. The high activity was consistent with mild weather during autumn and spring. However, daily temperatures limited female movements on cool autumn days and male movements on warm spring days, a pattern consistent with sexual size dimorphism (large females and small males). The long movements in autumn probably helped tortoises find food plants that grow quickly after autumn rains; both sexes recover body condition from autumn lows, and females begin egg production in late-autumn and winter. These movements may also help males mate with females before they ovulate. The high activity of females in spring should help them forage and sustain their vitellogenesis, egg production and nesting in spring. Male paths {{tended to be more}} linear than female paths in both seasons, so this sexual difference is likely not linked to food consumption. Males may move long, linear paths to engage females and avoid other males. Males may have been thermally-challenged in spring. Their movements decreased with increased ground temperatures (in the sun), they used denser refugia in spring than in autumn, and in spring used denser refugia than females used. Geometric tortoises typically used different refugia on consecutive nights, a type of predator avoidance mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology) - MSc (Biodiv and Cons Biol) The {{geometric}} tortoise {{is one of}} the world‟s rarest terrestrial tortoises and is endemic to the Southwestern Cape, South Africa. There has been cause for conservation concern for <b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus,</b> yet as is common for many species, quantitative physiological research has been lacking. Considering the important role of red blood cells in oxygen circulation, and the role of white blood cells in immune resistance, blood profiles have been used across taxa as a reliable indicator of health status and physiological processes. Forming part of a larger chelonian conservation programme in South Africa, I studied the haematological changes in P. geometricus, to better understand their physiological responses to changes in climatic conditions. Sampled peripheral blood from males, females and juveniles of the largest known wild {{geometric tortoise}} population over four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) from August 2000 to June 2001. Blood samples were used to make smears and determine red cell count (RCC), packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobi concentration (Hb), red cell indices and differential white cell counts. Digital imaging analysis was used for the histological evaluation of stained blood smears, including descriptions of red and white blood cell morphologies, as well as erythrocyte developmental stages. In the cooler periods, geometric tortoises showed low Hb and mean cell haemoglobin concentration values. Erythrocytes were larger and rounder in winter and spring, which were likely due to hydration states. In addition, increased numbers of immature erythrocytes in circulation suggested an erythropoietic response in winter and spring. This regenerative response is common in reptiles emerging from periods of limited activity and is associated with increasing primary production following rainfall events. In the following summer and autumn, increased mean cell haemoglobin concentrations suggested elevated metabolic rates influenced by rising temperatures. This would seem pertinent to meet the extra physical demands associated with foraging effort in the season characterised with limited water and food supply, and mating behaviour, which occurs in the summer. Low body conditions across all cohorts provided evidence for nutrition stress, while erythrocyte size, shape and degenerative responses indicated dehydration stress. Physiological responses to seasonal influences are specific to growth or reproductive demands and differed for each cohort. Males experienced increased Hb, PCV, RCC, and erythrocyte sizes in summer and autumn, which relate to the erythropoieticstimulating effects of androgens. Female erythropoietic cycles in spring accommodate the increased metabolic demands of increased foraging needed for a larger body size and egg production, and again in autumn again for vitellogenesis. Juvenile tortoises showed minimal differences, and could indicate species-specific responses to environmental changes. A spring-related erythropoiesis was observed in juveniles while during summer and autumn, juveniles showed less evidence for dehydration stress than in adults. No haemoparasites were observed in peripheral blood. Seven leukocyte types were identified and included heterophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes and azurophils, in addition to thrombocytes. Heterophils were the most abundant leukocyte, followed by lymphocytes and eosinophils while monocytes and basophils were equally low; plasma cells and azurophils were rare. Heterophil counts were higher in spring than in summer and autumn, and in summer, were more abundant in females than in juveniles. Eosinophil counts were low in spring for all cohorts, and additionally, female and juvenile counts were low in summer. Eosinophils in juveniles were significantly lower than in adults in winter and spring. Lymphocyte numbers increased in autumn for all cohorts, while summer counts were higher in juveniles than in adults. Basophils and monocytes showed minimal seasonal changes, although basophil counts in females in winter tended to be high. Thrombocytes were lowest in spring for all cohorts. Understanding the physiological responses associated with seasonal changes and for each cohort is critical for effective chelonian conservation management.

40|$|Magister Scientiae (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology) Due to the {{critical}} status of <b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus</b> and the vulnerability of their habitat, {{there is a need}} to allocate areas for their protection. The aim of this study was to provide information on the space requirements and activity level of geometric tortoises to facilitate future conservation efforts. The thread-and-spool method was used to compare short-term movements, habitat utilisation, and activity patterns of male and female tortoises over 15 and 20 days respectively, in autumn and spring. Through radiotelemetry, the long-term movements of 10 male and 11 female tortoises were evaluated from April 2002 to April 2003. Locality data for the short-term and long-term studies were used to calculate the size of activity areas and home ranges as minimum convex polygons and fixed kernel estimates. Male and female geometric tortoises were active throughout the year, and maintained a high level of activity in autumn and in spring. However, females were more active than males were in spring. Females may require more resources, particularly food, in spring when they produce eggs. Although males and females travelled similar distances in autumn and in spring, males displaced further than females displaced in both seasons. The movement path for males was often linear, perhaps because this path may enhance their opportunities to encounter females. Geometric tortoise males were substantially smaller than females, which may explain why the distances that males moved and displaced in spring were negatively correlated to environmental temperature. In autumn, when temperatures were lower than in spring, the distance travelled by males was not correlated to temperature. However, in autumn female displacement showed a positive correlation with environmental temperature. Geometric tortoises showed large inter-individual variation in home range size, which may contribute to the fact that home range size did not differ among the three different habitat types: mature renosterveld, burned renosterveld and the old agricultural fields. Average home range size was 11. 5 ha for 95 % fixed kernel estimates, and 7. 0 ha for minimum convex polygon estimates. Body size influenced the home range size of female geometric tortoises, but had no effect on the home range size of male tortoises. Females had larger home ranges than male tortoises had, possibly because females were larger, but reproductive requirements of females may have played a role. During the dry season, home range size increased when compared to the wet season. The larger home range during the dry season, which is associated with high temperatures, may be related to a reduction in resource availability. The fewer resources available, the greater the distance the tortoises would need to travel in order to acquire the necessary resources. The small home range in the wet season may indicate an abundance of resources, but it may also be that large pools of standing water restrict the movements of tortoises. Understanding the spatial and habitat requirements of P. geometricus will help to assess the viability of populations in disturbed and highly fragmented areas, and contribute to the conservation efforts for this endangered species.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhD (Biodiversity and Conservation Biology) Southern Africa {{harbours}} {{one-third of}} the world's Testudinid species, many of which inhabit arid or semi-arid areas, but ecological information on these species is scant. I studied the habitat, morphology and ecology of Kalahari tent tortoises over 13 months in semi-arid Savanna at Benfontein farm, Northern Cape Province, South Africa. In order to allow continuous monitoring of individuals, I attached radiotransmitters to males and females, split equally between two habitats, sites E (east) and W (west), with apparent differences in vegetation structure. Results {{of the study were}} based on data obtained from 27 telemetered tortoises and 161 individuals encountered opportunistically. Female Kalahari tent tortoises were larger than males and the sex ratio did not differ from 1 : 1. Based on person-hours to capture tortoises, the population appeared to have a low density, with more time required to capture a juvenile (35 hours) than an adult (10 - 11 hours). The frequency distribution of body size ranges was indicative of recruitment. Relative age, based on annuli counts, suggested that males were younger than females, perhaps because males as the smaller sex are more predation-prone than females. Linear relationships between annuli counts and shell volume indicated that, after reaching sexual maturity, female body size increased faster in volume than did male body size, possibly because a larger volume may enhance female reproductive success. Body condition differed between sites, sexes and among seasons. The hot and dry summer may account for low summer body condition, whereas vegetation differences and size effects, respectively, may account for the low body condition of tortoises in site W and in males. Site E was sandy with grasses, particularly Schmidtia pappophoroides, being the prevalent growth form. This habitat resembled a Savanna vegetation type Schmidtia pappophoroides – Acacia erioloba described for a neighbouring reserve. Site W was stonier, dominated by shrubs, and was reminiscent of Northern Upper Karoo vegetation (NKu 3). Neither site resembled Kimberley Thornveld (SVk 4), the designated vegetation type of the area. Differences in substrate and grazing intensity may have contributed to site vegetation differences. Rainfall had an important influence on seasonal vegetation. Short grass abundance correlated with rainfall and annual plants sprouted after spring rain. Refuge use changed according to season and sex. Males selected denser refuges than females did, perhaps because males were smaller and more vulnerable to predation and solar heat. Tortoises selected sparse, short grass as refuges in cool months, probably to maximise basking whilst remaining in protective cover. During hot periods, mammal burrows were preferred to vegetation as refugia. The smaller males spent more time in cover than females, which may be related to predator avoidance or thermoregulation. Females spent more time basking than males, perhaps due to their larger size and to facilitate reproductive processes. Tortoises did not brumate, but through a combination of basking, and orientation relative to the sun in their refuges, managed to attain body temperatures that allowed small bouts of activity. Body temperature for active tortoises was similar among seasons, and was higher for more specialised active behaviours, such as feeding and socialising, than for walking. Increased activity by males in spring could relate to mating behaviour while females were more active in autumn, when they foraged more than males, perhaps due to the high cost of seasonal reproductive requirements. Males displaced further per day than did females, but home range estimates did not differ between sexes. Annual home range estimates varied substantially among individuals: 0. 7 – 306 ha for minimum convex polygons and 0. 7 – 181 ha for 95 % fixed kernel estimates. The ability to cover large areas would assist tortoises in finding resources, e. g., food, in an area where resource distribution may be patchy. Differences among seasonal home ranges and movements probably reflect seasonal climatic change; activity areas shrinking when temperatures were extreme. In order to assess the effects of a semi-arid environment on the morphology of P. oculifer, I compared its morphology to that of its ‘cool-adapted’ sister taxon <b>Psammobates</b> <b>geometricus,</b> using live and museum specimens. Both P. oculifer and P. geometricus are sexually dimorphic and differences between the two species could indicate environmental or sexual selection effects, or a combination of the two. The shorter bridge length, which allowed more leg space, and wider front feet in P. oculifer cohorts probably represent traits for manoeuvring in a sandy habitat, while wider heads in P. oculifer possibly relate to interspecific differences in diet. The flatter shell in female P. oculifer, relative to P. geometricus, may represent a trade-off between space for reproductive structures, e. g., eggs, and the need to fit into small refuges, e. g., mammal burrows. Male P. oculifer had wider shells, more space around their hind legs, and wider hind feet than P. geometricus males had, all characteristics which may assist males to fight and mate in a sandy environment.
