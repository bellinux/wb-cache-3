50|$|The {{international}} standard ISO 9283 sets different performance criteria for industrial robots and suggests test procedures {{in order to}} obtain appropriate parameter values. The most important criteria, and also the most commonly used, are pose accuracy (AP) and <b>pose</b> <b>repeatability</b> (RP). Repeatability is particularly important when the robot is moved towards the command positions manually ("Teach-In"). If the robot program is generated by a 3D simulation (off-line programming), absolute accuracy is vital, too. Both are generally influenced in a negative way by kinematic factors. Here especially the joint offsets and deviations in lengths and angles between the individual robot links take effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at an issue of {{assessment}} of performance criteria of manipulating industrial robots with focusing on positioning performance. There are presented: the testing of one-directional <b>pose</b> accuracy and <b>repeatability</b> on Robot Fanuc LR Mate 200 iC within the Laboratory of the Department of Automation and Production Systems and processing of the measured data. The laser interferometer Renishaw and digital indicator Mitutoyo Digimatic were used for performing the testing experiments...|$|R
40|$|With seismic {{interferometry}} or {{the virtual}} source method, controlled sources can be redatumed from the Earthâ€™s surface to generate so-called virtual sources at downhole receiver locations. Generally {{this is done}} by crosscorrelation of the recorded down-hole data and stacking over source locations. By studying the retrieved data at zero time lag, downhole illumination conditions that determine the virtual source radi- ation pattern can be analyzed without a velocity model. This can be beneficial for survey planning in time-lapse experiments. Moreover, the virtual source radiation pattern can be corrected by multidimensional deconvolution or directional balancing. Such an approach can help to improve virtual source <b>repeatability,</b> <b>posing</b> major advantages for reservoir monitoring. An algorithm is proposed for so-called illumination balancing (being closely related to directional balancing). It {{can be applied to}} single-component receiver arrays with limited aperture below a strongly heterogeneous overburden. The algorithm is demonstrated on synthetic 3 D elastic data to retrieve time-lapse amplitude attributes. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Designing {{self-healing}} into cementitious {{materials can}} {{open a new}} world of opportunities for resilient concrete infrastructure under service loading conditions. The self-healing process should be robust as well as repeatable, allowing for self-repair after multiple damage events. The <b>repeatability</b> <b>poses</b> great challenges when self-healing strategies mainly rely on the formation of low-strength calcium carbonate healing product, complicated by the localized cracking behavior of cementitious materials. This study aims at formulating a new cementitious material system with designed physical and chemical characteristics that favour repeatable self-healing. Advanced experimental methods, coupled with micromechanics theory, are adopted to probe and design repeatable self-healing into cementitious materials. This study aims at formulating a new cementitious material system with designed physical and chemical characteristics that favor repeatable self-healing. This is achieved by answering fundamental questions such as what is the dominating self-healing mechanism within a crack, how do self-healing products grow, {{and what are the}} physical and chemical variables that influence the self-healing mechanism under certain environmental exposure conditions. Advanced experimental methods, coupled with micromechanics theory, are adopted to probe and design repeatable self-healing into cementitious materials...|$|R
40|$|Low {{back pain}} is a {{significant}} problem in the industrialised world and its associated cost is enormous. Diagnosis of the underlying causes can be extremely difficult. Since mechanical factors often play an important role, it {{can be helpful in}} studying the motion of the spine. Traditional radiographic methods of obtaining spine images suffer from high radiation dosage and can only yield a limited number of images. Thus, digital videofluoroscopy was introduced. This can provide sequences with many image frames, but the images obtained often suffer due to noise and very low radiation dosage. Thus determining vertebrae position within the image sequence presents a considerable challenge. There have been many studies aimed at vertebral image extraction, varying from manually locating the vertebral landmarks to template matching. However, the former method <b>poses</b> problems of <b>repeatability</b> that can cause errors in kinematic analysis, while the latter cannot cope with occlusion and out-of-plane motion. In this paper, we show how the Hough transform can be used to solve this problem. Here, Fourier descriptors were used to describe the vertebral body shape and were incorporated within our Hough transform algorithm from which we can obtain affine transform parameters, i. e. scale, rotation and center position. The method has been applied to images of a calibration model and to images from a sequence of a moving human lumbar spine. The results show promise and potential for object extraction from poor quality images and that models of spinal movement can indeed be derived for clinical application...|$|R
