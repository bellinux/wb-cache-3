5|$|In {{recent years}} {{germanium}} has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In sterling silver alloys, for instance, it reduces firescale, increases tarnish resistance, and improves <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening.</b> A tarnish-proof silver alloy trademarked Argentium contains 1.2% germanium.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening.</b> These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|E

Results show that there is a strong relationship between the acousto-elastic constants and the yield strength and hardness.

25|$|As {{for many}} of the {{aluminium}} alloys, Yalloy age hardens spontaneously at normal temperatures after solution heat treating. In contrast, R.R. alloys remain soft afterwards, until deliberately heat treated again by <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> for artificial ageing. This simplifies their machining in the soft state, particularly where component blanks are made by a subcontractor and must be shipped to another site before machining. For R.R.56 the solution treatment is to quench from 530°C and ageing is carried out at 175°C. For R.R.50, the solution treatment may be omitted and the metal taken directly to <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> (155°C-170°C).|$|E
25|$|Some metals may {{be forged}} cold, but {{iron and steel}} are almost always hot forged. Hot forging {{prevents}} the work hardening that would result from cold forging, which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece. Also, while work hardening may be desirable in some circumstances, other methods of hardening the piece, such as heat treating, are generally more economical and more controllable. Alloys that are amenable to <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening,</b> such as most aluminium alloys and titanium, can be hot forged, followed by hardening.|$|E
2500|$|Metals can be {{heat treated}} {{to alter the}} {{properties}} of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion. [...] Common heat treatment processes include annealing, <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening,</b> quenching, and tempering. [...] The annealing process softens the metal by allowing recovery of cold work and grain growth. [...] Quenching {{can be used to}} harden alloy steels, or in precipitation hardenable alloys, to trap dissolved solute atoms in solution. [...] Tempering will cause the dissolved alloying elements to precipitate, {{or in the case of}} quenched steels, improve impact strength and ductile properties.|$|E
