5|$|In his plebe (first) year at West Point, Patton {{adjusted}} {{easily to}} the routine. However, his academic performance was so <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> {{he was forced}} to repeat his first year after failing mathematics. Patton excelled at military drills though his academic performance remained average. He was cadet sergeant major his junior year, and cadet adjutant his senior year. He also joined the football team but injured his arm and ceased playing on several occasions, instead trying out for the sword team and track and field, quickly becoming one of the best swordsmen at the academy. Ranked 46 out of 103, Patton graduated from West Point on June 11, 1909 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Like {{others of}} the Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! explores {{the actions of a}} small insular group facing and {{overcoming}} a more powerful opponent. It was filmed on the island of Barra; the weather was so <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> the production over-ran its 10-week schedule by five weeks, and the film went £20,000 over budget. The initial cut of the film was considered poor by Michael Balcon, the head of the studio, so one of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage and re-edited the film prior to its release.|$|E

Philadelphia secured its berth in the final by defeating the Harrisburg City Islanders, the New York Cosmos, the New England Revolution, and FC Dallas. Seattle's road to the final included victories over PSA Elite, the San Jose Earthquakes, the Portland Timbers, and the Chicago Fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} largely {{accepted her}} proposal. The Charity School Spelling Book was printed first {{and was the}} most widely used. It {{was one of the}} first children's books for the <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> was small but still had large type and large margins (features often considered appropriate only for books for more privileged readers). The stories themselves were also innovative: they emphasized the ordinary lives of ordinary children—"these children climbed trees, played with fire, threw cricket bats at sheep and begged in the streets". The book was adopted by Andrew Bell around 1800 for his Madras system of education and by various educational societies throughout Britain and its colonies; it was even used to educate adult slaves in Antigua and Jamaica.|$|E

5|$|Ajax {{opened the}} scoring {{in the third}} minute when Cees de Wolf, who was making his debut for Ajax, scored. A throw-in by Cruyff was headed into the air, Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came to collect the ball. Realising he could not reach it, he moved back towards his goal, but de Wolf outjumped defender Chris Lawler to head {{the ball into the}} Liverpool goal. The {{conditions}} were so <b>poor,</b> <b>that</b> the crowd celebrated in stages. Those closest to the goal celebrated immediately, while those {{at the other end of}} the stadium reacted to these celebrations. Liverpool striker Hunt had a chance to score in the 12th minute, but his shot was saved by Ajax goalkeeper Gert Bals. Following the goal Ajax continued to attack, midfielder Sjaak Swart ran past three Liverpool players before passing the ball to Klaas Nuninga, whose shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Lawrence. However, Lawrence dropped the ball near Johan Cruyff, who scored to give Ajax a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's health {{problems}} {{kept him from}} military service. In 1939, he met actor Pierre Fresnay, who was already an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay's only directorial feature Le Duel, {{as well as two}} plays for him: On prend les mêmes, which was performed in December 1940, and Comédie en trois actes, which was performed in 1942. Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf, who declined to purchase them. After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation of France during World War II, the German-operated film production company Continental Films was established in France in October 1940. Alfred Grevin, the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas-André Steeman. Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Grevin's offer. Clouzot's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman's mystery novel Six hommes mort (Six Dead Men). Clouzot retitled the film Le Dernier des six, having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.|$|E

5|$|In Caernarfon's {{case the}} walls of the town and castle {{remained}} in good condition, while features which required maintenancesuch as roofswere in a state of decay and much timber was rotten. Conditions were so <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> of the castles seven towers and two gatehouses, only the Eagle Tower and the King's Gate had roofs by 1620. The domestic buildings inside the castle had been stripped of anything valuable, such as glass and iron. Despite the disrepair of the domestic buildings, the castle's defences were in a good enough state that during the English Civil War in the mid-17thcentury it was garrisoned by Royalists. Caernarfon Castle was besieged three times during the war. The constable was John Byron, 1st Baron Byron, who surrendered Caernarfon to Parliamentarian forces in 1646. It was the last time Caernarfon Castle saw fighting. Although it was ordered in 1660 that the castle and town walls should be dismantled, the work was aborted early on and may never have started.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E
5|$|The Yawata raid {{revealed}} serious {{shortcomings in}} Japan's air defenses. While the 19th Air Brigade initially {{claimed to have}} shot down eight B-29s and damaged a further four, it was soon determined that {{only two of the}} bombers had been destroyed. This loss ratio was considered too low to defeat attacks on the home islands. The raid demonstrated that Japan had too few air bases and not enough aircraft were available for night operations. It was also found that the Toryu fighter was not well suited to intercepting B-29s as it was slower than the bombers, too lightly armed and most aircraft lacked radar. While the air raid alert system had proved successful in this instance, the radars which detected the American aircraft had been unable to determine their altitude and it was decided that there was a need to further expand radar coverage. The performance of the 131st Anti Aircraft Regiment during the raid was judged to be so <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> its commander was transferred to Manchuria. News reports of the Yawata raid and successful U.S. landing at Saipan on the same day also indicated to Japanese civilians that the war was not going well. In response to the raid Japanese Government ministers urged families living the country's four major cities to evacuate their children to rural areas.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the race: {{the first was}} held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon. Both sessions lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. All three sessions were affected by rain, with only the second giving teams any chance to run dry-weather tyres. Adrian Sutil was quickest {{with a time of}} 1:32.842 in the first session, more than half a second quicker than the next fastest drivers Rubens Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella. Timo Glock was the next quickest, almost fourseconds behind Sutil. Conditions were so <b>poor</b> <b>that</b> sixdrivers, including both McLarens, failed to set times. The session was stopped fourminutes early, though by that time no cars had entered the track for at least tenminutes. The track dried out in the second session; Räikkönen adapted best to the changed conditions with a lap of 1:23.861, significantly quicker than his morning time. Kubica was the next fastest, with his BMW teammate Heidfeld in third. Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Massa rounded out the top six. Glock was fastest in the final session with a time of 1:35.464, followed by Sebastian Vettel, Rosberg, Jarno Trulli, Kazuki Nakajima and Heidfeld. Hamilton only completed eightlaps, and finished last with a time almost 11seconds behind Glock.|$|E
