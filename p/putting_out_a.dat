5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fire.|$|E

5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required {{to determine whether the}} batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to <b>put</b> him <b>out.</b> If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years he has been honing his craft as a record producer, <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> long array of music {{projects}} along the way. His goal has been to spearhead the EDM movement in Africa while at the same time doing his part in spreading the gospel of Afro beats music to the rest of the world. Therefore, his mash-ups and remixes infuse both contemporary African rhythms and vocals with the piercing synth sounds of electronic dance music giving birth to a completely new refreshing high. His productions however, though geared towards certain genres still remain highly experimental, reminiscent of early Diplo. His mash-up series “Mash-Up Mondays” where he releases a brand new mash-up every Monday is currently hosted on The Beat 99.9 FM radio station during the Morning Rush show.|$|E
25|$|By 20 October, Hohenlohe and the {{survivors}} of the Reserve reached Magdeburg. Kalckreuth crossed the Elbe at Tangermünde before handing over his command in order to take up a new post in Poland. Blücher was east of Brunswick marching for the Elbe with Saxe-Weimar a day's march behind him at Salzgitter On the 20th, Soult and Murat arrived before Magdeburg. Murat sent his chief of staff Augustin Daniel Belliard to demand its surrender, which was refused by Hohenlohe. However, the Prussians foolishly allowed Belliard into the city without a blindfold. He reported back to Murat that Hohenlohe's main body was still in the city and that great confusion prevailed. Davout seized Wittenberg on the 20th, with the local people assisting his troops in <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fire and preventing a powder magazine from being blown up. Consequently, 140,000 pounds of gunpowder and a valuable Elbe River crossing fell into French hands. Lannes seized a second bridgehead at Dessau.|$|E
25|$|Năsturel was {{primarily}} {{an advocate of}} Old Church Slavonic, the courtly language. He was one of its last exponents in Romanian literature, and taught it to students at the school in Târgoviște. His favorite forms of expression were the essay and the rhyming preface, but he also perfected a Slavonic answer to the blason, which remained influential for two centuries and was, by some accounts, the first known poem by a Romanian. Năsturel, who made mention of the people's Latin origin, also used the Romanian vernacular, in which he notably produced a translation of Barlaam and Josaphat. In his original works, his themes and his linguistic obscurities show a Baroque streak, while his core ideology {{has been linked to}} Renaissance humanism. An Eastern Orthodox theologian and a ktitor within the Wallachian Metropolis, he was nevertheless attracted to Counter-Reformation ideas, and published Catholic-inspired propaganda against Calvinism. Năsturel was versed in both Renaissance Latin and classical scholarship, <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Slavonic rendition of The Imitation of Christ.|$|E

25|$|Born {{the son of}} Dr James Deans (of Calcutta) and Janet Deans (née Dundas), James Deans, as he then was, {{joined the}} Royal Navy in March 1799. He {{initially}} joined the third-rate HMS Kent and {{took part in the}} Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in Autumn 1799 during the War of the Second Coalition. In 1802 he saw action in combat with the French ship Duguay Trouin and was also involved with the capture of La Vautour. Promoted to lieutenant on 25 May 1805, he joined the fifth-rate HMS Cambrian and took part in capturing three privateers that year. After serving for a few weeks as flag-lieutenant to Admiral The Hon. George Berkeley on the North American Station and having been promoted to commander on 8 October 1806, he was given command of the fifth-rate HMS Rosamond but was injured while <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fire at Copenhagen Dockyard shortly after the capture of that City in August 1807. Promoted to captain on 13 October 1807, he briefly took command of the fifth-rate HMS Cambrian. Following his marriage to Janet Dundas he assumed the surname of Dundas in April 1808.|$|E
25|$|The {{success at}} Juvenile level {{convinced}} the Bridgeton Waverley committee {{to seek a}} place in the Junior leagues, having been permitted by senior club Clyde F.C. and their manager Frank Thompson to play fixtures at their Shawfield Stadium ground in Rutherglen as they sought a local home ground of their own. At that time the city of Glasgow was densely populated and heavily industrialised, and there were many clubs already established in the area. The most notable was the giants Celtic F.C., although their Irish-Catholic connections held little appeal for many of the area's residents. Junior clubs Strathclyde and Parkhead were based in the vicinity of Bridgeton, and other established clubs Glencairn, Shettleston, St Roch's, Shawfield, Baillieston, Vale of Clyde and Cambuslang Rangers were all within a few miles and could be expected to compete for players. However despite these challenges, Waverley performed well from the outset, having joined the Second Glasgow District League for 1923–24 while also <b>putting</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> side at juvenile level. They reached the semi-finals of the most prestigious national competition, the Scottish Junior Cup, at the first attempt, eventually being eliminated by neighbours Parkhead; the match at Celtic Park attracted an attendance of 11,500, even though the senior Scottish Cup final was taking place at Hampden Park at the same time.|$|E
