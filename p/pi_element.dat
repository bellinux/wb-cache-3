40|$|We have {{identified}} a new immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer element, designated pi, between the microE 2 and microE 3 elements. The pi enhancer element is transcriptionally active primarily during early stages of B-cell development but becomes virtually inactive during B-cell maturation at about the stage of immunoglobulin kappa light-chain gene rearrangement. Mutational analysis suggests that the <b>pi</b> <b>element</b> is crucial for immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer activity at the pre-B-cell stage but is almost irrelevant for enhancer activity at the mature B-cell or plasma-cell stage. The activity of the pi enhancer element correlates {{with the presence of}} an apparently pre-B-cell-specific protein-DNA complex.
