The focus is on RT control systems with multiple control tasks running on a uniprocessor.

40|$|International audienceThe {{airborne}} launch vehicle, {{studied in}} this article, {{has to find}} an appropriate route to reach the mission goal, considering environment requirements and system constraints, for mission safety and efficiency. A method for three-dimensional waypoint generation based on an improved version of the A* algorithm with avoidance of detected obstacles is presented in this article. As the mission proceeds, {{the information about the}} environment is regularly updated. This information is considered in the mission plan, yielding a revised sequence of waypoints, to reach one or multiple goal points, depending on their order <b>of</b> <b>priority.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the algorithm is twofold: a dynamic waypoint generation and a shortest route refined regularly. Diverse obstacles such as turbulence zones, no-fly zones, storms, etc., are considered in the flight plan as soon as they are detected. Their locations and shapes are introduced into the path search space. The improved A* capabilities are tested via simulation in different scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{centerless}} grinding process demonstrates superior grinding accuracy with extremely high productivity, {{but only if}} the setup conditions are properly set up. Otherwise, various unfavorable phenomena manifest during the grinding processes and become serious obstacles to achieving that high quality and productivity. These phenomena are associated with the fundamental stabilities of the {{centerless grinding}} system, so it is essential to keep the system stable by setting up the appropriate grinding conditions. This paper describes the development of a model for finding the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy the three stability criteria of centerless grinding systems: (1) work rotation stability for safe operations; (2) geometrical rounding stability for better roundness; and (3) dynamic system stability for chatter-free grinding. The objective of the model development is to produce combinations of optimal setup conditions as the <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> the model, and to rank the <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> the <b>outputs</b> using PI (performance index) functions based on the process aims (productivity or accuracy). The paper demonstrates that the developed model, named Opt-Setup Master, can generate the optimum setup conditions to ensure safe operations, better roundness and chatter-free grinding. It provides practical setup conditions as well as scientific parameters and fundamental grinding parameters. Finally, the paper verifies that the Opt-Setup Master provides the setup conditions that simultaneously satisfy all three stability criteria of the centerless grinding system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{promising}} paths towards the sustainable development is utilizing solar energy, especially in oil-dependent economy nations like Iran. Electricity production in Iran is mainly dominated by its fossil fuel resources. High solar insolation and available desert lands in Iran are two main factors to encourage the full development of solar power plants for thermal and electrical energy productions. Herein, the solar thermal power plants have the <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> consistent power <b>output</b> and the ability to incorporate storage. In the present study, a brief description and working principles of the solar thermal power plants are given. Besides, the paper points out the solar energy potential, the current state of electricity generation and the future of solar thermal power projects in the country. Special attention is drawn to the Iranian government initiatives and support for the use of solar energy. In the end, the future prospects of solar projects development with the worldwide competitive technologies by considering the existing obstacles that should be removed by the Iranian governments and energy planners in the future of energy production are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{behavior}} based {{architecture is}} presented in which behaviors are sparsely interconnected, using an arbitration structure which solves the problem of behavior selection in a distributed way. The arbitration structure is constituted by sets of blockers, each blocker resolving conflicts between two behaviors. There will be a blocker set for each actuator {{in order to allow}} independent actions from non interfering behaviors. The behavior model is also described comprising two sub-modules, one for the action and another for the <b>priority</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the behavior. The user when designing a particular vehicle must also define, for each behavior, a fixed priority input plus a fatigue and a recovery times that complete the behavior characterization. A case study is depicted with analysis of the vehicle global behavior for different parameter values. The implications of the architecture model for the control of autonomous vehicles are discussed and future developments are advanced. 1 Introduction [...] ...|$|R

The ICER algorithm applies a wavelet decomposition and prioritizes the compressed bit layers from the wavelet sub-bands so as to (attempt to) progressively transmit the layer that gives the largest improvement in image quality per transmitted bit. Our modified version accepts additional input priorities that reflect the relative importance of various “regions of interest ” in the source data, and arranges its output packets to reflect both the input regional priorities and the wavelet bit layer <b>priorities.</b> The <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the data compression module is supervised by an intelligent buffer manager that shuffles the prioritized pack...|$|R

40|$|Institutions {{can affect}} {{the degree to which}} public opinion {{influences}} policy by determining the clarity of responsibility in decision-making. The sharing of power between national and devolved levels of government makes it difficult for the public to attribute responsibility for decisions. In the UK, this generates the prediction that the devolution of power to territorial units weakens the effect of public opinion on policy both for the UK and Scottish governments. To test this expectation, this paper analyses responsiveness <b>of</b> the legislative <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> the UK and Scottish parliaments to the issue <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> the public. It finds the policy-opinion link in the UK appears to be weaker since devolution to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 compared with the period between 1977 and 1998.
