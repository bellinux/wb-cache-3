5|$|Root {{extensions}} are additions {{of one or}} two sounds, often <b>plosives,</b> {{to the end of a}} root.

5|$|The {{research}} into {{the reconstruction of the}} consonants of Middle Mongol has engendered several controversies. Middle Mongol had two series of <b>plosives,</b> but there is disagreement as to which phonological dimension they lie on, whether aspiration or voicing. The early scripts have distinct letters for velar <b>plosives</b> and uvular <b>plosives,</b> but as these are in complementary distribution according to vowel harmony class, only two back plosive phonemes, */k/, * (~ *, *) are to be reconstructed. One prominent long running disagreement concerns certain correspondences of word medial consonants among the four major scripts (UM, SM, AM, and Ph, which were discussed in the preceding section). Word medial /k/ of Uyghur Mongolian (UM) has, not one, but two correspondences with the three other scripts: either /k/ or zero. Traditional scholarship has reconstructed */k/ for both correspondences, arguing that */k/ got lost in some instances, which raises the question of what the conditioning factors of those instances were. More recently, the other obvious possibility has been assumed, namely that the correspondence between UM /k/ and zero in the other scripts points to a distinct phoneme, /h/, which would correspond to the word-initial phoneme /h/ that is present in those other scripts. /h/ (sometimes also called /x/) is sometimes assumed to derive from *, which would also explain zero in SM, AM, Ph in some instances where UM indicates /p/, e.g. debel > Khalkha deel.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{rotation}} {{to change the}} vowel of a syllable is unique to Canadian syllabics, but had its antecedent in shorthand.

25|$|A very {{important}} issue for all neuroscientific or neurocomputational approaches is to separate structure and knowledge. While {{the structure of the}} model (i.e. of the human neuronal network, which is needed for processing speech) is mainly determined by evolutionary processes, the knowledge is gathered mainly during speech acquisition by processes of learning. Different learning experiments were carried out with the model ACT in order to learn (i) a five-vowel system /i, e, a, o, u/ (see Kröger et al. 2009), (ii) a small consonant system (voiced <b>plosives</b> /b, d, g/ in combination with all five vowels acquired earlier as CV syllables (ibid.), (iii) a small model language comprising the five-vowel system, voiced and unvoiced <b>plosives</b> /b, d, g, p, t, k/, nasals /m, n/ and the lateral /l/ and three syllable types (V, CV, and CCV) (see Kröger et al. 2011) and (iv) the 200 most frequent syllables of Standard German for a 6 year old child (see Kröger et al. 2011). In all cases, an ordering of phonetic items with respect to different phonetic features can be observed.|$|E
25|$|The declensional {{paradigms}} {{for some}} common nouns and pronouns are given below. As Malayalam is an agglutinative language, {{it is difficult}} to delineate the cases strictly and determine how many there are, although seven or eight is the generally accepted number. Alveolar <b>plosives</b> and nasals (although the modern Malayalam script does not distinguish the latter from the dental nasal) are underlined for clarity, following the convention of the National Library at Kolkata romanization.|$|E
25|$|Some scripts, however, {{are truly}} ambiguous. The semi-syllabaries of ancient Spain were syllabic for <b>plosives</b> such as p, t, k, but {{alphabetic}} for other consonants. In some versions, vowels were written redundantly after syllabic letters, conforming to an alphabetic orthography. Old Persian cuneiform was similar. Of 23 consonants (including null), seven were fully syllabic, thirteen were purely alphabetic, {{and for the}} other three, there was one letter for /Cu/ and another for both /Ca/ and /Ci/. However, all vowels were written overtly regardless; as in the Brahmic abugidas, the /Ca/ letter was used for a bare consonant.|$|E
5000|$|A uvular-epiglottal {{consonant}} is a doubly articulated consonant pronounced {{by making}} a simultaneous uvular consonant and epiglottal consonant. An example is the Somali [...] "uvular" [...] <b>plosive</b> , which is a voiceless uvular-epiglottal <b>plosive</b> , as in [...] 'to emit smoke'.|$|R
5000|$|... is not phonetically a fricative, but behaves as one phonologically. [...] is {{pronounced}} [...] in the Hooper Bay-Chevak and Nunviak dialects.

5000|$|The unattested parent language, Proto-Chin, {{featured}} a voiced velar <b>plosive</b> [...] The phoneme itself {{was lost in}} all of its daughter languages, due to a spirantisation to ɣ, which a labialisation followed afterwards. Only certain loanwords, not native words, have the voiced velar <b>plosive.</b>|$|R
25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, many {{researchers}} {{have come to believe}} that one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished voicing in the <b>plosives</b> by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the alveolar (/d/~/t/) and velar (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see northeastern Iberian script.) If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.|$|E
25|$|By this stage, Germanic {{had emerged}} as a {{distinctive}} branch and had undergone many of the sound changes that would make its later descendants recognisable as Germanic languages. It had shifted its consonant inventory from a system that was rich in <b>plosives</b> to one containing primarily fricatives, had lost the PIE mobile pitch accent for a predictable stress accent, and had merged two of its vowels. The stress accent {{had already begun to}} cause the erosion of unstressed syllables, which would continue in its descendants. The final stage of the language included the remaining development until the breakup into dialects and, most notably, featured the development of nasal vowels and the start of umlaut, another characteristic Germanic feature.|$|E
25|$|What is {{sometimes}} {{known as the}} fourth phase shifted the dental fricatives to <b>plosives.</b> This shift occurred late enough that unshifted forms {{are to be found}} in the earliest Old High German texts, and thus it can be dated to the 9th or 10th century. This shift spread much further north than the others, eventually reaching all continental West Germanic languages (hence excluding only English). It is therefore not uniquely High German; it is nonetheless often grouped together with the other shifts, as it did spread from the same area. The shift took several centuries to spread north, appearing in Dutch only during the 12th century, and in Frisian and Low German not for another century or two after that.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the OC lateral {{consonant}} /*l/ {{is shown}} to have fortified to a coronal <b>plosive</b> /d/ in Type A syllables. Meanwhile, it developed into /j/ in Type B syllables, which developed palatalisation in Middle Chinese. Sagart pointed out, however, that these changes are not true if the lateral is preceded by a reconstructed prefix. This position, whereby OC /l/ underwent fortition to become a <b>plosive,</b> is upheld by Baxter. Baxter pointed out xiesheng contacts between <b>plosive</b> series, sibilants and MC y-, and made the following reconstructions.|$|R
