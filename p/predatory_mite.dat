5|$|The hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) is {{the most}} common flea in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea C. fringillae, is also {{occasionally}} found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on house sparrows. Lice include Menacanthus eurystemus, Brueelia nebulosa and Stumidoecus sturni. Other arthropod parasites include Ixodes ticks and mites such as Analgopsis passerinus, Boydaia stumi, Dermanyssus gallinae, Ornithonyssus bursa, O. sylviarum, Proctophyllodes species, Pteronyssoides truncatus and Trouessartia rosteri. The hen mite D. gallinae is itself preyed upon by the <b>predatory</b> <b>mite</b> Androlaelaps casalis. The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared to reuse old nests.|$|E

However, the distinction between the direct and indirect effects of a pesticide is not always possible in field tests. Generalist <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> belonging to the Phytoseiidae are considered as non-target organisms in pesticide side-effect evaluations. Plant pathogens of cultivated plants can be of importance as food resources for various phytoseiids. Pesticides with fungicidal activity may have a direct impact on phytoseiids, but they can also an indirect effect when reducing food availability for <b>predatory</b> <b>mites.</b> In field experiments on grapevine, we investigated whether the availability of the plant pathogen grape downy mildew has an effect on fungicides impact on the <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> Typhlodromus pyri and Amblyseius andersoni. We used fungicides having a differential selectivity towards predatory mites: copper compounds, folpet, and mancozeb. The abundance of <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> was associated with the plant pathogen foliar symptoms. The presence of <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> differed among treatments in response of the toxicological features of fungicides (direct effects), but also as consequences of plant pathogen availability induced by fungicide applications (indirect effects).

40|$|Biological {{control of}} {{different}} species of pest with various species of generalist predators can potentially disrupt the control of pests through predator-predator interactions. We evaluate the impact of three species of generalist <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> on the biological control of green peach aphids, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) with the aphidophagous gall midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani). The <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> tested were Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans), Iphiseius degenerans (Berlese) and Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot, which are all commonly used for pest control in greenhouse sweet pepper. All three species of <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> were found to feed on eggs of A. aphidimyza, even {{in the presence of}} abundant sweet pepper pollen, an alternative food source for the <b>predatory</b> <b>mites.</b> In a greenhouse experiment on sweet pepper, all three predators significantly reduced population densities of A. aphidimyza, but aphid densities only increased significantly in the presence of A. swirskii when compared to the treatment with A. aphidimyza only. This stronger effect of A. swirskii {{can be explained by the}} higher population densities that this predator reached on sweet pepper plants compared to the other two predator species. An additional experiment showed that female predatory midges do not avoid oviposition sites with the predator A. swirskii. On the contrary, they even deposited more eggs on plants with <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> than on plants without. Hence, this study shows that disruption of aphid control by <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> is a realistic scenario in sweet pepper, and needs to be considered when optimizing biological control strategies...|$|R

30|$|Although the {{constitutive}} antipredator defence of P. citri by {{lying down}} with protective setae is effective against <b>predatory</b> <b>mites,</b> {{it is totally}} ineffective against gigantic intraguild predators: lying P. citri individuals are often consumed together with leaves by swallowtail caterpillars (Shirotsuka and Yano 2012). Although P. citri and swallowtail caterpillars overlap on citrus host plants in time and space, the caterpillars are seemingly less harmful to P. citri than are <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> because the caterpillars forage randomly {{with respect to the}} presence of P. citri (Shirotsuka and Yano 2012), while <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> actively search for prey mites using various prey derived cues (e.g. Vet and Dicke 1992; Pratt and Croft 1999; Shinmen et al. 2010).

The experimental cages were arranged in blocks and randomly assigned. The released numbers of <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> were 30 (10 males[*]+[*] 20 females) per plant, while the initial numbers of F. occidentalis for each plant were 60 adults.

Leaves of tomato plants were checked six times (after 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75  days), while their flowers were only examined two times (after 50 and 60  days) from the transporting of tomato seedlings. Leaves (2 – 5) and flowers (5 – 8) of tomato were collected from each plant in separate Ziploc bags (17 [*]×[*] 22  cm) from each plant and then transferred to the laboratory. The leaves and flowers of tomato were placed in a plastic cup with ethanol (75 %: diluted from analytical ethanol grade 99 %) for 30  min to displace the different stages of thrips. Numbers of thrips (larvae and adults) per leaf and per five flowers were counted using a magnifier lens.|$|R
40|$|Supplemental {{food sources}} to support natural enemies in crops are {{increasingly}} being tested and used. This is particularly interesting for generalist predators that can reproduce on these food sources. However, a potential risk for pest control could occur when herbivores also benefit from supplemental food sources. In order to optimize biological control, it may be important to select food sources that support predator populations more than herbivore populations. In this study we evaluated the nutritional quality of four types of supplemental food for the generalist <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot and Amblydromalus (Typhlodromalus) limonicus (Garman and McGregor), both important thrips predators, and for the herbivore western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande, by assessing oviposition rates. These tests showed that application of corn pollen, cattail pollen or sterilized eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller to chrysanthemum leaves resulted in three times higher oviposition rates of thrips compared to leaves without additional food. None of the tested food sources promoted <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> or western flower thrips exclusively. Decapsulated cysts of Artemia franciscana Kellogg were not suitable, whereas cattail pollen was very suitable for both <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> and western flower thrips. In addition, {{we found that the}} rate of thrips predation by A. swirskii can be reduced by 50 %, when pollen is present. Nevertheless, application of pollen or Ephestia eggs to a chrysanthemum crop still strongly enhanced the biological control of thrips with A. swirskii, both at low and high release densities of <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> through the strong numerical response of the predators. Despite these positive results, application in a crop should be approached with caution, as the results may strongly depend on the initial predator–prey ratio, the nutritional quality of the supplemental food source, the species of <b>predatory</b> <b>mites,</b> the distribution of the food in the crop and the type of crop...|$|R
