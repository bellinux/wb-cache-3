40|$|PURPOSE: To {{ascertain}} {{whether there are}} differences in the histopathological appearance of tendinopathic Achilles and <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons.</b> METHODS: In males, we studied biopsies from tendinopathic Achilles (N = 28; average age 34. 1 yr) and <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> (N = 28; average age 32. 1), Achilles tendons (N = 21; average age 61. 8 yr) from deceased patients with no known tendon pathology, and <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> (N = 15; average age 28. 3) from patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Hematoxylineosin stained slides were interpreted using a semiquantitative grading scale (0 : normal to 3 : maximally abnormal) for fiber structure, fiber arrangement, rounding of the nuclei, regional variations in cellularity, increased vascularity, decreased collagen stainability, and hyalinization. All slides were assessed blindly twice, the agreement between two readings ranging from 0. 170 to 0. 750 (kappa statistics). RESULTS: The highest mean score of tendinopathic Achilles tendons was not significantly different from that of tendinopathic <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> (11. 6 +/- 5 and 10. 4 +/- 3, respectively).

INTRODUCTION: High-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy is an option in the treatment of orthopedic diseases such as chronic tendonitis. Despite its potential clinical applicability, there have been few studies on this technique that examine both its clinical effectiveness and its effect on angiogenesis. METHODS: High-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy was applied at the tibial insertion of the left patellar ligament in 30 rabbits that were separated into six groups that differed in terms of the voltage and number of pulses that were applied by high-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy. The tibial insertion in the right legs of the animals was used as the control. After six weeks, we performed histological analysis on the region and quantified the number of blood vessels. RESULTS: No significant differences in the number of blood vessels between the left and right <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> were found within groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND Patellar {{tendinopathy}} is {{a complex}} overuse knee injury common in sportsinvolving repetitive jumping and landing, in which repetitive loading is the mostfrequently reported causative factor associated with patellar tendinopathy. In order toprovide evidence {{for the development of}} prevention and rehabilitation programs forpatellar tendinopathy, research is required to broaden our understanding of the riskfactors associated with patellar tendinopathy. THESIS AIM The primary purpose of this thesis was to systematically investigate andcharacterise the patellar tendon loading generated during dynamic landings, and theinfluence of fatigue and the presence of a patellar tendon abnormality on diagnosticimaging (PTA) on these loads. METHODS To achieve the thesis aim, the thesis was completed in three parts. Part I (Chapter 2) assessed whether lower limb symmetry during a stop-jump landing task in 16 male athletes with normal <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> could be assumed. Then the validity andreliability of an experimental protocol designed to induce lower limb fatigue wasassessed (Chapter 3), in which 13 healthy male athletes performed the fatigue protocolon three separate occasions. The participants performed sets of 30 submaximal stretchshorteningcycle efforts immediately followed by 30 seconds rest during which theparticipants‟ kinetics and kinematics were quantified and blood lactate samplesrecorded. The experimental protocol that was developed in Part I (Chapter 2), was thenused to investigate the landing technique and patellar tendon loads generated during thelanding phases of a stop-jump task by 16 male athletes with healthy <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> (Chapter 4), and between seven male athletes with a PTA but with no previous historyor clinical signs of patellar tendon injury who were then matched to seven male athleteswith normal <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> (Chapter 6). Part II and III used the experimental protocolthat was developed in Part I (Chapter 3) to investigate the effect of fatigue on landingtechnique and patellar tendon loads generated during a stop-jump movement by 16 maleathletes with normal <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> (Chapter 5) and by seven asymptomatic athleteswith a PTA (Chapter 7). During each stop-jump trial (Chapters 2, 4 - 7), the participants‟ground reaction forces (GRF) were recorded, three-dimensional kinematics estimated,and FPT calculated by dividing the net knee joint moment by the patellar tendon momentarm. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS In characterising the patellar tendon loads generated during the landing phasesof a stop-jump task, it was evident that athletes with normal <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons</b> were ableto reduce their patellar tendon loads when fatigued. This was achieved by altering theirlanding technique in a way which may have a protective effect and potentially decreasethe likelihood of patellar tendon pathologies in vulnerable athletes. In contrast,asymptomatic athletes with a PTA utilised a different lower limb landing technique thantheir healthy counterparts with normal <b>patellar</b> <b>tendons,</b> by landing with greater kneeflexion and utilising a hip extension rather than a hip flexion strategy. Theseasymptomatic athletes with a PTA, however, were unable to modify either their patellar tendon load or their landing technique in response to fatigue. It was speculated thatthese asymptomatic athletes with a PTA, may be less able to adapt to changes evokedby fatigue and are therefore at risk of developing patellar tendinopathy due to higherpatellar tendon loading...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Repetitive, high <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading {{has been}} {{associated}} with the development of patellar tendinopathy, the most common overuse knee injury incurred in sports with a high volume of jumping and landing, such as volleyball. A large patellar tendinopathy prevalence discrepancy exists between male versus female players and highly skilled versus skilled players. It is unknown, however, how sex and skill level influence the <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> load generated during landing. It is possible that male and/or highly skilled volleyball players utilise a landing technique, or exhibit specific risk factors, that contribute to high <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading, thereby increasing their susceptibility to developing patellar tendinopathy, although this notion remains unexplored. THESIS AIM: The primary purpose of this thesis was to investigate the influence of sex and skill level on <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading generated when volleyball players land from a sport-specific lateral stop-jump block movement. METHODS: To achieve the thesis aim, a cohort of 50 male and female volleyball players of varying skill level underwent assessment of known patellar tendinopathy risk factors including their anthropometry, training history, lower limb muscle strength and extensibility, and maximum vertical jump performance. Each participant’s landing technique was also characterised by assessing their three-dimensional trunk and lower limb kinematics and kinetics, and the neuromuscular recruitment patterns from six lower limb muscles. <b>Patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading was characterised by peak <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> force and <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> force loading rate during the landing. Results were analysed as a series of studies, each designed to systematically contribute to the thesis aim. RESULTS: The interaction of sex, quadriceps muscle strength, ankle dorsiflexion velocity, and trunk flexion velocity were able to estimate and predict 52 % of the peak <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> force and 70 % of the <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> force loading rate variance generated during landing, whereby being male, and having increased quadriceps muscle strength, increased ankle dorsiflexion velocity and trunk flexion velocity were associated with higher <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading (see Chapter 2). When matched for jump height, however, {{there was no significant difference}} in <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading between the male and female volleyball players (see Chapter 3). Although male and female players displayed significantly different neuromuscular recruitment patterns, these patterns were not strongly related to the generated <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading (see Chapter 4). Furthermore, although there were no between-skill level differences in landing technique or <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading, highly skilled male volleyball players reported a higher training volume than the skilled volleyball players (see Chapter 5). MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: <b>Patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading generated when landing from a lateral stop-jump block movement was not influenced merely by sex, as male volleyball players generated higher <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading as a result of the higher jump height they attained compared to the female players. However, female players who attain similar jump heights to their male counterparts may be equally susceptible to developing patellar tendinopathy as they generated similar <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading to the men. Furthermore, skill level did not influence the magnitude of <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> loading during landing, suggesting that the discrepancy in patellar tendinopathy prevalence between the highly skilled and skilled players is due to the high training volume the highly skilled players are exposed to. Based on these findings, it is recommended that injury prevention programs aimed at reducing the patellar tendinopathy prevalence in volleyball players should focus on monitoring each player’s jump height and landing training volume, especially for highly skilled, male volleyball players who perform many jumps across frequent training sessions...|$|R
40|$|Arthroscopic {{technique}} for lateral release {{is the most}} widely used procedure for the correction of recurrent dislocations of the patella. In the relevant literature, several complications of lateral release are described, but the spontaneous <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture has never been suggested as a possible complication of this surgical procedure. <b>Patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture is a rather infrequent and often unilateral lesion. Nevertheless, in case of systemic diseases (LES, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic renal insufficiency) that can weaken collagen structures, bilateral <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> ruptures are described. We report a case of a 24 -year-old girl with spontaneous rupture of <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> who, at the age of 16, underwent an arthroscopic lateral release for recurrent dislocation of the patella. This is the first case of described spontaneous <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture that occurred some years after an arthroscopic lateral release...|$|R
40|$|AbstractChronic <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture {{is a rare}} {{disabling}} {{injury that}} is technically difficult to repair. The true prevalence of this injury is unknown. Delayed reconstruction of chronic <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> rupture has yielded suboptimal clinical and functional results. Many different surgical methods for reconstruction of chronic <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> injury have been reported. In this report, we present a case with chronic <b>patellar</b> <b>tendon</b> injury that was addressed using a technique that had not previously been described in the literature, through combining procedures that had been described separately. The reconstruction method {{presented in this article}} has the advantages of being easy and reproducible, without a requirement of allografts...|$|R
