40|$|The author {{discusses}} the basic components of designing efficient sub slab radon venting and vapor barrier systems for schools and large buildings. There are two new construction case study schools: one located in Georgia {{and the other}} in New Jersey. Both have active radon venting plans as supplied by the architect. Both architect designs required considerable review and plan amendments. The school in New Jersey has a conventional under slab pipe collection system, multiple riser pipes and a standard polyethylene vapor barrier. The school in Georgia has an efficient under slab <b>plenum</b> <b>box</b> collection system, a single riser pipe and a Liquid Boot vapor barrier system. This paper compares sub slab vacuum field extension, the leakage associated with the different vapor barrier systems, electrical consumption, as well as heat and cooling efficiencies. An energy consumption cost analysis demonstrates support for efficient designs and long term sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Nijburg Products {{is part of}} the Nijburg Industry Group {{which is}} active in the air {{conditioning}} systems industry. Nijburg Products is the production unit for the sales and installation companies. Nijburg Products produces amongst other diffusers with <b>plenum</b> <b>boxes</b> and air ducts. To ensure the growth of Nijburg Products, two extra production halls are bought. The expanding of the number of production halls is seen by Nijburg as the right moment to reorganize the layout of the plant. Therefore, a new layout has been developed. The new layout is divided in four case studies, a general layout for the whole plant and a more detailed layout for three sub departments of this new general layout. A theoretical framework has been developed which shows all issues related to the layout cases, this framework is used in the four case studies and reviewed afterwards. This thesis has resulted in improvements in all four cases and a good reflection of the used theoretical framework. ...|$|R
