40|$|This report {{argues that}} section 35 P of the ASIO Act is not justified, {{and that it}} does not contain {{adequate}} safeguards for protecting the rights of outsiders and is not proportionate to the threat of terrorism or the threat to national security. Purpose This report discusses the impact on journalists of the operation of section 35 P of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act) concerning offences for the disclosure of information relating to a special intelligence operation (SIO). Impact The impact of section 35 P on journalists is twofold: A. It creates uncertainty as to what may be published about the activities of ASIO without fear of prosecution. The so-called chilling effect of that uncertainty is exacerbated because it also applies in relation to disclosures made to editors for the purpose of discussion before publication. B. Journalists are prohibited from publishing anywhere at any time any information relating to an SIO, regardless of whether it has any, or any continuing, operational significance and even if it discloses reprehensible conduct by ASIO insiders. Issues The basic problem with section 35 P {{is that it does not}} distinguish between journalists and others (outsiders) and ASIO insiders. The application in this manner of broad secrecy prohibitions to outsiders is not satisfactorily justified, including by precedents in Australia or elsewhere. The SIO scheme is necessary and proportionate to the present threats to security. The statutory and administrative procedures in force are appropriate safeguards against abuse. A secrecy provision relating to the scheme is not inappropriate. However, section 35 P is not justified. It does not contain adequate safeguards for protecting the rights of outsiders and is not proportionate to the threat of terrorism or the threat to national security. Section 35 P is arguably invalid on the basis that it infringes the constitutional protection of freedom of political communication. Section 35 P is also arguably inconsistent with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so not in accordance with Australia’s international obligations. Three basic flaws need to be addressed. The first is the absence of an express harm requirement for breach (of the basic offence) by a journalist or other third party. The second is that recklessness is the fault element in relation to the circumstance described in section 35 P(2) (c) (ii) (that is, in relation to the latter harm requirement in the aggravated offence). The third is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> of information already in the public domain. Recommendations Section 35 P should be redrafted to treat insiders and outsiders separately, with one part dealing with third parties and another part dealing with insiders. There should be a basic offence (penalty five years imprisonment) and an aggravated offence (penalty 10 years imprisonment) in relation to both insiders and outsiders. Insiders The basic offence and the aggravated offences for insiders would be as per current section 35 P. Outsiders The basic offence for outsiders would have the same elements as section 35 P(1), but with the additional physical element that the disclosure of the information will endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of an SIO. Recklessness would be the default fault element in relation to this last physical element. The aggravated offence for outsiders would have the same elements as section 35 P(2) except that the fault element for (c) (ii) should be knowledge rather than recklessness (in other words, the fault element for the circumstance that the disclosure will endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of the operation should be specified to be knowledge). There should be a defence of prior publication (not available to a member or ex-member of the intelligence and security services in respect of information available to them in that capacity) ...|$|E

WCPFC members, however, have disagreed sharply over management measures for tuna, sharks, and other species, in part because some WCPFC members have refused to provide the WCPFC with vessel-specific data, known as operational data, which is needed to manage the stocks sustainably. Despite a legal requirement to submit operational data to the WCPFC, these members, including Japan and Korea, have claimed that “domestic legal constraints,” in particular <b>prohibitions</b> against <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> “personal information,” prevent them from complying with their international obligation to submit operational data. This Article assesses those claims and concludes that Japan and Korea either do not have current domestic legal constraints preventing them from submitting operational data or they have readily available options to remedy those constraints.

The article present and analyzes the impediments to marriage according to articles 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 277 of the Civil Code. Thus, we will see that according to art. 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 276 of the Civil Code the impediments to marriage are: 1. {{the existence of a}} previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; 3. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; 4. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; 5. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; 6. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; 7. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage. However, the provisions in the Civil Code only bring under regulation as an impediment the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the persons who suffer from temporary lack of judgment. Art. 277 paragraph 3 in the Civil Code stipulates the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the civil partnerships between people of different or same sex. the Family Code, the new Civil Code, impediments to the contracting of marriage, the existence of a previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack <b>of</b> judgment; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{studies do}} not make a clear {{distinction}} between the quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> As it is generally assumed that the quantity of information has an implication in determining its quality, quantity measures are often used as proxy for disclosure quality. Nonetheless, the measurement of the quality <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> is recognized as a relevant question that is still open and the importance of developing measures <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> quality is emphasized in literature. This paper disputes the idea that the quantity <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> is a sound proxy for the quality <b>of</b> <b>disclosure.</b> The adoption <b>of</b> multidimensional frameworks for the appreciation <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> is discussed and an index for quality disclosure is proposed. Moving from the assumption that high-quality information should usefully support external users in the judgment of past and future performance, we hypothesize that highquality disclosure is positively associated with accuracy and negatively associated with the dispersion of analysts’earnings forecasts. We show analytically that the proposed framework captures dimensions <b>of</b> annual report <b>disclosure</b> that are considered useful by financial analysts in forecasting earnings and that the proposed measure <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> quality has a stronger positive statistical association with accuracy and a stronger negative association with the dispersion of financial analysts’ earnings forecasts than a simple index <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> quantity has...|$|R

In addition the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture is absolute and non-derogable. Therefore. it entails some obligations for states whether or not they ratify the CAT. States have the universal obligations to prevent torture and inhuman degrading treatment in theirjurisdiction under international customary law.

40|$|Medical {{malpractice}} insurance policies customarily contain a “cooperation” clause requiring insureds {{to cooperate with}} the insurer’s efforts to defend the insured against a claim. A common stipulation in this clause forbids the insured from “admitting liability ” to an injured or harmed party. Health professionals often understand this clause to have a chilling effect on the truthful <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> medical error, which is morally required of physicians when they know that a harm-causing error has occurred. This paper offers a two-part response to the fear that medical error disclosure might result in a denial of {{malpractice insurance}} coverage. Part one describes various legal precedents wherein insurers successfully invoked the cooperation clause to deny coverage in instances of liability admission. This paper shows, however, that the legally sanctioned reasons for denying coverage in these cases address factors other than an insured’s truthful and honest <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> what happened to a claimant. Consequently, these cases do not support the belief that legal precedents discourage the truthful <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> harm-causing medical errors. Part two of this paper proposes that the cooperation clause’s <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> admission of liability in instances <b>of</b> medical error <b>disclosure</b> might well be unenforceable, and that the clause might not even be actuarially sound...|$|R
