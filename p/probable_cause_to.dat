25|$|However, {{the court}} found that those {{previous}} cases did not entirely apply to the situation at hand, because in the case of Ross there was no target container that had been observed being placed in the car, but rather <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> believe that contraband was located somewhere in the car. Therefore, there was <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> search Ross' car.|$|E

25|$|When the anticipatory warrant is {{predicated}} on a triggering condition, the Fourth Amendment requires that there is <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> believe that the triggering condition will occur, and that if it occurs, {{that there is a}} fair probability that the contraband will be found at the place to be searched. In this case, the warrant application satisfied both conditions, based on the delivery of the tape as the triggering condition.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 2009, in Westmont, Illinois, Chelios {{was arrested}} for driving under the influence. He was the only {{occupant}} of the vehicle that was stopped. The vehicle was towed and Chelios {{was taken to the}} Westmont station, where he was charged, processed, and posted bond. In March 2010, a judge reviewed the video tape of the arrest. The case was dismissed for lack of <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> stop, and evidence the tape provided that Chelios was not impaired.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, 2012, the Court of Appeals {{dismissed}} the petition of Anwar Ampatuan {{to have the}} murder charges against him quashed. Anwar Ampatuan is the grandson of former Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan Sr., and is charged with 57 counts of murder. He was arrested in August 2012.

25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would be very hard for the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Neal {{returns to}} June's house and finds an old friend: Mozzie (Willie Garson), who {{maintains}} deep {{connections in the}} criminal underworld. With Mozzie's help, Neal identifies the Dutchman as Curtis Hagen (guest star Mark Sheppard). Neal and Peter visit Hagen, who easily recognizes Neal. After their meeting, the FBI learns that Hagen has booked a flight out of the country, which will leave in one week. Neal and Peter know that Hagen is likely operating out of a warehouse, but fail to get a warrant or sufficient <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> enter it.|$|E
25|$|The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment (MDVE) {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} various police responses to domestic violence calls in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This experiment was implemented during 1981-82 by Lawrence W. Sherman, Director of Research at the Police Foundation, and by the Minneapolis Police Department with funding support from the National Institute of Justice. Among a pool of domestic violence offenders for whom there was <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> make an arrest, the study design called for officers to randomly select {{one third of the}} offenders for arrest, one third would be counseled and one third would be separated from their domestic partner.|$|E

25|$|In a 5-4 vote, the Court {{ruled that}} {{suspects}} who are arrested without a warrant {{must be provided}} <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> within 48 hours of their arrest. Using the precedent set by the Gerstein case – in which the Supreme Court ruled that Florida’s practice of keeping suspects for 30 days without <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> was unconstitutional – and close interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, {{they found that the}} County of Riverside’s practice of keeping suspects in custody without <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> determination amounted <b>to</b> illegal detention (or held in custody without being charged). Illegal detention would unquestionably violate the unreasonable search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment; withholding <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> determination <b>to</b> suspects would also violate the Fourth Amendment as well.|$|R

Harris also wrote on his website {{that he had been}} building and detonating pipe bombs. Guerra wrote a draft affidavit for a search warrant, but the affidavit was never filed as authorities believed {{that they did not have}} the necessary <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> conduct a search of the Harris household. This information was not revealed to the public until September 2001 by 60 Minutes, though it was known by the police the entire time.|$|E
25|$|Abdullah Al-Kidd {{was held}} in a maximum {{security}} prison for 16 days, and in supervised release for 13 months. Al-Kidd was born Lavoni T. Kidd in 1973 in Wichita, Kansas. When he converted to Islam {{as a student at}} the University of Idaho, where he was a prominent football player, he changed his name. He asserts that Ashcroft violated his civil liberties as an American citizen, as he was treated like a terrorist and not allowed to consult an attorney. Al-Kidd's lawyers say Ashcroft, as US Attorney General, encouraged authorities after 9/11 to arrest potential suspects as material witnesses when they lacked <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> believe the suspects had committed a crime.|$|E
25|$|Neal, {{desperate to}} stay out of prison and find Kate, knows that he must find a legal way to have Hagen taken down. He takes off toward the warehouse, exiting the two-mile radius his {{tracking}} anklet allows him to stay within. Peter is alerted at the FBI headquarters that Neal has bolted. Peter believes that Neal has run off in search of Kate; however, he tracks him to Hagen's warehouse. With Neal, a convicted felon, inside the warehouse, Peter now has <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> enter. He does, and discovers Hagen running a massive counterfeiting operation. Hagen and his men are taken into custody, and Peter remarks to Neal that this is the third time Neal has been caught.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, {{the issue is}} not whether John tried to kill Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered to prove that the officer had <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E
25|$|The next day, June 25, 1855, David Newsom {{filed an}} {{affidavit}} and {{a warrant for}} inquest was issued. A six-man inquest jury was summoned to Robert Newsom’s estate to hear testimonies from William Powell, Coffee Wainscott, and Celia. After hearing the testimonies, the inquest jury determined that there was <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> arrest Celia {{for the murder of}} Robert Newsom. Celia was arrested and sent to Calloway County jail to await her trial in October. After her arrest, Celia was interrogated once more in her cell by Jefferson Jones, in order to determine whether she had been acting alone in her crime. Despite Jones’ insistent questioning, Celia repeatedly denied having had any assistance in killing Robert Newsom or in burning his body.|$|E
25|$|After unsuccessfully {{moving to}} {{suppress}} the marijuana before trial, Caballes was convicted of narcotics trafficking and sentenced to 12 {{years in prison and}} a $256,136 fine. The trial judge denied Caballes' motion to suppress, reasoning that the officers had not unnecessarily prolonged the traffic stop, and the indication by the dog, of narcotics in the vehicle, gave them <b>probable</b> <b>cause</b> <b>to</b> search the trunk of Caballes' car. The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, but the Illinois Supreme Court reversed, holding that because the dog sniff was performed without reference to specific and articulable facts, it unjustifiably enlarged the scope of the stop into a drug investigation. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in order to answer {{the question of whether the}} Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion to justify using a drug-sniffing dog during a routine and otherwise legitimate traffic stop.|$|E
