5|$|Kneale {{was born}} Thomas Nigel Kneale in Barrow-in-Furness, England. His family {{came from the}} Isle of Man, and {{returned}} to live there in 1928, when Kneale was six years old. He {{was raised in the}} island's capital, Douglas, where his father was the owner and editor of the local newspaper, The Herald. He was educated at St Ninian's High School, Douglas, and after leaving studied law, training to become an advocate at the Manx Bar. He also worked in a lawyer's office, but became bored with his legal training and eventually abandoned the profession. At the beginning of the Second World War Kneale attempted to enlist in the British Army, but was deemed medically unfit for service owing to <b>photophobia,</b> from which he had suffered since childhood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Photophobia</b> (light intolerance).|$|E
25|$|Classic presentations are abrupt {{onset of}} {{unilateral}} periorbital edema, headache, <b>photophobia,</b> and bulging {{of the eye}} (proptosis).|$|E
25|$|Most {{frequent}} are symptoms due to conjunctival or corneal irritation: burning, <b>photophobia,</b> tearing, pain, and {{a gritty}} or sandy sensation.|$|E
25|$|Colorado {{tick fever}} virus {{can cause a}} fever, chills, headache, <b>photophobia,</b> myalgia, arthralgia, and lethargy. Children, in particular, may develop a hemorrhagic disease. Leukopenia with both {{lymphocytes}} and neutrophils is very common for Colorado tick fever virus. In either case, the infection can lead to encephalitis or meningitis.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} of incomplete achromatopsia {{are similar to}} those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or <b>photophobia.</b> Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{complete}} inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia {{have a number}} of other ophthalmologic aberrations. Included among these aberrations are greatly decreased visual acuity (<0.1 or 20/200) in daylight, Hemeralopia, nystagmus, and severe <b>photophobia.</b> The fundus of the eye appears completely normal. Also see Pingelap#Color-blindness.|$|E
25|$|Headache {{beginning}} within 60 {{minutes of}} aura onset. These headaches can last 4–72 hours, occur {{on only one}} side of the head, pulsate, be of moderate to severe intensity, and may be aggravated by common physical activities such as walking. These headaches must also be accompanied by nausea/vomiting, phonophobia (avoidance of sound due to hypersensitivity) and/or <b>photophobia</b> (avoidance of light due to hypersensitivity).|$|E
25|$|Coltivirus is a genus {{of viruses}} (belonging to the Reoviridae family) that infects vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. It {{includes}} the causative agent of Colorado tick fever. Colorado tick fever virus {{can cause a}} fever, chills, headache, <b>photophobia,</b> myalgia, arthralgia, and lethargy. Children, in particular, may develop a hemorrhagic disease. Leukopenia with both lymphocytes and neutrophils is very common for Colorado tick fever virus. In either case, the infection can lead to encephalitis or meningitis.|$|E
25|$|In {{clinical}} trials, {{the most}} common adverse effects of sildenafil use included headache, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and impaired vision, including <b>photophobia</b> and blurred vision. Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In July 2005, the FDA found that sildenafil could lead to vision impairment in rare cases {{and a number of}} studies have linked sildenafil use with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|The prodromal phase {{may have}} no symptoms, or may mimic a {{non-specific}} viral infection, marked by flu-like symptoms that typically last for a few days. There may be fever, headache, nausea, meningismus, dysacusia (discomfort caused by loud noises or a distortion {{in the quality of}} the sounds being heard), tinnitus, and/or vertigo. Eye symptoms can include orbital pain, <b>photophobia</b> and tearing. The skin and hair may be sensitive to touch. Cranial nerve palsies and optic neuritis are uncommon.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} The Island of the Colorblind Sacks wrote about an island where {{many people have}} {{achromatopsia}} (total colourblindness, very low visual acuity and high <b>photophobia).</b> The second section of this book, entitled Cycad Island, describes the Chamorro people of Guam, who have {{a high incidence of}} a neurodegenerative disease locally known as Lytico-Bodig disease (a devastating combination of ALS, dementia and parkinsonism). Later, along with Paul Alan Cox, Sacks published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the disease, namely the toxin beta-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA) from the cycad nut accumulating by biomagnification in the flying fox bat.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{indirect}} symptoms characterize Retinitis Pigmentosa {{along with the}} direct effects of the initial rod photoreceptor degeneration and later cone photoreceptor decline. Phenomena such as <b>photophobia,</b> which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, and photopsia, the presence of blinking or shimmering lights within the visual field, often manifest during the later stages of RP. Findings related to RP have often been characterized in the {{fundus of the eye}} as the Ophthalamic triad. This includes the development of (1) a mottled appearance of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) caused by bone spicule formation, (2) a waxy appearance of the optic nerve, and (3) the attentuation of blood vessels in the retina.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{and other}} retinoids {{are well known}} to affect the eyes. Dry eyes are very common during {{treatment}} and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some patients develop contact lens intolerance as a result. In some patients, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), red eye caused by conjunctivitis and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), colour blindness, development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea (keratitis), swelling of the optic disk (papilloedema, associated with IIH), <b>photophobia</b> and other visual disturbances.|$|E
25|$|The {{mnemonic}} 'POUND' helps {{distinguish between}} migraines and tension type headaches. POUND stands for Pulsatile quality, 4–72 hOurs in length, Unilateral location, Nausea or vomiting, Disabling intensity. One review article {{found that if}} 4–5 of the POUND characteristics are present, migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (likelihood ratio 24). If 3 characteristics of POUND are present, migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (likelihood ratio 3). If only 2 POUND characteristics are present, tension type headaches are 60% more likely (likelihood ratio 0.41). Another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension type headache: nausea, <b>photophobia,</b> phonophobia, exacerbation by physical activity, unilateral, throbbing quality, chocolate as headache trigger, cheese as headache trigger.|$|E
25|$|The {{only known}} albino gorilla – named Snowflake – was a wild-born western lowland gorilla {{originally}} from Equatorial Guinea. Snowflake, a male gorilla, {{was taken from}} the wild and brought to the Barcelona Zoo in 1966 at a very young age. Snowflake presented the typical traits and characteristics of albinism typically seen in humans, including white hair, pinkish skin, light colored eyes, reduced visual perception and <b>photophobia</b> (discomfort in bright light). Snowflake was diagnosed by scientists as having non-syndromic albinism. The genetic variant for Snowflake’s albinism was identified by the scientists as a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism located in a transmembrane region of SLC45A2. This transporter is also known to be involved in oculocutaneous albinism type 4 in humans. This information revealed the first evidence of inbreeding in western lowland gorillas.|$|E
25|$|People {{with early}} {{keratoconus}} typically notice a minor blurring of their vision {{and come to}} their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving. At early stages, the symptoms of keratoconus may be no {{different from those of}} any other refractive defect of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly. Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances, and night vision is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop <b>photophobia</b> (sensitivity to bright light), eye strain from squinting in order to read, or itching in the eye, but there is normally little or no sensation of pain. It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.|$|E
25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from <b>photophobia,</b> like albinos.|$|E

2500|$|Pneumococcal {{meningitis}} is {{an infection}} of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include: stiff neck, fever, headache, confusion and <b>photophobia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Less common manifestations include splenomegaly, {{hematuria}} and glomerulonephritis. [...] Headache, neck stiffness, and <b>photophobia</b> may occur. There {{have been}} three case reports suggesting meningitis or encephalitis.|$|E
2500|$|Pellagra is classically {{characterized}} by four 4 [...] "D's": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, <b>photophobia,</b> tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalophathy {{characterized by}} confusion, memory loss, and psychosis.|$|E
2500|$|... 90% of all {{headaches}} are primary headaches. Primary headaches usually {{first start}} {{when people are}} between 20 and 40 years old [...] The most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches. They have different characteristics. Migraines typically present with pulsing head pain, nausea, <b>photophobia</b> (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). Tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing [...] "bandlike" [...] pressure {{on both sides of}} the head, not accompanied by other symptoms. Other very rare types of primary headaches include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, <b>photophobia,</b> dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, deliriant hallucinations and excitation especially amongst the elderly. [...] Most of available ampules are carried on sulphate {{which can cause}} histamine release and anaphylaxis to susceptible patients or patients with allergy to sulpha products. These latter effects are because atropine is able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Because of the hallucinogenic properties, some have used the drug recreationally, though this is potentially dangerous and often unpleasant.|$|E
2500|$|Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome, or EEC, {{and also}} {{referred}} to as EEC syndrome (also known as [...] "Split hand–split foot–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome") is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as an genetic trait. EEC is characterized by the triad of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. Other features noted in association with EEC include vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, <b>photophobia,</b> occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are more}} serious {{conditions}} that can present {{with a red}} eye such as infectious keratitis, angle-closure glaucoma, or iritis. These conditions require the urgent attention of an ophthalmologist. Signs of such conditions include decreased vision, significantly increased sensitivity to light, inability to keep eye open, a pupil that does not respond to light, or a severe headache with nausea. Fluctuating blurring is common, due to tearing and mucoid discharge. [...] Mild <b>photophobia</b> is common. [...] However, {{if any of these}} symptoms are prominent, {{it is important to consider}} other diseases such as glaucoma, uveitis, keratitis and even meningitis or carotico-cavernous fistula.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, and {{possibly}} {{related to the}} [...] "Reefer Madness" [...] legend, some people (particularly Americans) had confused cannabis with Jimson weed (Datura stramonium). Jimson weed, which grows wild in the United States and several other countries, is a potent deliriant which can cause true hallucinations and delusions that are believed by the user to be real, {{as opposed to the}} pseudohallucinations and perceptual distortions typically caused by cannabis. Confusion could have resulted from the fact that Daturas common name contains the word [...] "weed," [...] which is also a slang term for cannabis, and the fact that both plants (as well as others) have been given the moniker [...] "locoweed" [...] {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. [...] Aside from these superficial similarities, the two plants are not related and have very little to do with one another, and thus should not be confused. [...] Jimson weed is highly toxic and can cause delirium, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, <b>photophobia,</b> dry mouth, urinary retention, hyperthermia, incoordination, hypertension, and rapid heartbeat among other effects. [...] An overdose (or suspected overdose) on this substance is a medical emergency, as it can cause seizures, coma, or death by cardiac arrest.|$|E
2500|$|A {{bounty hunter}} hired {{to protect the}} [...] "Scarecrow", Aloysius (Pronounced allo-wishus) [...] "Black" [...] Knight was a captain within Delta Team 7, {{regarded}} as the [...] "elite within the elite" [...] of the special forces. He became a fugitive from the US during a mission in Sudan, {{in which he was}} infiltrating an arms deal involving Osama bin Laden. Despite being in shooting range of the terrorist, Knight was ordered not to attack, allowing the terrorist to escape while Knight was forced to wait for reinforcements. Later, while preparing to board a Black Hawk piloted by his friend Rufus, he overhears his backup being ordered to kill him and his pilot. He finds out later that the men belong to the ICG (Intelligence Convergence Group), a complex web of civilian and military spies whose job is to ensure all intelligence obtained by the United States of America stays solely within the United States of America. He escaped, along with Rufus, and killed 13 of the men pursuing him. [...] He was consequently placed on the FBI Most Wanted List and his family killed in a supposedly botched home invasion. He turned to being a mercenary and after successfully rescuing the daughter of the Russian Vice-President, was given a fighter jet known as the [...] "Black Raven" [...] which Rufus pilots for him, as well as landing privileges at any Russian airfield. He is regarded as the second best bounty hunter in the world after [...] "Demon" [...] Larkham. More than [...] tall, he dresses entirely in black, in keeping to his call sign [...] "Black Knight". Due to an eye disorder, <b>photophobia,</b> he must wear tinted lenses at all times. This weakness is sometimes exploited by others, as removing his shades will cause him to experience immense pain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Photophobia</b> is {{a symptom}} of {{abnormal}} intolerance to visual perception of light. As a medical symptom, <b>photophobia</b> is not a morbid fear or phobia, but an experience of discomfort or pain to the eyes due to light exposure or by presence of actual physical sensitivity of the eyes, though the term is sometimes additionally applied to abnormal or irrational fear of light such as heliophobia. The term <b>photophobia</b> comes from the Greek φῶς (phōs), meaning [...] "light", and φόβος (phobos), meaning [...] "fear". <b>Photophobia</b> is a common symptom of visual snow.|$|E
