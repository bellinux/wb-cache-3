This system is suitable for locations plumbed with [...] or [...] water pipes. These small diameter pipes cannot supply water quickly enough to flush the toilet; the tank is needed to supply a large volume of water in a short time. The storage tank is kept full by a tank fill-valve. The storage tank is usually mounted directly upon the bowl, although some tanks are mounted on the wall a few feet above the bowl in an attempt to increase the flush water pressure as it enters the bowl. Tanks near the ceiling are flushed by means of a dangling <b>pull</b> <b>chain,</b> often with a large ornate handle, connected to a flush lever on the cistern itself.

5000|$|A {{drag chain}} or <b>pull</b> <b>chain</b> is a chain shift {{in which the}} phoneme at the [...] "leading" [...] edge of the chain changes first. In the example above, the chain shift would be a <b>pull</b> <b>chain</b> if [...] changed to [...] first, opening up a space at the {{position}} of [...] which [...] then moved to fill. A push chain is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the [...] "end" [...] of the chain moves first: in this example, if [...] moved toward , creating a [...] "crowding" [...] effect and causing [...] to move toward , and so forth. It is not known which phonemes changed first during the Great Vowel Shift; many scholars believe the high vowels such as [...] started the shift, but some suggest that the low vowels, such as , may have shifted first.|$|E

50|$|A finial or hip-knob is {{an element}} marking the top or end of some object, often formed to be a {{decorative}} feature. In architecture it is a decorative device, typically carved in stone, employed decoratively to emphasize the apex of a dome, spire, tower, roof, or gable or any of various distinctive ornaments at the top, end, or corner of a building or structure. Where there are several such elements they may be called pinnacles. Smaller finials in materials such as metal or wood are used as a decorative ornament on the tops or ends of poles or rods such as tent-poles or curtain rods or any object such {{as a piece of}} furniture. These are frequently seen on top of bed posts or clocks. Decorative finials are also commonly used to fasten lampshades, and as an ornamental element {{at the end of the}} handles of souvenir spoons.

5000|$|Soon he {{discovered}} {{that he had to}} design machinery to make its parts. One of the first was a tapping machine, also his patent. Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off <b>pull</b> <b>chain</b> is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. cartridge fuses and fuse block, lamp holders, key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within." [...] Hubbell's pace of new ideas and product design did not falter. In 1909 the company began constructing a four-floor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in New England made of reinforced concrete.|$|E
