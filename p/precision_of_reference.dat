40|$|A superspace {{formulation}} {{is proposed}} for the osp(1, 2) -covariant Lagrangian quantization of general massive gauge theories. The superalgebra os 0 (1, 2) is considered as subalgebra of sl(1, 2); the latter may be considered as the algebra of generators of the conformal group in a superspace with two anticommuting coordinates. The mass-dependent (anti) BRST symmetries of proper solutions of the quantum master equations in the osp(1, 2) -covariant formalism are realized in that superspace as invariance under translations combined with mass-dependent special conformal transformations. The Sp(2) symmetry - in particular the ghost number conservation - and the "new ghost number" conservation are realized as invariance under symplectic rotations and dilatations, respectively. The transformations of the gauge fields - and of the full set of necessarily required (anti) ghost and auxiliary fields - under the superalgebra sl(1, 2) are determined both for irreducible and first-stage reducible theories with closed gauge algebra.

Both single frequency (8. 4 GHz) observations to compare morphologies, and multi-frequency observations (from 330 MHz through 22 GHz) to study scattering behaviour have been carried out. Though scintillation probes the structure of quasars on scales of tens of microarcseconds, information at the milliarcsecond scale probed by these VLBI observations is proving invaluable in furthering our understanding of this phenomenon.

40|$|Motivation: Association rule {{analysis}} methods are important techniques applied to gene expression data for finding expression relationships be-tween genes. However, previous methods implicitly {{assume that all}} genes have similar importance, or they ignore the individual importance of each gene. The relation intensity between any two items has never been taken in to consideration. Therefore, we proposed a technique named REMMAR (RElational-based Multiple Minimum supports Association Rules) algo-rithm to tackle this problem. This method adjusts the minimum relation support (MRS) for each gene pair depending on the regulatory relation intensity to discover more important association rules with stronger biolog-ical meaning. Results: In the actual case study of this research, REMMAR utilized the shortest distance between any two genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene regulatory network (GRN) as the relation intensity to discover the association rules from two Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression datasets. Under experimental evaluation, REMMAR can generate more rules with stronger relation intensity, and filter out rules without biological meaning in the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). Furthermore, the proposed method has a higher precision (100 %) than the <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> Apriori method (86 %) for the discovered rules use a literature survey. Therefore, the proposed REMMAR algorithm can discover stronger association rules in biological relationships dissimilated by traditional methods to assist biologists in complicated genetic exploration.

The accurate determination of stable isotope ratios in plasma first required substantial method development work, as minor iron amounts in plasma had {{to be separated from}} a large organic matrix prior to mass-spectrometric analysis to avoid spectroscopic interferences and shifts in the mass spectrometer's mass-bias. The 56 Fe/ 54 Fe ratio in erythrocytes, expressed as permil difference from the “IRMM- 014 ” iron reference standard (δ 56 / 54 Fe), ranges from − 3. 1 ‰ to − 2. 2 ‰, a range typical for male Caucasian adults. The individual subject erythrocyte iron isotope composition can be regarded as uniform over the 21 days investigated, as variations (± 0. 059 to ± 0. 15 ‰) are mostly within the analytical <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> materials. In plasma, δ 56 / 54 Fe values measured in two different laboratories range from − 3. 0 ‰ to − 2. 0 ‰, and are on average 0. 24 ‰ higher than those in erythrocytes. However, this difference is barely resolvable within one standard deviation of the differences (0. 22 ‰). Taking into account the possible contamination due to hemolysis (iron concentrations are only 0. 4 to 2 ppm in plasma compared to approx. 480 ppm in erythrocytes), we model the pure plasma δ 56 / 54 Fe to be on average 0. 4 ‰ higher than that in erythrocytes. Hence, the plasma iron isotope signature lies between that of the liver and that of erythrocytes.

30|$|The maximum {{precision}} of actual evapotranspiration {{could be obtained}} using lysimeter (Xu and Chen 2005; Valipour 2012 a, b; Valipour 2015 b, c) or imaging techniques (Hart et al. 2009) that their costs are too high. Thus, the FAO Penman–Monteith model (Allen et al. 1998) has been replaced to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration. Although the FAO Penman–Monteith (FPM) has been applied in various {{regions of the world}} (Rahimi et al. 2015; Valipour 2014 m, n, o; Valipour and Eslamian 2014), but it needs too many parameters to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration. In the most regions, as weather data are limited, {{it is not possible to}} use the FPM. Therefore, empirical methods including mass transfer-, radiation-, temperature-, and pan evaporation-based methods have been developed for estimation of the reference crop evapotranspiration using limited data. The mass transfer-based model is one of the most widely used models for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration. Valipour (2014 p, q, r, s, t) studied estimation of evapotranspiration in Iran. The results showed that each province of Iran needs to a specified evapotranspiration equation, if the highest accuracy is desirable. Further examination of the performance resulted in the following rank of precision as compared with the FPM estimates: Priestley-Taylor, Makkink, Hargreaves, Blaney-Criddle, and Rohwer (Xu and Singh 2002). Adjusted Dalton model gives the better estimation of reference crop evapotranspiration compared with adjusted Penman–Monteith model for the Kendall subwatershed (Rim 2000). The top six ranked methods obtained for the average as well as for central Saudi Arabia ratings are ranked in the following order of merit: Jensen-Haise, class A pan, Ivanov, adjusted class A pan, Behnke-Maxey, and Stephens-Stewart (Al-Sha’lan and Salih 1987). Azhar and Perera (2011) calibrated the Meyer model as well as nine other (temperature and radiation-based) models under Southeast Australian Conditions successfully. Zhai et al. (2010) calibrated the Hargreaves, Makkink, Turc, Priestley–Taylor, Jensen–Haise, Doorenbos-Pruitt, Abtew, McGuinness-Bordne, Rohwer, and Blaney–Criddle. It can be concluded that calibration can be used to modify reference crop evapotranspiration equations with multi-station data to improve the <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> crop evapotranspiration estimates in northwest China. Singh and Xu (1997) evaluated the Meyer, Dalton, and Rohwer for determining free water evaporation at four climatological stations in north-western Ontario, Canada. The results of comparison showed that all equations were in reasonable agreement with observed evaporation. More accurate estimation of potential evapotranspiration can help other studies including surface and pressurized irrigation water management (Mahdizadeh Khasraghi et al. 2014; Valipour 2012 c, e, f, g, h, 2013 a, b, c, d, 2014 a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, y, 2015 a, b; Valipour and Montazar 2012 a, b, c), drainage engineering (Valipour 2012 i, j, 2013 g, h, 2014 v, w), environmental studies (Valipour 2012 d, 2013 a, b, 2014 x), and water resources management (Banihabib et al. 2012; Valipour 2012 a, b, c, d, 2013 c, e, f, 2014 u, 2015 a). In the previous studies, one or more of the mass transfer-based models are compared with temperature, radiation, or pan evaporation-based models. In other cases, there are some models which can estimate reference crop evapotranspiration better than the mass transfer-based models. This is because the previous studies focus on specific weather conditions (not suitable for applying the mass transfer-based model) or/and do not consider mass transfer-based models. Moreover, the results of the previous studies are not useable for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration in other regions, because they are recommended for one or more climatic conditions. However, a climatic condition contains various value of weather parameters (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, etc.), and results of each research (for a region with specific weather variations) are not applicable for other regions without determining specified ranges of each weather parameter even if climatic conditions (e.g., humid, arid, semi-arid, temperate, etc.) are the same for both regions. In addition, the governments cannot schedule for irrigation and agricultural water management when reference crop evapotranspiration is estimated for a basin, wetland, watershed, or catchment instead a state or province (different parts of them are located at more than one state or province) and/or number of weather station used is low (increasing uncertainty). Therefore, this study aims to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration for 31 provinces of Iran (considering their usability for long-term and macroeconomic policies of governments and adaptability to various weather conditions) using average data of 181 synoptic station (decreasing uncertainty) and by 11 mass transfer-based models to determine the best model based on the weather conditions of each province (for which the best weather parameters are determined to use other regions and next researches) as well as increasing {{precision of}} the models by calibration of them for each province.|$|E

In the field of cardiac output monitoring, its results, in terms of bias and limits of agreement, are often difficult to interpret, leading clinicians to use a cutoff of 30 % in the percentage error in order to decide whether a new technique may be considered a good alternative. This percen- tage error of ± 30 % arises from {{the assumption that the}} commonly used reference technique, intermittent thermodilution, has a <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> ± 20 % or less. The combination <b>of</b> two <b>precisions</b> <b>of</b> ± 20 % equates to a total error of ± 28. 3 %, which is commonly rounded up to ± 30 %. Thus, finding a percentage error of less than ± 30 % should equate to the new tested technique having an error similar to the reference, which therefore should be acceptable. In a worked example in this paper, we discuss the limitations of this approach, in particular in regard to the situation in which the reference technique may be either more or less precise than would normally be expected. This can lead to inappropriate conclusions being drawn from data acquired in validation studies of new monitoring technologies.

Therefore, there is much value in developing {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms through which power supply noise coupling occurs in this fundamental analog and RF system building block. A model representing the amount of noise coupling in the frequency domain is developed and verified through circuit simulations. A practical design solution for increasing high frequency power supply noise rejection is identified and evaluated. Finally, the effect of technology scaling on power supply noise is studied in two successive CMOS processes...|$|R
40|$|Chlorides are {{responsible}} for initiating steel corrosion in reinforced concrete, the economically most important deterioration mechanism in concrete infrastructure. The quantification of chlorides is commonly performed by wet chemical analysis, e. g. acid dissolution and Volhard's titration. Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometry (EDS) is a powerful tool that can be employed in the detection and quantification of chlorides in cementitious materials. In order to provide fully quantitative analyses, a reference sample must be employed for calibration purposes. In this paper, commercially available microanalysis standard mount and a laboratory-made reference sample were used. Results show that the <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> the lab-made <b>reference</b> mount is suitable for cementitious analysis. Subsequently, chlorides were quantified in mortar specimens with concentrations of 1 and 2 % wt cem. Results show that quantification of chlorides by employing different minerals was {{in the range of}} 0. 8 and 1. 6 % for each sample, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Judgements {{upon the}} CE-compliance of {{products}} are of great economic importance. Therefore, the calibration of field sensors for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) susceptibility {{testing in the}} frequency range of 80 – 1000 MHz calls for traceability, optimum accuracy and economy. In the Seibersdorf calibration laboratory, this has been achieved by application of a TEM-cell and a set <b>of</b> <b>precision</b> <b>reference</b> dipoles. A broadband reference sensor is calibrated {{on the basis of}} these high-precision primary standards with an expanded uncertainty (at two standard deviations) of 0. 4 dB. Routine calibrations are performed by an economized, swept-frequency substitution method using the reference sensor. The expanded uncertainty is 0. 5 dB, providing a reliable basis for industrial EMC measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Results are reported for: (1) subscene registration, (2) full scene rectification and registration, (3) resampling techniques, (4) and ground control point (GCP) extraction. Subscenes (354 pixels x 234 lines) were registered to approximately 1 / 4 pixel accuracy and evaluated by change detection imagery for three cases: (1) bulk data registration, (2) <b>precision</b> correction <b>of</b> a <b>reference</b> subscene using GCP data, and (3) independently precision processed subscenes. Full scene rectification and registration results {{were evaluated by}} using a correlation technique to measure registration errors of 0. 3 pixel rms thoughout the full scene. Resampling evaluations of nearest neighbor and TRW cubic convolution processed data included change detection imagery and feature classification. Resampled data were also evaluated for an MSS scene containing specular solar reflections...|$|R
40|$|In this study, sediments were {{collected}} from the Detroit River - Lake Erie waterway and subjected to a sequential extraction procedure in order to evaluate the <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> the procedure and determine metal partitioning and concentrations of Pb, Zn, Ni, Cu and Cr. The samples were subjected to a three stage sequential extraction procedure. The three phases that were separated out were (1) carbonate, exchangeable and adsorbed (AEC) fraction; (2) organic material (ORG); and (3) Fe-Mn oxides (RED). Metal concentrations were determined by ICP-OES. The metal concentrations and distribution among three sediment fractions were scrutinised {{in the context of}} other sediment characteristics including grain-size, total carbon and total major element data. <b>Precision</b> <b>of</b> certified <b>reference</b> materials indicated the sequential extraction procedure produced good to excellent results aside from zinc contamination within the procedure. The highest metal concentration of Pb, Cu, Zn and Cr were found in Lake St. Clair sediment at site LS 17, adjacent to the shipping channels and in the deeper part of the Lake. Ni, Cu and Zn recorder higher concentrations than released in previous reports. The trace metals were primarily released from the less labile reducible step of the extraction excepting for lead which favoured the AEC step. Lower metal levels were recorded in Detroit River sediment but Detroit River sediment recorded higher proportions of the more labile metal forms. Dept. of Earth Sciences.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an all-digital {{frequency}} synthesizer using interpolation techniques. Unlike the traditional {{direct digital synthesizer}} (DDS) which requires a large look-up table to store the phase and its corresponding sine wave, our new design contains only a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) and two banks of memory to store the two reference sequences. This can achieve a cost-efficient design. The novelty of this idea lies in that one can synthesize the desired frequency between these two reference frequencies through a threshold device. The frequency resolution of this synthesizer {{is determined by the}} order of the LFSR. The maximal spur around the synthesized frequency may be controlled by the numerical <b>precision</b> <b>of</b> these two <b>reference</b> frequencies. The percentage error of the synthesized frequency is identical to that of the system clock. This design is mainly used in implementing an economical digital modulator for continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) and other related wireless communication arts. I...|$|R
