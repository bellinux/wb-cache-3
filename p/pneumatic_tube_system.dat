2500|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> <b>system</b> ran {{throughout}} the Cleveland Trust Company Building, connecting tellers to bookkeepers and each department. A telautograph was also located in each department. This device enabled a handwritten message to be reproduced at the receiving station. The building also had 76 telephones (quite {{a large number}} for the era), and two private telephone exchanges in the building to accommodate telephone traffic. The building also had a central vacuum cleaner system and a primitive air conditioning system known as [...] "artificial ventilation" [...] were built into the plaster-coated columns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} has three floors below ground. Originally only two below-ground floors were planned, but a third was added during the review process. The top two {{floors of the}} northern (E Street) structure housed the fingerprint bureau. Special features of the building included a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> <b>system</b> and a conveyor belt system for handling mail and files. A special, reinforced, extra-thick [...] "protection slab" [...] existed beneath the second floor to help protect the building from street-level explosions. A gravel-filled dry moat ran along the building on E Street NW.|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago {{architectural}} firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst and White, {{the successor to}} D.H. Burnham & Company, designed the structure, originally known as Pennsylvania Station–30th Street {{in accord with the}} naming style of other Pennsylvania Stations. [...] Its design was influenced by the Northeast Corridor electrification that allowed trains to pass beneath the station without exposing passengers to soot as steam engines of earlier times had. The station had a number of innovative features, including a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> <b>system,</b> an electronic intercom, and a reinforced roof with space for small aircraft to land, and contained a mortuary, a chapel and more than 3,000 square feet of hospital space.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> <b>systems</b> play an {{important}} material handling role in many hospitals. These systems are costly and complex to design and operate, yet little exists {{in the way of}} analytical methodologies for them. We present a decision support framework based on defining relevant system performance metrics, traffic analysis reporting, as well as discrete event simulation modeling. We have used this approach to analyze numerous <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>systems</b> in the United States and present a representative case study from a large tertiary care hospital. Our general approach can be generalized to other computer controlled hospital operational systems such as elevators, track vehicles, automatic guided vehicles, workflow enabled processes, and laboratory automation <b>systems.</b> KEY WORDS: <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> system; decision support; simulation; material handling...|$|R
2500|$|Bids {{for work}} on the $68 million {{superstructure}} were opened in May 1971, and the job again awarded to Blake Construction. In December 1971, GSA announced {{that the cost of}} the building had risen by $7 million in the past year (to $109 million) due to inflation, a major design change, and the cost of the building's unusual features. The design change added [...] of office space, but also included special blast-proof paving around the building. Just a month later, in January 1972, GSA reported that the cost of the building had risen to $126.108 million. A new completion date of July 1974 was also announced. GSA later capped the building's cost at $126.108 million in August 1972. The agency blamed the cost increase on inflation; the use of different contracts for excavation, substructure construction, and superstructure construction; the construction of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> <b>system,</b> reinforced flooring, and a special fire detection and suppression system; and the unique requirements of the areas for the fingerprinting bureau. The agency also said that NCPC and CFA alterations increased the cost by $7.465 million.|$|E
