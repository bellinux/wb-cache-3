In this paper, a feasibility study of dissimilar materials joint between 7075 aluminium alloy and <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>sheet</b> was conducted by using friction stir welding through butt joint. A series of friction stir welding experiments were executed at various levels in order to obtain good joint. The preliminary results indicated that 7075 aluminium alloy and <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>sheet</b> were successfully joined with the aid of frictional heat energy originated from the friction stir welding process. The formation of 7075 aluminium alloy dislocation at the <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>sheet</b> side was clearly observed at the welding interface, which believed to be contributing to the weld strength.

50|$|There are {{two methods}} to {{manufacture}} faceshields, extrusion and injection molding. Faceshields cut from extrusion sheets provide better impact resistance than injection molding faceshields because extrusion sheets {{are made of}} high molecular weight plastic pellets while injection molding must use lower molecular weight plastic pellets, which provide better melt flowing property needed by injection molding. For example, even 0.8 mm thickness faceshields made of extrusion <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>sheets</b> can withstand {{the impact of a}} 6 mm nominal diameter steel ball traveling at the speed 120 m/s (European standard, protection against high-speed particles - medium energy impact), while injection molding faceshields must have at least 1.5 mm thickness to withstand the same impact.

TIV 2 was designed to address some of the problems experienced with the original TIV, namely its low ground clearance, lack of four-wheel drive, and low top speed. It is based on a Dodge Ram 3500 that was strengthened and converted to six-wheel drive by adding a third axle. After season two the six-wheel drive system was modified to four-wheel drive. It is powered by a 6.7-liter Cummins turbo charged Diesel engine, modified with propane and water injection to produce [...] This gives TIV 2 an estimated top speed of over 100 mi/h km/h. Its fuel capacity is 95 gal, giving TIV 2 an approximate range of 750 mi. The body of TIV 2 is constructed of a 1/8-inch steel skin welded over a 2 in square tubing steel frame. The windows in TIV 2 are all bullet-resistant 1.63 in interlayered <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>sheets</b> and tempered glass. TIV 2 also features an IMAX filming turret similar to the one on the original TIV.

Photoelasticity analysis showed that MW-assisted curing causes localized overheating of the samples, inducing a state of residual plane stresses that bring about dimensional instability of the coated material. Instrumented scratch tests for the coated samples revealed an increase of 1 order of magnitude in the minimal load at which a scratch track appears on the sample surface.
