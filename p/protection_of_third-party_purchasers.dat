Existing defenses against ROP exploits either require source code or symbolic debugging information, or impose a significant runtime overhead, which limits their applicability for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>third-party</b> applications. Aiming for a practical mitication against ROP attacks, we introduce in-place code randomization, a software diversification technique that can be applied directly on third-party software. Our method uses various narrow-scope code transformations that can be applied statically, without changing the location of basic blocks, allowing the safe randomization of stripped binaries even with partial disassembly coverage. We demonstrate how in-place code randomization can prevent the exploitation of vulnerable Windows 7 applications, including Adobe Reader, as well as the automated construction of reliable ROP payloads.

40|$|Objectives China's {{government}} {{has decided to}} increase government funding by 1 - 1. 5 % of the Gross Domestic Products {{in the health care}} sector. However, it is still a question how to turn the new funding into efficient health care. Methods To help to answer this question we analyze three prototype models of organizing the health care system that may be relevant for China, namely the "Government provision model", the "regulated market with non-competing third-party purchasers", and the "regulated market with competing third-party purchasers". The pre- and post-reform English health care system and the present Dutch health care system are used as examples of the three models. During the last 20 years these countries had, just as China, major health care reforms from a national centrally planned system to a market-based system. Based on the experiences in these countries we analyze {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these three prototype models and discuss their relevance for China. Results and conclusions We conclude that the creation <b>of</b> prudent <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers,</b> who have the incentive and ability to act on behalf of individual consumers, is a critical success factor, whatever model China chooses to implement.

Our method uses various narrow-scope code transformations that can be applied statically, without changing the location of basic blocks, allowing the safe randomization of stripped binaries even with partial disassembly coverage. These transformations effectively eliminate about 10 %, and probabilistically break about 80 % of the useful instruction sequences found in a large set of PE files.

Our evaluation using publicly available ROP exploits and two ROP code generation toolkits demonstrates that our technique prevents the exploitation of the tested vulnerable Windows 7 applications, including Adobe Reader, as well as the automated construction of alternative ROP payloads that aim to circumvent in-place code randomization using solely any remaining unaffected instruction sequences.

This thesis will focus on the behaviour of health care providers and some of the existing tools which might help to eliminate inefficiencies their behaviour causes. The crucial hypothesis this paper was built upon concerns the imperfect agency problem of the health care providers. The attention is paid to a particular sort of tools represented by various payment mechanisms implemented in the health systems within the relationship between the health care providers and the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers.</b> The paper revises some of the most common payment methods, their diversity, advantages and limitations. This thesis presents a simple theoretical model which provides a comparison of some payment mechanisms focusing on their enhancement of cost-efficiency, prevention, creation of waiting lists and production of health care. The analysis is based on utility functions of three important actors of the health systems; health care providers, <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and patients...|$|R

40|$|In many (predominantly) {{publicly}} financed {{health care}} systems market-oriented health care reforms are being implemented or have been proposed. The purpose of these reforms is to make resource allocation in health care more efficient, more innovative and more responsive to consumers preferences while maintaining equity. At the same time, the advances in technology result in a divergence of consumers' preferences with respect to health care and urge society to (re) think {{about the meaning of}} the solidarity principle in health care. In this paper we indicate some international trends in health care reforms and explore some potential future options. From an international perspective we can observe a trend towards universal mandatory health insurance, contracts between <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and the providers of care, competition among providers of care and a strengthening of primary care. These trends can be expected to continue. A more controversial issue is whether there should also be competition among the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and whether in the long run there will occur a convergence towards some "ideal" model. Although regulated competition in health care can be expected to yield more value for money, it might yield both more efficiency and higher total costs. It has been argued that equity can be maintained in a competitive health care system if we interpret equity as "equal access to cost-effective care within a reasonable period of time". Because the effectiveness of care has to be considered in relation to the medical indication and the condition of the patient, the responsibility for cost-effective care rests primarily with the providers of care. Guidelines and protocols should be developed by the profession and sustained by financial incentives embedded in contracts. It has been argued that the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> could start to concentrate on the contracts with the primary care physicians. Contracts with other providers could then be a natural complement to these contracts. Coordinated-care contracts between the <b>third-party</b> <b>purchasers</b> and the consumer of care could provide the consumer with monetary incentives to go to efficient providers. A consumer choice of insurance contract could give the consumer an opportunity to make important choices in health care. However, each society has to make its own choices about what care should be available to everybody independent of an individual's purchasing power. health care reforms regulated competition cost-effectiveness choices in health care...|$|R

This analysis is informed by a critical comparison of the current English doctrine, alongside the US system and the proposals from UNCITRAL. It is argued that attempts to regulate a world of integrated goods (whereby goods and software are inextricably interconnected), through unintegrated regimes of legal governance of security interests over goods and IPRs, is unsustainable. It will thus be argued that reform of security interest law generally (to bring about a functional system of security) and a single register for security interests whether over goods or IPRs is necessary.

The second technique is based on the detection of abnormal control transfers that take place during ROP code execution. This is achieved using hardware features of commodity processors, which incur negligible runtime overhead and allow for completely transparent operation without requiring any modifications to the protected applications. Our implementation for Windows 7, named kBouncer, can be selectively enabled for installed programs in the same fashion as user-friendly mitigation toolkits like Microsoft's EMET. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that kBouncer has low runtime overhead of up to 4 %, when stressed with specially crafted workloads that continuously trigger its core detection component, while it has negligible overhead for actual user applications. In our experiments with in-the-wild ROP exploits, kBouncer successfully protected all tested applications, including Internet Explorer, Adobe Flash Player, and Adobe Reader. In addition, we introduce a technique that enables ASLR for executables with stripped relocation information by incrementally adjusting stale absolute addresses at runtime. The technique relies on runtime monitoring of memory accesses and control flow transfers to the original location of a module using page table manipulation. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed technique for Windows 8, which is transparently applicable to third-party stripped binaries. Our results demonstrate that incremental runtime relocation patching is practical, incurs a runtime overhead of up to 83 % in most of the cases for initial runs of protected programs, and has a low runtime overhead of 5 % on subsequent runs...|$|R
