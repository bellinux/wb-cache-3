40|$|A {{study was}} made on axial {{reflexion}} of the kidneys and kinking of the ureter, {{to be caused by}} a change in posture, by taking pyelography of 105 individuals. The following observations were made: 1. It was shown that downward displacement of the kidneys, if it was within 5 cm., was normal in both men and women. There was a greater downward displacement in men than in women, and in the left kidneys than in the right one. 2. The normal position occupied by the lower <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kidney</b> in terms of spinal vertebral height corresponded to lumbar III-IV in supine position and lumbar IV in upright position. In both upright and supine positions, the positions occupied by the kidneys were higher than that occupied by the right one. 3. Many individuals had a smaller pelvic-spinal angle in upright position than in supine position. Some, however, showed abnormal angles. 4. The pelvic long axis showed a markedly smaller value in upright position than in supine position; in some, the value of pelvic long axis in upright position was less than two-thirds as much as the value of pelvic long axis in supine position. 5. Downward displacement of the kidneys caused a deformity of the ureter to occur. Generally speaking, the deformity was seen in upper one-third of the ureter in many instances...|$|E
40|$|Absrracr. Thirty-three {{cases of}} canine renal {{carcinoma}} reported between 1907 and 1972 are reviewed, and clinical and pathological features of nine other cases seen in Bristol between 1966 and 1975 are described. Clinical features frequently include nonspecific signs of anorexia and weight loss. The age range of affected dogs varies from 3 to 15 years, {{with a mean}} of 7. 1 years. Male dogs appear to be affected more frequently than females, but there is no breed predilection. The clinical behaviour of canine renal carcinoma is variable, with 4 years the longest survival time after nephrectomy. The primary tumours characteristically are large and unilateral and occupy most of one <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kidney.</b> Metastatic spread can involve a wide range of organs, the commonest being lymph nodes and lung. Solid, tubular and papillary patterns are common. Clear cell carcinoma is uncommon. Although renal carcinoma in the dog is relatively rare it is the commonest primary neoplasm of the kidney. There {{have been a number of}} case reports of this tumour, but few pathologists see more than occasional examples, and current textbooks of veterinary pathology give only a general account of the neoplasm. It has been reported that widespread metastases have usually occurred by the time the tumour is diagnosed [II, 181. Our observations suggest that extended survival may follow nephrectomy. We have also found that renal carcinoma may occur in younger dogs. The literature on this neoplasm is reviewed, and clinical and pathological features of nine cases of canine renal carcinoma seen in Bristol between 1966 and 1975 are reported. Review of the Literature The main features of the cases published between 1907 and 1972 are shown in table I.

40|$|The growing use of {{maternal}} fetal ultrasound {{is leading to}} the discovery <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increasing number <b>of</b> suprarenal masses. Our experience with a cystic suprarenal mass detected on antenatal ultrasound is described. Location and radiographic features could {{not rule out the}} possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cystic neuroblastoma; therefore, surgical resection of the mass was performed. Despite the absence of common radiologic characteristics, the pathology of the specimen revealed <b>a</b> non-functioning upper <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> duplex <b>kidney</b> with complete duplication of the collecting system.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} yield of {{neonatal}} renal ultrasonography as <b>a</b> predictor <b>of</b> abnormalities on voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). Study design: We prospectively followed 264 infants with antenatal renal pelvis dilation. Two successive neonatal renal ultrasound examinations were performed at day 5 and 1 month after birth. VCUG {{was performed in}} all infants. Results: Neonatal ultrasound findings were abnormal in 190 infants (72 % of total). Among them, 63 (33 %) had an abnormal VCUG. The most common abnormalities were primary vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) in 30 infants, VUR into the lower <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> duplex <b>kidney</b> in 14, refluxing megaureter in 9, posterior urethral valves in 5, and ureterocele in 5. When both neonatal ultrasound findings were normal (74 infants), the VCUG showed abnormalities in only 5 (6. 7 %) patients (4 low-grade primary VUR and 1 posterior urethral valve). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 2 successive ultrasound scans in the neonatal period to predict an abnormality on VCUG were 93 %, 35 %, 33 %, and 93 %, respectively. Conclusions: A normal-appearing urinary tract on 2 successive neonatal ultrasound scans rarely coexists with abnormal findings at VCUG. Therefore, in such patients, VCUG does not seem justified.

40|$|Objective: Multicystic dysplastic <b>kidney</b> (MCDK) is <b>a</b> {{developmental}} anomaly {{believed to}} be <b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> either early in utero urinary tract obstruction or failure of union between the ureteric bud and the metanephric blastema. Concomitant finding of MCDK and ipsilateral obstructive ureterocele may further support the obstructive theory. We aimed to explore the possible linkage between MCDK and ipsilateral obstructive ureterocele. Materials and Methods: Ultrasonographic imaging and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) of children diagnosed with MCDK were retrospectively reviewed. Results: <b>A</b> total <b>of</b> 28 children with MCDK were included, all of whom underwent ultrasonography and 16 underwent VCUG. Ten of the 16 children (62 %) who underwent VCUG had vesicoureteral reflux, none of which was to the MCDK. Twenty of 28 children (71 %) had MCDK replacing the entire kidney, among whom seven (35 %) had an ipsilateral ureterocele on bladder imaging. Eight of 28 children (29 %) had segmental disease, all involving the upper <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> duplex <b>kidney</b> (right, 4; left, 4). All four left-sided kidneys with segmental MCDKs had an associated ipsilateral ureterocele. Conclusion: Our data highlight the fact that MCDK is frequently identified with <b>a</b> concomitant finding <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ipsilateral ureterocele, which should be carefully sought whenever MCDK is identified. The reported association strongly supports the theory of MCDK development as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> in utero urinary tract obstruction...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathological findings in 150 children submitted to partial or total nephrectomy have been reviewed. Histological {{examination of the}} kidney removed at operation showed evidence of renal dysplasia in 76 (51 %). These 76 patients were divided into three main groups {{on the basis of}} the pathological changes found in the kidney and the associated urinary tract anomalies. In group 1, gross cystic renal dysplasia was associated with absence or atresia of the renal pelvis and ureter. In group 2, renal dysplasia was segmental; the ureter, although patent, had some anatomical or functional abnormality which resulted in urinary stasis or reflux. In many of these patients dysplasia was confined to the upper <b>pole</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> `duplex' <b>kidney</b> which was drained by an ectopic ureterocele. In group 3, renal dysplasia was associated with obstruction of the lower urinary tract, most commonly by posterior urethral valves. In group 1 dysplasia was total, involving the whole kidney, whilst in groups 2 and 3 dysplasia tended to be segmental; in the majority some normal renal tissue was present. Pyelonephritis was a very common complication, but was present only in patients from groups 2 and 3, in whom a lumen was present in the draining ureter, and not in patients from group 1 in whom the ureter was atretic or absent, and the kidney not functioning. It appears that urinary obstruction, stasis, or reflux are the principal factors predisposing to and promoting pyelonephritis in dysplastic kidneys. There seems to be no reason to suppose that dysplastic renal tissue is abnormally susceptible to infection since pyelonephritic changes were lacking in those cases in which dysplasia was most severe...|$|R
