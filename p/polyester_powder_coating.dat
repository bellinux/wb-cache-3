The shopping centre {{consists of two}} main buildings (East and West Mall) which are connected by an underground passage lined with shops and is also accessible from St Martin's Square via glass doors. The doors to both wings from New Street can be removed when crowds get large and queues develop at the doors. This feature also allows cars for display to be driven into the building. They are sheltered by a glass roof known as the SkyPlane which covers [...] and appears to have no visible means of support. The two malls are different internally in design. The balustrades in the East Mall consist of integrated glass 'jewels' within the metal framework, and are of different colours formed through <b>polyester</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating.</b> Touchscreen computers, developed by Calm Digital, are located throughout the building which allow a user {{to search for the}} location of a certain store or browse a map of the complex. It features a dramatic landmark building, housing a branch of Selfridges department store to a design by the Future Systems architectural practice. The store is clad in 15,000 shiny aluminium discs and was inspired by a Paco Rabanne sequinned dress. The Selfridges store cost £60 million and the contractor was Laing O'Rourke. Covering an area of , the designs for the Selfridges store were first unveiled in 1999, not long before demolition of the original shopping centre began. The Selfridges store has won eight awards including the RIBA Award for Architecture 2004 and Destination of the Year Retail Week Awards 2004.|$|E

Different types of zincplated surfaces have been investigated. Selected hybrid polymer nano-composites have been applied on various zinc surfaces in a dip coating process and finally provided with a standard <b>polyester</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating.</b> The performance of these samples have then been compared with relevant, commercially available anti-corrosion systems in defined test procedures in order to assess the adhesion strength and the degree of corrosion of the laminated composites.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the mechanical response of thermoset polymers under high compressive loads. The study {{is divided into}} two parts. The first part focuses on the behaviour of a powder coating when used in a clamping force joint and how the properties vary when the chemical and physical structure of the coating is changed. The second part discusses the fundamental understanding of the behaviour of thermoset polymers with small thickness-to-width ratio subjected to compressive stresses, the aim being to develop mathematical material models for viscoelastic materials under high compressive loads. In the first part polyester powder coatings were used with variations in molecular weight, number of functional groups of the resin, amount and type of filler and thickness of the coating. The coatings were subjected to conventional tests for coatings and polymers and also to specially designed tests developed to study the behaviour of powder coatings in clamping force joints. The high compressive loads in a clamping force joint put high demands on the relaxation and creep resistance of the coating and the study shows the importance of crosslink density, filler content, and also coating thickness in order to achieve the desired mechanical properties of a coating. A high reactivity of the resin, facilitating a high crosslink density and hence a high Tg, is the most important property of the coating. A film with high crosslink density shows increase in relaxation time and in apparent yield strength under compression, and also an increase in relaxation modulus and storage modulus in tension at temperatures above Tg. Addition of fillers reduces the deformation during compression and tension, but also induces a lower strain at break and hence a more brittle coating. The reinforcing effect of the fillers is pronounced when increasing the crosslink density of the coating, especially in the compression tests. The effect is evident in compression even at low amounts of fillers, where the relaxation time and resistance to deformation are strongly increased. The combination of high crosslink density and addition of fillers is therefore desirable since fillers then can be used moderately in order to achieve a reinforcing effect in compression while minimising embrittlement. The study also showed that increased coating thickness will give rise to defects in the coating, especially voids and blisters due to evaporation of water formed during the curing of the <b>polyester</b> <b>powder</b> <b>coating.</b> These defects will give rise to stress concentrations and increased plastic deformations in the coating, impairing the properties of the clamping force joint. The results from relaxation tests in tension were used to create a micromechanical model. This model was used in finite element modelling to estimate the loss of clamping force in a screw joint and to correlate with the experimental results of the powder coatings. In {{the second part of the}} study a well-defined free radically cured vinyl ester resin was used and studied in six different geometries in order to determine the dependence of apparent mechanical properties on the particular size and shape of a sample when it is subjected to high compressive loads. Variation of the specimen thickness, boundary conditions and loading conditions reveals that the geometry of the sample has a significant effect on the mechanical performance of the polymer. The apparent modulus and the yield strength increase dramatically when the thickness-to-width ratio of the sample is reduced, whereas they decrease when the friction between the sample and the compression plate is reduced. The creep strain rate decreases when the thickness of the material is reduced and it decreases even more when the amount of material surrounding the compressed part of the sample is increased. Creep and strain recovery tests on large specimens were used to develop a mathematical model including non-linear viscoelastic and viscoplastic response of a thermoset vinyl ester. The model was used in FEM calculations where the experimental results were compared with the calculated results in order to model the trends of the material response when varying the sample geometry.

40|$|Free {{brackets}} used {{in sections}} susceptible to salt damage {{need to be}} replaced before reaching their expected service life due to severe corrosion, and thus development of highly corrosion-resistant free brackets is demanded. Possible measures to improve corrosion prevention performance include replacing the material of free brackets with a material having higher corrosion prevention performance such as weather-resistant steel and stainless steel or applying double rust prevention where zinc hot dip galvanized steel is further coated. In the previous development of beams for sections susceptible to salt damage, we compared and verified those measures and attained the conclusion that the best measure is double rust prevention <b>coating</b> with saturated <b>polyester</b> <b>powder</b> (so-called Terry <b>powder</b> <b>coating).</b> 1) Based on that conclusion, we decided to develop a free bracket and a stem insulator <b>coated</b> with saturated <b>polyester</b> <b>powder</b> for sections susceptible to salt damage.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent a liquid epoxy {{cross-linker}} from premature, Arrhenius-law predicted, reaction with an acid-functional polyester resin, the liquid cross-linker has been physically separated from the resin by encapsulation while release is only possible by a temperature-controlled trigger. The glass transition temperature Tg of the polymeric encapsulant was used to trigger the softening of the polymeric capsule. Epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) cross-linker was encapsulated as 0. 1 µm diameter droplets in 16 µm diameter microparticles (poly(N-vinyl) pyrrolidone) (PVP) by means of spray-drying. The resulting nano-composite microparticles were used to cross-link the acid functional <b>polyester</b> in a <b>powder</b> <b>coating.</b> It was found that below Tg the encapsulation considerably slows down the (premature) cross-link reaction. Beyond Tg also a slowdown was found {{but in this case}} it was caused by the mere presence of PVP rather than by the state of encapsulation of the cross-linker: PVP as a strong hydron bond acceptor slows down the reaction of epoxy with the acid groups of the polyester.

The reversible work of adhesion should be considered too, for it has proven to be a good measure to describe adhesion phenomena. The surface tension of the melted <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> and the substrate should be determined with their dispersive and polar fractions.

The investigations, clinical and chemical, strongly indicate degradation of TGIC in the test preparation and powder. Both substances and the test preparations made from them may change over time. Therefore, if a false-negative reaction due to a test preparation is strongly suspected, we recommend a re-test of the patient with a new test preparation of fresh material.

40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} and experimental work {{has shown that}} surface tension gradients in liquid layers create surface defects and inhibit the levelling of an uneven surface.

We provide experimental evidence that lateral gradients in the surface tension of the polymer melt, resulting from the non-uniform distribution of the flow agent, inhibit the levelling of the surface. Specifically, the surface roughness of a <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> is up to three times greater when a steep surface tension gradient is purposely created through powder blending.
