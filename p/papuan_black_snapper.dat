50|$|The <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake (Pseudechis papuanus) is a venomous snake of {{the family}} Elapidae native to New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake is one {{of several}} species in the genus Pseudechis {{commonly}} known as black snakes. A study of mitochondrial DNA showed the <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake to be the next closest relative to a pair of Australian species, Collett's Snake (P. collettii) and the blue-bellied black snake (P. guttatus), and is likely to have had its origins in Australia and diverged from a common ancestor in the Pliocene.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> myzomela (Myzomela nigrita) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Meliphagidae.It is found in New Guinea and nearby islands.Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests.|$|R
50|$|The {{first to}} extract <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake venom for {{scientific}} purposes was Australian herpetologist Ken Slater in the mid-1950s. He sent it to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne for antivenom research.|$|R
5000|$|The black {{rockfish}} (Sebastes melanops, {{also known}} variously {{as the black}} seaperch, black bass, black rock cod, sea bass, <b>black</b> <b>snapper,</b> and Pacific Ocean perch) is a rockfish of the genus Sebastes. It is sometimes misidentified as the [...] "red snapper." ...|$|R
50|$|Belgian naturalist George Albert Boulenger {{described}} the species in 1902, naming it {{in honour of}} Norwegian zoologist Robert Collett. A young snake had been collected by Collett, and Boulenger had noted its scale pattern to be distinct from the <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake.|$|R
50|$|Collett's snake is one {{of several}} species in the genus Pseudechis {{commonly}} known as black snakes. A study of mitochondrial DNA showed it to be most closely related to the blue-bellied black snake (P. guttatus), with the <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake (P. papuanus) as the next closest relative to the pair.|$|R
50|$|DNA {{analysis}} has shown honeyeaters {{to be related}} to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in a large Meliphagoidea superfamily. The <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> myzomela, (Myzomela nigrita), found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea is also known as the black honeyeater. It is a different but related species.|$|R
5000|$|Black bass {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a multitude of unrelated fish species found around the world and called [...] "bass", such as the butterfly peacock bass (Cichla ocellaris), speckled peacock bass (Cichla temensis), <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> bass (Lutjanus goldiei) (also called Niugini bass), Australian bass, rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), American striped bass, and British sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax).|$|R

50|$|The venom {{produced}} by the Collett's snake {{is similar to the}} <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake's and mulga snake's venom. The venom is cytotoxic and has haemolytic activity. Neurotoxins may also be found in its venom as well. Collett's produce around about 30 milligrams of venom in one strike. Black snake or tiger snake anti-venom can be administered. It is the world's nineteenth most venomous snake.|$|R
50|$|Slater was an {{experienced}} snake collector and snake milker. In his Papua New Guinea years he supplied the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories {{with their first}} samples of Papuan Taipan venom. He also provided all the <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake venom CSL used to develop and produce an antivenom for the species. This antivenom {{turned out to be}} effective for bites of the king brown snake as well. In 1955 CSL provided Slater, Worrell and Ram Chandra with some of the first doses of Taipan antivenom, in recognition of the dangers involved in their work.|$|R
40|$|It {{is thought}} that the {{incidence}} of snakebite in Australia is falling, with an estimated 1000 – 3000 snakebites each year. 1, 2 There has also been a dramatic fall in the incidence of antivenom use. 3 Reasons for the falling incidence of snakebite in Australia include both decreasing numbers of venomous and other snakes and decreasing human exposure to snakes because of lifestyle and demographic changes. 3 Proposed factors affecting snake populations include increasing urban development, especially in coastal regions, the spread of the introduced cane toad (Bufo marinus) whose poisonous secretions are thought to be in part responsible for the demise of frog-eating snakes, such as the red-bellied black snake in Queensland and the <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snake in Papua New Guinea, an...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>black</b> {{and white}} <b>snapper</b> can reach a maximum length of 75 cm, though most do not exceed 35 cm. [...] Its fins and eyes {{are black and}} its body varies in color from light grey to black {{depending}} on age. Juveniles are typically striped, changing in complete black when adult. The <b>black</b> and white <b>snapper</b> is solitary when juvenile, but forms large schools as adults. They feed on crustaceans and small fishes. [...] It is sometimes confused with its congener, the midnight snapper, M. macularis.|$|R
50|$|The {{mangrove}} snapper can {{be confused}} with the Cubera <b>snapper</b> or <b>black</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus cyanopterus. Mangrove snapper are typically much smaller than Cubera, but when they are of similar size, the two species can only be distinguished by examining the tooth patch on the inside roof of the mouth. Many specimens caught in Florida, specifically Punta Gorda, are actually misidentified dogtooth or dog snapper, Lutjanus jocu. The best way to distinguish between the two species is dog snapper has a lighter triangle of color with a blue band under the eye and large, sharp fangs in the front (canines), hence its common name. These fangs can deliver a painful bite, even in a small fish. The mangrove snapper feeds mostly on small fishes and crustaceans. It was also observed as systematically waiting under maternal colony of Buffy flower bat for falling bats near the entrances of Lucayan cavern, Bahamas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> {{and white}} <b>snapper</b> are prized as food fish and are caught commercially, {{as well as}} recreationally. This species {{can also be found}} in the {{aquarium}} trade.|$|R
40|$|Among 335 {{patients}} presenting with snakebites in Central Province, Papua New Guinea, nine were proved by {{enzyme immunoassay}} {{to have been}} bitten by <b>Papuan</b> <b>black</b> snakes (Pseudechis papuanus). Seven showed clinical evidence of envenoming. Early symptoms included vomiting and tender local lymph nodes. Five patients had neurotoxic signs and one required mechanical ventilation. Spontaneous systemic bleeding occurred in two patients. Coagulation studies in four patients showed thrombocytopenia, prolongation of prothrombin time, mild defibrination and depletion of other clotting factors with elevated fibrin(ogen) degradation products and other evidence of fibrinolysis. One patient developed mild renal dysfunction. There {{was no evidence of}} intravascular haemolysis or rhabdomyolysis. These clinical observations, which do not distinguish victims of P. papuanus from those of taipans (Oxyuranus scutellatus canni), suggest that the venom contains neurotoxic, haemorrhagic and mild procoagulant activities. Only two other cases of proven envenoming by this species have been reported. There {{appears to have been a}} decline in the abundance of this species, and hence its medical importance, over the last 25 years...|$|R
2500|$|The {{species has}} {{also failed to}} become as a food fish and {{commercial}} resource for the islands, because of low market prices. [...] Since it competes with more commercially valuable fish, most fishers {{view it as a}} pest. Since 2008, Hawaii has conducted a series of spearfishing contests that targeted bluestripes, along with blue-spotted groupers and <b>black</b> tail <b>snappers</b> with the intent of removing these fish from Hawaiian waters.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> {{and white}} <b>snapper,</b> Macolor niger, is {{a species of}} snapper native to the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. It is an {{inhabitant}} of reefs, occurring in large schools along steeply sloping substrates at depths from 2 to 90 m.|$|R

60|$|Dec. 22d.-The swell {{had gone}} down. We passed Boutong, a large island, high, woody, and populous, the native place {{of some of}} our crew. A small prau {{returning}} from Bali to the island of Goram overtook us. The nakoda (captain) was known to our owner. They had been two years away, but were full of people, with several <b>black</b> <b>Papuans</b> on board. At 6 P.M. we passed Wangiwangi, low but not flat, inhabited and subject to Boutong. We had now fairly entered the Molucca Sea. After dark it was a beautiful sight to look down on our rudders, from which rushed eddying streams of phosphoric light gemmed with whirling sparks of fire. It resembled (more nearly than anything else to which I can compare it) one of the large irregular nebulous star-clusters seen through a good telescope, with the additional attraction of ever-changing form and dancing motion.|$|R
60|$|Dag Daughtry, who {{had kept}} always footloose and never married, {{surveyed}} the boat-load of his responsibilities {{to which he}} was anchored--Kwaque, the <b>Black</b> <b>Papuan</b> monstrosity whom he had saved from the bellies of his fellows; Ah Moy, the little old sea-cook whose age was problematical only by decades; the Ancient Mariner, the dignified, the beloved, and the respected; gangly Big John, the youthful Scandinavian with the inches of a giant and the mind of a child; Killeny Boy, the wonder of dogs; Scraps, the outrageously silly and fat-rolling puppy; Cocky, the white-feathered mite of life, imperious as a steel-blade and wheedlingly seductive as a charming child; and even the forecastle cat, the lithe and tawny slayer of rats, sheltering between the legs of Ah Moy. And the Marquesas were two hundred miles distant full-hauled on the tradewind which had ceased but which was as sure to live again as the morning sun in the sky.|$|R
60|$|So sailed the Ship of Fools--Michael {{playing with}} Scraps, {{respecting}} Cocky and by Cocky being bullied and wheedled, singing with Steward and worshipping him; Daughtry drinking his six quarts of beer each day, collecting his wages {{the first of}} each month, and admiring Charles Stough Greenleaf as the finest man on board; Kwaque serving and loving his master and thickening and darkening and creasing his brow with the growing leprous infiltration; Ah Moy avoiding the <b>Black</b> <b>Papuan</b> as the very plague, washing himself continuously and boiling his blankets once a week; Captain Doane doing the navigating and worrying about his flat-building in San Francisco; Grimshaw resting his ham-hands on his colossal knees and girding at the pawnbroker to contribute {{as much to the}} adventure as he was contributing from his wheat-ranches; Simon Nishikanta wiping his sweaty neck with the greasy silk handkerchief and painting endless water-colours; the mate patiently stealing the ship's latitude and longitude with his duplicate key; and the Ancient Mariner, solacing himself with Scotch highballs, smoking fragrant three-for-a-dollar Havanas that were charged to the adventure, and for ever maundering about the hell of the longboat, the cross-bearings unnamable, and the treasure a fathom under the sand.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to quantitatively determine the fatty acid contents of 20 species of marine fish and four species of shellfish from Straits of Malacca. Most samples contained fairly high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C 18 : 3 n 3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n 3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6 n 3). Longtail shad, yellowstripe scad, and moonfish contained significantly higher (P< 0. 05) amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), respectively. Meanwhile, fringescale sardinella, malabar red <b>snapper,</b> <b>black</b> pomfret, Japanese threadfin bream, giant seaperch, and sixbar grouper showed considerably high content (537. 2 – 944. 1 [*]mg/ 100 g wet sample) of desirable omega- 3 fatty acids. The polyunsaturated-fatty-acids/saturated-fatty-acids (P/S) ratios for most samples were higher than that of Menhaden oil (P/S= 0. 58), a recommended PUFA supplement which may help to lower blood pressure. Yellowstripe scad (highest DHA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 6. 4, P/S= 1. 7), moonfish (highest ALA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 1. 9, P/S= 1. 0), and longtail shad (highest EPA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 0. 8, P/S= 0. 4) were the samples with an outstandingly desirable overall composition of fatty acids. Overall, the marine fish and shellfish from the area contained good composition of fatty acids which offer health benefits and may be used for nutraceutical purposes in the future...|$|R
6000|$|On the whole, we {{will repeat}} that this Religion of Mahomet's {{is a kind}} of Christianity; has a genuine element of what is spiritually highest looking through it, not to be hidden by all its imperfections. The Scandinavian God Wish, the god of all rude men,--this has been {{enlarged}} into a Heaven by Mahomet; but a Heaven symbolical of sacred Duty, and to be earned by faith and well-doing, by valiant action, and a divine patience which is still more valiant. It is Scandinavian Paganism, and a truly celestial element superadded to that. Call it not false; look not at the falsehood of it, look at the truth of it. For these twelve centuries, it has been the religion and life-guidance of the fifth part of the whole kindred of Mankind. Above all things, it has been a religion heartily believed. These Arabs believe their religion, and try to live by it! No Christians, since the early ages, or only perhaps the English Puritans in modern times, have ever stood by their Faith as the Moslem do by theirs,--believing it wholly, fronting Time with it, and Eternity with it. This night the watchman on the streets of Cairo when he cries, [...] "Who goes?" [...] will hear from the passenger, along with his answer, [...] "There is no God but God." [...] Allah akbar, Islam, sounds through the souls, and whole daily existence, of these dusky millions.

40|$|Utilization {{of fishing}} area in Banten Bay by various {{activities}} may cause multi sectors conflicts related to {{management of the}} bay. The integrated zone system in that area has not been established yet; therefore it is needed to be studied. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) determine fishing season and fishing ground; 2) determine indicators and criteria of fishing zone; 3) establish fishing zone. The study was conducted in four fish landing centers which are located in Karangantu, Terate, Wadas, and Kepuh from January to April 2010. Data were collected by surveying analyzed using the fishing season index analysis, relationship analysis between sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and fish abundance, and GIS analysis. Based on the results, it were revealed that 1) peak fishing season of pelagic fish was from November to January and demersal fish was from November to December; 2) the catches from fishing grounds surrounding Panjang island were anchovies, trevallies, squids, Indian mackerels, pony fishes, Fringescale sardinella; surrounding Pamujan besar island were threadfin bream, shrimps; and surrounding Tunda island were eastern little tuna, narrow barred king mackerels, <b>black</b> pomfret, red <b>snapper,</b> great trevally, scads, mullets, squids; 3) development indicators of fishing zone were (i) feasibility of fishing ground, (ii) compatibility of fishing gears with fishing grounds, (iii) possibility of conflicts, (iv) infrastructure, (v) carrying capacity of environment; 4) Banten bay water was divided into three fishing zones, they were (i) passive zone, (ii) passive and outboard motor zone, (iii) active and inboard motor zone...|$|R
