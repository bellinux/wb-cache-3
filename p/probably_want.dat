[...] He has also said that, [...] "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate. It gets done when it gets done." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{positive}} reviews, Star Fox Adventures is often criticised for its setting being {{too much of}} a departure from the other Star Fox games. Casamassina said that [...] "Fans expecting a true Star Fox experience akin to the older games are in for a disappointment". He also added that the Star Fox license has been utilised sparingly {{to the point where the}} game felt [...] "out of place within the confines of the Star Fox game universe". Casamassina asserted that Fox was [...] "clearly only on 'Dinosaur Planet' at Nintendo's request, not because he belongs". NGC Magazine similarly expressed concern on why Fox was added to the game, adding that Adventures was [...] "one game Fox himself would <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> to forget" [...] and further speculating that Nintendo only added the Star Fox license to prevent Dinosaur Planet from appearing on the Xbox.|$|E
500|$|Homer captures Molloy at the {{retirement}} home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests {{him and he}} is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> {{to know where he}} hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant [...] "T" [...] somewhere in Springfield. They all rush out of the station hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell. However, several citizens continue to dig, convinced that a real treasure must be buried deeper.|$|E

500|$|The Dreamcast port of Incoming {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics. IGN opened their review by saying that, although the game [...] "is lacking in many areas, there's {{more than enough}} here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action." [...] Though criticizing the graphics' ability to [...] "get in the way at times," [...] the [...] "very vague" [...] mission briefings and the [...] "odd flying model for the planes," [...] the reviewer conceded that [...] "if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're {{looking for a good}} challenge, you'll <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> to look into Incoming."

[...] Though describing the multiplayer as [...] "fun", it considered [...] "by far, the best [...] Campaign mode." [...] The review concluded by describing the game as [...] "lots of fun and highly recommended." ...|$|E
