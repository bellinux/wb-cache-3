Throughout these processes, traders faced the problem of keeping the ice from melting; melted ice represented waste and lost <b>profits.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to the end user due to wastage en route. By the end of the 19th century, however, the wastage in the ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent, depending on the efficiency of the company.|$|E

Stolar would subsequently accede to become CEO and president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining <b>profits,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fiscal year ending March 31, 1998, Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. This decision effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released.|$|E
5|$|Sterling Products, {{equipped}} {{with all of}} Bayer's U.S. intellectual property, tried {{to take advantage of}} its new brand as quickly as possible, before generic ASAs took over. However, without German expertise to run the Rensselaer plant to make aspirin and the other Bayer pharmaceuticals, they had only a finite aspirin supply and were facing competition from other companies. Sterling president William E. Weiss had ambitions to sell Bayer aspirin not only in the U.S., but to compete with the German Bayer abroad as well. Taking advantage of the losses Farbenfabriken Bayer (the German Bayer company) suffered through the reparation provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, Weiss worked out a deal with Carl Duisberg to share <b>profits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Americas, Australia, South Africa and Great Britain for most Bayer drugs, in return for technical assistance in manufacturing the drugs.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers. The prose {{has been called}} magnificent, lucid, eloquent, and passionate. Lewis' emotional appeal has been called remarkably candid, sincere, powerful, and moving. Connecting the diplomatic and policy-level work of the UN and World Bank with specific effects {{on the ground in}} Africa, and describing the problem of orphans, were among the strengths of the book. Lewis' criticisms are constructive and, since they come from such an ardent multilateralist employed by the United Nations, authoritative. One reviewer questioned several of Lewis' potential solutions as contributing to the same system that consistently fails to address its flaws. The same reviewer identified as the book's weakness its political slant, which ignores corrupt or inefficient African governments and the realities of asking corporations and western governments to take steps against their self-interest, like canceling agricultural subsidies in the case of governments and donating <b>profits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of businesses. Several reviewers noted that the book could be used as an effective tool to educate about the HIV/AIDS crisis and the plight of the people of sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E

Following five years of generally declining <b>profits,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a net loss of ¥43.3 billion (US$327.8 million) and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (Magic Knight Rayearth being the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and the company announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or nearly one-fourth of its workforce.|$|E

In 1965, Ceylon became the world's leading exporter of tea, with 200,000 tonnes of tea being shipped internationally annually.

25|$|The large <b>profits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Carolina {{furniture}} industry lessened {{with the increasing}} number of factories. In addition to the increased competition for market shares, by 1910 the salary for competent experienced workers and rising shipping costs had cut further into the profit. Bankruptcies resulted from inexperienced managers who tried to sell products below the cost of production and companies that tried to expand too quickly. An innovative High Point company, Tomlinson Chair Co., devised incentives to give its workforce an opportunity to receive part of the profits. The company {{was one of the first}} to manufacture quality period reproduction dining and living room furniture on a large scale; an employee who exceeded a monthly quota received a percentage bonus.

25|$|Because the Rehn-Meidner model allowed capitalists owning very {{productive}} and efficient firms to retain excess profits {{at the expense}} of the firms' workers, thus exacerbating inequality, workers in these firms began to agitate for a share of the <b>profits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, just as women working in the state sector began to assert pressure for better wages. Meidner established a study committee that came up with a 1976 proposal that entailed transferring the excess profits into investment funds controlled by the workers in the efficient firms, with the intention that firms would create further employment and pay more workers higher wages, rather than increasing the wealth of company owners and managers. Capitalists immediately distinguished this proposal as socialism, and launched an unprecedented opposition—including calling off the class compromise established in the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{dividend}} signaling hypothesis in Japanese {{firms in}} manufacturing, trading, and service industries (in 2010 - 2014). By multiple-regression analysis, we researched {{the relation between}} dividend, enterprise value, and net <b>profit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. This leads to the following conclusion that: (1) In manufacturing and trading industries, the dividend and dividend increase signal net <b>profit</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. (2) <b>In</b> service industry, signaling theory isn't supported. (3) In all industries that we researched, dividend decrease doesn't work as a signal of net <b>profit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. (4) Dividend is more strongly relevant to net <b>profit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next period than to net profit after 2 or 3 periods. 本研究は、配当のシグナリング仮説について業種別に検証するものである。石川・太田 [2011] を主な先行研究とし、東証の大分類で製造業・商業・サービス業に属する、 2010 - 2014 年の 3 月期決算上場企業を対象とした。重回帰分析を用いて、配当と企業価値・将来利益の関係性を調べた。この分析により、(1) 製造業、商業において、配当額と増配がシグナルとして機能していること (2) サービス業においては配当のシグナリング仮説が否定されること (3) どの業種においても減配はシグナルとして機能していないこと (4) 配当と 2 期・ 3 期先利益の関連性は弱いこと が明らかになった。刊行のことばAbstract (要約) 2014 年度共同論文集序章 [2]第 1 章 導入 [3]第 2 章 リサーチ・デザイン [4]第 3 章 プラットフォームの分析 [7]第 4 章 修正モデルによる分析 第 1 節 製造業の分析 [18]第 4 章 修正モデルによる分析 第 2 節 商業の分析 [25]第 4 章 修正モデルによる分析 第 3 節 サービス業の分析 [37]Research Answer [45]参考文献 [46]付録 [47]終章 [56] 2014 年度ゼミナール活動の記録 [57]TA のお言葉 [58] 1 年を振り返って [63]編集後記 [71...|$|R

25|$|The Capehart Amendment put intense {{pressure}} on the Truman administration's inflation program. On August 8, the federal government imposed stricter economic controls on the economy. In the steel industry, production quotas and procurement orders were extended to all civilian steelmakers, not just large manufacturers. Steel companies had reported record and near-record <b>profits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer, but by mid-fall net revenues were down as defense needs consumed larger and larger quantities of raw and finished steel and steelmakers were unable to sell steel to the higher-margin civilian market. On September 4, DPA again increased the amount of steel needed for defense use, sharply scaling down allotments for the civilian economy. When steelmakers balked at expanding plant and equipment {{in order to meet}} new defense quotas, ODM officials ordered the chief executives of the nation's largest steel manufacturers to attend a meeting in Washington where they were threatened with additional government regulation and oversight. The steelmakers quickly acceded to the government's demands.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the stock}} markets history, {{there have been}} dozens of scandals {{involving}} listed companies, stock investing methods and brokerage. A classical case related to insider trading of listed companies involved Raj Rajaratnam and its hedge fund management firm, the Galleon Group. On Friday October 16, 2009, he was arrested by the FBI and accused of conspiring with others in insider trading in several publicly traded companies. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara put the total <b>profits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scheme at over $60million, telling a news conference {{it was the largest}} hedge fund insider trading case in United States history. A well publicized accounting fraud of a listed company involved Satyam. On January 7, 2009, its Chairman Raju resigned after publicly announcing his involvement in a massive accounting fraud. Ramalinga Raju was sent to the Hyderabad prison along with his brother and former board member Rama Raju, and the former CFO Vadlamani Srinivas. In Italy, Parmalat's Calisto Tanzi was charged with financial fraud and money laundering in 2008. Italians were shocked that such a vast and established empire could crumble so quickly. When the scandal was made known, the share price of Parmalat in the Milan Stock Exchange tumbled. Parmalat had sold itself credit-linked notes, in effect placing a bet on its own credit worthiness in order to conjure up an asset out of thin air. After his arrest, Tanzi reportedly admitted during questioning at Milan's San Vittore prison, that he diverted funds from Parmalat into Parmatour and elsewhere. The family football and tourism enterprises were financial disasters; as well as Tanzi's attempt to rival Berlusconi by buying Odeon TV, only to sell it at a loss of about €45 million. Tanzi was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fraud relating to the collapse of the dairy group. The other seven defendants, including executives and bankers, were acquitted. Another eight defendants settled out of court in September 2008.|$|E
