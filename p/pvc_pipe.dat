In some cases, {{multiple}} materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic. Chairs may have hard surfaces of wood, metal, plastic, or other materials, or some or all of these hard surfaces may be covered with upholstery or padding. The design may be made of porous materials, or be drilled with holes for decoration; a low back or gaps can provide ventilation. The back may extend above the height of the occupant's head, which can optionally contain a headrest. Chairs can also be made from more creative materials, such as recycled materials like cutlery and wooden play bricks, pencils, plumbing tubes, rope, corrugated cardboard, and <b>PVC</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractExperimental {{studies show}} that the {{parameters}} that contribute to fatigue in <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> include the number of pressure cycles, the amplitude of the transient pressures, and the average pressure to which PVC material is exposed during the transient. Based on such experimental studies, design standards have been set to provide the required data for calculating the permissible number of pressure cycles below which the <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> are considered safe against fatigue. However, the key challenge is to determine the amplitude and the number of transient pressure cycles, values which should be the outcome of a thorough transient analysis. Using a quite simple concept, the Plastic Pipe Institute developed the computer program PACE for the analysis of the fatigue failure mode in PE and <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes.</b> However, the concept behind this program disregards the intensity of the transient in the system, and thus its results are questionable in more realistic systems. The current research aims to explain and improve on the underlying concept of the program PACE. To this end the fatigue analysis of a hypothetical pumping system is made by the aid of both the program PACE and the results of a thorough transient analysis considering different mode of operation of the pumping system. The results show, somewhat predictably, that the analysis of fatigue in <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> is a crucially system dependent; thus, the concept utilized by the PACE program is overly simplistic. In addition, the numerical results obtained imply that <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> are safe against fatigue failure in a wide verity of operational conditions and that a reliable fatigue analysis can be only achieved through utilizing the data obtained from a though transient analysis...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{experimental}} {{design for the}} short term hydrostatic test for the Polyvinyl Chloride (<b>PVC)</b> <b>pipes.</b> The objective of this thesis is to design or develop an experimental setup in determining the burst pressure of a <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> by the means of internal pressure. The thesis describes the experimental procedures to determine the burst pressure of the <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes.</b> The experimental value obtained is then compared to the theoretical value calculated from an existing formula. The samples used are designed using computer aided software which is SolidWork. The samples are then fabricated and tested based on the setup designed. From the result obtained, the value of experimental burst pressure is indeed different from the theoretical burst pressure. The result is then compared again with other formula basely for metal pipes in order to check the validity of the equations to be used for <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes.</b> Based on the result, the equations are not too suitable to be used as the different between the values from the main equation with the values calculated from other standard are too big.

50|$|A {{sleeping}} dragon is a maneuver used by protesters {{to cause}} disruption. It involves handcuffs and PVC pipe: {{a series of}} protesters are handcuffed together through the <b>PVC</b> <b>pipe,</b> which precludes police from simply using bolt cutters to break the handcuffs. Advanced variations include covering the <b>PVC</b> <b>pipe</b> with elements which might {{make it more difficult}} to break. Examples include chicken wire, tar, and duct tape. Another variation is filling a barrel with concrete and putting the <b>PVC</b> <b>pipe</b> through the barrel such that it cannot be accessed without first destroying all of the concrete. Often the protesters will chain, lock, or otherwise secure themselves to immovable objects, resulting in a difficult-to-remove human obstacle. This is typically accomplished best with carabiners tied to their wrists so that the protestors can easily unlock themselves, though they cannot be unlocked by outsiders.|$|E

40|$|The Cuban treefrog, Osteopilus septentrionalis, is an {{invasive}} species in Florida {{that may be}} negatively impacting adult and larval native treefrog species through competition via direct predation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the abundance and distribution of O. septentrionalis in urban, semi-urban and natural habitats. The distribution and abundance of native treefrogs within the study area, Hyla cinerea, Hyla femoralis and Hyla squirella, were also estimated and compared to that of O. septentrionalis. Treefrogs were captured using <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> with two internal diameters, 1. 9 cm and 4. 45 cm, hung on three tree types, Pinus, Quercus and Sabal. Distance to water, time of year and monthly rainfall were also considered as a potential influence of treefrog captures. O. septentrionalis was found in sites with both urban and natural habitats in frequencies far greater than those of native treefrogs. Results indicate that O. septentrionalis are captured more frequently in sites with urban habitat; however recapture rates and estimates of population size indicate that the population sizes of O. septentrionalis may actually be larger at sites with natural habitat. O. septentrionalis are found significantly more frequently in Quercus. H. femoralis and H. squirella were found significantly more frequently in <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> with an internal diameter of 4. 45 cm. A weak, although significant, positive correlation was found between distance to water and treefrog abundances for O. septentrionalis and H. squirella. Native treefrogs were found less frequently in <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> that also contained O. septentrionalis; this result is perhaps the most interesting because it may indicate that native treefrogs will avoid habitat or refuges where O. septentrionalis are present. If O. septentrionalis is a real threat to species of treefrogs in Florida, these results should be of concern. Findings suggest that <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> may give biased estimates of treefrog densities. Available refuge, temperature and precipitation all appear to have an effect on how attractive <b>PVC</b> <b>pipes</b> are to treefrogs...|$|R
