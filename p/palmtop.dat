50|$|The HP 200LX <b>Palmtop</b> PC (F1060A, F1061A, F1216A), {{also known}} as project Felix, is a {{personal}} digital assistant introduced by Hewlett-Packard in August 1994. It was often called a <b>Palmtop</b> PC, and it was notable that it was, with some minor exceptions, a MS-DOS-compatible computer in a <b>palmtop</b> format, complete with a monochrome graphic display, QWERTY keyboard, serial port, and PCMCIA expansion slot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palmtop</b> PCs {{distinguish}} {{from other}} <b>palmtop</b> computers by utilizing a mostly IBM-compatible PC architecture and BIOS {{as well as}} an Intel-compatible x86 processor. Most such devices were DOS-based, with DOS stored in ROM. While many <b>Palmtop</b> PCs came with a number of PDA and office applications pre-installed in ROM, most of them could also run generic, off-the-shelf PC software with no or little modifications. Some could also run other operating systems such as GEOS, MINIX 2.0, Windows 1.0-3.0, or Linux.|$|E

40|$|Mobile {{handheld}} {{devices are}} increasingly being used in education. In this paper, we undertook a review of empirical based articles to summarise the current research {{regarding the use of}} mobile handheld devices (personal digital assistants/PDAs, <b>palmtops,</b> and mobile phones) in K- 12 and higher education settings. This review was guided by the following four questions: (a) How are mobile handheld devices such as PDAs, <b>palmtops,</b> and mobile phones used by students and teachers? (b) What types of research methods have been applied using such devices? (c) What data collection methods are used in the research? and (d) What research topics have been conducted on these handheld devices in education settings, as well as their related findings? We summarise and discuss some major findings from the research, as well as several limitations of previous empirical studies. We conclude by providing some recommendations for future research related to mobile handheld devices in education settings. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Computational models are simple because they do not involve complex mathematical analysis.

40|$|A Denial of Service (DoS) {{attack is}} an {{incident}} in which the user is deprived of {{the services of a}} resource he is expected to have. With the increasing reliance on mobile devices like laptops and <b>palmtops,</b> a new type of DoS attack is possible that attacks the batteries of these devices, called “sleep deprivation attacks”. The goal of sleep deprivation attacks is to rapidly drain the battery of the mobile devices, rendering the device inoperable long before the expected battery lifetime, thus denying the service the user expects from the mobile device. The purpose of this research is to investigate these types of attacks so that proper defense mechanisms can be put in place before the attacks become a more sophisticated and potent force. This research presents three different possible methods that can be adopted by an attacker to drain the battery of a device i. e. malignant attacks, benign attacks and network service request attacks. These attacks are implemented on a variety of mobile computing platforms like <b>palmtops</b> and a laptop and the corresponding results are presented. Finally, a mathematical model is presented that estimates the battery life of a device based on its power consumption in various powe...|$|R

40|$|Despite recent {{increases}} in the processing power of handheld computers, often called <b>palmtops,</b> the devices continue to function primarily as personal information organizers.

We propose a storage hierarchy, involving a hard disk and large software controlled flash memory cache, that lowers the power cost of accessing the data from the disk, but retains the storage capacity benefits of the disk. We investigate how the hoarding of files into flash memory during a power abundant docked state can drastically reduce the power consumption of the hard disk. ...|$|R
