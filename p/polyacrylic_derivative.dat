40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the design of {{sustained-release}} mucoadhesive bilayered tablets, using mixtures of mucoadhesive polymers and an inorganic matrix (hydrotalcite), for the topical administration of flurbiprofen in the oral cavity. The first layer, responsible for the tablet retention on the mucosa, was prepared by compression of a cellulose derivative and <b>polyacrylic</b> <b>derivative</b> blend. The second layer, responsible for buccal drug delivery, was obtained by compression of a mixture of the same (first layer) mucoadhesive polymers and hydrotalcite containing flurbiprofen. Nonmedicated tablets were evaluated in terms of swelling, mucosal adhesion, and organoleptic characteristics; in vitro and in vivo release studies of flurbiprofen-loaded tablets were performed as well...|$|E
30|$|Several {{researches}} {{have indicated}} that some polymers {{can be used as}} corrosion inhibitors because, through their functional groups, they form complexes with metal ions and on metal surfaces. These complexes occupy a large surface area, thereby blanketing the surface and protecting the metals from corrosive agents present in the solution. The corrosion inhibition by various cationic polymers such as polyethyleneimine derivative, polyacrylamide derivative, polydicyanodiamide derivative, and anionic polymers such as polymaleic acid <b>derivative,</b> <b>polyacrylic</b> acid <b>derivative,</b> and <b>polyacrylic</b> acid, have been investigated by Sekine et al. [1]. They found that polymers having the COOH group are effective polymer-based systems that can function as corrosion inhibitors. Muller et al. [2] studied the corrosion inhibition of polymethacrylic acid and styrene maleic acid co-polymer on zinc pigments in aqueous alkaline medium.|$|R

In this study we evaluated the pH of respective solutions of lidocaine hydrochloride with ionic polymer - polyacrylic acid or non-ionic polymer - methylcellulose, and compared to physiological skin conditions in the range between 22 °C and 41 °C. In microscopic observation of lidocaine hydrochloride preparations with polyacrylic acid the micro-sedimentation was revealed, however obtained mixture was opalescent, and homogenously dispersed in aqueous environment. The pH was maintained on the level not higher then 4, 0 in the period of 12 hours for polyacrylic acid formulation, whereas in the case of preparation with methylcellulose, the pH increased from acceptable pH of ca. 4, 5 to the level of above 6, 0. The <b>polyacrylic</b> acid <b>derivatives</b> should be further studiedas vehicles forming preparations with stable pH value during application on the skin, with more specific methods including pH microelectrodes, sufficient for assessments in small quantities of liquids of skin surface...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} study is the comparison of various hydrogel formulations, as carriers for a horse chestnut seed extract (EH). Methylcellulose (MC), two <b>polyacrylic</b> acid <b>derivatives</b> (PA 1 and PA 2), and polyacrylate crosspolymer 11 (PC- 11) were employed. The release rates of EH were examined and a comparison with the Weibull model equation was performed. Application of MC as the carrier in the hydrogel preparation resulted in fast release rate of EH, whereas {{in the case of the}} hydrogel composed with PC- 11 the release was rather prolonged. Applied Weibull function adhered best to the experimental data.

40|$|The {{real and}} {{potential}} applications of phospholipid and surfactant vesicles {{in areas such}} as drug delivery, solar energy conversion, and chemical reactivity control have been discussed by Fendler. Additional applications may be foreseen for vesicles which can be made to respond to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, or specific chemical substances. One might imagine, for example, the use of such sensitized vesicles for selective release of drugs in targets of local hyperthermia) or low ambient pH). We have recently demonstrated that multilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) are rendered sensitive to pH in the presence of synthetic poly(carboxylic acid) s related to poly(acrylic acid). In biomedical applications, however, the non-degradability of these <b>poly(acrylic</b> acid) <b>derivatives</b> may be a serious limitation. In this paper, we show that a similar pH-dependent modification of DPPC vesicle structure may be effected by poly(P-malic acid) (PMLA 100), a degradable poly(carboxylic acid).

50|$|The Florida company Dyn-O-Mat and its CEO, Peter Cordani, {{proposed}} {{the use of}} a patented product it developed, called Dyn-O-Gel, to reduce the strength of hurricanes. The substance is a polymer in powder form (a <b>polyacrylic</b> acid <b>derivative)</b> which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water. The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm. When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm AeroGroup which operated unique tactical aircraft. Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, AeroGroup tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the B-57 aircraft's large bomb bay disbursing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida. The tests were documented on film and made international news showing the storms were successfully removed on monitored Doppler radar. In 2003, the program was shut down because of political pressure through NOAA. Numerical simulations performed by NOAA showed however {{that it would not be}} a practical solution for large systems like a tropical cyclone.|$|R

40|$|International audienceHydrophilic or {{amphiphilic}} macromolecules {{are common}} organic matrices used to encapsulate and protect fragile {{drugs such as}} proteins. Polymer cargoes are in addition designed for remote control of,protein delivery, upon imparting the macromolecules with stimuli-responsive properties, such as light-triggered :polarity switches. The effect of interaction between polymers and proteins on the Stability of the proteins is, however, rarely Investigated. Here we studied the unfolding/folding equilibrium of. cytochrome c. (cyt c) under its oxidized or reduced forms, {{in the presence of}} various,amphiphilic copolymers (by circular dichroism and;intrinsic fluorescence measurements), As models of stimuli-responsive amphiphilic chains, we considered <b>Poly(acrylic</b> acid) <b>derivatives,</b> modified to contain hydrophobic,, light-responsive azobenzene moieties [...] These copolymers are, thus, capable to develop both ionic (Under their sodium forms at pH > 8) and hydrophobic associations with the basic protein cyt c (isoelectric point of 10. 0). In aqueous buffer upon increasing urea concentrations, cyt c underwent unfolding, at [urea] Of 9 - 10 M, which was analyzed under the framework Of the equilibrium between two States (native unfolded). In the presence of polymers, the native folding of cyt c was preserved at low Concentrations Of urea (typically 20 degrees C as compared to thermal unfolding in the absence of polymers. Upon exposure to UV light, properties of the polymers chains were perturbed in situ, upon cis/trans isomerization of the azobenzene groups. In polymers displaying a photoresponsive polarity and hydrophobicity switch (conventional azobenzene), the stability of cyt c was not affected by the exposure to light. In contrast, when photoionization occurred (using an hydroxyl-azobenzene whose pK(a) can be photoshifted); unfolding was initiated upon exposure to light. Altogether, these results show that coulombic binding is a predominant driving force that facilitates unfolding in water/urea solutions. In regard to the design of light-responsive systems for protein handling and control of folding, we, conclude that control of the coulombic interaction upon photoionization of chromophores can be more efficient than the more conventional photomodulation of polarit...|$|R
40|$|Janus {{particles}} are {{named after the}} two-faced ancient Roman god, Janus, based on the chemical and physical anisotropy that these particles exhibit. This work focuses on the synthesis of sub-micron silica particles with asymmetric grafting of polymer chains from their surface. High demand of such particles {{is in contrast to}} their usually small-scale production. In response to that, this work takes advantage of the large surface area provided by spherical latex particles to immobilize silica particles at the latex-solvent interphase and thus provide shielding to one hemisphere of the colloidal silica particles buried in the latex particles, whereas the exposed silica surface can be chemically modified as required. Here, the exposed surface of the silica particles was functionalized with atom transfer radical polymerization initiating sites. The successful transformation of the particles into Janus precursor initiators was verified by means of transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence microscopy. These Janus initiator particles were used for the preparation of hybrid polymer-silica Janus particles. In order to successfully grow well-defined polymer chains {{from the surface of the}} particles, the atom transfer radical polymerization conditions were optimized for each monomer used. In each case, the polymerization kinetic studies provided information on the reaction time and the control of the polymer molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. The results show that high polymer molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distributions are achieved, indicating the good control of the polymerization reactions. The Janus particles synthesized comprised an amine-functionalized hemisphere and a polymer-grafted one. Three different polymers were grown from the particle surface: a hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) leading to amphiphilic Janus particles, a hydrophobic poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBuA) to give polyampholyte particles that can be hydrolyzed to form an anionic and pH-responsive <b>derivative</b> <b>poly(acrylic</b> acid) (PAA) and a hydrophilic cationic and pH- and temperature-responsive polymer; poly(2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), leading to fully hydrophilic cationic particles. For comparison, fullycoated particles of the same polymers were also synthesized employing the same polymerization conditions. The successful grafting of the polymers from the surface of the silica particles was verified by TGA while the high polymer molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distributions were measured by GPC verifying the control of the surfaceinitiated polymerization reactions. Based on the results derived from these techniques the number of polymer chains grafted per particle was calculated, finding that for the polymer-silica Janus particles this number was significantly lower than for the corresponding fully polymer-coated particles. Observation by SEM provided insight on the topology of the polymer-silica Janus particles, indicating the formation of acorn-like and snowman-like particles. The pH-depended size of the Janus PDMAEMA particles was shown by DLS measurements verifying the pH-responsive behavior of the Janus particles. Although a temperature-induced precipitation of the particles was observed by turbidimetry, the size of the particles measured by DLS was not found to decrease before the LCST of the polymer, as was the case for the fully-coated PDMAEMA particles. Instead, an increase of the size of the particles was found attributed to the formation of controlled aggregates...|$|R
