5|$|Amalthea radiates {{slightly}} more heat than it receives from the Sun, which is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the influence of}} Jovian heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected from the planet (<5K), and charged particle bombardment (<2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{increased}} convergence {{rates of}} the Nazca and South America plates for the past 28 million years, a phase of strong volcanic activity commenced in the Andes 25 million years ago. It is likely that this phase persisted without interruption until today.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} {{to build a}} fortification on Dragut Point {{was made by the}} Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. He proposed a fortified city known as Borgo della Città Piccola, with a design similar to Fort Ricasoli. The proposal never materialized, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a lack of funds.|$|E
50|$|Willes's health {{soon began}} <b>to</b> fail, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> largely <b>to</b> overwork; in 1766 he retired to England and died at Newbold Comyn in 1768.|$|R
50|$|This album sounds {{strongly}} World music (<b>probably</b> largely <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the presence}} of multi-instrumentist and acoustic guitarist Lu Edmonds).|$|R
25|$|Other native trees {{producing}} fruits {{included the}} carob, which was <b>probably</b> popular <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its sweet taste, {{and the black}} mulberry.|$|R
5|$|The plans {{obtained}} {{the support of}} Sir Joseph Banks, a baronet who was a patron of the natural sciences, and had been the President of the Royal Society since 1778. The fourth attempt to obtain an act of Parliament was successful, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his influence.|$|E
5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service are unclear, {{but he held}} the rank of major in the Barbados militia. The rank was <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> his land holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function of the militia. Bonnet's militia service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, {{but there is no}} record that he took part in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|During late July 2009, a moonlet was {{discovered}} in the B Ring, 480km from {{the outer edge of}} the ring, by the shadow it cast. It is estimated to be 300m in diameter. Unlike the A Ring moonlets (see below), it does not induce a 'propeller' feature, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the density of the B Ring.|$|E
50|$|Social Stories {{are neither}} {{considered}} well established, nor considered <b>probably</b> efficacious, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the limitations of}} the current body of research.|$|R
50|$|In Britain, small {{pondweed}} is common and widespread. It is <b>probably</b> under-recorded <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its relatively small size and confusion with P. pusillus.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} <b>probably</b> {{abandoned}} <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a major uplift {{which resulted in}} cutting off of the water source from the Kud River.|$|R
5|$|Hill plotted {{the remains}} of 102 lodges. Pike {{reported}} finding 44 lodges at the village; the difference is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the abandonment or destruction of lodges and the building of new ones on different sites. At least 90 graves have been investigated by archaeologists; an estimated 75–100 additional graves {{are thought to have}} been opened by relic hunters.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had several}} health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness {{in one ear}} and blindness in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E
5|$|NGC 4027 {{is another}} member of the NGC 4038 group, notable for its {{extended}} spiral arm. Known as the Ringtail Galaxy, it lies close to 31 Crateris. A barred spiral galaxy, its distorted shape is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a past collision, possibly with the nearby NGC 4027A. NGC 4782 and NGC 4783 are a pair of merging elliptical galaxies in the northeastern part of the constellation, around 200 million light-years distant.|$|E
50|$|Very large high {{metallicity}} {{stars are}} <b>probably</b> unstable <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the Eddington limit, and {{would tend to}} shed mass during the formation process.|$|R
50|$|In a {{telephone}} poll of households in 1996, 6.5% of population declared themselves as Internet users, {{although the number}} was <b>probably</b> overestimated <b>due</b> <b>to</b> methodological problems.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, in 2015, 10.4%, {{or about}} [...] of the Swiss {{residents}} speak High German aka Standard German at home, but <b>probably</b> mainly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> German (and Austrian) immigrants.|$|R
5|$|Some {{bumblebees}} {{native to}} North America are also vanishing, such as Bombus balteatus, Bombus terricola, Bombus affinis, and Bombus occidentalis, and one, Bombus franklini, may be extinct. In South America, Bombus bellicosus was extirpated {{in the northern}} limit of its distribution range, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> intense land use and climate change effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{available}} sources give no {{clue as to}} Albin's {{pattern of}} allegiance in these factional politics, and neither do his recorded activities. Professor Donald Watt has suggested that Albin was probably aligned with the Durward faction, in contrast, for instance, to the allegedly Comyn aligned Clement of Dunblane. Watt even argued that Albin's postulation was <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the influence of Alan Durward, {{who at the time}} was a close advisor of King Alexander II.|$|E
5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural {{home they}} will shelter on land in {{overgrown}} heather. Accounts are inconsistent {{as to the}} extent of the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
5000|$|Nellie Frazier Eaves died February 12, 1954. Not a lot {{is known}} about Mrs. Eaves, except that she <b>probably</b> died <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{complications}} that she had from [...] "Sugar Diabetes".|$|R
50|$|The word Palfrey, {{refers to}} a small simple horse, once used {{particularly}} for women. The neighbourhood name of Palfrey was <b>probably</b> created <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a large field kept for the horse.|$|R
30|$|Reports of O. minuta J. Presl. from Australia have <b>probably</b> been <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{confusion}} with O. officinalis or other species (Kodela 2009). Further molecular analysis of Australian populations will clarify these reports.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th and the {{beginning}} of the 20th centuries, Chile was engaged in an intense naval competition with its neighbor Argentina. This ended peacefully in 1902, but less than a decade later Argentina responded to Brazil's order for two dreadnoughts with two of its own. The Chilean congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts, which were ordered from the United Kingdom despite a strong push from the American government for the contracts, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Chile's traditionally strong ties with the British.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
50|$|Ellupanatham {{was part}} of the Magadai Mandalam as of 1190 AD. Probably, during the Palaiyakkarar rule. The village is <b>probably</b> named <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{presence}} of large number of Illupai Madhuca longifolia tree.|$|R
2500|$|The {{proliferation}} of African names is <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> more <b>to</b> regional customs than actual manufacturing specialization. The 'Mkporo' is likely a Dutch or British manilla and the 'Popo' is French, {{but the rest}} are examples of a single evolving Birmingham product.|$|R
40|$|EnThe {{zooplankton}} {{composition in}} the "stagno grande" {{of the natural}} oasis "Le Cesine" (LE) was examined for the first time. The community structure was not stable, and different components appeared and/or disappeared during the time lag of the study. A brackish water (oligoaline) community was dominant. The calanoid Calanipeda aquaedulcis and the Rotifera taxocoenose was the main component. The appearence-disappearence of the species (which can be classified as opportunist, and typical of unpredictably stressed environments) is <b>probably</b> <b>dued</b> <b>to</b> the presence of resting stages in their life cycles...|$|R
5|$|Extant relations, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed {{starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Harry's Walls are {{the remains}} of an {{unfinished}} artillery fort, started in 1551 {{by the government of}} Edward VI to defend the island of St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly. Constructed to defend the harbour of Hugh Town from possible French attack, the fortification incorporated Italianate-style bastions with protective orillons and would have been the most advanced design in the kingdom at the time. It was not completed, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's Walls are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Head {{injury is}} present in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history. Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation {{may have been used}} to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain {{to be the center of}} thought, <b>probably</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their experience with head trauma.|$|E
5000|$|In what {{proved to}} be a {{propaganda}} mis-step, Lord Haw-Haw derisively referred to the Garrison as [...] "poor desert rats of Tobruk" [...] during radio broadcasts. This was <b>probably</b> mostly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> two factors: ...|$|R
50|$|Because no {{wreckage}} was salvaged and {{the crew}} did not report any problems, {{it was concluded that}} the aircraft was <b>probably</b> lost <b>due</b> <b>to</b> loss of control while turning in severe turbulence and heavy rain.|$|R
50|$|In 1851, Chance Brothers {{supplied}} {{the glass to}} glaze the Crystal Palace, which was <b>probably</b> partly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Chance's previous links with Joseph Paxton, the architect, when supplying glass for the greenhouses at Chatsworth House.|$|R
