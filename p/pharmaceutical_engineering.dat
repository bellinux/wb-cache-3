25|$|<b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>engineering</b> is an {{interdisciplinary}} science that includes drug engineering, novel drug delivery and targeting, pharmaceutical technology, unit operations of Chemical Engineering, and Pharmaceutical Analysis. It may be deemed {{as a part}} of pharmacy due to its focus on the use of technology on chemical agents in providing better medicinal treatment. The ISPE is an international body that certifies this now rapidly emerging interdisciplinary science.|$|E

The groups have 300 employs. In each group has 150 pharmaceutical employees and other one groups has 150 engineering employees. Scale was use for data collection is personal datasheet and leadership style scale developed by L. I. Bhushan (2005), 2 x 2 x 3 factorial design was used and data were analysis by „F ‟ test. Result show, there was significant difference of leadership style between <b>pharmaceutical</b> and <b>engineering</b> company employees, the leadership style scores of engineering company employee is higher than pharmaceutical company employee. There was significant difference of the leadership style between manager and worker of <b>pharmaceutical</b> and <b>engineering</b> company employees, the leadership style scores of manager is higher than worker. There was no significant difference of the leadership style between post-graduate, graduate and diploma degree holder of <b>pharmaceutical</b> and <b>engineering</b> company employees.
