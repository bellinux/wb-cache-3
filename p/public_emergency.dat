5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} <b>public</b> <b>emergency</b> was {{declared}} {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including tarpaulins and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief supplies that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15.|$|E

25|$|As a {{response}} to the 2001 economic crisis, electricity tariffs were converted to the Argentine peso and frozen in January 2002 through the <b>Public</b> <b>Emergency</b> and Exchange Regime Law. Together with high inflation (see Economy of Argentina) and the devaluation of the peso, many companies in the sector had to deal with high levels of debt in foreign currency under a scenario in which their revenues remained stable while their costs increased. This situation has led to severe underinvestment and unavailability to keep up with an increasing demand, factors that contributed to the 2003-2004 energy crisis. Since 2003, the government has been in the process of introducing modifications that allow for tariff increases. Industrial and commercial consumers' tariffs have already been raised (near 100% in nominal terms and 50% in real terms), but residential tariffs still remain the same.|$|E

In this paper, we use the social network analysis method to explore the network structure, node position and key nodes feature such as the missed Malaysia Flight Mh 370. The research shows that the network structure of the microblogging public opinion about <b>public</b> <b>emergencies</b> is loose, and the key nodes are more important that makes the public opinion spread quickly.
