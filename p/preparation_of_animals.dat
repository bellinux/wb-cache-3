Conse-quent handling is important because of animal welfare, meat quality and matching economic consequences. During road transport, human impact can be divided in different steps: 1) driving pigs from the pens via an alley to the trailer, 2) loading, 3) actual transport, 4) unload-ing to the lairage, and 5) the final phase driving pigs to the stunning.

40|$|Preimmunization {{of either}} guinea pigs or rabbits to bovine gamma {{globulin}} (BGG) prepares the animals for markedly enhanced antibody responses to 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl-BGG (DNP-BGG). This phenomenon is observed {{both in the}} primary anti-DNP antibody response to DNP-BGG and in the secondary anti-DNP antibody response to DNP-BGG in animals primed with DNP-ovalbumin (DNP-OVA). The BGG preimmunization is most effective if the antigen is administered as a complete Freund's adjuvant emulsion; in rabbits, a dose of 1 µg of BGG {{is more effective than}} a dose of 50 µg, whereas the reverse is true in guinea pigs.

40|$|According to {{clinical}} observations and state-ments in textbooks, impaired hepatic function {{may result in}} a greater than normal duration or intensity of drug action. There is little evi-dence concerning the reason for this increased response. A review of Brodie et at. (1958) presents the work of several investigators showing that many drugs are metabolized by enzymes in the liver microsomes. One of the constituents of bile, deoxycholic acid, has been found to disrupt and destroy certain microsomal structures (Palade and Siekevitz, 1956). In addition, this bile acid has been shown by Gillette (J. R. Gillette, per-sonal communication) to inhibit in vitro some microsomal drug enzyme systems. Therefore, it was postulated that animals with ob-structive jaundice might have an enhanced response to a given dose of a drug. This increased response, in part, might be caused by the de-structive action of bile acids on certain liver structures and their associated drug-enzyme systems. METHODS. <b>Preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> Young adult California rabbits weighing 1 to 1. 5 kg were used.

The present paper describes a method of cross-circulation that has been successfully adapted to the rat. The use of this species offers certain advantages: (a) animals are uniform in structure {{as a result of}} continued inbreeding, (b) blood types are similar and consequently difficulties due to incompatibility are not a problem, (c) marked resistance to infection is present, (d) certain organs can be removed comparatively easily, and (e) since the laboratory rat has been used extensively in biological investigations, a great deal of standardized information is readily available for use as control data. <b>PREPARATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ANIMALS</b> Rats weighing approximately 200 grams have been used. They are anesthetized with Nembutal (5 mg. per 100 gm. body weight given intraperitoneally) and are prepared as follows: A transverse skin incision is made just below the inguinal ligament; the skin is dissected free of fascia and retracted, so that an adequate exposure of the femoral artery, vein, and nerve is made. The blood vessels and nerve are dissected free of adhering connective tissue and the femoral nerve is cut in order to diminish the number of impulses relayed during the cannulation and cross-circulation procedures. A 2 per cent solution of Papaverine 8 is then applied locally to the blood vessels to relieve the vasospasm that occur...|$|E
40|$|When {{animals are}} exposed to a novel {{situation}} such as transportation, they react by eliciting certain physiological and behavioural functions in order {{to cope with the}} situation. These changes can be measured to indicate how much stress the animal is suffering. Physiological stress indicators often measured in animal transport research include changes in heart rate, live-weight, cortisol levels, and blood composition including electrolytes, metabolites and enzymes (Broom and Johnson, 1993). Animal behavioural stress indicators include struggling, vocalisation, kicking or biting, hunching of the back, urination, defecation and recumbence (Broom et al. 1996; Gregory, 1998). Meat quality parameters post mortem can also help to indicate stress levels in animals (Grandin, 1990; Gregory, 1998). These include incidence of bruising and DFD in all farm animal species and PSE in pigs. Mortality is also an obvious indicator of poor welfare. Combined aspects of transport that contribute to causing stress in livestock include loading and unloading procedures, close proximity to stock handlers, water/feed deprivation, noise, riding in a truck, mixing with other animals and being forced into unfamiliar environments. The responses of stock to these conditions will depend on the animal's genetically controlled adaptability, physical condition and its previous handling experiences (Gross and Siegel, 1993). Factors such as the adequate <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for transport, controlled prior access to feed and water, minimal disruption to social groups, considerate animal handling skills, adequate handling and transport facilities including good ventilation in trucks, and careful driving technique are major areas that dictate the standard of animal transport. For example, considerations for pigs should include a pre-transport fasting period which balances the requirement to avoid hunger, travel sickness and deaths. Breeding and selecting for more stress-resistant genotypes of pigs can improve the welfare by reducing mortality and the metabolic consequences of transport stress. Other factors influencing animal transport include farm size and country size. For example, livestock transport in Scandinavia involves transport vehicles travelling to more than one farm in order to fill a vehicle. In Australia often one farm pick up can fill a truck, and although the distances may be much longer to the abattoir, it will be more direct. The market demand dictates the type of animals transported. For example the veal trade in Europe demands young live calves to be transported over long distances from northern countries which supply it to the southern countries which demand it. This trade exists in live animals rather than meat because the demanding countries further fatten and slaughter these animals specific to their needs. The industry set up influences the standard of animal transport in different countries. For example in countries where industries are vertically integrated consisting of producer-owned slaughter plant co-operatives (Sweden and Denmark), producers are paid according to slaughter weight and lean meat percentage, therefore there is more consistent quality control measures in place. In Australia the marketing system is such that it provides no economic incentive to reduce losses. Greater public awareness of animal welfare seems to be increasing in western countries, and as a result there is more pressure on the livestock industry to adopt better standards for the farming, handling, transport and slaughter of animals. The transport of livestock in Australia continues to be under increased scrutiny from overseas markets and animal welfare groups. In the European Union (EU), public pressure has been a successful instigator to the drafting and continued improvement of comprehensive legislation for animal transport. EU animal transport laws cover aspects such as minimum design standards for livestock vehicles (including ventilation controls), maximum journey lengths before resting intervals, stocking rates, what animals are considered as fit to travel, and general handling and care requirements of animals in transport. These laws are causing debate between northern and southern countries in areas such as maximum journey lengths and vehicle design standards. Some countries such as the UK have also gone to a great effort to adjust national laws in order to incorporate EU transport laws, but countries such as Spain and Italy have not. Typically it is these countries that more often have poor standards of animal welfare, and the welfare of farmed animals has historically been of low priority (Schmidt, 1995). When and how these countries will adopt the comprehensive EU animal transport regulations, continues to be an unanswered and politically sensitive question between EU member states...|$|E

40|$|Transport, {{marked by}} {{intensive}} handling of live animals, {{is a crucial}} step in the animal production process, involving many different operators (farmers, transporters and slaughterhouses), possibly affecting the environment, animal health, animal welfare, product (meat) quality {{and the spread of}} animal diseases. During the past decades consumers have become more and more concerned about factors such as ethical animal production and animal welfare. This does not only include animal housing aspects but also,nbsp;even more, the transport of animals. Because more consumers are faced with road transport. So, there is a social demand to monitor and improve animal welfare during the transportnbsp;In addition, consumers are interested in high quality meat which is influenced by stress and welfare during the last day before slaughter. The aim of this thesis was to study the influences of housing, transport and slaughterhouse aspects on skin lesions and meat quality. Furthermore, some possible aspects to optimise welfare and meat quality were investigated. The purpose of the study in chapter 2 was to determine (the variation of) effects of farm management, climate parameters, transport and lairage conditions on meat quality of fattening pigs, heterozygous for the halothane gene. A total of 4, 763 fattening pigs were transported from the Zootechnical Centre (Belgium) to a commercial slaughterhouse (distance 110 km) in 121 transports through 5 years. From 2, 404 carcasses, carcass temperature and pH were measured 45 min post-mortem; 48 h post-mortem pH, electrical conductivity, drip loss and meat colour were registered. During the raising period gender, conditions at weaning (purchased or not as piglet, vaccination against Mycoplasma) and (type of) room during fattening (i. e. from about 22 kg to 105 kg) were registered to relate with pork quality. Transport season, weather parameters, regrouping or not during loading, transport combination (truck, trailer and driver), transport compartment and transport conditions (loading density, transport duration and unloading time) nbsp;monitored. At the slaughterhouse, duration of lairage and carcass conformation were followed up to examine correlations with meat quality parameters. In conclusion, effects of farm management, climate parameters during transport, transport and slaughterhouse conditions on pork quality were demonstrated. In the next chapter, the effects of transport and lairage conditions on skin lesions of carcasses of fattening pigs, heterozygous for the halothane gene, were studied. A total of 4, 507 fattening pigs were transported from a farm to a commercial slaughterhouse (distance 110 km) in 111 transports spread over 5 years. Skin lesions were visually assessed in the slaughter line {{in different parts of the}} carcass, i. e. shoulder, middle and ham, using a 4 -point scale. The incidence of skin lesions was most prevalent (31 %) in the shoulder region of the pig carcass. Gender, wind velocity, regrouping, transport combination, transport compartment, lairage time and ham angle affected the skin lesion incidence. In conclusion, scoring the incidence of skin lesions is an indicator of the level of welfare exercised during transport and the slaughterhouse conditions. Furthermore, skin lesion monitoring can be used to determine critical control points in the transport procedure. Given the importance from both a commercial and welfare perspective, it should be a powerful incentive to handle fattening pigs with care duringnbsp;transport process and the lairage period. In chapter 4 the effect of olfactory substances on the heart rate and lying behaviour of pigs during transport simulation is investigated. Five treatments were tested in which a substance was applied to pigs’ snouts with a paintbrush. These consisted of: 1) control treatment (wiping without product); 2) 2 ml of a synthetic, maternal-like pheromone; 3) 5 ml of a synthetic, maternal-like pheromone; 4) a commercial, non-relevant odour and 5) 2 ml of a placebo (solvent of the synthetic pheromone without active ingredients). In total, 90 pigs took part in this study and each treatment was tested on a group of three pigs with six replicates per treatment. Pigs were vibrated in the vertical direction in a transport simulator with a frequency of 8 Hz and an acceleration of 3 m s– 2. Cardiac activity and lying behaviour during vibration were quantified. The effect of vibration was found to be statistically significant, i. e. causing an increase in heart rate and numbers of ventricular ectopic beats (VEB). Both 2 and 5 ml of synthetic pheromone were found to decrease minimum heart rate significantly. However, the number of VEB was highest for these two synthetic pheromone groups during vibration. No dose-dependent synthetic pheromone effects were found and there were no differences in the amount of time pigs spent lying. In practice, unfamiliar pigs are frequently mixed prior to loading in order to obtain groups of uniform weight and to adjust the group size to the dimensions of the trailer compartments. Mixings pigs induces aggressive interactions to establish a new social rank. Fighting results innbsp;lesions and pre-slaughter stress and on his turn reduced meat quality. A three-year study was performed to compare the effect ofnbsp;and regrouping at fattening, loading and lairage. A total of 1, 332 pigs were included over 30 transports from one pig farm to one slaughterhouse (110 km). Skin lesions were determined on 1, 314 carcasses. Meat quality was measured on 620 pigs. The temperature and pH in the longissimus dorsi muscle were measured 45 min post-mortem. Forty-eight hours later pH, electrical conductivity, drip loss and the colour of the longissimus dorsi muscle were measured. The non-regrouped treatment showed less skin lesions and better meat quality than the groups regrouped at loading or in lairage. Pigs mixed at 80 kg at the farm have in general a comparable amount of skin lesions and comparable meat quality as the non-mixed group. If mixing is unavoidable, due to large within-group weight variations, mixing at 80 kg can be an alternative to reduce skin lesions at slaughter and to optimise meat quality. Finally, from previous studies, it appears that the transport of fattening pigs is characterized by a strong human-animal interaction. Consequent handling is important because of animal welfare, meat quality and matching economic consequences. Therefore, chapter 6 presents practical information to ease the handling of fattening pigs. During road transport, human impact can be divided in different steps: 1) driving pigs from the pens via an alley to the trailer, 2) loading, 3) actual transport, 4) unloading to the lairage, and 5) driving pigs in the final stage to the stunning. Inadequate design and poor condition of the facilities will negatively affect the ease of handling. Because of the consequences, acute stress during transport and slaughter should be minimized by improving education of people, equipment and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> for the journey. Education programmes have to be repeated regularly so that knowledge can be refreshed. In general, it can be concluded that there are some main effects (see chapter 2 and 3) affecting welfare and meat quality. Initially, animal welfare and meat quality can be optimised by focusing on thesenbsp;effects. Preparing animals with olfactory substances, odours or feed additives has minor effects. After more than 30 years, there is still research going on about the impact of transport on welfare of animals and meat quality. Thereby, the optimization of welfare monitoring and training programmes are important study aspects. status: publishe...|$|E

In ancient times, zootherapists mainly depended on whole body <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> metabolic products (corporal secretions and excreta) or non-animal materials (nests and cocoons). Out of these resources, seven major materials gained prominence for drug preparations. These are honey, wax, adder, beaver testicles, musk oil, coral, and ambergris (Lev, 2003). A more detailed insight would reveal a diverse world of zootherapy.

FAO recently published two manuals that can be of help. One manual (number 6) provides valuable information on the principles and coordination of preparedness planning for animal diseases. It explains how to organise veterinary services during emergencies and how to set up early warning and early reaction systems. It deals with the problems of remote and marginalised areas, explains the use of radio stations and other media, and shows how to set up specific disease contingency plans. Special attention is warranted in case rinderpest emerges in a country that had been previously declared free of the disease and infection. For this disease in particular, FAO has published another manual (number 7) that provides information on the nature of rinderpest and on the principles and strategic options relating to the control and elimination of the disease. It provides guidelines for individual countries to formulate their national policy on rinderpest control and eradication.

40|$|Abstract: in {{the rural}} {{community}} of Iran, there are gaps between the ruling class (capital owners) and villagers, between literate and illiterate, and between men and women. Especially in villages women have fewer possibilities in terms of investment and less power and credit. Role of rural women, over of men, is more influenced with different economic, social, cultural and ecologic factors. Rural women are considered as a noticeable potential in the community either directly (crops production, livestock, handicrafts, cottage industries) or indirectly by helping the agricultural sector (as labor). About 5. 6 million women are involved in agricultural production, and activities related to planting [...] . harvesting, <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> food, {{and taking care of}} livestock and poultry and some certain activities related to trading and marketing are all different fields of rural women’s role and participation. Based on current statistics, women in rural area participate about 50 % in conversion industries, 22 % in producing crops and livestock, 75 % in handicrafts and in areas related to planting…harvesting, respectively, 25, 24 and 4. 26. And also in activities related to livestock, they handle 23 % of livestock grazing, 42 % <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> care and 100 percent of total poultry in the village. Therefore their role in achieving food security is undeniable. But, like most developing countries, this crucial role in society and in process of rural development, is not obvious. In Iranian rural community, about 80 % of women work, but they are mostly considered as housewives, unpaid employment, domestic workers, family workers, or independent employers. The statistics often do not take into account seasonal, part-time, unpai...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSurfactant protein C (SP-C) is an {{essential}} component for the surface tension-lowering activity of the pulmonary surfactant system. It contains a valine-rich α helix that spans the lipid bilayer, {{and is one of}} the most hydrophobic proteins known so far. SP-C is also {{an essential}} component <b>of</b> various surfactant <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> origin currently used to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) in preterm infants. The limited supply of this material and the risk of transmission of infectious agents and immunological reactions have prompted the development of synthetic SP-C-derived peptides or recombinant humanized SP-C for inclusion in new preparations for therapeutic use. We describe herein the recombinant production in bacterial cultures of SP-C variants containing phenylalanines instead of the palmitoylated cysteines of the native protein, as fusions to the hydrophilic nuclease A (SN) from Staphylococcus aureus. The resulting chimerae were partially purified by affinity chromatography and subsequently subjected to protease digestion. The SP-C forms were recovered from the digestion mixtures by organic extraction and further purified by size exclusion chromatography. The two recombinant SP-C variants so obtained retained more than 50 % α-helical content and showed surface activity comparable to the native protein, as measured by surface spreading of lipid/protein suspensions and from compression π–A isotherms of lipid/protein films. Compared to the protein purified from porcine lungs, the recombinant SP-C forms improved movement of phospholipid molecules into the interface (during adsorption), or out from the interfacial film (during compression), suggesting new possibilities to develop improved therapeutic preparations...|$|R
