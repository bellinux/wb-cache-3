Thus, this scheduler dictates what <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> to run on a system, and the degree of concurrency to be supported at any one time whether many or few <b>processes</b> <b>are</b> to be executed concurrently, and how the split between I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive <b>processes</b> <b>is</b> to be handled.

5|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory.

In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass. The <b>process</b> <b>was</b> neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the <b>process</b> <b>was</b> approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
