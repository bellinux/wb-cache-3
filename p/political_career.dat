40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{analytical}} {{framework for the}} study of <b>political</b> <b>careers</b> in multi-level systems. It is argued that the study of vertical movements between political arenas, which constitutes the prevalent methodological approach in the literature on <b>political</b> <b>careers,</b> should be complemented by the study of horizontal movements within political arenas. Based on a longitudinal analysis of individual <b>political</b> <b>careers,</b> the micro-approach developed in this article allows the comprehension of all territorial dynamics of <b>political</b> <b>careers</b> in multi-level systems. Based on an in-depth case study of all 419 Walloon careers in Belgium, four career patterns are identified: national careers, regional careers, multi-level careers and discrete careers. Although Belgium presents an integrated structure of opportunity, it is demonstrated that key evidences underline the prevalence of a regional and a national political class along a highly integrated political elites.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} <b>political</b> <b>careers</b> adopt a macro {{perspective}} to establish career patterns which brings {{the risk of}} overlooking the importance of transfers between parliaments in the estab-lishment of career patterns. As movements between levels often hides a more complex empiric reality of <b>political</b> <b>careers,</b> this research suggests to adopt a micro-longitudinal perspective through the systematic analysis of individual <b>political</b> <b>careers.</b> Based on an in-depth case study of Walloon trajectories in Belgium, this article demonstrates that this approach permit to un-cover other patterns. Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies, the findings conclude that Wallonia is not only characterized by the integrated career, but completed by three other robust career patterns, the alternative pattern with the regional and federal careers and the discrete pattern...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the effects of {{decentralization}} on the <b>political</b> <b>careers</b> of regional elites. We observe on the trajectories of the heads of governments of the regions of Spain, France and United Kingdom, focusing on their <b>political</b> <b>careers</b> through multilevel arenas. We ask what are the main career patterns (national or local) and whether there are differences in these patterns by type and evolution of decentralization process. The data analysis reveals the existence of different career patterns, in which local and national experience tend to dissociate, creating different cursus honorum. The institutional structure and timing of the evolution of decentralization also produced differences in the type of careers. In France the regional presidents tend to follow a traditional career pattern, while in Spain are specific territorial trajectories. Furthermore, consolidation of regional institutions seems to contribute to the emergence of distinct <b>political</b> <b>careers</b> for regional leaders...|$|R
