[...] In fact, it is possible to write down all these static stellar models in a way which makes clear that they exist in plenitude. [...] Given this success, it may come as a nasty shock that it seems to be very difficult, mathematically speaking, to construct rotating stellar models in which a <b>perfect</b> <b>fluid</b> interior is matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior.

2500|$|Under {{experimentally}} achievable {{conditions for}} gravitational systems {{this effect is}} too small to be observed directly. However, in September 2010 an experimental set-up created a laboratory [...] "white hole event horizon" [...] that the experimenters claimed was shown to radiate an optical analog to Hawking radiation, although its status as a genuine confirmation remains in doubt.

2500|$|Be this as it may, {{very few}} {{examples}} of exact solutions modeling isolated and rotating objects in general relativity are presently known. [...] In fact, the list of useful solutions presently consists of the Neugebauer-Meinel dust (which models a rigidly rotating thin (finite radius) disk of dust surrounded by an asymptotically flat vacuum region) and a few variants. [...] In particular, there is no known <b>perfect</b> <b>fluid</b> source which can be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior, {{as one would expect}} in order to create the simplest possible model of a rotating star.

2500|$|Einstein {{took the}} first {{opportunity}} to proclaim his approval of the new theory. [...] In a keynote address to {{the annual meeting of}} the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, given in Vienna on September 23, 1913, Einstein surveyed the state of the art, declaring that only his own work with Marcel Grossmann and the second theory of Nordström were worthy of consideration.

2500|$|Indeed, if {{some argue}} that an {{interior}} solution which matches to the Kerr vacuum, which has Petrov type D, should also be type D. [...] There {{is in fact a}} known <b>perfect</b> <b>fluid</b> solution, the Wahlquist fluid, which is Petrov type D and which has a definite surface across which one can attempt to match to a vacuum exterior. [...] However, {{it turns out that the}} Wahlquist fluid cannot be matched to any asymptotically flat vacuum region. [...] In particular, contrary to naive expectation, it cannot be matched to a Kerr vacuum exterior. [...] A tiny minority of physicists (actually, a minority of one) appear to believe that general relativity is unacceptable because it does not allow sufficiently general asymptotically flat solutions (evidently this argument implicitly assumes that we have decisively rejected at least some Machian principles!), but a sequence of increasingly sophisticated and general existence results appears to contradict this assumption.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{recognized}} by J. J. Thomson in 1881 that a charged sphere moving in a space filled with a medium of a specific inductive capacity (the electromagnetic aether of James Clerk Maxwell), is harder {{to set in motion}} than an uncharged body. (Similar considerations were already made by George Gabriel Stokes (1843) with respect to hydrodynamics, who showed that the inertia of a body moving in an incompressible <b>perfect</b> <b>fluid</b> is increased.) So due to this self-induction effect, electrostatic energy behaves as having some sort of momentum and [...] "apparent" [...] electromagnetic mass, which can increase the ordinary mechanical mass of the bodies, or in more modern terms, the increase should arise from their electromagnetic self-energy. This idea was worked out in more detail by Oliver Heaviside (1889), Thomson (1893), George Frederick Charles Searle (1897), Max Abraham (1902), Hendrik Lorentz (1892, 1904), and was directly applied to the electron by using the Abraham–Lorentz force.
