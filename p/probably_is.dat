5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais {{also ordered}} the {{destruction}} of the old cathedral that had been built by Aldhun, {{to make way for the}} construction of a new, larger cathedral, the current Romanesque-style Durham Cathedral. The construction of the new cathedral began on 29 July 1093, when St-Calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating the site. The first stones were laid shortly afterwards, on 11 August 1093. However, St-Calais' exile after his trial as well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric, and this <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> the cause of the medieval chronicler Symeon of Durham's comparatively neutral treatment of St-Calais in his works. There is no evidence of St-Calais performing any of the normal episcopal functions, including consecrating priests or churches.|$|E
5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E

25|$|The three {{commentaries on}} Yaska's Nirukta text are by Hindu {{scholars}} named Durgasinha (also known as Durga) who likely lived before the 6th-century CE, Skanda-Mahesvara {{who may be}} two scholars who probably lived before the 5th-century CE, and Nilakantha who <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> from the 14th-century.|$|E
25|$|Amphidromus perversus perversus f. infraviridis von Martens, 1867, <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> a {{derivative}} of the Celebesian infrapictus. Instead of flammulations and a basal purplish zone {{it has a}} pale green or greenish-yellow base which is only slightly darker than the greenish-yellow or citron-colored spire. It is most similar to typical perversus but differs in the darker basal portion.|$|E
25|$|Many more {{traditional}} kinds exist worldwide; {{they have all}} involved human selection, so are classified as agricultural cultivars. Traditionally, Canna edulis Ker Gawl. has been reputed to be the species grown for food in South America, but C. edulis <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> simply a synonym of C. discolor, which is also grown for agricultural purposes throughout Asia.|$|E

25|$|Depression {{or having}} {{previously}} been depressed <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> due to altered brain structure or alters brain structure. Patients {{who have been}} depressed or are depressed show more activation to negative stimuli in emotion. When negative stimuli were presented to patients' right hemispheres, the patients were significantly more accurate and quicker {{to respond to the}} stimuli. The data in this study shows that psychological disorders are correlated with increased lateralization.|$|E
25|$|Development of an {{effective}} global surveillance and response system <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> {{at least a decade}} or more away, owing to inadequate coordination and funding at the international level and lack of capacity, funds, and commitment in many developing and former communist states. Although overall global health care capacity has improved substantially in recent decades, the gap between rich and poorer countries in the availability and quality of health care.|$|E
25|$|The fourth law of {{thermodynamics}} and {{the concept}} of material entropy as proposed by Georgescu to redress his first mistake have no scientific basis in physics whatsoever, and it was a theoretical mistake by Georgescu to make these propositions at all (Georgescu's second mistake); but by itself, this does not imply that complete and perpetual recycling of material resources is possible, as it most <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> impossible on other grounds (see below).|$|E

25|$|Outside of Scandinavia, the Isle of Man {{stands out}} with its 30 runestones from the 9th century and early 11th century. Scattered runestones {{have also been}} found in England, Ireland, Scotland and the Faroe Islands. With the {{exception}} of the runestone on Berezan', there are no runestones in Eastern Europe, which <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> {{due to a lack of}} available stones and the fact that the local population probably did not treat the foreigners' stones with much respect.|$|E
25|$|Only one {{of these}} {{traditional}} biographies supplies a date of birth for Juvenal: it gives 55 AD, which most <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> speculation, but accords reasonably well {{with the rest of}} the evidence. Other traditions have him surviving for some time past the year of Hadrian's death (138 AD). Some sources place his death in exile, others have him being recalled to Rome (the latter of which is considered more plausible by contemporary scholars). If he was exiled by Domitian, then it is possible that he was one of the political exiles recalled during the brief reign of Nerva.|$|E
25|$|While Iraq's WMD {{capabilities}} were degraded under UN {{supervision and}} set back by Coalition strikes, some capabilities remain and others could quickly be regenerated. Despite claims that WMD efforts have ceased, Iraq <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> continuing clandestine nuclear research, retains stocks {{of chemical and}} biological munitions, and is concealing extended-range SCUD missiles, possibly equipped with CBW payloads. Even if Baghdad reversed its course and surrendered all WMD capabilities, it retains the scientific, technical, and industrial infrastructure to replace agents and munitions within weeks or months. A special concern {{is the absence of}} a UN inspection and monitoring presence, which until December 1998 had been paramount to preventing large-scale resumption of prohibited weapons programs. A new disarmament regime must be reintroduced into Iraq as soon as possible and allowed to carry out the mandates dictated by the post-Gulf War UN resolutions.|$|E

25|$|International {{organizations}} such as WHO and the World Bank, institutions in several developed countries such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) will continue {{to play an important}} role in strengthening both international and national surveillance and response systems for infectious diseases. Development of an integrated global surveillance and response system <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> at least a decade or more away. This owes to the magnitude of the challenge; inadequate coordination at the international level; and lack of funds, capacity, and, in some cases, cooperation and commitment at the national level. Some countries hide or understate their infectious disease problems for reasons of prestige and fear of economic losses. Total international health-related aid to low- and middle-income countries—some $2–3 billion annually—remains a fraction of the $250 billion health bill of these countries.|$|E
25|$|The Qutb Shahi rulers invited many Persian {{artists like}} Shaykh Abbasi and Muhammad Zaman in their court, which left a {{profound}} impact of different phases of Iranian art on the miniature paintings of this period. The earliest miniature paintings like the 126 illustrations in the manuscript of Anwar-i-Suhayli (c. 1550–1560) in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and the illustrations in Sindbad Namah in the India Office Library, London and Shirin and Khusrau in the Khudabaksh Library, Patna most probably belong to the period of reign of Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah. First 6 of the total 8 illustrations in the manuscript of Kulliyat-i-Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah (c. 1590–1600) in Salar Jung Museum, Hyderabad are masterpieces. The 5 illustrations in a manuscript of the Diwan-i-Hafiz (c.1630) in the British Museum, London belonged to the period of reign of Abdullah Qutb Shah. The most outstanding surviving Golkonda painting <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> the Procession of Sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah riding an elephant (c. 1650) in Saltykov-Shtshedrine State Public Library, St. Petersberg.|$|E
25|$|Non-revenue water. According to {{the results}} of a Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Program carried out by the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) in 2006 in 28 cities, the average level of non-revenue water (NRW) was 44 percent. Another study of 20 cities by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission {{with the support of the}} Asian Development Bank showed an average level of non-revenue water (NRW) of 32%. However, 5 out of the 20 cities did not provide any data. For those that {{provided}} data there <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> a large margin of error, since only 25% of connections are metered, which makes it very difficult to estimate non-revenue water. Also, three utilities in the sample show NRW levels of less than 20%, two of which have practically no metering, which indicates that the numbers are not reliable and actual values are likely to be higher. In Delhi, which was not included in the ADB study, non-revenue water stood at 53% and there were about 20 employees per 1000 connections. Furthermore, only 70% of revenue billed was actually collected.|$|E

25|$|ONJ, {{even in its}} mild or minor forms, {{creates a}} marrow {{environment}} that is conducive to bacterial growth. Since many individuals have low-grade infections of the teeth and gums, this <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the major}} mechanisms by which the marrow blood flow problem can worsen; any local infection / inflammation will cause increased pressures and clotting in the area involved. No other bones have this mechanism as a major risk factor for osteonecrosis. A wide variety of bacteria have been cultured from ONJ lesions. Typically, they are the same microorganisms as those found in periodontitis or devitalized teeth. However, according to special staining of biopsied tissues, bacterial elements are rarely found in large numbers. So while ONJ is not primarily an infection, many cases have a secondary, very low-level of bacterial infection and chronic non-suppurative osteomyelitis can be associated with ONJ. Fungal infections in the involved bone {{do not seem to be}} a problem, but viral infections have not been studied. Some viruses, such as the smallpox virus (no longer existent in the wild) can produce osteonecrosis.|$|E

On March 20, Vince Lascheid, Penguins and Pittsburgh Pirates organist of 33years, died. Vice President of Communications Tom McMillan said, [...] " [...] <b>probably</b> <b>is</b> the only organist {{in the history of}} professional sports to be inducted into a team Hall of Fame."
