40|$|AbSTRACT There is {{disagreement}} about {{the association between}} missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{and the presence of}} temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Here, the purpose was to investigate whether the number of missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> their distribution, age, and gender are associated with TMD. Seven hundred and forty-one individuals, aged 21 - 60 years, with missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> 386 with and 355 without TMD, were included. Four variables—gender, age, the number of missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> and the number of dental quadrants with missing posterior teeth—were analyzed with a logistic regression model. All four variables—gender (OR = 1. 59, men = 1, women = 2), age (OR = 0. 98), the num-ber of missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> (OR = 0. 51), and the number of dental quadrants with missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> (OR = 7. 71) —were entered into the logistic model (P < 0. 01). The results indicate that indi-viduals who lose <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> with fewer miss-ing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> but in more quadrants, have a higher prevalence of TMD, especially young women.

30|$|This {{study showed}} that <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{uprighting}} is usually obtained when using continues archwires and anterior vertical elastics to close anterior open bite, especially in the mandibular arch. However, uprighting of the <b>posterior</b> maxillary <b>teeth</b> is more difficult, primarily in extraction cases. Therefore, mechanical procedures such as the multiloop edgewise archwire technique [13, 14] or mesially angulating the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> accessories with continuous archwires [15 – 17, 24] are recommended to increase the possibility of actually uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> If, in fact, this mesial angulation increases treatment stability, {{this will be a}} contributing factor. Nevertheless, despite some clinical evidence that uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> will increase treatment stability, this has yet to be investigated.|$|R
30|$|In the mandibular arch, all <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> were {{significantly}} distally angulated with treatment (Table  2). This shows that even without intentionally trying to distally tip these teeth with tip-back bends in the archwires or by mesially angulating the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> accessories, {{it is possible}} to upright, at least, the mandibular <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> If uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> actually leads to more stability, as speculated [13, 14, 16, 17, 24], this may have contributed to it in an earlier study with some of these patients [6]. Therefore, the principle of uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> can be partially accomplished even without the mentioned procedures [13 – 16, 24]. This uprighting may also be seen as a necessary dentoalveolar change to compensate for the divergent palatal and mandibular planes that are usually associated with open-bite characteristics [40].|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} method to upright the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> instead of incorporating tip-back bends on the archwires, is to mesially angulate the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> accessories and use continuous archwires associated with anterior vertical intermaxillary elastics [14 – 17]. This procedure may simplify the orthodontic mechanics and provide more patient comfort. It is also {{speculated that the}} procedure of uprighting the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> will provide more treatment stability [14, 17].|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{participants}} in this study are divided into 3 groups; group A contains 5 participants with anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> 5 without anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> the rest without anterior teeth drifting nor unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> The electromyograph biofeedback used to measure the chewing strength and we compare the score among the three groups. Introduction Anterior dental drifting of the upper jaw has became common problem after unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> and create diastema, protrusion, and teeth curve change that eventually leads to malocclusion, periodontal and esthetics problems. Contraction and relaxation of masseter muscle will increase vertical, lateral and oblique pressure force distributed to all the teeth. High chewing strength in mastication process {{is one of the main}} cause of the drifting. Untill now, there is no research show how high the chewing strength can influnce the anterior teeth drifting in case of unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> Objectives The objective of this study is to observe influence of chewing strength towards anterior teeth drifting. Methods Fifteen {{participants in}} this study are divided into 3 groups; group A contains 5 participants with anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> 5 without anterior teeth drifting with unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> the rest without anterior teeth drifting nor unreplaced missing <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> The electromyograph biofeedback used to measure the chewing strength and we compare the score among the three groups. Results Data that we got would be analyzed by using Kruskal Wallis Test and there is no significant difference of chewing strength among the three groups (p> 0. 005).

40|$|The Mentawai {{ethnic group}} is {{accustomed}} {{to the practice of}} anterior teeth mutilation on males and females prior to reaching puberty age at Siberut Island, Mentawai Islands Regency, West Sumatra Province. Objective: of this research was to analyze the effects of anterior teeth mutilation on the teeth of the Mentawai ethnic, and prove that there is a correlation between anterior <b>teeth</b> mutilation and <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> attritions. Material & method: There were 179 respondents who contributed to this study by applying accidental sampling method, consist of 96 respondents had anterior teeth mutilations and 83 non-mutilation respondents were found. Among respondents with anterior teeth mutilation, 53. 07 % of them had <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> attritions. Only 0. 56 % of the respondent with anterior teeth mutilation did not have <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> attrition. On the other hand, respondent without anterior teeth mutilation who got <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> attritiona nd without <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> attrition were almost similar (27. 93 % and 18. 44 %, respectively).

50|$|The {{anterior}} <b>teeth</b> {{protect the}} <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> by providing for a plane of guidance during excursions, thus allowing the cusps of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> to disclude rather than strike one another during lateral or protrusive movements from centric relation. In other words, the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> have much larger crowns {{and many more}} cusps than the anterior <b>teeth.</b> Because <b>posterior</b> crowns are so much wider and possess cuspal projections in various configurations, the cusps of the maxillary teeth {{and those of the}} mandibular teeth have an opportunity to bang into each other during chewing, speech or simply meeting together when one bites down. To prevent this from happening, the anterior teeth of each arch will, ideally, be situated so as to come into contact before the cusps of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> do, thus preventing wear on the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> This requires less force because the anterior teeth are further from the joint (analogous to stopping a door further from its hinge).|$|R
30|$|Therefore, the {{objective}} {{of this study is to}} investigate whether the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are able to be uprighted even when no tip-back bends are incorporated or the accessories of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are not mesially tipped, in non-extraction and extraction open-bite treatments.|$|R

50|$|This type of {{intrusion}} {{consists of}} true intrusion of incisors without any extrusion of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> The incisors in the anterior teeth (depending on the arch) move towards {{the bone and}} no movement of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> is seen in comparison with relative intrusion where <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> erupt out of the bone. A light continuous force is known to achieve true intrusion. True intrusion {{can be done with}} methods such as Burstonian segmental arch mechanics or the use of TADs anteriorly.|$|R
50|$|The <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{protect the}} {{anterior}} teeth {{by providing a}} stable vertical dimension of occlusion. While anterior teeth may retain their natural position even after loss of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> the masticatory forces will eventually cause the single-rooted anterior to splay, thus leading to a collapsed bite.|$|R
5000|$|Cortical bone {{is known}} to resorb slower than the {{medullary}} bone. Therefore, cortical anchorage is used in orthodontics to allow for slower movement of teeth, especially molars in the posterior dentition. A clinician may produce a movement which allows the buccal roots of the permanent molars to move buccally (outside), eventually contacting the cortical bone. It is claimed that that by using cortical bone against <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> mesial movement of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> can be prevented which helps in anchoring the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> {{in the back of}} the jaw.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Facial {{skeletal}} asymmetry {{is commonly}} found in humans and its main characteristic is menton deviation. The literature suggests that occlusal and masticatory problems arising from tooth absence {{could be related to}} the development of such asymmetries. Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the prevalence of mandibular skeletal asymmetries and to investigate its association with <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absences. Methods: Tomographic images of 952 individuals aged from 18 to 75 years old were used. Asymmetry was the analyzed outcome, and it was categorized into three groups according to gnathion displacement in relation to the midsagittal plane (relative symmetry, moderate asymmetry, and severe asymmetry). Patients were sorted by the presence of all <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth,</b> unilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence, or bilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence. Chi-square test with a significance level of 5 % was used to verify the association between <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence and asymmetry. Results: Results show relative symmetry present in 55. 3 % of the sample, as well as the prevalence of 27. 3 % for moderate mandibular asymmetry and 17. 4 % for severe asymmetry. Moderate and severe mandibular asymmetries occurred in a higher proportion in patients with unilateral <b>posterior</b> <b>tooth</b> absence. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the analyzed groups (p = 0. 691). Conclusions: In this study, mandibular asymmetries did not present any association with the absence of <b>teeth</b> on the <b>posterior</b> area of the arch...|$|R

30|$|Although the {{principle}} of intentionally uprighting the posterior either with tip-back bends on the archwires or by mesially angulating the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> accessories has been developed some time ago, this principle was not generally used [14, 17].

However, it is quite obvious that some uprighting of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> may occur even if no tip-back bends are incorporated or the accessories of the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> are not mesially tipped, due to {{the action of the}} elastic forces on these teeth [15 – 17, 24].|$|R

The esthetic concern of the patients and safety concerns about use of amalgam are changing the conventional trends of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> restoration. Some dental schools have even declined the use of amalgam in their institutions. But the properties of amalgam such as its high strength and less wear over a period of time are still making it the best alternative for the <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth</b> restoration. This study was conducted to evaluate the attitude of the dental students towards the use of amalgam and resin composites in restoration of <b>posterior</b> <b>teeth.</b> A 20 items online questionnaire was sent to 82 fifth year dentistry students of Al Quds University.
