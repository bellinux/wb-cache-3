40|$|Although, as {{a result}} of the {{introduction}} <b>of</b> the <b>Teaching</b> Excellence Framework, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> excellence is receiving renewed attention in English higher education, the idea has been left largely undefined. The cynic might argue, in agreement with Bill Readings, that this lack of a precise definition is deliberate, since teaching excellence is not designed to observe teaching but to permit an integrated system of accounting. This article, however, develops a different line of criticism. Following Readings’s characterization of “excellence” as symptomatic of the “Americanization” of higher education, it traces the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> excellence in English educational discourse back to the influence of debates, led by Ernest Boyer in the US, concerning the teaching-research nexus. Contextualizing these debates in relation to ideas about the learning society influenced by theories of human capital and investment in national productivity, it takes issue with descriptions of recent policy that overemphasize the corporate structure of the university and its vision of the student as consumer at the expense of recognizing the continuation of the nation-state organization of the student as producer. Reconnecting this broader framework back to the teaching-research nexus, the article examines how this intersects with the dominant agenda <b>of</b> research-led <b>teaching</b> excellence, centred on the idea of the productivity of research, and outlines an alternative notion of teaching-led research, developed out of the work of Boyer and Walter Benjamin, within which teaching might continue, in spite of excellence...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate, taking a socio-cultural approach, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning Japanese language during the introductory period, i. e., the starting point of learning. Specifically, I examine how language is developed among children during the introductory period through interactions with others within a social community, namely a classroom. This examination is based on the following perspectives: (1) cross-sectionaly analyses of socio-cultural reciprocal behaviors that {{can be seen in the}} formation process of classroom communications, from viewpoints of conversations between students and the teacher (Tsuchida), conversations among students, conversations between the teacher and students' parents, and Tsuchida's own inner reflections; and (2) analyses of language development among children in Tsuchida's classroom in 1954 from successive and longitudinal viewpoints. These analyses reveal Tsuchida's <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching.</b> Specifically, Tsuchida's practice during the introductory period helps children experience their language development as a firsthand experience through "group discussions" (communication activities) based on their language development, within a designed setting of a learning environment in which micro-, meso-, exo-, and marco-socio-cultural contexts are mutually and organically made functional. In this way, Tsuchida tried to construct children's language development as incarnated knowledge and skills. A remaining task is to investigate contents of communication activities during the introductory period, which are not fully described in Tsuchida's book...|$|R
