25|$|The {{apparent}} {{need for}} a <b>propagation</b> <b>medium</b> for such Hertzian waves {{can be seen by}} the fact that they consist of perpendicular electric (E) and magnetic (B or H) waves. The E waves consist of undulating dipolar electric fields, and all such dipoles appeared to require separated and opposite electric charges. Electric charge is an inextricable property of matter, so it appeared that some form of matter was required to provide the alternating current that would seem to have to exist at any point along the propagation path of the wave. Propagation of waves in a true vacuum would imply the existence of electric fields without associated electric charge, or of electric charge without associated matter. Albeit compatible with Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic induction of electric fields could not be demonstrated in vacuum, because all methods of detecting electric fields required electrically charged matter.|$|E

30|$|When an {{electromagnetic}} wave propagates in the porous media near the borehole formation, the signal amplitude attenuation is different {{because there are}} different resistivities among different <b>propagation</b> <b>mediums.</b> Based on that, by detecting the amplitude ratios and phase differences of induction electromotive force received by two receiver coils mounted on the resistivity LWD tool, the resistivities of different media can be reflected according to the measurement model of the tool.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study {{electromagnetic}} wave <b>propagation</b> in <b>mediums</b> {{in which the}} effective relative permittivity and the effective relative permeability are allowed to take any value in {{the upper half of}} the complex plane. A general condition is derived for the phase velocity to be oppositely directed to the power flow. That extends the recently studied case of <b>propagation</b> in <b>mediums</b> for which the relative permittivity and relative permeability are both simultaneously negative, to include dissipation as well. An illustrative case study demonstrates that in general the spectrum divides into five distinct regions...|$|R

Dispersion of a signal <b>propagation</b> <b>medium</b> may result in unintentional conversion of impulse signals into chirps. On the other hand, many practical applications, such as chirped pulse amplifiers or echolocation systems, use chirp signals instead of impulses because of their inherently lower PAPR.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} robust, data-driven localization methodology {{based on the}} integration of matched field processing with compressed sensing ℓ 1 recovery techniques and scale transform signal processing. The localization methodology is applied to an ultrasonic guided wave structural health monitoring system for detecting, locating, and imaging damage in civil infrastructures. In these systems, the channels are characterized by complex, multi-modal, and frequency dispersive wave propagation, which severely distort propagating signals. Acquiring the characteristics of these <b>propagation</b> <b>mediums</b> from data represents a difficult inverse problem for which, in general, no readily available solution exists. In this dissertation, we build data-driven models of these complex mediums by integrating experimental guided wave measurements with theoretical wave propagation models and ℓ 1 sparse recovery methods from compressed sensing. The data-driven models are combined with matched field processing, a localization framework extensively studied for underwater acoustics, to localize targets in complex, guided wave environments. The data-driven matched field processing methodology is then refined, {{through the use of}} the scale transform, to achieve robustness to environmental variations that distort guided waves. Data-driven matched field processing is experimentally applied to an ultrasound structural health monitoring system to detect and locate damage in aluminum plate structures...|$|R

In seismic exploration, shales represent the majority of the wave <b>propagation</b> <b>medium</b> overlying the petroleum reservoir. In conclusion, seismic properties of shale are important for both exploration and reservoir management.|$|E

50|$|PSSD solves Maxwell's {{equations}} by propagating them {{forward in}} a chosen spatial direction. The fields are therefore held {{as a function of}} time, and (possibly) any transverse spatial dimensions. The method is pseudo-spectral because temporal derivatives are calculated in the frequency domain with the aid of FFTs. Because the fields are held as functions of time, this enables arbitrary dispersion in the <b>propagation</b> <b>medium</b> to be rapidly and accurately modelled with minimal effort. However, the choice to propagate forward in space (rather than in time) brings with it some subtleties, particularly if reflections are important.|$|E

50|$|Ultrasonic reflectometry: A {{transducer}} generates ultrasonic waves which propagates {{until it}} reaches the interface between the <b>propagation</b> <b>medium</b> and the sample. The wave is partially reflected at the interface and partially transmitted into the sample. The waves reflected at the interface travel back to the transducer, then the impedance of a sample is determined by measuring the amplitude of the wave reflected from the propagation medium/sample interface. From the reflected wave, {{it is possible to}} determine some properties of the sample that is desired to characterize. Applications include medical ultrasonography and nondestructive testing.|$|E
50|$|A {{transmissometer}} is {{an instrument}} for measuring the extinction coefficient of the atmosphere, and for the determination of visual range.

Deviations from the law of reflection due to irregularities on a surface are also usually considered to be a form of scattering.
