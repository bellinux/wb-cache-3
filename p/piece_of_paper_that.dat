25|$|A {{postage stamp}} {{is a small}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> is {{purchased}} and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postage. Typically, stamps are printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are self-adhesive. Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other authorized vendor, and are {{used to pay for}} the costs involved in moving mail, as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration. They are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when sold to collectors who will not actually use them for postage.|$|E

[...] Along with Westfeldt, Hamm has appeared in Gap-related campaign advertisements. During April 2009, Hamm and Westfeldt formed their own production company, Points West Pictures. Hamm and Westfeldt are advocates of animal rescue and have adopted a mixed breed dog named Cora from the Much Love Animal Shelter in California.|$|E

His words in the speech are {{a matter of some}} debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: [...] "The State Department is infested with communists. I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." ...|$|E

500|$|In season two, Lex's curiosity {{with the}} symbols continues. Lex first kills Nixon before the {{reporter}} can kill Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) for protecting Clark from Nixon. When Clark discovers the Kawatche Caves, under a LuthorCorp construction site, Lex opts {{to be the}} curator of the caves to preserve them after he notices symbols on the cave walls that match the symbols on the disc, {{as well as an}} octagonal shape in the wall of the cave that would fit the disc perfectly. His interest grows more and more when he finds Clark constantly in the caves, and later with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> appears to indicate that Clark has deciphered the language on the cave walls — although, Clark denies being able to read the language. Lex's company eventually loses the Kawatche caves to Lionel as his father has also developed an interest in the caves and the octagonal disc. During all this, Lex also met and courted Dr. Helen Bryce (Emmanuelle Vaugier) but Helen would try to kill him on their honeymoon.|$|E
500|$|Kidnapped {{and thrown}} on a plane, they {{land on a}} remote island. They are led by the men in suits through a jungle {{wilderness}} to a large stone temple. The Dean of the Secret Order of Dirty Joke Writers appears from the shadows and leads the group into a large library, where the world's greatest geniuses study. The Dean explains {{that many of the}} world's greatest geniuses have come together to create dirty jokes and tailor jokes to where the need is greatest. The Dean takes them into a dark room. He reveals {{that they will not be}} permitted to leave the island now that they know about the network of joke distribution agents, like the bellhop. They are locked in a jail cell. As a diversion, Peter stabs Cleveland with a pencil. When the guard opens the door to investigate, the prisoners escape. They are recaptured by the Dean and his armed guards immediately. As they are about to be shot by the guards, an old man claims he has just written the world's greatest dirty joke and then suddenly dies. Peter snatches a small <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> the man dropped as he died, containing the joke. The prisoners escape with the joke on a small plane. As they fly over the secret enclave, it is destroyed in a fireball resulting from a burning drapery that Peter had set alight with a candle. Quagmire bemoans that they destroyed the source of all dirty jokes. Joe quickly realize that Peter has best one ever written. Peter, Joe, Cleveland and Quagmire then fly off into the sunset, after finding out the supposed greatest joke ever written is [...] "Guess what? Chicken butt!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 27, 1949, Rushmore {{published}} in the Journal-American allegations of communist infiltration of US naval vessels. Though {{the facts of the}} article were invented by Rushmore, by coincidence the FBI was conducting its own investigation on the same matter. Initially, J. Edgar Hoover thought that Rushmore had access to genuine intelligence. Hoover then had Rushmore's telephone tapped. Later in Olympia, Washington, Rushmore testified before the Canwell Committee, a state committee to investigate subversive activities at the University of Washington. Rushmore switched the subject to Washington, D.C. He waved a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> he claimed was an FBI report that named 150 federal employees that were members of a Soviet spy ring. When FBI agents intercepted him in a hotel lobby and asked about the document, he showed them a four-page letter that he typed himself. Then in the spring of 1953, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy asked Hoover about Rushmore's bonafides. The FBI's reply warned against relying on Rushmore's veracity. [...] " [...] writings have proved unreliable, due to his tendency to sensationalize and blow up fragments of information." [...] Though the FBI regarded Rushmore as a publicity seeker, McCarthy hired Rushmore anyway.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} assess not only the type but also the {{severity}} of neglect, doctors employ a variety of tests, {{most of which are}} carried out at the patient's bedside. Perhaps one of the most-used and quickest is the line bisection. In this test, a line a few inches long is drawn {{on a piece of paper}} and the patient is then asked to dissect the line at the midpoint. Patients exhibiting, for example, left-sided neglect will exhibit a rightward deviation of the line's true midpoint. Another widely used test is the line cancellation test. Here a patient is presented with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>that</b> has various lines scattered across it and is asked to mark each of the lines. Patients who exhibit left-sided neglect will completely ignore all lines on the left side of the paper. Visual neglect can also be assessed by having the patient draw a copy of a picture with which they are presented. If the patient is asked to draw a complex picture they may neglect the entire contralesional side of the picture. If asked to draw an individual object, the patient will not draw the contralesional side of that object. A patient may also be asked to read a page out of a book. The patient will be unable to orient their eyes to the left margin and will begin reading the page from the center. Presenting a single word to a patient will result in the patient either reading only the ipsilesional part of the word or replacing the part they cannot see with a logical substitute. For example, if they are presented with the word [...] "peanut", they may read [...] "nut" [...] or say [...] "walnut".|$|E
