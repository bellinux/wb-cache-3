Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the Golgi apparatus. The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces <b>pectins</b> and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>pectin</b> gelation {{depends on the}} degree of methoxylation. High methoxyl <b>pectin</b> gels due to hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between <b>pectin</b> molecules. Low methoxyl <b>pectin</b> forms gels in the presence of di- and polyvalent cations which cross link and neutralise the negative charges of the <b>pectin</b> molecule. Monovalent cations normally do not lead to gel formation with high methoxyl <b>pectin</b> solutions free of divalent cations, especially Ca. The present study found that alkali (NaOH or KOH) added to high methoxyl <b>pectin</b> leads to gel formation in a concentration-depended manner. It was also found that monovalent cations (Na and K) induce gelation of low methoxyl <b>pectin</b> and the time required for gel formation (setting time) depends on the cation concentration. The results indicate that a combined char-e neutralisation and ionic strength effect is responsible for the monovalent cation-induced gelation of <b>pectin.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|To {{provide more}} {{insight into the}} cation {{facilitated}} pectin-gel structure-function relationship, the microstructure of pectin-gels was explored using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM) in combination with physiochemical and rheological analysis. <b>Pectin</b> with different degrees of methylesterification, DM, was obtained from commercial citrus <b>pectin</b> (CP) and sugar beet <b>pectin</b> (SBP) by action of carrot <b>pectin</b> methylesterase. <b>Pectin</b> characterisation confirmed that <b>pectin</b> properties other than DM were unaltered and <b>pectin</b> from the two sources exhibited different structures. Cryo-SEM visualisation of pectin-gels prepared with different cations revealed that the network density increased with decreasing DM and increasing pH, <b>pectin</b> and cation-concentration. At a given DM, the more linear and less acetylated <b>pectin</b> (CP) exhibited a more intertwined fibrous network compared to the highly branched and more acetylated <b>pectin</b> (SBP). Furthermore, gel-microstructure was influenced by type of cation with Zn 2 +, Fe 2 + and Ca 2 +-pectin gels showing a more intertwined network compared to Mg 2 +-pectin gels.

40|$|The {{importance}} of many factors for the cloud stability {{of orange juice}} was investigated.

This mechanism was confirmed when the addition of pectic acid clarified the orange juice artificially.
