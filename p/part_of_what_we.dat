500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{had first}} played Fillmore East in December 1969, opening for Blood, Sweat & Tears for three nights. Promoter Bill Graham enjoyed {{the band and}} promised to have them back soon. In January 1970, the band opened for Buddy Guy and B.B. King at San Francisco's Fillmore West, and one month later at Fillmore East {{supporting}} the Grateful Dead. According to biographer Alan Paul, [...] "these shows were crucial in establishing the band and exposing them to a wider, sympathetic audience on both coasts." [...] Drummer Butch Trucks considered their performances at the Fillmore East to be the launching pad for their success. In 1970, Duane Allman told disc jockey Ed Shane, [...] "You know, we get kind of frustrated doing the [...] records, and I think, consequently, our next album will be... a live recording, {{to get some of}} that natural fire on it." [...] "We were not intentionally trying to buck the system, but keeping each song down to 3:14 just didn't work for us," [...] remembered Gregg Allman. [...] "And we realized that the audience was a big <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did, which couldn't be duplicated in a studio.

At Fillmore East was recorded over three nights — March 11, 12, and 13, 1971 — at the Fillmore East in New York, for which the band was paid a nightly $1,250. At Fillmore East was released in July 1971 by Capricorn Records as a double album, [...] "people-priced" [...] for the cost of a single LP. While previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts (often {{near the bottom of the}} top 200), the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days. At Fillmore East peaked at number 13 on Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough. The album is considered among the best live albums of all time, and in 2004 was one of the albums selected for preservation in the Library of Congress, deemed [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" [...] by the National Recording Registry.|$|E

Of the changes, FremantleMedia said [...] "Neighbours is undergoing a work flow upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure {{we are at the}} forefront of professionalism and efficiency."

In this context, we are conducting a case study involving an 11 -year old severely physically handicapped child.

2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
50|$|The Scandinavian {{region has}} a rich prehistory, having been {{populated}} by several prehistoric cultures and people for about 12,000 years, {{since the end}} of the last ice age. During the ice age, all of Scandinavia was covered by glaciers most of the time, except for the southwestern <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> now know as Denmark. When the ice began retreating, the barren tundras were soon inhabited by reindeer and elk, and Ahrenburg and Swiderian hunters from the south followed them here to hunt occasionally. The geography then was very different from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know today. Sea levels were much lower; the island of Great Britain was connected by a land bridge to mainland Europe and the large area between Great Britain and the Jutlandic peninsula - now beneath the North Sea and known as Doggerland - was inhabited by tribes of hunter-gatherers. As the climate warmed up, forceful rivers of meltwater started to flow and shape the virgin lands, and more stable flora and fauna gradually began emerging in Scandinavia, and Denmark in particular. The first human settlers to inhabit Denmark and Scandinavia permanently were the Maglemosian people, residing in seasonal camps and exploiting the land, sea, rivers and lakes. It was not until around 6,000 BC that the approximate geography of Denmark as we know it today had been shaped.|$|R

Mallory developed the chords for [...] "There is Nothing More to Say" [...] while Curt wrote the melody and Michael Fennelly wrote the lyrics. The final song [...] "Anthem (Begin)" [...] was developed by Curt and Doug. Sandy Salisbury described the song [...] "Karmic Dream Sequence #1" [...] as [...] "perhaps the essence of the Millennium experience", by developing music that evokes [...] "feelings from the deepest <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were doing at that time in our lives. We were at once spontaneous in artistic expression and fixed in who we were as individuals." [...] The songs lyrics were written by Boettcher and Lee with Boettcher and Keith Olsen developing the music. The song included a Japanese woman invited by Boettcher to play the koto on the song. Mallory spoke on [...] "Karmic Dream Sequence #1", explaining that it came from a return trip from visiting his grandmother for the last time before she had died. [...] He wrote the first and second verse and showed it to Curt who wrote the bridge for it. [...] "5 A.M." [...] came from songwriter Sandy Salisbury who desired to [...] "write a melodic piece about the quite early-morning time" [...] Salisbury drew from his love of bossa nova music for this song, specifically Antônio Carlos Jobim.|$|R
