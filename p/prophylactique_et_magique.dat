40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the artwork of Max Bucaille (1906 - 1996), an obscure French artist who, {{as a professor}} of mathematics, had become famous mainly for his surrealistic collages. I am aiming to clarify the relationship of Bucaille to the Czech environment and the Czech artists. I am also focusing mainly on his imprisonment during WWII in prison camp Stalag IV C located in current Czech Republic; his activity in a group of Revolutionary Surrealists between 1947 and 1948, which also included members of Czech Group Ra; and his exhibitions in Czechoslovakia in the 1960 's. His work had been introduced to our country thanks to the affiliation of Brno based surrealist group Lacoste along with the international group C. I. A. F. M. A. (Centre international d'actualité fantastique <b>et</b> <b>magique)</b> which was founded in 1958 in Brussels, Bucaille was also among the founders of this group. Considering the focus of this work it is also necessary to mention and to outline the situation of post war surrealism in the Czech countries. There are also comments regarding post war searches for Czech artists which were halted by the political event of February 1948, which completely ended free artwork as well as foreign connections. Then there is a description of the liberalization that happened {{toward the end of the}} 1950 's [...] ...|$|R
