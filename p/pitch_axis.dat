5|$|During {{test flights}} of the Su-27Ms, {{which began in}} 1988, {{engineers}} discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of flight control surfaces at low speeds. The decision was therefore made to install thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country's Far East and was {{being used as a}} radar test bed. Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight cleared. Therefore the aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the <b>pitch</b> <b>axis,</b> and can deflect together or differentially.|$|E

40|$|Flapping wings can pitch passively {{about their}} {{pitching}} axes {{due to their}} flexibility, inertia, and aerodynamic loads. A shift in the <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> location can dynamically alter the aerodynamic loads, which in turn changes the passive pitching motion and the flight efficiency. Therefore, it is {{of great interest to}} investigate the optimal <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> for flapping wings to maximize the power efficiency during hovering flight. In this study, flapping wings are modeled as rigid plates with non-uniform mass distribution. The wing flexibility is represented by a linearly torsional spring at the wing root. A predictive quasi-steady aerodynamic model is used to evaluate the lift generated by such wings. Two extreme power consumption scenarios are modeled for hovering flight, i. e. the power consumed by a drive system with and without the capacity of kinetic energy recovery. For wings with different shapes, the optimal <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> location is found such that the cycle-averaged power consumption during hovering flight is minimized. Optimization results show that the optimal <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> is located between the leading edge and the mid-chord line, which shows close resemblance to insect wings. An optimal <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> can save up to 33 % of power during hovering flight when compared to traditional wings used by most of flapping wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). Traditional wings typically use the straight leading edge as the <b>pitching</b> <b>axis.</b> With the optimized <b>pitching</b> <b>axis,</b> flapping wings show higher pitching amplitudes and start the pitching reversals in advance of the sweeping reversals. These phenomena lead to higher lift-to-drag ratios and, thus, explain the lower power consumption. In addition, the optimized <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> provides the drive system higher potential to recycle energy during the deceleration phases as compared to their counterparts. This observation underlines the particular importance of the wing <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> location for energy-efficient FWMAVs when using kinetic energy recovery drive systems.

A control strategy based on extended state observer (ESO) is designed to obtain a fast response speed and highly accurate <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> control system and eliminate disturbances during the adjustment of pitch posture. First, a sufficient condition of stabilization for ESO is obtained by analyzing the steady-state error of the system under step input.

25|$|As {{improved}} jet fighters emerged, Gloster {{decided to}} modernise the F.4 while retaining {{as much of}} the manufacturing tooling as possible. The result was the definitive production model, the Meteor F.8 (G-41-K), serving as a major RAF fighter until the introduction of the Hawker Hunter and the Supermarine Swift. The first prototype F.8 was a modified F.4, followed by a true prototype, VT150, that flew on 12October 1948 at Moreton Valence. Flight testing of the F.8 prototype led to the discovery of an aerodynamic problem: after ammunition was expended, the aircraft became tail-heavy and unstable around the <b>pitch</b> <b>axis</b> due to the weight of fuel in fuselage tanks no longer being balanced by the ammunition. Gloster solved the problem by substituting the tail of the abortive G 42 single-engined jet fighter. The F.8 and other production variants successfully used the new tail design, giving the later Meteors a distinctive appearance, with taller straighter edges compared with the rounded tail of the F.4s and earlier marks.|$|E
500|$|After {{extensive}} {{wind tunnel}} testing, the stabilator was mounted {{at the top}} of the fin for optimum stability and control about the <b>pitch</b> <b>axis.</b> Because the vertical tail fin was only slightly shorter than the length of each wing and nearly as aerodynamically effective, it could act as a wing on rudder application (a phenomenon known as [...] "Dutch roll"). To offset this effect, the wings were angled downward to give 10° anhedral. The rudder was manually operated and supplemented by a small yaw damper surface mounted at the bottom of the fin.|$|E
2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. [...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the <b>pitch</b> <b>axis</b> of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.|$|E
40|$|Inspired by insect flights, {{flapping}} wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) keep attracting {{attention from}} the scientific community. One of the design objectives is to reproduce the high power efficiency of insect flight. However, {{there is no clear}} answer yet {{to the question of how}} to design flapping wings and their kinematics for power-efficient hovering flight. In this thesis, we aim to answer this research question from the perspectives of wing modeling, design and optimization. Quasi-steady aerodynamic models play an important role in evaluating aerodynamic performance and designing and optimizing flapping wings. In Chapter 2, we present a predictive quasi-steady model by including four aerodynamic loading terms. The loads result from the wing's translation, rotation, their coupling as well as the added-mass effect. The necessity of including all four of these terms in a quasi-steady model to predict both the aerodynamic force and torque is demonstrated. Validations indicate a good accuracy of predicting the center of pressure, the aerodynamic loads and the passive pitching motion for various Reynolds numbers. Moreover, compared to the existing quasi-steady models, the proposed model does not rely on any empirical parameters and, thus, is more predictive, which enables application to the shape and kinematics optimization of flapping wings. For flapping wings with passive pitching motion, a shift in the <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> location alters the aerodynamic loads, which in turn change the passive pitching motion and the flight efficiency. Therefore, in Chapter 3, we investigate the optimal <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> location for flapping wings to maximize the power efficiency during hovering flight. Optimization results show that the optimal <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> is located between the leading edge and the mid-chord line, which shows a close resemblance to insect wings. An optimal <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> can save up to 33 % of power during hovering flight when compared to optimized traditional wings used by most of the flapping wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). Traditional wings typically use the straight leading edge as the <b>pitching</b> <b>axis.</b> In addition, the optimized <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> enables the drive system to recycle more energy during the deceleration phases as compared to their counterparts. This observation underlines the particular importance of the wing <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> location for energy-efficient FWMAVs when using kinetic energy recovery drive systems. The presence of wing twist can alter the aerodynamic performance and power efficiency of flapping wings by changing the angle of attack. In order to study the optimal twist of flapping wings for hovering flight, we propose a computationally efficient fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model in Chapter 4. The model uses an analytical twist model and the quasi-steady aerodynamic model introduced in Chapter 2 for the structural and aerodynamic analysis, respectively. Based on the FSI model, we optimize the twist of a rectangular wing by minimizing the power consumption during hovering flight. The power efficiency of the optimized twistable wings is compared with corresponding optimized rigid wings. It is shown that the optimized twistable wings can not dramatically outperform the optimized rigid wings in terms of power efficiency, unless the pitching amplitude at the wing root is limited. When this amplitude decreases, the optimized twistable wings can always maintain high power efficiency by introducing certain twist while the optimized rigid wings need more power for hovering. Considering the high impact of the root stiffness on flapping kinematics and power consumption, we present an active hinge design which uses electrostatic force to change the hinge stiffness in Chapter 5. The hinge is realized by stacking three conducting spring steel layers which are separated by dielectric Mylar films. The theoretical model shows that the stacked layers can switch from slipping with respect to each other to sticking together when the resultant electrostatic force between layers, which can be controlled by the applied voltage, is above a threshold value. The switch from slipping to sticking will result in a dramatic increase of the hinge stiffness (about 9 x). Therefore, a short duration of the sticking can still lead to a considerable change in the passive pitching motion. Experimental results successfully show the decrease of the pitching amplitude with the increase of the applied voltage. Flight control based on the electrostatic force can be very power-efficient since there is ideally no power consumption due to the control operations. In Chapter 6, we retrospect and discuss the most important aspects related to the modeling, design and optimization of flapping wings for efficient hovering flight. In Chapter 7, the overall conclusions are drawn and recommendations for further study are provided. Structural Optimization and Mechanic...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{four key}} design {{parameters}} of cycloidal rotors, namely the airfoil section, number of blades, chord-to-radius ratio, and <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> location, are addressed. The four parameters, {{which have a}} strong effect on rotor aerodynamic efficiency, are analyzed with an analytical model and a numerical approach. The numerical method, {{which is based on}} a finite-volume discretization of two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations on a multiple sliding mesh, is proposed and validated against experimental data. A parametric analysis is then carried out considering a large-scale cyclogyro, suitable for payloads above 100 kg, in hovering conditions. Results demonstrate that the airfoil thickness significantly affects the rotor performance; such a result is partly in contrast with previous findings for small-scale and microscale configurations. Moreover, it will be shown that increasing the number of blades could result in a decrease of the rotor efficiency. The effect of chord-to-radius will demonstrate that values of around 0. 5 result in higher efficiency. Finally it is found out that for these large systems, in contrast with microscale cyclogyros, the generated thrust increases as the <b>pitching</b> <b>axis</b> is located away from the leading edge, up to 35 % of chord length.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were known}} for their poor pitch handling characteristics. The famous aerodynamicist Irv Culver told Albatross owner Jeff Byard that the problem came from three sources. First, the rotation axis of the all flying horizontal tail was located at 35% chord instead of slightly {{in front of the}} aerodynamic center at 25% chord. [...] Second, the horizontal tail rotation hinge had high friction. Third, the relatively soft <b>pitch</b> <b>axis</b> cable control system stored elastic energy reacting the friction in the tail hinge. As the pilot tried to input pitch controls into the unstable tail, the friction of the tailplane hinge prevented initial movement which then stored up energy in the control cables. The pilot then applied more force to get the desired reaction. Eventually, the high friction would break loose and the horizontal tail would move much farther than desired due to the higher than necessary force applied by the pilot and releasing the force in the control cables. The resulting over control often resulting in PIO and when near the ground would likely damage the aircraft. [...] Culver instructed the owner to move the hinge axis forward to 24.5%, add a downspring to the pitch control, and liberally lubricate the hinge axis before each flight to reduce friction. According to Byard, the plane flies significantly better with the improvements.|$|E

Inspired by the novel flapping wing mechanisms in insects, birds and bats, we have carried out a numerical study systematically investigating a three-dimensional flapping rigid wing with passively actuated lateral and rotational motion. Distinguishing it from the limited existing studies, this work performs a systematic examination on the effects of wing aspect ratio (AR = 1. 0 to infinity), inertia (density ratio σ = 4 – 32), torsional stiffness (frequency ratio F = 1. 5 – 10 and infinity) and pivot point (from chord-center to leading edge) on the dynamics response of a low AR rectangular wing under an initial zero speed flow field condition. The simulation results show that the symmetry breakdown of the flapping wing results in a forward/backward motion with a rotational pitching. When the wing reaches its stable periodic state, the induced pitching frequency is identical to its forced flapping frequency. However, depending on various kinematic and dynamic system parameters, (i. e. flapping frequency, density ratio and <b>pitching</b> <b>axis),</b> the lateral induced velocity shows a number of different oscillating frequencies. Furthermore, compared with a one degree of freedom (DoF) wing in the lateral direction only, the propulsion performance of such a two DoF wing relies very much on the magnitude of torsional stiffness adding on the pivot point, as well as its <b>pitching</b> <b>axis.</b> In all cases examined here, thrust force and moment generated by a long span wing is larger than that of a short wing, which is remarkably linked to the strong reverse von K´arm´an vortex street formed {{in the wake of a}} wing...|$|R
