50|$|The P100 {{was longer}} than the {{corresponding}} Cortina and Sierra models, and had a higher ride height due to having a multi leaf spring suspension in the rear and larger five-stud wheels all round. The hub design on the Cortina was a SA specific pattern and actually a Rover PCD, hence Rover SD1 alloys and steel wheels fit. The later Sierra front hubs were from the Granada with <b>adapter</b> <b>plates</b> to allow fitment of the heavier duty Ford Transit wheel. Its rear axle was lifted directly from the SWB Transit 80, hence {{the need for the}} front adapters to match.|$|R

50|$|The term {{may also}} be used to define {{replacement}} criteria for other components available from multiple sources. For example, a plug-compatible cooling fan may need to have not only the same physical size and shape, but also similar capability, run from the same voltage, use similar power, attach with a standard electrical connector, and have similar mounting arrangements. Some non-conforming units may be re-packaged or modified to meet plug-compatible requirements, as where an <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> is provided for mounting, or a different tool and instructions are supplied for installation, and these modifications would be reflected in the bill of materials for such components. Similar issues arise for computer system interfaces when competitors wish to offer an easy upgrade path.|$|R

5000|$|Power for the [...] "CERV-I" [...] is {{supplied}} by a specially-developed, lightweight {{version of the}} Chevrolet 283 cubic inch. V-8 that develops [...] and weighs only 350 pounds (159 kg). Such specific output, only one pound per horsepower, is rarely achieved in reciprocating engines, {{even in the most}} highly developed aircraft types. The dramatic reduction of weight was gained by using aluminum for the cylinder block, cylinder heads, water pump, starter motor body, flywheel, and clutch pressure plate. In the cylinder block, no bore liners are used and the pistons run directly on specially treated aluminum bores. Magnesium is used for the clutch housing, fuel injection manifold, and manifold <b>adapter</b> <b>plate.</b> Weight savings achieved through the use of lighter metals in the engine and clutch is in excess of 175 pounds (79 kg).|$|R

40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{completed}} under the TX- 100 blade manufacturing {{portion of the}} Carbon-Hybrid Blade Developments: Standard and Twist-Coupled Prototype project. The TX- 100 blade is a 9 meter prototype blade designed with bend-twist coupling to augment the mitigation of peak loads during normal turbine operation. This structural coupling was achieved by locating off axis carbon fiber in the outboard portion of the blade skins. The report will present the tooling selection, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> design and fabrication. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. The molds used {{for the production of}} the TX- 100 were originally built for the production of the CX- 100 blade. The same high pressure and low pressure skin molds were used to manufacture the TX- 100 skins. In order to compensate for the difference in skin thickness between the CX- 100 and the TX- 100, however, a new TX- 100 shear web plug and mold were required. Both the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture used for the CX- 100 blades could be utilized for the TX- 100 blades. A production run of seven TX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken at TPI Composites during the month of October, 2004. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain gauges before final assembly. After production at the TPI Composites facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico and three blades to the United States Department of Agriculture turbine field test facility in Bushland, Texas. An <b>adapter</b> <b>plate</b> was designed to allow the TX- 100 blades to be installed on existing Micon 65 / 13 M turbines at the USDA site. The conclusion of this program is the kick-off of the TX- 100 blade testing at the three testing facilities...|$|R
50|$|On September 6, 2003, the {{satellite}} was badly damaged while being worked {{on at the}} Lockheed Martin Space Systems factory in Sunnyvale, California. The satellite {{fell to the floor}} as a team was turning it into a horizontal position.
