We have analysed {{the generation of}} photoinduced black body radiation (photothermal radimometry signal) on monocrystalline silicon wafers. We report the particular role of {{each one of the}} main parameters involved on the <b>phototermal</b> signal. The parameter values were taken of the reported values for industrial silicon wafers.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{potential}} of bilayer graphene as a cryogenic microwave photodetector by studying the microwave absorption in fully suspended clean bilayer graphene pn junctions in the frequency range of $ 1 - 5 $ GHz at a temperature of 8 K. We observe a distinct photocurrent signal if the device is gated into the pn regime, while {{there is almost no}} signal for unipolar doping in either the nn or pp regimes. Most surprisingly, the photocurrent strongly peaks when one side of the junction is gated to the Dirac point (charge-neutrality point CNP), while the other remains in a highly doped state. This is different to previous results where optical radiation was used. We propose a new mechanism based on the <b>phototermal</b> effect explaining the large signal. It requires contact doping and a distinctly different transport mechanism on both sides: one side of graphene is ballistic and the other diffusive. By engineering partially diffusive and partially ballistic devices, the photocurrent can drastically be enhanced...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the <b>phototermal</b> instabilities in a Fabry-Perot cavity is reported, where one mirror {{consists}} of a silicon-nitride membrane coated by the molecular organic semiconductor tris(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminum and silver layers. We propose a theoretical model to describe the back-action associated with the delayed response of the cavity field to the radiation pressure force and the photothermal force. For the case under investigation, the photothermal force response occurs on a timescale that is {{comparable to that of}} mirror oscillations and dominates over the radiation pressure force. A phase diagram analysis has been performed to map the stability of the static solution {{as a function of the}} control parameters. The model equations are integrated numerically and the time history is compared to experimental measurements of the transmitted field and displacement of the membrane. In both experimental and theoretical data we observe large amplitude oscillations when the cavity length is scanned at a low speed compared to the growth rate of the instability. The perturbation is found to evolve through three regimes: sinusoidal oscillations, double peaks and single peaks followed by a lethargic regime. When the cavity length is scanned in opposite directions, dynamical hysteresis is observed, whose extension has a power law dependence on the scanning rate...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of Q-Switched Nd: YAG laser energy dose to human enamel caries. The specifications of Q-Switched Nd: YAG laser as followed: wavelength of 1064 ?nm and 6 ?ns pulse width. Caries enamel samples taken from human teeth molars of 17 - 35 ages and the type of media caries. Energy doses used in this study were 723. 65 mJ/cm 2, 767. 72 mJ/cm 2, and 1065. 515 mJ/cm 2; 5 Hz repetition rate, and 20 second exposure time. Samples characterized the surface morphology and the percentage of constituent elements, especially calcium/phosphorus (Ca/P) with FESEM-EDAX. The fraction volume and crystallinity percentage of hydroxyapatite (HA) with XRD and hardness value using Vickers Microhardness Test. The results indicated that exposure of Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser on enamel caries resulting cracks, holes, and melt due to plasma production effects in the surface. Plasma production effect also resulted in micro properties such as percentage of Ca/P was close to normal, the fraction volume and crystallinity percentage of HA went up but did not change the crystal structure (in terms of the lattice structure). The hardness value also rose as linear as exposure energy dose caused by <b>phototermal</b> effect. Based on the results, Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser can be used as contactless drill dental caries replacement candidate with the additional therapy effect such as localized caries {{in order to avoid the}} spread, the ratio of Ca/P approaching healthy teeth, the fraction volume and crystallinity percentage of HA rose and established stronger teeth with peak energy dose 1065. 515 mJ/cm 2...|$|E
40|$|Background: A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was {{employed}} {{as a source of}} ablation. The fundamental wavelength of the laser is 1064 nm, with pulse duration of 8 nanosecond operates with uniphase mode of TEM 00. In the following experiments, dentin samples (without caries and plaque) are exposed to pulse laser with Q-switching effect at various energy dose. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of laser ablation on dentin samples using Q-switched Nd:YAG laser exposure. Methods: The laser was operated in repetitive mode with frequency of 10 Hz. The energy dose of the laser was ranging from 13. 9 J/cm 2, 21. 2 J/cm 2 and 41. 7 J/cm 2. The target material comprised of human dentin. The laser was exposed in one mode with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Energy delivered to the target through free beam technique. The exposed human dentin was examined by using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluoresence scanning electron microscopy for energy dispersive (FESEM-EDAX). Microhardness of human dentin were examined by using microhardness vickers test (MVT). Results: The result obtained showed that the composition of hydroxyapatite of the dentin after exposed by Q-switched Nd:YAG laser are 75. 02 % to 78. 21 %, with microhardness of 38. 7 kgf/mm 2 to 86. 6 kgf/mm 2. This indicated that exposed pulsed Nd:YAG laser on the human dentin attributed to the <b>phototermal</b> effect. The power density created by the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser enables the heat to produce optical breakdown (melting and hole) associated with plasma formation and shock wave propagation, from energy dose of 21. 2 J/cm 2. From XRD analysis showed that the exposure of Nd:YAG laser did not involve in changing the crystal structure of the dentin, but due to photoablation effect. Conclusion: In conclusion, the application of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser as contactless drills in dentistry should be regarded as an alternative to the classical mechanical technique to improve the quality of the dentin treatment. Latar belakang: Mode Q-Switch pada laser Nd:YAG dapat menghasilkan fenomena ablasi pada dentin. Laser Nd:YAG yang digunakan mempunyai panjang gelombang 1064 nm, durasi pulsa 8 ns beroperasi dengan mode TEM 00. Sampel dentin yang digunakan tanpa karies dan plak, yang dipapari laser dengan mode Q-switch dalam berbagai variasi dosis energi. Tujuan: Tujuan penelitian ini adalah mengamati efek ablasi dentin secara in vitro akibat paparan laser Nd:YAG Q-switch dengan pengamatan morfologi permukaan, komposisi hidroksiapatit, dan uji kekerasan mikro. Metode: Laser Nd:YAG Q-switch dengan frekuensi 10 Hz dan variasi dosis energi 13, 9 J/cm 2, 21, 2 J/cm 2 dan 41, 7 J/cm 2 ditembakkan pada sampel dentin manusia dengan teknik penyinaran bebas tanpa dilewatkan serat optik. Dentin yang terbuka diamati menggunakan x-ray diffraction (XRD) dan fluoresence scanning electron microscopy for energy dispersive (FESEM-EDAX). Kekerasan mikro dari dentin juga diamati menggunakan microhardness vickers test (MVT). Hasil: Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa komposisi hidroksiapatit dari dentin setelah paparan laser Nd:YAG Q-Switch menunjukkan peningkatan berkisar 75, 02 % sampai 78, 21 % dibandingkan normal, dengan kekerasan mikro berkisar 38, 7 kgf/mm 2 sampai 86, 6 kgf/mm 2. Perubahan pada struktur mikro tersebut disebakan karena adanya efek fototermal. Kerapatan daya yang bervariasi berdasarkan variasi dosis energi menyebabkan efek panas pada dentin yang menyebabkan adanya fenomena optical breakdown, yang ditandai dengan munculnya efek leleh dan lubang pada sampel karena produksi plasma dan adanya gelombang kejut, mulai dosis 21, 2 J/cm 2. Berdasarkan uji XRD, efek yang muncul pada dentin tidak menyebabkan terjadinya perubahan struktur kristal hidroksiapatit, tetapi menyebabkan perubahan komposisi hidroksiapatit yang disebut dengan fotoablasi. Kesimpulan: Dapat disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan mode Q-switched pada laser Nd:YAG sebagai alat dengan kontak minimal dapat dijadikan teknik alternatif untuk meningkatkan kualitas perawatan dental. </p...|$|E
