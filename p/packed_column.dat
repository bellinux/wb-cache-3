25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a <b>packed</b> <b>column</b> or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode.

2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high pressure pump. The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a <b>packed</b> <b>column</b> containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate). [...] In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with [...] smaller silica particles (~1.7 μm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).|$|E

These denitrification studies produced process design information on a columnar denitrification plant and on continuous- flow, stirred-bed reactors.

40|$|Based on {{dimensionless}} paramters, equations {{are given}} which compare speed of analysis, pressure drop and plates per bar pressure drop for capillary GC, SFC with capillary columns and SFC with <b>packed</b> <b>columns.</b> With respect to speed of analysis, contemporary capillary SFC cannot compete with packed-column SFC. A further decrease in capillary column diameter {{will be needed}} to reach this goal. Decreasing the column diameter of capillary columns at the same time decreases the sample capacity and also places extremely stringent requirements on the speed of sample introduction and on the time constants of the detection systems. If the allowable pressure drop is a serious factor, as is expected from theory, open-tubular columns are to be preferred in terms of the maximum obtainable plate number. The effects of polar organic modifiers in capillary SFC are described and compared with those in <b>packed</b> <b>columns.</b> The introduction of modifier can cause a considerable reduction of the capacity factors in capillary SFC. Generally, the effects of modifiers in capillary SFC are not as large as those observed in <b>packed</b> <b>columns.</b> The interpretation of retenton data is severely hindred by the unavailability of accurate density data for binary supercritical fluids. Three methods for the calculation of critical properties of mixed fluids are compared. The coupling of SFC with FT-IR detection is discussed. For capillary SFC, a conflicting situation arises in which the cell volume that can be allowed without loss of resolution is much lower than the minimum volume required for good spectroscopy. It is shown that the on-line coupling of capillary SFC with IR spectroscopy will always be a compromise between chromatographic and spectorscopic requirements. For <b>packed</b> <b>columns</b> restrictions placed on the detector-cell volume are less stringent. Here, however, the on-line approach is severely hampered by the necessity to add modifiers to the mobile phase for the analysis of (even midly) polar solutes...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of existing methods to minimise the analysis time in gas chromatography (GC) being {{the subject of}} many publications in the scientific literature. Packed and (multi-) capillary columns are compared {{with respect to their}} deployment in fast GC. It is assumed that the contribution of the stationary phase to peak broadening can be neglected (low liquid phase loading and thin film columns, respectively). The treatment is based on the minimisation of the analysis time required on both column types for the resolution of a critical pair of solutes (resolution normalised conditions). Theoretical relationships are given, describing analysis time and the related pressure drop. The equations are expressed in reduced parameters, making a comparison of column types considerably simpler than with the conventional equations. Reduction of the characteristic diameter, being the inside column diameter for open tubular columns and the particle size for <b>packed</b> <b>columns,</b> is the best approach to increase the separation speed in gas chromatography. Extremely fast analysis is only possible when the required number of plates to separate a critical pair of solutes is relatively low. Reducing the analysis time by reduction of the characteristic diameter is accompanied by a proportionally higher required inlet pressure. Due to the high resistance of flow of <b>packed</b> <b>columns</b> this seriously limits the use of <b>packed</b> <b>columns</b> for fast GC. For fast GC hydrogen has to be used as carrier gas and in some situations vacuum-outlet operation of capillary columns allows a further minimisation of the analysis time. For fast GC the columns should be operated near the conditions for minimum plate height. Linear temperature programmed fast GC requires high column temperature programming rates. Reduction of the characteristic diameter affects the sample capacity of the 2 ̆ 2 fast columns 2 ̆ 2.
