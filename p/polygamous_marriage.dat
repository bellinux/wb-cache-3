25|$|Though {{celestial}} {{marriage is}} the only form of marriage recognized as a sacrament, the church permits sex within government-recognized marital unions, the notable exceptions being same-sex marriage, common law marriage, civil unions (in jurisdictions where marriage is available), and polygamy. The church is sensitive about its historical relationship with polygamy, and entry into a <b>polygamous</b> <b>marriage,</b> even where legal, will result in mandatory consideration of church discipline and possible excommunication. Today, the church's teachings allow married couples to decide what is appropriate sexual behavior between themselves. The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include various standards of modesty, which have varied according to cultural norms of the time. Serious offenses {{of the law of}} chastity may result in church discipline, including the possibility of excommunication.|$|E
25|$|In the 1800s, the {{practice}} of celestial marriage included plural marriage, a form of polygamy. According to a consensus of historians, {{the practice}} of plural marriage was taught by Joseph Smith, {{the founder of the}} Latter Day Saint movement, and after Smith's death was formally acknowledged in 1852 by Brigham Young, leader of the LDS Church. The practice became famous during the 19th century when it was opposed and outlawed by the United States federal government, resulting in an intense legal conflict, which culminated in LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issuing the 1890 Manifesto, which officially discontinued the creation of new plural marriages in church temples. Nevertheless, unofficial plural marriages continued within the LDS Church after 1890 for some years, often in Mexico. In 1904, the church issued a Second Manifesto, which discontinued the official practice worldwide and established excommunication as a possible penalty for violators. These manifestos did not automatically divorce existing plural unions, however, and some couples in the LDS Church continued to live together as plural families well into the 20th century, with the final <b>polygamous</b> <b>marriage</b> in the LDS Church ending in 1954 when one of Edward Eyring's two wives died.|$|E
40|$|Polygamy {{remains one}} of the key topics in various societies. It is through {{cultural}} practices, beliefs and also on the individuals’ choices that people decide to be committed to polygamy lifestyles. Polygyny remains widespread across the world. Over seventy percent of the societies known to Anthropologists permit men to marry more than one wife. There are consequences to each type of marriage that certain individuals might adapt to. Women who have entered into <b>polygamous</b> <b>marriages</b> have different experiences that can be enriching to those who practice monogamy. This paper highlights what people in <b>polygamous</b> <b>marriages</b> face on a daily basis.
