40|$|Abstract. Concentration of 4 {{heavy metals}} (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd) and <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> {{in the surface}} sediments {{collected}} from Chenglingji, Dongting Lake, were quantitatively analyzed. Distribution characteristics and possible sources of the heavy metals and <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> were discussed. Methods of single-factor index and geoaccumulation index were adopted to evaluate the potential ecological risks of heavy metal. The results showed that Cd was seriously polluted and in a strong ecological risk level; Cu, Pb and Zn pollution was mild in Chenglingji Port, Dongting Lake. <b>Petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> content of nearshore sediment was low exclude of area near Chenglingji Port, which significantly exceeded the standard value.

30|$|Total <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> was {{extracted}} from 0.2  g of sampled soil (wet weight) with 10  mL of polychlorotrifluoroethylene (H- 997; Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) as the extraction solvent. Total <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> in the solvent was quantified with an oil-measurement instrument OCMA- 350 (Horiba, Japan) based on infrared absorption analysis. A standard mixture of OCB (Horiba, Japan) consisting of 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, hexadecane and benzene {{was used as}} standard. Total <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> concentration per dry weight soil (g) was calculated and converted to mg/kg units from the actual TPH concentration data and moisture ratios of soil samples.|$|R

In{{organic pollutants}} might include other nutrients such as ammonia and phosphate, and radionuclides such as uranium (U) or radon (Rn) naturally present in some geological formations. Saltwater intrusion is also an example of natural contamination, but is very often intensified by human activities.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} set of Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) is from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9. A set of standards used in Europe exists and is often called the Dutch standards. The European Union (EU) is rapidly moving towards Europe-wide standards, {{although most of the}} industrialised nations in Europe have their own standards at present.

25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{determine}} exposure to benzene. Benzene {{itself can be}} measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid, phenylmercapturic acid, phenol, catechol, hydroquinone and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 μg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 μg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.|$|E
40|$|Bioremediation {{play key}} role in the {{treatment}} of <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> contaminated environment. Exposure of <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> into the environment occurs either due to human activities or accidentally and cause environmental pollution. <b>Petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> cause many toxic compounds which are potent immunotoxicants and carcinogenic to human being. Remedial methods for the treatment of petroleum contaminated environment include various physiochemical and biological methods. Due to the negative consequences caused by the physiochemical methods, the bioremediation technology is widely adapted and considered {{as one of the best}} technology for the treatment of petroleum contaminated environment. Bioremediation utilizes the natural ability of microorganism to degrade the hazardous compound into simpler and non hazardous form.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{building}} of the causeway, a [...] landfill was built near the river. Various materials were disposed of in the area, including petroleum waste oil, pipe and foam insulation, sewage sludge, and medical waste. While the landfill was shut down in 1992, samples by the Environmental Bureau of Investigation and the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper showed that ammonium levels around the leachate exceeded Canadian quality guidelines by as much as 15 times, and contained heavy metals, <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and PCBs. A mortality rate of 100percent was found for test trout and daphnia when exposed to water samples. Gemtec Limited, the company responsible for planning and closing the landfill, and the City of Moncton were charged on 12 March 2002, for offences relating to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) and the Fisheries Act. The city pleaded guilty on 23 September 2003, paid a $35,000 fine, and was ordered to help reduce the leachate flow from the landfill. Three years later, Gemtec Limited was fined a total of $6,000 and was ordered to contribute a total of $22,000 to the federal Environmental Damages Fund and the Jonathan Creek Committee.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the term}} [...] "aromatic" [...] was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. [...] Hofmann used the term for a class [...] of benzene compounds, many of which have odors (aromas), unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons. Aromaticity as a chemical property bears no general relationship with the olfactory properties of such compounds (how they smell), although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties that we recognize today are similar to unsaturated <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> like benzene.|$|E

40|$|A {{concept is}} {{proposed}} to assess in situ <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mineralization by combining data on oxidant consumption, production of reduced species, CH 4, alkalinity and {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (DIC) with measurements of stable isotope ratios. The concept was applied to a diesel fuel contaminated aquifer in Menziken, Switzerland, which was treated by engineered in situ bioremediation. In the contaminated aquifer, added oxidants (O 2 and NO − 3) were consumed, elevated concentrations of Fe(II), Mn(II), CH 4, alkalinity and DIC were detected and the DIC was generally depleted in 13 C compared to the background. The DIC production was larger than expected based on the consumption of dissolved oxidants {{and the production of}} reduced species. Stable carbon isotope balances revealed that the DIC production in the aquifer originated mainly from microbial <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mineralization, and that geochemical reactions such as carbonate dissolution produced little DIC. This suggests that <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> mineralization can be underestimated if it is determined based on concentrations of dissolved oxidants and reduced species...|$|R
2500|$|The {{composition}} of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, {{is also an important}} factor regulating animal growth. [...] Ruminants, which may digest cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also Environmental impact below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with formalin to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the partial conversion of <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> to protein through microbial action.|$|E

Normally in the United States, an Environmental Impact Report {{as well as a}} geotechnical investigation are conducted precedent to any major construction over bay mud. [...] Combined, these reports have developed much of the data base extant on bay mud characteristics, frequently yielding original field data from soil borings. [...] These data have demonstrated that in many locations the shallower bay muds contain concentrations of mercury, lead, chromium, <b>petroleum</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> PCBs, pesticides and other chemicals which exceed toxic limits: a geological record of human activities of the last century. [...] These data are particularly important to consider when dredging of bay muds is contemplated as part of a development project.
