5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E

In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people {{by the end of}} the month.|$|E

The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The same can be said for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E

25|$|Back in Britain, Collins met Austin John Marshall, {{whom she}} later married. She also {{proceeded}} with her singing career, appearing releasing on three compilations albums (A Jug of Punch, A <b>Pinch</b> <b>of</b> Salt and Rocket Along) in 1960 and an EP, Heroes in Love, in 1963 (now included with False True Lovers on the CD release). It was after that, {{in a series}} of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of Folk Roots, New Routes, with guitarist Davy Graham. 1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, The Sweet Primeroses, on which she was accompanied for the first time by Dolly Collins's portative organ. 1968's The Power of the True Love Knot also featured Dolly's accompaniment. In 1969, there was another collaboration, this time with The Young Tradition (featuring Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood and Royston Wood) and Dolly Collins, The Holly Bears the Crown. However, the album was not released until 1995.|$|E
25|$|Set in {{the parish}} of St Giles—a notorious slum {{district}} that Hogarth depicted in several works around this time—Gin Lane depicts the squalor and despair of a community raised on gin. Desperation, death and decay pervade the scene. The only businesses that flourish serve the gin industry: gin sellers; a distiller (the aptly named Kilman); the pawnbroker where the avaricious Mr. Gripe greedily takes the vital possessions (the carpenter offers his saw and the housewife her cooking utensils) of the alcoholic residents of the street {{in return for a}} few pennies to feed their habit; and the undertaker, for whom Hogarth implies at least a handful of new customers from this scene alone. Most shockingly, the focus of the picture is a woman in the foreground, who, addled by gin and driven to prostitution by her habit—as evidenced by the syphilitic sores on her legs—lets her baby slip unheeded from her arms and plunge to its death in the stairwell of the gin cellar below. Half-naked, she has no concern for anything other than a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> snuff. This mother was not such an exaggeration as she might appear: in 1734, Judith Dufour reclaimed her two-year-old child from the workhouse where it had been given a new set of clothes; she then strangled it and left the infant's body in a ditch so that she could sell the clothes (for 1s. 4d.) to buy gin. In another case, an elderly woman, Mary Estwick, let a toddler burn to death while she slept in a gin-induced stupor. Such cases provided a focus for anti-gin campaigners such as the indefatigable Thomas Wilson and the image of the neglectful and/or abusive mother became increasingly central to anti-gin propaganda. Sir John Gonson, whom Hogarth featured in his earlier A Harlot's Progress, turned his attention from prostitution to gin and began prosecuting gin-related crimes with severity.|$|E

[...] "It speaks of a very confident, classy musician near the height of his powers", Leng writes, while remarking on the contrast between Harrison in 1972–73 and the [...] "resigned figure" [...] he had portrayed in the Beatles' 1970 documentary film Let It Be.|$|E
500|$|Leave Home was {{released}} on January 10, 1977 and was well received by critics. Although the album did not receive much initial reception, Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone magazine gave the album a favorable review in 1977, {{saying that it is}} very similar to their debut yet more experienced sounding. He sums up the album with: [...] "The Ramones are as direct and witty as before. They've also lost just a <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> their studied rawness: whether this is a sign of maturity or sellout is a matter for debate. The Ramones make rousing music and damn good jokes, but they're in a bind: the hard rock of this group is so pure it may be perceived as a freak novelty by an awful lot of people." [...] In the 1979 book The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album was given 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

40|$|Today the {{statistical}} {{study on the}} edema of the tendon still remains in a state which requires further exploration. Therefore, by using a Mitamura's Abderhalden Dryer and Torsion-Balance, the author studied periodical changes of various edemas evoked by inflicting injuries to tendons, muscles, and skin of rabbits, and obtained the following results: 1. Of the Achilles tendon and long digital flexor tendon sutured groups, the edema both in the silk-thread group of the former and in the stainless-wire group of the latter {{was found to have}} reached its maximum stage around {{the end of the second}} week after operation, and it disappeared about the end of the sixth week. However, the degree of the edema is higher in the silkthread group than in the stainless-wire group. These findings coincide with microscopic ones. The normal water content of the Achilles tendon is about equal to that of the long digital flexor tendon when the Achilles tendon is severed. 2. Even in the case of severing the Achilles tendon, the edema reaches its maximum around the end of the second week after operation, and it practically disappears about the end of the sixth week. Likewise in the microscopic findings, the cellular substances are most abundant in the second week, showing an irregular inter-fiber spaces. These agree fairly well with the results obtained by Nakura and Takechi. 3. Changes of the edema evoked by <b>pinching</b> <b>of</b> the Achilles tendon, femur muscle, and femur skin take a similar course. The edema caused by the <b>pinching</b> <b>of</b> the musele and skin occurs more rapidly than that by the <b>pinching</b> <b>of</b> the tendon, especially markedly up to 24 hours after operation. 4. In comparing the degrees of the edema, it is highest in the case <b>of</b> <b>pinching</b> the femur muscle, followed by the <b>pinching</b> <b>of</b> the Achilles tendon → in the Achilles tendon sutured with silk thread → the severed part of the Achilles tendon → in the long digital flexor tendon sutured with stainless wire, in the order mentioned...|$|R

500|$|Frustrated at {{the lack}} of {{progress}} and feeling the <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> the American-British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November a new government under Hideki Tojo presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina. The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers. That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;, listing various military and diplomatic developments, observes that [...] "the threat to Japan was not purely economic." [...] the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.|$|E
