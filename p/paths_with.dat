5|$|If a continuous-time real-valued {{stochastic}} process meets certain moment conditions on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem {{says that there}} exists a modification of this process that has continuous sample <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> probability one, so the {{stochastic process}} has a continuous modification or version. The theorem can also be generalized to random fields so the index set is -dimensional Euclidean space {{as well as to}} stochastic processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.|$|E

5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} find the Fountain of Youth, Sparrow arrives in London only to learn someone is {{gathering}} a crew by using his name. While searching for the imposter, he saves Gibbs from being hanged but is captured by the Royal Guards. They present him to King GeorgeII. Sparrow is surprised to learn Captain Barbossa is now a privateer in the Royal Navy. Sparrow refuses to negotiate with them to locate the Fountain of Youth and escapes. Soon he crosses <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> his impersonator, an old flame named Angelica (Penélope Cruz). She shanghais him to serve aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship captained by her father Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who forces Sparrow {{to search for the}} Fountain of Youth.|$|E

5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of the American web {{television}} series Daredevil, {{which is based on}} the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a blind lawyer-by-day who fights crime at night, crossing <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> the deadly Frank Castle / Punisher along with the return of an old girlfriend–Elektra Natchios. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez serving as showrunners, and series creator Drew Goddard acting as consultant.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} {{southern}} landowner, Thơ {{was born in the}} province of Long Xuyên in the Mekong Delta. He began his bureaucratic career in 1930, serving the French colonial authorities as a low-profile provincial chief. During World War II, Thơ rose to become the first secretary of the Resident Superior of Annam, the French governor of the central region of Vietnam. During this time, he crossed <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> Ngô Đình Diệm, a former Interior Minister under the French regime in the 1930s. The French thought that Diệm was working with Imperial Japan and tried to have him arrested, but Thơ tipped off Diệm and the Kempeitai, resulting in their escape.|$|E

5|$|The {{two seasons}} of Carnivàle {{take place in}} the Depression-era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that slowly converge. The first {{involves}} a young man with strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who joins a traveling carnival when it passes near his home in Milfay, Oklahoma. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surrealistic dreams and visions, which set him on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben's own.|$|E
5|$|To-Me Ku-Pa (a name phonetically {{similar to}} that of British comedian Tommy Cooper) is an evil necromancer who {{regularly}} crosses <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> Thrud and is depicted as a bald man wearing a large cloak.

Subsequently, in The Three Tasks of Thrud, To-Me Ku-Pa takes advantage of Thrud's drugged state, following Lymara's failed assassination attempt, to hypnotise him and force him to obtain three items necessary for a spell.|$|E

5|$|In 1271, Niccolò, Maffeo and Marco Polo {{embarked}} on their voyage to fulfil Kublai's request. They sailed to Acre, and then rode on camels to the Persian port of Hormuz. The Polos wanted to sail straight into China, but the ships {{there were not}} seaworthy, so they continued overland through the Silk Road, until reaching Kublai's summer palace in Shangdu, near present-day Zhangjiakou. In one instance during their trip, the Polos joined a caravan of travelling merchants whom they crossed <b>paths</b> <b>with.</b> Unfortunately, the party was soon attacked by bandits, who used {{the cover of a}} sandstorm to ambush them. The Polos managed to fight and escape through a nearby town, but many members of the caravan were killed or enslaved. Three and a half years after leaving Venice, when Marco was about 21 years old, the Polos were welcomed by Kublai into his palace. The exact date of their arrival is unknown, but scholars estimate it to be between 1271 and 1275. On reaching the Yuan court, the Polos presented the sacred oil from Jerusalem and the papal letters to their patron.|$|E
5|$|In 2010's {{video game}} , the Queen (voiced by Kyoko Satomi in Japanese and Susanne Blakeslee in English) {{appears in the}} Dwarf Woodlands world. She {{recruits}} the protagonist Terra to kill Snow White and bring back her heart in return for allowing him to use the Magic Mirror to locate Master Xehanort. Terra, like the huntsman, ultimately does not go through with this, and the Queen, learning of his betrayal, forces the Mirror to consume him, but Terra manages to fight the Mirror off and the Queen reluctantly gives him the information he looks for. She later appears briefly in Ventus's scenario, where she crosses <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> him {{on her way to}} poison Snow White. She drops the poisoned apple, which Ventus returns to her. She notices Ventus's Keyblade and muses that Terra threatened her with a similar weapon. She is then only briefly mentioned in Aqua's storyline, when the Magic Mirror tells Aqua that the Queen is dead and he is no longer under her control.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train in Shadows of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing <b>paths</b> <b>with</b> each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E
