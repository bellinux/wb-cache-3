40|$|Surface tensions, {{critical}} micelle concentrations (CMCs), {{contact angles}} on hydrophobic polyethylene, and foaming characteristics of <b>phosphatidic</b> <b>acids,</b> phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylglycerols were measured {{to determine their}} suitability as substitutes for traditional surfactants. These phospholipids have fatty acid chains of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, a range over which they are soluble at room temperature. Their surface tensions decrease with increasing concentrations until their CMCs are reached, above which their plateau surface tensions are as low as 21 mN/m, indicating excellent surface activities. In general, plateau surface tensions decrease with increasing chain length within each phospholipid type. The classical relationship for In CMC vs. chain length is followed with slopes typical of anionic surfactants for <b>phosphatidic</b> <b>acids</b> and phosphatidylglycerols and resembling zwitterionic surfactants for phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, consistent with the charge on the hydrophilic group. The wetting capabilities of aqueous solutions on polyethylene are good and foam heights and stabilities are high, the latter two properties being comparable to traditional anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate) and nonionic (octylphenol polyethoxylate) surfactants. Some anomalies are observed regarding the effect of chain length on wetting and foaming, {{probably due to the}} depletion effect. Many phospholipids slowly degrade in aqueous solution. We conclude that short-chain phospholipids exhibit excellent surfactant properties and may be useful in many applications...|$|R

When the substrate is stearate-LPA (18 carbon chain), the enzyme has reduced activity. <b>Phosphatidic</b> <b>acids</b> can also be hydrolyzed by lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase, but at a significantly lower rate.

By inhibiting background K+ channels, group I mGluRs mediate slow and long-lasting excitation. The main neuronal representatives of this K+ channel family (K 2 P or KCNK) are TASK and TREK. Here, we show that in cerebellar granule cells and in heterologous expression systems, activation of group I mGluRs inhibits TASK and TREK channels. d-myo-inositol- 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate and phosphatidyl- 4, 5 -inositol-biphosphate depletion are involved in TASK channel inhibition, whereas diacylglycerols and <b>phosphatidic</b> <b>acids</b> directly inhibit TREK channels.

40|$|AbstractThe biphasic {{dependence}} of the chain-melting transition temperature on chainlength, nN, of the headgroup-attached chain of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines and of O-alkyl <b>phosphatidic</b> <b>acids</b> is interpreted {{in terms of a}} different linear {{dependence of}} the transition enthalpy and entropy on nN for long and short chains, respectively. A consistent expression of the form Tt(nN) = TN[|nN−ΔnN| + Δh′(no′N−nN) ]/[|nN−ΔnN| + Δs′(no′N−nN) ], where ΔnN is the critical chainlength at which the packing mode of the headgroup-attached chains changes, is found to apply systematically to the transition temperatures for both sets of lipids, over the range nN = 2 – 18. This thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the headgroup-attached chain is located in an environment that differs for long and short chains. Similar considerations apply also to phosphatidylcholines with a-branched glycerol-attached chains...|$|R

Many efforts have been devoted to optimize matrix choice and deposition technique for positive ion mode analyses. The identification of lipid species desorbed from tissue sections in the negative mode can be significantly improved by using 9 -aminoacridine together with a robust deposition method, yielding a superior signal-to-noise ratio and thus a better contrast for the ion images in comparison to classical matrices such as α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, or 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxyacetophenone. Twenty-eight different lipid species (<b>phosphatidic</b> <b>acids,</b> phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylinositol-phosphates, and sulfatides) were scrutinized on rat brain tissue sections, and systematic MS/MS studies were conducted.

The phase transition and molecular orientation of the phospholipid monolayers were investigated using MDC measurement without mechanical contact between electrodes and the materials. Direct evidence of phase transition from gaseous to the polar ordering phase can be obtained across phospholipid monolayers even though at very low surface pressure. Relaxation process of the phospholipid monolayers was investigated by using the step compression on the MDC signals. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The in vivo pattern of labeling of acyl lipids, either from fatty acids synthesized `endogenously' from radioactive acetate or malonate, or from radioactive fatty acids added `exogenously', indicates the involvement of the following pathways in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerols. Palmitic, stearic, and oleic acid, synthesized in the acyl carrier protein-track, are channeled to the Coenzyme A (CoA) -track and converted to triacylglycerols via the glycerol- 3 -phosphate pathway. Pools of stearoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA are elongated to very long-chain saturated and monounsaturated acyl-CoA, respectively. Most of the very long-chain saturated acyl-CoAs acylate preformed diacylglycerols.
