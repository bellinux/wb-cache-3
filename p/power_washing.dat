50|$|Back {{pressure}} can force an undesirable contaminant to enter potable water piping. Sources of back pressure may be boilers, heat exchanging equipment, <b>power</b> <b>washing</b> equipment, fire sprinklers, or pumps {{in the water}} distribution system. In some cases {{there may be an}} almost continuous risk of overcoming the static water pressure in the piping. To reduce the risk of contamination, a backflow preventer can be fitted. A backflow preventer is also important when potentially toxic chemicals are used, for instance for commercial/industrial descaling of boilers, or when chemical bleaches are used for residential <b>power</b> <b>washing.</b>|$|E
50|$|A jet spray washer cleans by {{flooding}} the parts with warm chemical solution and high chemical concentration {{to clean the}} parts. In the <b>power</b> <b>wash</b> process the parts are blasted with hot chemical solution utilizing the hydraulic impact force of the cleaning solution as the primary cleaning mechanism. A parts washer utilizing the power washer process operates at a very low concentration of cleaning detergent. The lower concentration causes the cleaning solution to last longer before it becomes supersaturated and requires disposal. Additionally, a low concentration of cleaning chemicals allows for easier rinsing of the detergent from the parts thereby minimizing rinse cycle requirements thus saving water and cycle time. A final factor used in the <b>power</b> <b>wash</b> process is an oscillating manifold system that is non-synchronous to {{the rotation of the}} turntable. This system assures that the blasted solution reaches all areas of the parts load that are otherwise blinded by the stationary manifolds used in the jet spray process. All things considered the <b>power</b> <b>wash</b> process is superior to the jet spray process for faster more thorough parts cleaning cycles while minimizing detergent use and waste generation. The <b>power</b> <b>wash</b> process is generally effective for difficult soil removal applications such as burnt hydrocarbons, paint, scale, varnish, carbon, mastic, or rubber. Additional <b>power</b> <b>wash</b> types of applications generally include cleaning diesel engines, aerospace components, aluminum automobile engine parts and rolling mill equipment.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} was again thoroughly remodeled between 2003 and 2004 {{to improve the}} living conditions of the residents and restore the buildings historical facade. At an estimated cost of $9 million, window-mounted air-conditioners were removed and a new centralized air-conditioning unit was installed. Additionally, approximately 450 exterior windows were replaced with replicas of the originals, the exterior was <b>power</b> <b>washed,</b> stucco was repaired, and the {{building was}} repainted to match its original beige color. Upgrades to the automatic fire sprinkler and fire alarm systems were also made.|$|R
50|$|An aqueous-based parts washer is {{much like}} a large dish washer. It uses water and {{detergent}} combined with heat and mechanical energy to provide the cleaning action. There are two main process styles of aqueous parts washers, the jet spray process and the <b>power</b> <b>wash</b> process. In a cabinet parts washer, the parts are placed on a turntable and the door is closed. During the cleaning cycle heated solution is flooded or blasted on the parts as the turntable rotates. Many systems have a wash, rinse and dry cycle. When the cycle is complete the door is opened and the parts removed.|$|R
50|$|Maytag {{used its}} Model 72 {{flat-twin}} engines to <b>power</b> <b>washing</b> machines, {{although they were}} used as proprietary engines for other purposes as well. Maytag began manufacturing the Model 72 engine in 1937 and, after a break in production from May 1942 to June 1945 due to World War II, continued manufacturing them until the 1950s.

50|$|The {{system is}} mixed on site and cold applied, using a {{high-quality}} clear resin binder {{to coat the}} aggregate particles prior to laying. Unlike resin-bonded surfacing, where {{a thin layer of}} resin is applied to the surface and then the aggregate scattered on top (which can then become loose over time and is impermeable), resin and aggregates are thoroughly mixed together prior to laying, ensuring that the aggregate is completely coated and so providing a totally bound surface. As a result, a resin-bound surface is more durable and requires less maintenance - it needs to be swept or <b>power</b> <b>washed</b> at least twice a year, to avoid the buildup of detritus and prevent the growth of moss or algae.|$|R
5000|$|Broward County {{required}} Harbour Towne Marina, {{particularly the}} boat wash-down area within the working boatyard, {{to comply with}} its best management practices or to close down {{that part of the}} business. To reduce the chance of spray and bottom debris reaching the marine waters, the washing pad was relocated 100 feet inland from the travel lift well used for haulouts. When the new pad and filtration system were being built, an unanticipated abandoned foundation had to be removed, and a storm water drain tie-in was built [...] Westrec installed a Nova Chem wastewater filtration system to clean the <b>power</b> <b>wash</b> water sufficiently to meet the county's gray water standards for discharge into the municipal sewer system.|$|R

50|$|Pressure washing or <b>power</b> <b>washing</b> {{is the use}} of {{high-pressure}} {{water spray}} to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, chewing gum and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles and concrete surfaces. The volume of a mechanical pressure washer is expressed in gallons or litres per minute, often designed into the pump and not variable. The pressure, expressed in pounds per square inch, pascals, or bar, is designed into the pump but can be varied by adjusting the unloader valve. Machines that produce pressures from 750 to 30,000 psi (5 to 200 MPa) or more are available.|$|E
50|$|ATP {{rubberized}} unitary surface: ATP {{stands for}} aliphatic thermoplastic monomer. This surface also meets safety and accessibility standards. It {{consists of a}} layer of almost-spherical rubber particles, about one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter, which are chemically bound by a color-fast binder. This surface, in turn, is bonded to a layer of engineered recycled foam (ERF) to absorb shock. The colors are vibrant, {{and they will not}} fade from the sun or <b>power</b> <b>washing.</b> As with PIP, its main disadvantage is high cost. But this limitation is somewhat offset by long life: data from Europe and the U.S. indicate these surfaces have a useful life of at least 10 years.|$|E
50|$|Often on {{the bottom}} of people's to-do list is home {{maintenance}} chores, such as landscaping, window and gutter cleaning, <b>power</b> <b>washing</b> the siding and hard-scape, etc. However, these maintenance chores pay for themselves over time. Often, injury could occur when operating heavy machinery or when climbing on ladders or roofs around your home, so if an individual is not in the proper physical condition to accomplish these chores, then they should consult a professional. Lack of maintenance will cost more due to higher costs associated with repairs or replacements to be made later. It requires discipline and learning aptitude to repair and maintain the home in good condition, but it is a satisfying experience to perform even seemingly minor repairs.|$|E
