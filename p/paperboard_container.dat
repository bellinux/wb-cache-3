50|$|An oyster pail (also {{known as}} a Chinese food box or Chinese takeout container) is a folded, waxed or plastic coated, <b>paperboard</b> <b>container</b> {{originally}} designed to hold oysters. It commonly comes with a handle made of solid wire. Currently, it is often in use by American Chinese cuisine restaurants primarily throughout the United States, to package hot or cold take-out food. It can also sometimes be found in other western countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Germany and England, but is rarely seen in China and other Asian countries with high numbers of ethnic Chinese.|$|E
40|$|During the {{transportation}} {{phase of the}} distribution cycle, packaged consignments are subjected to random dynamic compressive loads that arise from random vibrations generated by the vehicle. The protective packaging system’s ability to withstand these dynamic compressive loads for sufficiently long periods depends on the environmental vibration levels, the nominal stresses {{as well as the}} material’s characteristics. The research tests the hypothesis that cumulative damage in the packaging system under random dynamic compression will result in a change in the overall stiffness and damping characteristics of the system {{as well as in the}} nature of the statistical distribution of the response. These are manifested, respectively, as a shift in the fundamental resonant frequency of the system as well as an increase in the bandwidth of the frequency response function when subjected to random excitation. The paper presents further results from preliminary experiments in which corrugated <b>paperboard</b> <b>container</b> samples were subjected to dynamic compressive loads by means of broad-band random base excitation with a vibration table coupled with a guided dead-weight arrangement. The level of cumulative damage in the sample was estimated by continuously monitoring the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the system as well as by observation of thermal distribution images captured at regular intervals. The thermal images were used to establish the sensitivity of the method and to determine whether it can be useful in detecting incipient catastrophic mechanical failure of the packaging system. Results show that thermographic images are useful in identifying regions of elevated temperature in corrugated paper samples and that these regions of high temperature are reliable indicators of the location and mode of structural failure. Results indicate that there appears to be a strong correlation between a reduction in the overall stiffness of the system and variations in the distribution of temperature across the sample...|$|E

In 1937, Life Magazine became the company’s largest client, with inexpensive coated paper making the magazine stand out. In 1942, the Du Bay hydroelectric plant was completed, providing additional power for company expansion. During World War II, the company developed exceptionally strong plastics from wood byproducts for use in airplanes. The resulting Plastics Division became the Consoweld Corporation in 1954. In 1945, the company acquired the Wisconsin River Paper and Pulp Company in nearby Whiting, which became the Wisconsin River Division. A merger with Ahdawagam Paper Products Company in 1948 expanded the product line to include <b>paperboard</b> <b>containers</b> and cartons. By 1951, the company had completed hydroelectric power sites at Petenwell and Castle Rock, while also building the Mead Inn.|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to your request of May 19, 1999, we have summarized an interim assessment that the Office ofEnvironmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) staff made last year in connection with our assessment of methyl, tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and based on limited data available at that time. While this is still an interim assessment with preliminary calculations, and by no means represents a full risk assessment, it may be suitable for the purposes stated in your request. Tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) {{has been used as}} a gasoline octane booster and may be a food contaminant when used in coatings for metallic items that contact food, or as a coating for <b>paperboard</b> food <b>containers.</b> Human exposure can occur via skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a permissible exposure limit of 100 ppm or 300 mg/m 3 for TBA. TBA is partially metabolized via demethylation in rats to acetone and formaldehyde. TBA is a metabolite of MTBE and exposure may occur through inhalation ofMTBE fumes.

40|$|The {{sorption}} {{of water}} into the <b>paperboard</b> exposes a <b>container</b> to reversible and irreversible deformations under relative humidity variations. In this study, an elasto-plastic material model is used to demonstrate how through-thickness dry solids content gradients can generate permanent in-plane strains in paperboard. The measurements {{presented in this paper}} indicate that in consecutive loading-unloading cycles, the yield stress either remains roughly constant or decreases, and an additional permanent set of strain is obtained even when the maximum tension of repetitions stays constant. Two modified approaches concerning elasto-plastic hardening behavior based on the measurements of this work and the observations of previous studies are introduced. The simulated results exhibit some shared features of the frequently observed shrinkage behavior of paperboard exposed to cyclic relative humidity changes. The results suggest that {{with the use of a}} suitable hardening approach, the plastic deformations arising from through-thickness dry solids content gradients may be considered as a time-independent component for simulations of phenomena such as moisture-accelerated creep and release of dried-in stresses...|$|R
