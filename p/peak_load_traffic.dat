40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} how to deploy base {{stations}} (BSs) in green cellular networks, where BSs can be switched off {{to save energy}} when <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> is low. Unlike previous studies which deploy BSs only based on the <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>load,</b> our BS de-ployment scheme {{is based on the}} whole traffic variation process. In particular, we consider a linear cellular network where BSs are regularly deployed and users are uniformly distributed. Given the traffic variation process and the performance constraint, we obtain the energy optimal BS density by evaluating the network energy consumption in an analytical way. Simulation results show that compared with the BS deployment scheme based on <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>load,</b> the energy consumption of our scheme can be reduced by more than 20 %, and the performance improvement depends on the detailed traffic variation process.

50|$|An {{alternative}} to complex QoS control mechanisms {{is to provide}} high quality communication by generously over-provisioning a network so that capacity is based on <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>load</b> estimates. This approach is simple for networks with predictable <b>peak</b> <b>loads.</b> The performance is reasonable for many applications. This might include demanding applications that can compensate for variations in bandwidth and delay with large receive buffers, which is often possible for example in video streaming. Over-provisioning can be of limited use, however, {{in the face of}} transport protocols (such as TCP) that over time exponentially increase the amount of data placed on the network until all available bandwidth is consumed and packets are dropped. Such greedy protocols tend to increase latency and packet loss for all users.|$|R

We present StrawMAN, a simple mechanism that enables low duty cycle networks to gracefully handle sudden traffic surges. We show that StrawMAN provides a significantly lower power consumption compared to an existing backoff-based mechanism, while being able to scale up to situations with full link-level saturation. As sensor networks get more diverse in both applications and <b>traffic</b> <b>loads,</b> we see StrawMAN as an important addition to the existing set of low-level sensor network mechanisms. ...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal compressed sensing based network traffic prediction method to solve this problem. We first construct a traffic matrix (TM) by using previously measured data and setting the data to be predicted as zeros, corresponding to the volume of <b>traffic</b> <b>load.</b> Then, compressed sensing approach with large scale and small scale temporal constraints as well as spatial constraints is employed to factorize the traffic matrix. By reuniting the results of traffic matrix factorization, we obtain the estimation of predicted traffic data.

40|$|A {{distributed}} multistage software router (MSSR) {{is composed}} by several interconnected software routers running on personal computers (PCs). The MSSR architecture overcomes scalability and performance issues of single software router by providing parallel forwarding paths.

We first introduce an optimal energy saving algorithm defined as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Then, heuristic solutions, named differential algorithms are discussed. While the optimal approach provides higher energy savings, the heuristics avoid the complete MSSR reconfiguration, thus reducing forwarding delays and minimizing service interruption. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic algorithms, that gracefully modifies the internal MSSR configuration, preserve the load proportional energy demand characteristics of the optimal algorithm, with a minimal loss of efficiency, largely compensated by algorithm simplicit...|$|R
40|$|The Airspace Playbook {{is a set}} of {{airspace}} configuration {{scenarios that}} augment the National Severe Weather Playbook rerouting scenarios. Each rerouting “play ” would be accompanied with a candidate dynamic airspace reconfiguration. Typically, this would involve adjustments of sector boundaries in increments of existing sector components. Occasionally, these reconfigurations may combine two or more sectors into larger sectors or form dedicated smaller sectors to handle specific flows. The Airspace Playbook concept was examined using the distribution of the average sector occupancy counts during good-weather days and during weather-impacted days when specific rerouting “plays ” were used. The sector occupancy count metric is used as an initial proxy for sector workload. Accordingly, airspace re-sectorization “plays ” that accompany the rerouting “plays ” are developed. The study shows that applying these dynamic sector boundary adjustments that complement reroutes can produce more evenly distributed occupancy counts in affected sectors and also lower their <b>peak</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>load,</b> an indicator of improved workload distribution.
