Zaproponowane zostaje postpozytywistyczne pojęcie obowiązywania prawa stanowionego, oparte na analizie dotychczasowych podstawowych teorii obowiązywania prawa. Pierwsza część monografii zawiera analizę współczesnej niepozytywistycznej koncepcji prawa, opracowanej przez Ralfa Dreiera i Roberta Alexy'ego, w celu znalezienia odpowiedzi na pytanie o to, czy prawnicze pojęcie obowiązywania prawa winno zawierać kryteria lub standardy moralne.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} legal questions in the pharmaceutical industry today concerns settlements of patent infringement suits between branded and generic drug companies. These settlements, which are by-products of the Hatch-Waxman Act, involve payments from the branded manufacturer to the generic drug company in exchange for the generic company staying off the market for a period of time. For nearly a decade, courts considering this issue applied a scope of the patent test to determine the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> these settlements. Over time, increasing deference was given to a <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> patent <b>validity,</b> and almost all challenged settlements were deemed valid. In June 2012, the Third Circuit applied a quick look rule of reason test and found the settlement in question invalid. The Third Circuit’s departure from the prevailing approach taken by its sister circuits marked a shift towards stricter scrutiny and created a circuit split. After almost a decade of effort by the Federal Trade Commission to get this issue before the Supreme Court, certiorari was granted to a patent settlement case out of the Eleventh Circuit, Actavis. It was the Third Circuit’s decision in favor of the FTC’s position that clinched the effort this time. Following Actavis, reverse-payment settlements are not categorically immune from the antitrust laws even when within the scope of the patent. Lower courts must now weigh the settlement’s possible pro-competitive benefits against its potential anticompetitive effects. As a result, the doors have been reopened for pharmaceutical competition...|$|R

5000|$|Some jurisdictions {{including}} Bermuda, South Africa, China (in {{the case}} of Utility Models), Germany (in {{the case of}} Gebrauchsmusters (Utility Model)) and by option Spain, go one step further, in that an application is passed to issue and publication as an enforceable patent in short order, with no substantive examination. Questions of novelty and non-obviousness/inventive step are not reviewed until litigation may arise concerning the issues. Obviously, such a patent does not carry the same <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> as a patent that has been fully examined. Such systems are known as [...] "invention registration" [...] regimes, and {{have the benefit of}} reduced costs, because applicants may postpone or completely forego the expensive process of examination for inventions that are of small or speculative value in the applicant's field of endeavor. Another advantage is that a patent is granted relatively fast. A patent in South Africa, for example, is granted approximately 8 months after the date of filing, whereas in examining countries, it is highly unusual for a patent to be granted in less than 3 years. [...] At the same time, simply filing an application usually preserves the applicant's right to subsequently seek full examination and protection for his invention, if a competitor or a pirate is later discovered to infringe the invention.|$|E
5000|$|In Exxon, the Court {{stressed}} that the Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations. A nondiscriminatory regulation serving substantial state purpose is not invalid simply because it causes some business to shift from a predominantly out-of-state industry to a predominantly in-state industry. Only if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State’s legitimate purpose does such a regulation violate the commerce clause. When a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce, the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce. In Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959), the United States Supreme Court stated: 'These safety measures carry a strong <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> when challenged in court.
