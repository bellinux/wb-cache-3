40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Premix</b> insulin is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used insulin preparation in India. The first Indian <b>premix</b> guidelines were developed in 2009 and thereafter were updated in 2013. There is a need to revisit the Indian <b>premix</b> insulin guidelines, in view of emerging evidence and introduction of newer co-formulations. OBJECTIVE: The present consensus has been developed to evaluate available <b>premix</b> formulations, examine existing evidence related to <b>premix</b> formulations, and evolve consensus statement of recommendations on the topic. METHODS: A meeting of experts from across India was conducted at Chennai in July 2016. The expert committee evaluated each <b>premix</b> insulin regimen with reference to 1) Current recommendations by various guidelines, 2) Approved pack inserts and 3) Published scientific literature. The information was debated and discussed within the expert group committee, to arrive at seven consensus-based recommendations for initiation and intensification with <b>premix</b> insulin. RESULTS: Recommendations based on consensus on initiation and intensification of <b>premix</b> insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) management were developed for the following situations. 1) Initiation of <b>premix</b> insulin co-formulation at diagnosis, 2) Initiation of once daily (OD) <b>premix</b> insulin/co-formulation, 3) Initiation of twice daily (BID) <b>premix</b> insulin/co-formulation 4) Intensification with BID and thrice daily (TID) <b>premix</b> insulin/co-formulation. Three recommendations pertained to the use of <b>premix</b> insulin in other forms of diabetes, or in specific situations: 5) Use of <b>premix</b> insulin in gestational diabetes mellitus 6) Use of <b>premix</b> insulin in type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T 1 DM) 7) <b>Premix</b> insulin use during Ramadan. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of high carbohydrate consumption in India, or in patients with predominant post prandial hyperglycemia, <b>premix</b> insulin/co-formulation can offer effective and convenient glycemic control.

There is relatively few data on the effects of their nutritive value in pigs, so this research was carried out with objective to verify the effects of several different imported <b>premixes</b> and those produced according to domestic concept, in nutrition of sows, suckling piglets and weaned piglets. Research was performed on private farm in the vicinity of Å abac in Serbia. Obtained results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in losses of body masses and food consumption in sows during lactation period. Nutrition of suckling piglets using mixture which contained adequate <b>premix</b> of domestic production improved the growth rate by 7. 6 %. Cost of food when domestic <b>premixes</b> were used in nutrition of sows and piglets was by 5. 3 % lower, and value of realized piglets by approx. 26. 0 % more favourable when domestic <b>premixes</b> were used in nutrition of sows and suckling piglets. Piglets in rearing were fed mixtures containing imported <b>premixes</b> showed no significantly important effect on gain, but had poorer feed conversion by 6. 2 % compared to animals fed diets containing domestic <b>premix.</b> Domestic <b>premix</b> in mixtures reduced the cost of mixtures by 3. 4 % and reduced the cost of gain of piglets in rearing by 9. 9 % compared to nutrition with diets containing imported <b>premixes.</b> In general, obtained results shoed that use of both types of compared <b>premixes</b> can be recommended, but it is more economically efficient to use domestic <b>premixes</b> in nutrition of sows and piglets.
