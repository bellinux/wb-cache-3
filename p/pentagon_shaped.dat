5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a <b>pentagon</b> <b>shaped</b> pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E
5|$|The outer bailey is {{the southernmost}} {{feature of the}} castle; it is <b>pentagon</b> <b>shaped</b> and there are five towers spaced along the wall, three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an {{irregular}} polygon; like the outer bailey, {{the wall of the}} middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the towers in the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Château Gaillard {{was one of the first}} castles in Europe to use machicolations—stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers in European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8thcentury.|$|E

40|$|Light {{is a kind}} {{of medium}} that makes objects visible without being visible itself in empty space. The {{combination}} of spatial and spectral characteristics of the light source, material reflectance and shape of an object determine its appearance, and as such the appearance of an object is the main cue for perception of its lighting. In the current study we tested whether types of shapes and scene layout influence lighting perception. In real scenes composed of several objects we tested observers' perception of lighting direction with a real light probe – using a novel experimental setup to optically mix the probe object into a real scene by a semi-transparent mirror. Participants (N= 15) had to adjust the illumination direction on the probe such that it fitted the scene. We tested nine lighting directions for four different scenes, existing of five objects: a cylinder, star shape, and cross shape plus combinations of bowling pin(s) and <b>pentagon</b> <b>shape(s).</b> When using one bowling pin and one <b>pentagon</b> <b>shape,</b> the result showed that the light direction estimation was systematically contracted near the pentagon body, but not near the bowling pin. When horizontally mirroring this scene, also the light direction estimation was mirrored. Replacing the bowling pin with another pentagon body resulted in systematic contractions of the light direction slants near both pentagon bodies. Replacing the pentagon bodies with two bowling pins finally resulted in close to veridical light direction settings. The globally convex smoothly curved bowling pins, in comparison with the facetted <b>pentagon</b> <b>shapes,</b> improved observers' setting of light direction. Mirror arrangements of objects in the scene improved the estimation of the tilt direction. These very systematic effects suggest that human perception of the global 2 ̆ 2 light flow 2 ̆ 2 in a scene might be systematically deformed depending on scene layout and content...|$|R

40|$|Research {{demonstrates}} that within-category visual variability facilitates noun learning; however, {{the effect of}} visual variability on verb learning is unknown. We habituated 24 -month-old children to a novel verb paired with an animated star-shaped actor. Across multiple trials, children saw either a single action from an action category (identical actions condition, for example, travelling while repeatedly changing into a circle shape) or multiple actions from that action category (variable actions condition, for example, travelling while changing into a circle shape, then a square shape, then a triangle shape). Four test trials followed habituation. One paired the habituated verb with a new action from the habituated category (e. g., ‘dacking’ + <b>pentagon</b> <b>shape)</b> and one with a completely novel action (e. g., ‘dacking’ + leg movement). The others paired a new verb with a new same-category action (e. g., ‘keefing’ + <b>pentagon</b> <b>shape),</b> or a completely novel category action (e. g., ‘keefing’ + leg movement). Although all children discriminated novel verb/action pairs, children in the identical actions condition discriminated trials that included the completely novel verb, while children in the variable actions condition discriminated the out-of-category action. These data suggest that – as in noun learning – visual variability affects verb learning and children's ability to form action categories...|$|R

Captain Fisby, a young army officer, is transferred to a tiny Okinawa island town called Tobiki by his commanding officer, Colonel Purdy. Fisby is tasked with the job of implementing [...] "Plan B". The plan calls for teaching the natives all things American and the first step for Capt. Fisby {{is to establish a}} democratically elected mayor, chief of agriculture, chief of police, and president of the Ladies League for Democratic Action. Plan [...] "B" [...] also calls for the building of a schoolhouse (<b>Pentagon</b> <b>shaped),</b> democracy lessons, and establishing capitalism through means left up to the good captain's judgment. A local Tobiki native, Sakini by name, is assigned to act as Fisby's interpreter. Sakini, a Puck-like character, attempts to acquaint Fisby with the local customs as well as guide the audiences through the play, providing both historical and cultural framework through his asides and monologues. After receiving many gifts from the villagers, including a geisha named Lotus Blossom, Fisby tries to find local products on which to build his capitalist endeavor. He is discouraged when the villagers can not find a market for their handmade products, items like geta (wooden sandals), lacquered bowls, cricket cages, and casas (straw hats). He is also frustrated when the newly elected democratic government votes to build a teahouse (ochaya) for Lotus Blossom with the building supplies designated for his Pentagon-shaped school. Through the villagers, Captain Fisby starts to see the beauty of preserving their culture and a slower way of life.
