25|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} {{studies have found}} lateralization of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of lateralization have been proposed {{and some of those}} specific to emotions. <b>Please</b> <b>keep</b> in mind that most of the information in this article is theoretical and scientists are still trying to understand emotion and emotional lateralization. Also, some of the evidence is contradictory. Many brain regions are interconnected and the input and output of any given region may come from and go to many different regions.|$|E
500|$|In {{his efforts}} {{to carry out his}} orders and {{maintain}} discipline, Stone drew the attention and wrath of his home state's governor, John A. Andrew, and Charles Sumner, the senior U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, both powerful and influential Radical Republican politicians. In late September Stone issued general orders that required his men [...] "not to incite and encourage insubordination among the coloured servants in the neighbourhood." [...] When two runaway slaves came into their lines, one of his regiments, the 20th Massachusetts Infantry, promptly caught them and returned them to their owner. This was done in compliance with Stone's orders as well as both Federal and Maryland law. However, many of the 20th Massachusetts were abolitionists, disagreed with Stone's insistence on returning runaways back into slavery, and wrote both their families and their representatives about the incident. Governor Andrew strongly reprimanded the colonel of the regiment, who gave the letter to Stone. After reading it Stone wrote back, its contents summarized by military historian Bruce Catton as follows: [...] "this regiment was in United States service now and the governor had no business meddling with discipline, the young lieutenant and the colonel had properly done what they were told to do and were not subject to reprimand from any governor, and would the governor in future <b>please</b> <b>keep</b> his hand off?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although more {{sophisticated}} and robust methods have been proposed, {{the most frequently used}} graphical methods of identifying power-law probability distributions [...] using random samples are Pareto quantile-quantile plots (or Pareto Q-Q plots), [...] mean residual life plots and log–log plots. Another, more robust graphical method uses bundles of residual quantile functions. (<b>Please</b> <b>keep</b> in mind that power-law distributions are also called Pareto-type distributions.) It is assumed here that a random sample is obtained from a probability distribution, and that we want to know if the tail of the distribution follows a power law (in other words, we want to know if the distribution has a [...] "Pareto tail"). Here, the random sample is called [...] "the data".|$|E

2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? <b>Please</b> <b>keep</b> secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?'

2500|$|Following the Boston Globe's public {{exposure}} of the cover up by Cardinal Law (and his predecessor Humberto Cardinal Medeiros) of scores of pedophile priests in the Boston Archdiocese, Law had little option but to submit his resignation as Archbishop of Boston to the Vatican, which Pope John Paul II accepted on December 13, 2002.

[...] A letter urging Law's resignation had been signed by 58 priests, mostly diocesan priests who had sworn obedience to Law as their direct superior; the editorial said that this letter was [...] "surely one of the precipitating events in his departure".
