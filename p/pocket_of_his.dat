5|$|Approximately {{forty minutes}} after his collapse, a police {{helicopter}} took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, {{where he was}} pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Dumas refused to sign a burial certificate and a poisons expert from Marseille was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. Two empty tubes of amphetamines and a half-full tube {{were found in the}} rear <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team was called in for questioning and their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs– who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson– locked themselves in their room, got drunk and did not come out.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} Izvestia {{reported on}} 26 February 2001 that another note, written by Lt. Cmdr. Rashid Aryapov, had been recovered {{during the initial}} rescue operation. Aryapov held a senior position in the sixth compartment. The note was written on the page of a detective novel and wrapped in plastic. It {{was found in a}} <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clothing after his body was recovered.|$|E
25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> topcoat. Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, {{the object is}} found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal fitting that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E

25|$|As Langdon regains consciousness, {{he finds}} himself in a {{hospital}} located on an island. He is given the video camera which he placed in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tweed jacket. He is shocked when he hears the footage and becomes desperate {{to head back to}} the Vatican. The video shows the camerlengo branding himself with the Illuminati diamond and confessing that he himself is Janus, and who set in motion the night's chain of events in order to sabotage the Vatican. He also confesses that he killed the Pope with an overdose of heparin, a powerful anticoagulant because the Pope revealed he had fathered a child.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with his gloved hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> glove, with his bare hand {{in order to secure}} it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
500|$|After some time, Jenner {{joined the}} Royal Navy, but deserted in New York City, United States. He soon joined the United States Navy. Jenner's {{daughter}} stated {{in an interview}} after his death that {{he learned how to}} gamble during this time and he soon developed the impulse control disorder of problem gambling. He became particularly attached to the game craps, which was popular in the United States at the time. He started to keep a rabbit's foot in the left upper <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt, and would rub it with his left hand while he rolled the dice with his right. His shipmates therefore began calling him [...] "Bones", a nickname that he retained {{for the rest of his}} navy career.|$|E

500|$|A three-page {{letter was}} found in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket. The letter was never officially made public, but was leaked in November 1990 to Francine Pelletier, and {{published}} in the newspaper La Presse. In his suicide letter, Lépine claimed political motives, blaming feminists for ruining his life. He considered himself rational and expressed admiration for Denis Lortie, who had mounted an attack on the Quebec National Assembly in 1984 for political reasons, killing three Quebec government employees. The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism. [...] Another letter, written to a friend, promised the explanation to the massacre lay by following clues left in Lépine's apartment. The hunt led only to a suitcase of computer games and hardware.|$|E
500|$|At Stonehenge, the Doctor, Amy, and River find {{a passage}} to an {{underground}} area. Inside, {{they find the}} Pandorica, a giant metal box outfitted with every type of lock imaginable. While examining the Pandorica, Amy confronts the Doctor about an engagement ring she had previously found in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket and feels a strong emotional attachment to; he says that it belonged to a [...] "friend", and that nothing is ever truly forgotten. The Pandorica is transmitting a signal amplified by Stonehenge's rocks across the universe, and River warns the Doctor that the signal is drawing [...] "everything that ever hated [...] " [...] to Earth that night. The Doctor is aided by a volunteer group of Roman legionaries; the centurion in charge of them is revealed to be Amy's fiancé, Rory. Neither Rory nor the Doctor can explain Rory's presence, as he was consumed by {{a crack in the}} universe during the events of [...] "Cold Blood" [...] and erased from existence. When Amy comes around after being knocked out by a damaged Cyberman, she does not remember Rory, which upsets him greatly. The Doctor assures Rory that Amy will remember in time, and hands him the engagement ring.|$|E
500|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back {{to a group of}} chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished", but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, [...] "If Tom wants to go on, he goes". Noticing his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were [...] "On, on, on." [...] Hall estimated Simpson rode a further [...] before he began to wobble, and was held upright by spectators; he was unconscious, with his hands locked on the handlebars. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, before Dumas arrived with an oxygen mask. Approximately forty minutes after his collapse, a police helicopter took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Two empty tubes and a half-full one of amphetamines, one of which was labelled [...] "Tonedron", were found in the rear <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jersey. The official cause of death was [...] "heart failure caused by exhaustion." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{lead story}} with the Cape Times {{published}} in 1996 she spoke about Terre'Blanche; [...] "He {{is a political}} Tyrannosaurus Rex ... a henpecked husband who has to remove his boots before he is allowed to enter his wife's pristine kitchen; a narcissist who carries a can of Fiesta hairspray in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> safari suit ...|$|E

From beneath a false patch set into the left <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt Bunker took a bit of red cloth. Solemnly he gave Ausmus part of it and put the rest back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wishing {{for a quiet}} holiday {{free from}} crime, Poirot goes to Rhodes during the low season in October where there {{are but a few}} guests. Aside from the young Pamela Lyall and Sarah Blake there is Valentine Chantry, a {{consciously}} beautiful woman who seems to swoon under the attentions of Douglas Gold. This is done at the expense of his own wife, Marjorie, a mildly attractive woman, and Valentine's husband Tony Chantry. This is the [...] "triangle" [...] that everyone observes, and it gets rather absurd with the two men vying for Valentine's favour. She seems to delight in the attention. Marjorie Gold soon wins the sympathy of many of the guests of the hotel as her husband is frequently in the company of Valentine, she confesses her own doubts about Valentine to Poirot. Poirot, however, warns her to flee the island if she values her life. The event comes to a head one evening, beginning when Gold and Chantry have a loud argument. Valentine and Marjorie return from a drive, and the former is poisoned by the cocktail her husband gives her. Gold is immediately suspected, as the strophanthin that kills Valentine is found in the <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dinner jacket. Poirot notices otherwise, seeing that Chantry puts it in Gold's pocket just as everyone's attention is on his dying wife. Poirot gives this information to the police, and points out to Pamela Lyall that she was focusing on the wrong triangle. The real triangle was between Douglas, Marjorie and Chantry. Chantry and Marjorie were in love, but they could not get married as Douglas, a Catholic, would not consent to divorce. For this reason, Chantry and Marjorie decided to kill Valentine and ensure that Douglas was blamed for the murder. Also, Poirot's warning to Marjorie Gold was not because he feared she was a victim at risk of being murdered, but the opposite. He was warning her she would be caught, tried, and convicted as one of the culprits, and be hanged for murder.|$|E
