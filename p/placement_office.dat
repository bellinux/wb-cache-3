50|$|Early Third Republic France {{was a time}} of {{dramatic}} social and economic change. With the tremendous growth of industrial capitalism in the last twenty years of the 19th century and the continued migration of workers to cities, the traditional system of meeting places for those seeking work was overtaxed. Skilled and unskilled trades alike had gradually developed systems to match those seeking work with employers, but the legalisation of trades unions in 1884, helped formalise these structures. Employers, too, were creating private labour <b>placement</b> <b>offices.</b>|$|R

30|$|This {{paper has}} three purposes. First, {{empirical}} evaluations of job creation have rarely {{been conducted in}} Japan. The {{results show that the}} program increases the number of workers, especially workers commuting to the municipalities conducting the programs, and the program induces a net population inflow. Furthermore, the programs remarkably affect the agricultural sector and the wholesale, retail trade, and service sector, in which most municipalities conduct trial businesses or seminars via these programs. Intuitively, the joining together of the local firms, municipal government, members conducting this program, job <b>placement</b> <b>offices,</b> and job seekers, all owing to the launch of this program, is a key factor in increasing employment.|$|R

40|$|Many {{university}} <b>placement</b> <b>offices</b> {{employ a}} bidding system to allocate on-campus recruiter interview slots to students. Typically, {{a student is}} given (say) 700 points each week to bid on the firms visiting that week. Interview slots for each firm are assigned beginning with the highest bidder until all slots are filled. This paper describes the mathematical modeling behind a decision support system for helping students to bid in such a system. It has three components. The first component elicits a student's utilities of getting {{an interview with the}} various firms. The second component estimates the probability of getting an interview with a particular firm for a given bid amount. The final component considers our bidding problem as the maximization of a student's expected utility, which can be formulated as a nonlinear integer programming (IP) problem. It is shown that this IP problem can be transformed into a number of nonlinear programming problems without integer requirements, which can then be solved very rapidly to give on-line bidding recommendations to a large number of students. decision support system, bidding, mixed integer programming...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study provides insight about how employers and universities {{can and should}} partner, to achieving readiness of recent graduates to fill business analytics (BA) jobs. A phenomenological approach was used to interview 4 BA groups: business leaders, faculty, recent graduates, and supervisors of recent graduates. Twenty-five individuals yielded data via semi-structured interviews about their lived experiences. Findings show that while BA graduates {{are expected to be}} leaders in future analytics, most are initially lacking in real-world preparation, use obsolete and irrelevant software training, and lack beneficial interdisciplinary training. The rapidly changing business world is leaving an unfilled need for T-Shaped graduates. T-shaped graduates possess broad expertise coupled with in-depth discipline knowledge. Responsibility for training graduates is mistakenly seen as belonging to universities. But businesses are in an essential training role through internships, mentoring, and on-the-job training. Interviewee data suggests ways to improve: partnerships between universities, <b>placement</b> <b>offices</b> and businesses; better internship and mentoring programs; including students in curriculum planning; introducing and enhancing T-shaped thinking. These suggested improvements can help corporations and universities to become better partners in educating BA students. ...|$|R
