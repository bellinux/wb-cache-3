5000|$|In 1892, {{the brand}} Poggenpohl was {{established}} as a white lacquer furniture company founded by Freidemir Poggenpohl. Poggenpohl was successful with introducing ergonomic work-top heights, and storage innovations aimed at improving the kitchen. [...] In 1923, Poggenpohl introduced a free-standing commodious cupboard called The Ideal which was also adopted by American cabinet manufacturer Kitchen Maid. The Poggenpohl cupboard was the forerunner of The Fitted Kitchen in the [...] "Era of the Commodious Cupboard". The company continued to create new products and techniques; in 1928, it introduced the reform kitchen, a significant innovation in the industry, and in 1930, it created the 'ten-layer <b>polished</b> <b>lacquer</b> technique'.|$|R

50|$|Probber {{established}} Harvey Probber, Inc., in 1945 and in {{the middle}} years of the twentieth century, Harvey Probber became one of America’s leading designers.Though he considered himself a modern designer, his approach to modernity favored exotic woods, highly <b>polished</b> <b>lacquer,</b> hand-rubbed finishes and opulent upholstery fabrics—materials largely abandoned by more radical, Bauhaus-influenced designers. Probber’s designs, like those of Edward Wormley, Tommi Parzinger, were sought after by customers who wanted modern furniture with elegance. In 1947, when showroom space wasn’t available in Chicago’s Merchandise Mart, he took his line to Grand Rapids, then the center of the furniture manufacturing industry. In 1948, seeing the potential in the interior design market he opened a showroom at 136 Fifth Avenue, catering exclusively to designers.In little over a decade, Harvey Probber, Inc. became one of the country’s leading contemporary furniture firms. His elastic sling chair and Nuclear upholstered groups were chosen for MoMA’s Good Design exhibition in 1951, and he won several prestigious Roscoe industry awards.|$|R

50|$|Other {{work in the}} USCGS took {{precedence}} over construction of the new machine, {{and a reduction in}} staff levels precluded all work on the new machine for three years. As a result, Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 was not functional until 1910. It was first applied to predicting values for the 1912 and 1913 tide tables. Then the machine was disassembled, <b>polished,</b> plated, <b>lacquered,</b> and reassembled in time to provide predictions for the 1914 tide tables. Comparisons of the accuracy of the mechanical predictions of tides compared to hand calculations for two challenging locations demonstrated errors in heights of 0.72 in or less.|$|R
5000|$|Tana (棚), {{literally}} [...] "shelf/shelves," [...] is {{a generic}} term for {{various types of}} shelving used in the tea ceremonies and placed on the host's mat. Each type of tana has its own name. The three basic categories are built-in tana (shitsukedana), suspended tana (tsuridana), and portable shelves (okidana). The latter, okidana, are basically categorized as either large shelf units (ōdana) or small shelf units (kodana). Tana are made of various types of wood, the most formal style finished in highly <b>polished</b> black <b>lacquer.</b> Some tana include drawers or shelves enclosed by sliding doors. Tea utensils may be placed onto/into the tana {{before the start of}} a ceremony and/or at the end. Tana are used only tea rooms of 4.5 tatami mats or larger.|$|R
50|$|The M4 bayonet was {{introduced}} in 1944 for use with the M1 carbine. It {{was built on the}} M3 fighting knife. Like the M3 fighting knife it was designed for rapid production using a minimum of strategic metals and machine processes, it used a relatively narrow 6.75-inch bayonet-style spear-point blade with a sharpened 3.5-inch secondary edge. The blade was made of carbon steel, and was either blued or parkerized. Production of the grooved leather handle was later simplified by forming the grip of stacked leather washers that were shaped by turning on a lathe, then <b>polished</b> and <b>lacquered.</b> The steel crossguard had an bayonet muzzle ring and the bayonet fastener is on the pommel. Later models used a black molded plastic handle. The basic design would be used for the later M5, M6 and M7 bayonets.|$|R
50|$|Towel dryers can be {{made from}} {{different}} metals such as steel, stainless steel, or aluminum. In some types brass or copper is used. The finish can be in chrome plating, <b>polished</b> steel or <b>lacquer.</b> Dryers can be heated electrically (heating cartridge or heating cable) or by circulating hot water (connected to the central heating). Often a combination of the methods is used. In these cases the dryer is heated by hot water in winter time and by electricity in the summer. A towel dryer, with high output, can also serve as a radiator in a small bathroom.|$|R

Freed from financial constraints, he made more and larger pieces, {{and for the first}} time was able to afford to make whole sculptures in stainless steel. He also began his practice of making sculptures in series, the first of which were the Agricolas of 1951-59. He steadily gained recognition, lecturing at universities and participating in symposia. He separated from Dehner in 1950, with divorce in 1952. During his time as a visiting artist at Indiana University, Bloomington, in 1955 and 1956, Smith produced the Forgings, a series of eleven industrially forged steel sculptures.

DBS produces tough DB films with more tensile strength. Drug diffusion through the free films followed zero order kinetics. The films plasticized with PEG 400 showed higher permeability for DH compared with other films. The order of decrease of permeability of plasticized films with plasticizers was PEG 400 > PG > DBP > DBS.

50|$|The organ, {{considered}} the finest in the Channel Islands, {{was built in}} 1926 by Jardine and Co. of Manchester, and restored and enlarged in 1962 by the John Compton Organ Co. A small ‘Positive’ section was added in 1972 by Messrs. William Hill and Son, and Norman and Beard Ltd. The organ was completely renovated in 1985. In early 2008 it was dismantled {{as part of the}} renovation of the church, and temporarily replaced by a purpose built electronic organ.The renovation and rebuilding of the organ was entrusted to The Village Workshop Company. Because the organ chamber was identified as an ancient mortuary chapel of historic importance during the renovation, the organ was reinstated to the South Gallery in late 2013, which is thought to have been its original home, with a small choir and positive section {{on the north side of}} the Chancel. With three manuals, in total, the organ has 2,063 pipes.The specification includes a trompette-en-chamade department, which is housed in the west gallery of the church. The trompette-en-chamade is a fanfare trumpet stop, which not only has a stunning visual impact but also supplies a highly effective solo stop which speaks with amazing clarity and prominence. The splendid new casework and display pipes feature stained and polished wood to enhance the woodwork within the church, whilst the display pipes and the pipes of the trompette-en-chamade have been created by Kevin Rutterford of the Village Workshop in <b>polished</b> zinc, and <b>lacquered</b> to prevent tarnishing and staining. To ensure the depth and richness of tone within the confines of the gallery, the 32’ stops use state of the art digital technology, and the console is now situated on a mobile platform, giving flexibility and providing a great visual spectacle for concerts and recitals. The latest transmission and piston systems give thirty departmental and thirty general memory levels.The inaugural recital after the renovation was complete, was given by Ian Tracey from Liverpool Cathedral, on 26 September 2014.|$|R
40|$|It seems {{particularly}} appropriate that the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln presents the exhibition Juan Hamilton: Selected Works 1972 - 1991. It {{is apparent that}} Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s encounter with the reductive form of Princess X, 1916 by the 20 th Century master sculptor, Constantin Brancusi, {{had a profound impact}} and influence on his own mature aesthetic. The Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, designed by Philip Johnson, has had on permanent display in the Great Hall this sculpture since its opening to the public in 1963. Though Juan Hamilton was cognizant (prior to his collegiate studies at Hastings College in Nebraska) of Brancusi 2 ̆ 7 s sculpture, it seems that the biomorphic and columnar fluidity of Princess X had a lasting influence on his own sculptural vocabulary. It was also here on the remote plains of the Nebraska prairie that Hamilton found the solitude to pursue the medium of ceramics [...] the vessel that became the central metaphor for his sculpture. Juan Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s new work reveals changes in terms of formal vocabulary and technical sophistication that substantially extend his range as an artist. Because Hamilton is dedicated to quality and to the continuity of tradition, these changes have been evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Newness in his case is never novelty, but a gradual increase of skill and vision. Thus the current matte black bronze sculptures executed {{during the past two years}} differ from the preceeding sleek, <b>polished</b> bronzes and <b>lacquered</b> bronzes in a number of ways that are significant they are larger, more distinctively sculptural in their conscious use of all 360 degrees of changing viewpoints, each one different as the viewer moves around Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s subtle sloping shapes. Perhaps most importantly, the new works absorb rather than reflect light. This drawing away from light, as opposed to playing with a seductive flickering, enhances our sense of them as looming, mysterious presences, which display a new sense of gravity, a deliberate heaviness that is more illusion than reality. That Hamilton began his artistic career as a ceramist may explain why his forms, although they are monolithic, still communicate the personal touch of the artist 2 ̆ 7 s hand [...] the feeling of modeling rather than of cutting out or of slicing a form from a pre-existing block that we normally associate with the monolith. Moreover, there are no hard edges in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s art: plane meets plane softly, gently - another indication of his decisive rejection of the machine aesthetic that has more characterized recent modem art. Cenainly, simple, reductive forms are within the mainstream of modernist sculpture. However, they are much closer to the spiritual aesthetic that originally inspired Brancusi than they are to the materialist empiricism of minimal ar...|$|R
