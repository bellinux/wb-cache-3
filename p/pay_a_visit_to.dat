5|$|In March 1944, Arnold {{asked for}} Kenney to return Wilson {{to work on}} his own staff. Wilson took the long way back, visiting the other war theatres in India, China, the Middle East, Italy and England. Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Barney Giles anxious for Wilson's return so Giles could <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the war theatres. Wilson {{therefore}} found himself acting chief of staff. On Giles' return, Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff, Organization, Commitments and Requirements. In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer. He was promoted to major general on 17 March 1945.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may {{have gone back to}} the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E

During this period he continued to visit the Portuguese royal court also. Later, according to the Chronica, in a not unusual display of mercy, Alfonso invited the disgraced count to court and regaled him with gifts of gold and silver as he customarily did his regular courtiers, thus reconciling him to himself. In 1147 Rodrigo joined the royal army that marched to re-conquer Almería from the Muslims, but {{like many of the}} Galicians initially present he left in midsummer after taking part in the Siege of Oreja (at least until 25 July).|$|E
25|$|In 1939, {{under the}} terms of Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's Secret protocol, Western Volhynia was annexed into the Ukrainian SSR. Part of the local {{population}} viewed it, at least initially, as a form of liberation from Polish rule. However the Soviet governments' anti-religious stance became the new source of oppression, although the Ukrainian form of this persecution was somewhat less rigid than in that of the Russian lands in the early 1920s. The Lavra self-transferred to the Moscow Patriarchy, during this time thousands of Orthodox pilgrims, from all over the USSR, at their own risk, took the chance to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> the cloister that they feared would share the fate that of all others in the USSR. It was not to be, although the Lavra was thoroughly searched, the monastic livestock, orphanage and other communal services which it provided to the local community were promptly confiscated, the sheer numbers of visitors prevented the Soviets taking immediate action against a place that once again had become a refuge for Orthodoxy.|$|E

25|$|By the 1970s, the Dubois Brothers, in {{the west}} end, had become the most {{prevalent}} loan sharks using the bars they had taken as their offices in order to run their loan sharking business. In order for a borrower to obtain a loan they had to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> one of the Dubois Brothers offices or businesses where if the loan were approved they would either receive the money directly or delivered later to them. It was expected of the borrower to make their payments in cash to the same location that they borrowed from and {{the interest of the}} loan was substantial usually sitting around 30%. One of their associates who turned informant, Dugenais, told police that majority of the Dubois Brothers loan shark customers were taxi drivers who would take the money to go to the night clubs and racetrack. One of the clients had claimed that because he could not afford to pay his $50 debt, which he ran up playing billiards, to Adrien Dubois {{he had no choice but}} to agree to be forced into the drug trade as a drug pusher claiming that they were greedy and took more profit than they should have.|$|E
25|$|In the 1997–1998 anime series Street Fighter II V, Chun-Li is {{introduced}} as the fifteen-year-old daughter of Inspector Dorai, a Hong Kong police chief {{who has also}} schooled her in the martial arts. While attempting to bring down a drug smuggling operation in the country, he works with Interpol to investigate a mysterious organization known as Shadowlaw. Chun-Li serves as the tour guide for Ryu and Ken when they <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> work on their training; Ken is smitten with her and later buys her lavish gifts, including an engagement ring. Despite being underage, they enter a club in a dangerous part of town that hosts an underground fighting ring so Ryu and Ken can prove themselves as street fighters. After Ryu soundly defeats several opponents, the trio are marked for death by the ringleader as a result, and while on the run they encounter and battle various street gangs before being rescued by Chun-Li's father. Traveling with Ryu and Ken to Spain, Chun-Li is stalked by an obsessive Vega, who presents her with a severed bull's ear, intercepts her outside her hotel, sneaks into her room to observe her in her sleep, then invites her to a masquerade ball that is actually a setup to get Ken to fight him in a cage match. The whole time, Chun-Li is {{under the influence of}} Vega's love potion, but it wears off when Vega is defeated. Bison then accosts Chun-Li and she realizes that he is the leader of Shadowlaw, who, unbeknownst to her, had also hired Cammy to garrote Chun-Li's father, an attack he barely survives. Chun-Li plays her largest role in the five-part finale, when she and Ryu are kidnapped and brainwashed by Bison via microchips embedded in their foreheads, and like in the 1994 film, she acquires her signature outfit (albeit grayish-blue with white accents and slightly modified) while Bison's captive. The chip puts her into an overly aggressive state, which she displays by snapping an opponent's neck in combat, and she later manages to overpower Guile in battle before Ryu and Ken, during their victorious final fight against Bison, succeed in destroying the equipment triggering the chips (in addition to reducing the Shadowlaw base to ruins), returning Chun-Li to normal.|$|E
