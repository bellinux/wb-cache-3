5|$|The {{passing of}} the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider <b>potential</b> <b>effects</b> on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and Grandeur of the Seas had {{to alter}} their courses due to the {{presence}} of Bonnie. Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal {{declared a state of emergency}} on July22. Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the <b>potential</b> <b>effects</b> of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines. On July23, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 people in that area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July24. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{notification}} that a {{newly formed}} tropical cyclone was approaching the Florida coast, the Weather Bureau posted storm warnings for coastal areas between Key West and West Palm Beach, Florida. Later on August6, warnings were lowered in Key West, but the warning area was extended north to Titusville, Florida. Vessels and small craft located offshore north of Miami, Florida were notified to advise caution for the oncoming tropical disturbance. As the storm approached the coast, more accurate forecasts allowed vessels to be cautioned {{as far north}} as Hatteras, North Carolina. Storm warnings between Jupiter and Daytona, Florida were upgraded to hurricane warnings on August7, in accordance with the storm's upgrade to hurricane intensity. After moving inland, hurricane warnings were lowered, but emergency warnings for the storm's <b>potential</b> <b>effects</b> were posted for the interior of the Florida peninsula north of 28°N the following day. Northwest storm warnings were issued in Tampa, while northeast storm warnings were issued from Tampa north to Apalachicola, Florida. All warnings were eventually lowered following the storm's dissipation.|$|E

40|$|General Relativity {{extensions}} {{based on}} Renormalization Group effects {{are motivated by}} a known physical principle and constitute a class of extended gravity theories that have some unexplored unique aspects. In this work we develop in detail the Newtonian and post Newtonian limits of a realisation called Renormalization Group extended General Relativity (RGGR). Special attention is taken to the external <b>potential</b> <b>effect,</b> which constitutes a type of screening mechanism typical of RGGR. In the Solar System, RGGR depends on a single dimensionless parameter ν̅_, and this parameter is such that for ν̅_ = 0 one fully recovers GR in the Solar System. Previously this parameter was constrained to be |ν̅_| ≲ 10 ^- 21, without considering the external <b>potential</b> <b>effect.</b> Here we show that under a certain approximation RGGR can be cast in a form compatible with the Parametrised Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, and we use both the PPN formalism and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz technique to put new bounds on ν̅_, either considering or not the external <b>potential</b> <b>effect.</b> With the external <b>potential</b> <b>effect</b> the new bound reads |ν̅_| ≲ 10 ^- 16. We discuss the possible consequences of this bound to the dark matter abundance in galaxies. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures. Added references and minor corrections in text.

25|$|As well {{as being}} aware of {{cryptographic}} history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs.
