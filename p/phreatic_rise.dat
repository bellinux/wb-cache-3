40|$|Lowering the {{groundwater}} {{table for the}} purpose of open-cast mining causes settlements over a wide area usually affecting the whole mining region and the surrounding areas. The lowering reduces the soil buoyancy in the affected layers thus causing settlements, while the reverse effect of the subsequent <b>phreatic</b> <b>rise</b> results in heave. In order to estimate such vertical movements of the terrain, an analytical prognosis model is derived from basic soil mechanical relations describing the compression and consolidation of soils...|$|E
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. <b>Phreatic</b> events, when <b>rising</b> magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|R
40|$|The Gunung Mulu karst of {{northern}} Sarawak hosts {{some of the}} longest caves in Southeast Asia. The majority of the cave passages in the Mulu karst are of phreatic origin and formed between sinks and springs {{as a series of}} loops crossing the bedding planes along which the passages formed. Water draining off the Mulu Sandstone also invaded the limestone down-dip, under a hydraulic gradient large enough to facilitate <b>phreatic</b> tubes <b>rising</b> up to 100 m to intersect other bedding planes. Rain falling directly on the limestone massifs has created vertical shafts and invasion vadose passages, which intersected the drained phreatic tubes, creating a three-dimensional array of cave passages. The drainage off the sandstone also migrated laterally along the contact with the limestone to produce a series of very large cavities, whose roof collapse produced a series of very large dolines or tiankeng (sky windows) ...|$|R

In this study, an embankment model was constructed to investigate the influence of prolonged {{immersion in}} floodwater on the failure of an embankment. The results indicate that: (1) the <b>phreatic</b> surface gradually <b>rises</b> and negative pore pressures gradually dissipate with the time of prolonged immersion in floodwater, and, finally, a stable and fully saturated state is reached; (2) observable cracks and a heave phenomenon are found near the downstream toe and in the top stratum of the foundation, which are attributed to the large uplift pressure on the interface between the top stratum and the pervious substratum, the tremendous impact effect induced by the rapid rise in water level, and the reduction of shear strength of heavy silt loam. The present study enhances our in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms of embankment failure induced by floodwater, and provides experimental data for validation of mathematical models of the embankment seepage failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensive}} exploitation, {{since the}} beginning of the century, of a semiconfined aquifer in Buenos Aires City (Argentina) and its surrounding areas has caused large drawdown cones by the coalescence of smaller ones. The population of the area is about 11 million inhabitants. The climate is subhumid-humid with a mean annual rainfall of 1050 mm/year and a surplus of 270 mm/year. Some of the effects caused by the intensive exploitation have been saline intrusion and leakage from the phreatic aquifer through the aquitard, which caused a fall of the water table. As a consequence of the demand increase and closing of production wells due to salinization and nitrate content, treated water from the la Plata River began to be imported. The recovery of piezometric levels has caused the <b>phreatic</b> level to <b>rise,</b> with a serious impact on the urban infrastructure, established some decades ago. Based on successive flow - nets, on the system parameters T,S;K, K',T' and on the value of imported yields, a monitoring system with forecast capacity is proposed, as well as an operative model for phenomena control, using alternative pumping on both aquifers. Se analiza el origen y efectos de la recuperación de niveles freáticos, como consecuencia del ascenso de los niveles piezométricos en sectores del Gran Buenos Aires y La Plata. Se proponen alternativas de corrección y la implementación de un modelo matemático del fenómeno con capacidad de pronóstico...|$|R
