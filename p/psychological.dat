5|$|Obligatory <b>psychological</b> {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties {{responsible}} for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any <b>psychological</b> testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult <b>psychological</b> testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|The British <b>Psychological</b> Society {{issued a}} {{statement}} offering to provide expert support in <b>psychological</b> testing and monitoring of pilots. The European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA) {{issued a statement}} supporting <b>psychological</b> testing {{in the selection of}} pilots, but also stated it could not forecast the life events and mental health problems of individual pilots, nor could it predict the unique ways pilots would cope with these. It said priority should be given to <b>psychological</b> help for relatives and friends of victims {{in the aftermath of a}} disaster.|$|E
5|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} <b>psychological</b> therapy {{is effective in}} reducing self-harm. The proportion of the adolescents who self-harmed over the follow-up period was lower in the intervention groups (28%) than in controls (33%). <b>Psychological</b> therapies with the largest effect sizes were dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and mentalization-based therapy (MBT).|$|E

5|$|Modern writers {{also argue}} that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The {{consensus}} that White should try to win can be a <b>psychological</b> burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for <b>psychological</b> or objective reasons.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} Aun Weor's Practical Work is of a <b>psychological</b> nature. He states {{in many of}} his books {{that the purpose of}} his {{doctrine}} is to affect a <b>psychological</b> change.

25|$|Dutton has {{suggested}} a <b>psychological</b> profile {{of men who}} abuse their wives, arguing that they have borderline personalities that are developed early in life. However, these <b>psychological</b> theories are disputed: Gelles suggests that <b>psychological</b> theories are limited, and points out that other {{researchers have found that}} only 10% (or less) fit this <b>psychological</b> profile. He argues that social factors are important, while personality traits, mental illness, or psychopathy are lesser factors.|$|E
25|$|Some clinicians {{believe that}} <b>psychological</b> {{characteristics}} alone determine mental disorders. Others speculate that abnormal {{behavior can be}} explained by a mix of social and <b>psychological</b> factors. In many examples, environmental and <b>psychological</b> triggers complement one another resulting in emotional stress, which in turn activates a mental illness Each person is unique in how they will react to <b>psychological</b> stressors. What may break one person may have little to no effect on another. <b>Psychological</b> stressors, which can trigger mental illness, are as follows: emotional, physical or sexual abuse, loss of a significant loved one, neglect and being unable to relate to others.|$|E
25|$|Longitudinal {{studies have}} {{suggested}} adverse working conditions {{can contribute to the}} development of <b>psychological</b> distress. <b>Psychological</b> distress refers to negative affect, without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder. <b>Psychological</b> distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and anxiety symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to <b>psychological</b> distress is thus an important avenue of research. Job satisfaction is also related to negative health outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the central}} {{concepts}} of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong <b>psychological</b> process of differentiation {{of the self}} out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered {{it to be the}} main task of human development. He created some of the best known <b>psychological</b> concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the <b>psychological</b> complex, and extraversion and introversion.|$|E
25|$|Gethin argues, rebirth in the {{different}} realms is determined by one's karma, which is directly determined by one's <b>psychological</b> states. The Buddhist cosmology may thus {{be seen as a}} map of different realms of existence and a description of all possible <b>psychological</b> experiences. The <b>psychological</b> states of a person in current life lead to the nature of next rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.|$|E

25|$|The {{psychology}} {{of religion is}} concerned with the <b>psychological</b> principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion.

25|$|There is a {{small body}} of {{research}} on the psychology of cryptorchidism, that attempts to determine whether this condition can cause lasting <b>psychological</b> problems. The <b>psychological</b> research on cryptorchism consists of only a few case reports and small studies. This research also has serious methodological problems: major variables are completely uncontrolled, such as the small physical stature of many cryptorchid boys, and the <b>psychological</b> effects of corrective surgery.|$|E
