50|$|The {{pathogenic}} {{tendency of}} Sporisorium reilianum as illustrated above is {{to carry out}} its life cycle in congruence with the growth of either maize or sorghum as the host plant. For example, In place of ears of corn; plant-like sorus develop. The onset of this smut is sporadic and slowly progressive however disease severity is high. For example, a field of corn can have 10% infected with yield loss that has an 80% apparent infection rate. Post infection treatment to eliminate or reduce the disease are marginally effective or ineffective. The massive crop loss that this pathogen can create is devastating to producers who are unaware of the teliospores overwintering in the soil; which, can survive for many years. Treatment of seeds with a fungicide during planting or prior to harvest is important to limit the spread of spores especially if high risk field areas known by the producer. It is important to limit transmission of spores to disease free areas via harvesting equipment or <b>planting</b> <b>tools.</b> The incidence of Sporisorium reilianum occurs in occurs in Africa, Europe, U.S., and China. Fungicide use in the market today indicates that there are about 52 million acres of cereals lost worldwide a year.|$|E

Problem: How to mechanise tree planting in North American logged sites? Trees are presently hand planted. Preliminary exploration identified the following collection of sub-problems. Vehicle: How to carry tools reliably and cost effectively over rough obstacle strewn ground? Results: U. S. A. - patent granted European Patent Office - patent granted Canada - patent granted The patents cover the main form and mode of operation of a simple but unconventional vehicle. Silvicultural/mechanical: How to mechanise the handling and placement of trees? Results: Two International Patents allowed. They cover a magazine/feed mechanism and a placement mechanism. They form a planting tool. One man guides the vehicle/tool system. An array of <b>planting</b> <b>tools</b> is carried. Two problems arise from {{the need to make}} guidance manageable and the planting rate fast enough. Spacing: How to cause the members of a collection of simultaneously operating tools to space themselves appropriately the spacing being driven by machine perceived cues? Choice: How to cause a tool to move to and halt over a plan table spot, tool action being driven by machine perceived cues? Results: One International Patent allowed. Spacing: A conceptual solution is described. Choice: A semi-automatic solution is described. It involves a system of tool guidance and a system of tool set-up, both light guided. Two methods for the detection of light signals in the presence of sunlight have been investigated. Choice-automatic; two solutions have been explored. One uses standard data processing, the other "parallel" processing. Here an idealised device is described which will compare for likeness two two-dimensional patterns...|$|E

The demand for these {{commodities}} experienced thus increasing production of maize {{to the attention of}} many people. In Indonesia, the planting of the seed corn is still done traditionally caused due to mismatch condition of land with modern technology that has been made, besides the price factor for a mechanical corn cropping tool less attractive to farmers. So farmers still use traditional cropping tool which impact on the length of time required when planting. Sepatagung present provide appropriate solutions.
