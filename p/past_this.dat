5|$|At {{the border}} with Deptford Township, Route 47 reaches an {{intersection}} known as Five Points. Here, the road meets Route 41, County Route 603, and County Route 630. Route 47 turns northwest as this intersection and runs through wooded areas with some dwellings, with Route 55 intersecting the route at a cloverleaf interchange a short distance later. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> interchange, the road continues through wooded inhabited areas, eventually turning due north. It comes to an intersection with the western terminus of County Route 534 as the route heads through more suburban homes along with businesses. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> intersection, Route 47 passes businesses before crossing over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange. From here, it heads through more inhabited areas before entering Westville. Upon entering Westville, the route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 295. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> interchange, the road runs through neighborhoods, intersecting County Route 621 (Almonesson Road) and County Route 551. The latter forms a concurrency with Route 47 and these two routes run northeast through commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, crossing the Big Timber Creek into Brooklawn, Camden County. Here, {{it comes to a}} traffic circle with U.S. Route 130 and County Route 753, where Route 47 ends and County Route 551 continues on to Camden, forming a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 130.|$|E

5|$|US 22 {{continues}} into Branchburg Township, Somerset County, where development {{near the}} road increases but remains mostly rural. CR 614 parallels US 22 {{to the north}} {{to pass through the}} community of North Branch before US 22 intersects CR 637 and crosses the North Branch Raritan River into Bridgewater Township. In Bridgewater Township, the route comes to an interchange with the eastern terminus of CR 614 and the western terminus of Route 28. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> interchange, US 22 passes business parks and the Raritan Valley Country Club, widening to six lanes in the process. Afterwards, it comes to an interchange with US 202 and US 206. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> interchange, US 22 quickly transitions from a rural to a more suburban setting and heads east along the border of Somerville to the south and Bridgewater Township to the north, passing near the Bridgewater Commons shopping mall. The median of the route widens as it runs immediately to the south of I-287, fully entering Bridgewater Township again as it comes to an interchange with I-287 at exits 14A and 14B.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the town}} line, NY11A intersects Otisco Road (CR246) and passes several farms {{on its way}} to the hamlet of Cardiff. Here, the route runs past a line of homes prior to passing under US20 at the {{northern}} edge of the community. Outside of Cardiff, the highway becomes known as Syracuse–Tully Valley Road as it slowly curves to the northwest, matching a similar turn in the course of the creek and its valley. As the road traverses another stretch of cultivated fields, it meets Field Lane, a short connector providing access between NY11A and US20. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> point, NY11A serves little more than farms before it enters the Onondaga Reservation. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the Onondaga Nation.|$|E
5|$|After {{splitting}} from I-295, US 130 continues northeast as a four-lane {{divided road}} called Crown Point Avenue.

5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the <b>past.</b> <b>This</b> paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E

The Northeast Extension continues into Lehigh County, part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area, past the PA 663 interchange. Here, it interchanges with U.S. 22 (Lehigh Valley Thruway) near Allentown, which offers an indirect connection to Pennsylvania Route 309 and Interstate 78.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period.

This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{crosses the}} marshy Little River {{and enters the}} town of Little Creek, where it becomes Main Street and is lined with residences.

5|$|Due to {{the terrain}} {{surrounding}} the interchange {{and the location}} of the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, NY104 is forced to run parallel to NY590 for a short distance between the Keeler Street Expressway and NY590's next exit, a diamond interchange connecting to East Ridge Road. Through this stretch, NY590—now just four lanes wide—runs in between NY104 westbound and NY104 eastbound. At East Ridge Road, NY104 turns to the northeast to cross Irondequoit Bay while NY590 continues north through residential areas toward Sea Breeze. The road has an at-grade intersection with Sunrise Crescent, a private residential street, before meeting Titus Avenue at a roundabout that serves as NY590's northern terminus. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> point, the right-of-way of NY590 continues north to Culver Road at the Lake Ontario shoreline as a divided two-lane street named Sea Breeze Drive.|$|E
5|$|From here, Route 47 {{continues}} through {{a mix of}} trees and residences, intersecting Schooner Landing Road, which provides access to and from northbound Route 55. Just <b>past</b> <b>this</b> intersection, the route crosses the Manantico Creek into Millville, where it becomes South Second Street, and continues past more woodland containing residences. As the route continues north, residential development increases along with commercial and industrial establishments. Route 47 reaches the commercial downtown of Millville, where it crosses Route 49/County Route 555 and becomes North Second Street. County Route 555 parallels Route 47 a block to the east as the road crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and intersects County Route 552 Spur. <b>Past</b> <b>this</b> intersection, County Route 555 heads farther {{to the east and}} Route 47 crosses the Conrail Shared Assets Operations line a second time, passing a mix of residences, businesses, and industrial buildings. The road becomes three lanes with a center-left turn lane as it heads through commercial areas {{in the northern part of}} Millville.
