The lander has a 2.5 meter robotic arm that was capable of digging shallow trenches in the regolith. There was an electrochemistry experiment which analysed the ions in the regolith and the amount and type of antioxidants on Mars.

2500|$|The minimum {{instruction}} set {{of a universal}} Turing machine requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the Kolmogorov complexity of most practical theories. Marcus Hutter has used this consistency to define a [...] "natural" [...] Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex {{instruction set}}s {{in the formulation of}} razors. Describing the program for the universal program as the [...] "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as <b>program</b> <b>data,</b> it has been formally proven under Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that [...] "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized." [...] Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the minimum message length (MML) principle.|$|E
