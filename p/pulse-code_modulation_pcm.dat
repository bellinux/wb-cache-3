50|$|Analog-to-digital {{converters}} {{are integral}} to 2000s era music reproduction technology and digital audio workstation-based sound recording. People often produce music on computers using an analog recording and therefore need analog-to-digital converters {{to create the}} <b>pulse-code</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PCM)</b> data streams that go onto compact discs and digital music files. The current crop of analog-to-digital converters utilized in music can sample at rates up to 192 kilohertz. Considerable literature exists on these matters, but commercial considerations often play a significant role. Many recording studios record in 24-bit/96 kHz (or higher) <b>pulse-code</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PCM)</b> or Direct Stream Digital (DSD) formats, and then downsample or decimate the signal for Red-Book CD production (44.1 kHz) or to 48 kHz for commonly used radio and television broadcast applications.|$|E
