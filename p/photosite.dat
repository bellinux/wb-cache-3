25|$|The {{operation}} of the Foveon X3 sensor {{is quite different from}} that of the Bayer filter image sensor more commonly used in digital cameras. In the Bayer sensor, each <b>photosite</b> in the array consists of a single light sensor (either CMOS or CCD) that, as a result of filtration, is exposed to only one of the three primary colors, red, green, or blue. Constructing a full color image from a Bayer sensor requires demosaicing, an interpolative process in which the output pixel associated with each <b>photosite</b> is assigned an RGB value based in part on the level of red, green, and blue reported by those photosites adjacent to it. The Foveon X3 sensor creates its RGB color output for each <b>photosite</b> by combining the outputs of each of the stacked photodiodes at each of its photosites. This operational difference results in several significant consequences.|$|E
2500|$|For example, the {{dimensions}} of the <b>photosite</b> array in the sensor in the Sigma SD10 camera are 2268 × 1512, and the camera produces a native file size of those dimensions (times three color layers). [...] This amounts to approximately 3.4 million three-color pixels. However, it has been advertised as a 10.2 MP camera by taking account of the fact that each <b>photosite</b> contains stacked red, green, and blue color sensing photodiodes, or pixel sensors (2268 × 1512 × 3). [...] By comparison, {{the dimensions}} of the <b>photosite</b> array in the 10.2 MP Bayer sensor in the Nikon D200 camera are 3872 × 2592, but there is only one photodiode, or one pixel sensor, at each site. [...] The cameras have equal numbers of photodiodes, and produce similar RAW data file sizes, but the Bayer filter camera produces a larger native file size via demosaicing.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the actual}} {{resolution}} {{produced by the}} Bayer sensor {{is more complicated than}} the count of its photosites, or its native file size, might suggest. [...] The reason has to do with both the demosaicing and the separate anti-aliasing filter commonly used to reduce the occurrence or severity of color moiré patterns that the mosaic characteristic of the Bayer sensor produces. [...] The effect of this filter is to blur the image output of the sensor, thus producing a lower resolution than the <b>photosite</b> count would seem to imply. This filter is largely unnecessary with the Foveon X3 sensor and is not used. [...] The earliest camera with a Foveon X3 sensor, the Sigma SD9, showed visible luminance moiré patterns, but not color moiré.|$|E
5000|$|Fujifilm's EXR {{color filter}} array are {{manufactured}} in both CCD (SuperCCD) and CMOS (BSI CMOS). As with the SuperCCD, the filter itself is rotated 45 degrees. Unlike conventional Bayer filter designs, {{there are always}} two adjacent <b>photosites</b> detecting the same color. The main reason {{for this type of}} array is to contribute to pixel [...] "binning", where two adjacent <b>photosites</b> can be merged, making the sensor itself more [...] "sensitive" [...] to light. Another reason is for the sensor to record two different exposures, which is then merged to produce an image with greater dynamic range. The underlying circuitry has two read-out channels that take their information from alternate rows of the sensor. The result is that it can act like two interleaved sensors, with different exposure times for each half of the <b>photosites.</b> Half of the <b>photosites</b> can be intentionally underexposed so that they fully capture the brighter areas of the scene. This retained highlight information can then be blended in with the output from {{the other half of the}} sensor that is recording a 'full' exposure, again making use of the close spacing of similarly colored <b>photosites.</b>|$|R
5000|$|LBCAST {{divides the}} <b>photosites</b> {{to be read}} out into two {{channels}} by colour, red and blue photosites—making up 50% {{of the total number}} of <b>photosites</b> between them, as in CMOS and CCD colour sensors—accumulate using one read-channel, while green photosites—which make up the other 50% of total pixels, as in CMOS and CCD—accumulate in a dedicated channel.|$|R
50|$|Typical Bayer sensor arrays have RGB <b>photosites</b> in a {{repeated}} 2 by 2 pattern. When it overlaps {{with a regular}} pattern that is being captured, a new interference pattern can occur that {{does not exist in}} real life. In contrast, X-Trans sensors have a more randomised pattern of RGB <b>photosites</b> than conventional Bayer array sensors, reducing the likelihood of interference and removing a need for a low-pass filter that lowers image resolution.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{difference}} is that more of the photons entering the camera will be detected by the Foveon X3 photosensor than is possible with a mosaic sensor. This is because each of the color filters overlaying each <b>photosite</b> of a mosaic sensor passes {{only one of the}} primary colors, absorbing the other two. The absorption of these colors reduces the total amount of light gathered by the sensor and destroys much of the information about the color of the light impinging on each sensor element. Although the Foveon X3 has greater light gathering ability, the individual layers do not respond as sharply to the respective colours. Thus color-indicating information in the sensor's raw data requires [...] "aggressive" [...] matrixing (essentially, removal of common-mode signals) to produce color data in a standard color space, which can increase color noise in low-light situations.|$|E
5000|$|Each <b>photosite</b> in LBCAST uses {{a single}} JFET {{transistor}} {{in place of}} two MOSFET transistors used for the separate tasks of <b>photosite</b> read-out selection and signal amplification, in CMOS technology. In total, CMOS uses four transistors per <b>photosite,</b> where LBCAST manages with three.|$|E
50|$|In October 2003 Homestead Technologies {{launched}} <b>PhotoSite,</b> a photo {{sharing and}} web hosting service tailored to amateur digital photography. In March 2005, <b>PhotoSite</b> {{was sold to}} United Online.|$|E
5000|$|In a later [...] "behind the scenes" [...] {{interview}} {{published on}} the Nikon website it was revealed by the General Manager of Nikon's Imaging Development Management Department that the sensor developed for and used in the D1, and subsequently the D1H, actually used 10.8 million <b>photosites</b> rather than the 2.7 million {{that had previously been}} suggested. This allowed multiple <b>photosites</b> to be grouped together into units that formed the final pixels in the image, contributing to the sensor's high sensitivity and excellent signal-to-noise ratio.|$|R
50|$|The camera's {{image sensor}} is a {{single-plate}} CMOS-based integrated circuit, 24 mm × 36 mm in size; {{the same as}} 35mm film. It has approximately 17.2 million total <b>photosites</b> (16.7 million effective pixels in the final output). It uses a RGB primary color filter.|$|R
50|$|The camera's {{image sensor}} is a {{single-plate}} CMOS-based integrated circuit. It {{has a higher}} density of <b>photosites</b> - approximately 17.2 million total (16.6 million effective pixels in the final output). It has a RGB primary color filter and non-removable low-pass filter, like its predecessor.|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{dimensions}} of the <b>photosite</b> array in the sensor in the Sigma SD10 camera are 2268 × 1512, and the camera produces a native file size of those dimensions (times three color layers).

5000|$|... 1976: The Bayer Pattern {{color filter}} array (CFA) {{was invented by}} Eastman Kodak {{researcher}} Bryce Bayer. The order in which dyes are placed on an image sensor <b>photosite</b> is still in use today. The basic technology {{is still the most}} commonly used of its kind to date.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} {{has been over}} whether sellers should {{count the number of}} <b>photosites,</b> or the total number of photodiodes, as a megapixel count, and whether either of those should be compared with the number of photodiodes in a Bayer filter sensor or camera as a measure of resolution.|$|R
50|$|Conventional Bayer sensors {{can also}} produce false colour {{as they do}} not have R and B <b>photosites</b> in some {{horizontal}} and vertical lines, X-Trans sensors on the other hand have an improved colour reproduction due to all horizontal and vertical lines containing at least one R, G and B pixels.|$|R
50|$|The {{image sensor}} has {{individual}} <b>photosites</b> to collect {{light from a}} given area. Not {{all areas of the}} sensor are used to collect light, due to other circuitry. A higher fill factor of a sensor causes more light to be collected, allowing for better ISO performance based on sensor size.|$|R
5000|$|The simpler {{circuitry}} required {{translates into}} fewer layers of {{material in the}} silicon chip meaning that tangential light requires less correction in order to traverse to the depth at which the photons result in signal, simplifying the need for lensing at each pixel or <b>photosite,</b> and therefore theoretically, attaining greater image uniformity.|$|E
5000|$|On January 21, 2003 Fujifilm {{announced}} the fourth generation of SuperCCD sensors, in two variations: SuperCCD HR and SuperCCD SR. HR stands for [...] "high resolution" [...] and SR stands for [...] "super dynamic range". The SR sensor has two photodiodes per <b>photosite,</b> one {{much larger than}} the other. Appropriately processing information from both can yield larger black to white range of brightness (dynamic range).|$|E
50|$|Microlenses {{in recent}} imaging chips have {{attained}} {{smaller and smaller}} sizes. The Samsung NX1 mirrorless system camera packs 28.2 million microlenses onto its CMOS imaging chip, one per <b>photosite,</b> each with a side length of just 3.63 micrometer. For smartphones this process is miniaturized even further: The Samsung Galaxy S6 has a CMOS sensor with pixels only 1.12 micrometer each. These pixels are covered with microlenses of a equally small pitch.|$|E
25|$|It uses {{an array}} of <b>photosites,</b> each of which {{consists}} of three vertically stacked photodiodes, organized in a two-dimensional grid. Each of the three stacked photodiodes responds to different wavelengths of light; that is, each has a different spectral sensitivity curve. This difference is because different wavelengths of light penetrate silicon to different depths.|$|R
50|$|Visible fixed-pattern {{noise is}} often caused by hot pixels - pixel sensors with {{higher than normal}} dark current. On long exposure, they can appear as bright pixels. <b>Photosites</b> on the sensor that always appear as {{brighter}} pixels are called stuck pixels while sensors that only brighten up after long exposure are called hot pixels.|$|R
50|$|The Fujifilm X-Trans is a CMOS sensor {{developed}} by Fujifilm {{and used in}} its Fujifilm X-series cameras. Unlike most CMOS sensors featuring a conventional Bayer filter array, X-Trans sensors have a unique 6 by 6 pattern of <b>photosites.</b> Fujifilm claims that this layout can minimise moiré effects, and increase resolution by {{eliminating the need for}} a low-pass filter.|$|R
50|$|However, {{even with}} a {{theoretically}} perfect sensor that could capture and distinguish all colors at each <b>photosite,</b> Moiré and other artifacts could still appear. This is an unavoidable consequence of any system that samples an otherwise continuous signal at discrete intervals or locations. For this reason, most photographic digital sensor incorporates something called an optical low-pass filter (OLPF) or an anti-aliasing (AA) filter. This is typically a thin layer {{directly in front of}} the sensor, and works by effectively blurring any potentially problematic details that are finer than the resolution of the sensor.|$|E
50|$|The {{inclusion}} of the SampleFormat tag in TIFF 6.0 allows TIFF files to handle advanced pixel data types, including integer images with more than 8 bits per channel and floating point images. This tag made TIFF 6.0 a viable format for scientific image processing where extended precision is required. An example would be the use of TIFF to store images acquired using scientific CCD cameras that provide up to 16 bits per <b>photosite</b> of intensity resolution. Storing a sequence of images in a single TIFF file is also possible, and is allowed under TIFF 6.0, provided the rules for multi-page images are followed.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{contexts}} (such as {{descriptions of}} camera sensors), the term pixel {{is used to}} refer to a single scalar element of a multi-component representation (more precisely called a <b>photosite</b> in the camera sensor context, although the neologism [...] is sometimes used to describe the elements of a digital camera's sensor), while in yet other contexts the term may be {{used to refer to}} the set of component intensities for a spatial position. Drawing a distinction between pixels, photosites, and samples may reduce confusion when describing color systems that use chroma subsampling or cameras that use Bayer filter to produce color components via upsampling.|$|E
50|$|The {{digital camera}} {{industry}} {{is attempting to}} address the problem of dynamic range. Some cameras have an automatic exposure bracketing mode, to be used in conjunction with high-dynamic-range imaging software. Some CCDs including Fujifilm's Super CCD combine <b>photosites</b> of different sizes to give increased dynamic range. Other manufacturers use in-camera software to prevent highlight overexposure. Nikon calls this feature D-Lighting.|$|R
40|$|Space {{saved and}} interelectrode short {{circuits}} eliminated. Proposed virtual-phase, interline-transfer, charge-couple device uses single gate electrode to control both interline and intraline transfer of charge. Voltage on single control electrode varied to transfer charge from <b>photosites</b> to shift register, or else along sift register. Two kinds of transfer independent of each other. Charge transferred along shift register when voltage on control electrode alternated between gate potentials...|$|R
40|$|In {{proposed}} interline-transfer timing {{scheme for}} charge-coupled-device (CCD) video imaging array, charges accumulated during some fraction of frame period swept out and dumped to prevent overloading and saturation in intensely illuminated <b>photosites.</b> Excess charges swept out at highest possible rate, while charges used for imaging read out at rate lower but was highest rate that provides complete transfer of charge on array and handled by subsequent signal-processing equipment...|$|R

40|$|We report {{results of}} an optical and {{picosecond}} photon echo study on the zero-phonon line of <b>photosite</b> I of pentacene in benzoic acid. The results show that optical dephasing in this system proceeds via uncorrelated phonon scattering processes {{from the ground and}} optically excited state to singly excited librational levels. It is also shown that the data can not be consistently interpreted using coherence exchange theory. The librational frequencies and lifetimes at low temperature are determined to be 12 cm– 1 and 18 ps in the ground state and 16. 7 cm– 1 and 2. 5 ps in the singlet excited state. It is argued that population decay of librational overtones proceeds in single quantum steps down the librational ladder which excludes these modes from playing a role in optical dephasing. From a temperature-dependent line shape study of the libronic transition in absorption, it is concluded that the low-temperature librational lifetime is primarily due to resonant decay into acoustic phonons. At elevated temperature, cubic libration-phonon anharmonicity dominates the librational lifetime. These lifetime shortening processes are reflected in the temperature dependent dephasing of the origin. Finally, with the dephasing model presented in this paper for <b>photosite</b> I, existing controversies concerning optical dephasing in the unburned origin of pentacene in benzoic acid can be resolved. ...|$|E
50|$|Pixel {{density of}} the sensor: The large sensors in DSLRs and medium-format digital cameras {{generally}} have larger <b>photosites,</b> which collect more light and therefore are generally more sensitive than their diminutive counterparts in compact digital cameras. The larger sensors tend to have better signal-to-noise characteristics. However, signal processing and amplification improve with generation, and small sensors of today approach the dynamic range of large sensors in the past.|$|R
5000|$|According to Sigma Corporation, [...] "there {{has been}} some {{controversy}} in how to specify the number of pixels in Foveon sensors."The argument has been over whether sellers should {{count the number of}} <b>photosites,</b> or the total number of photodiodes, as a megapixel count, and whether either of those should be compared with the number of photodiodes in a Bayer filter sensor or camera as a measure of resolution.|$|R
50|$|The imager {{converts}} {{light into}} an electrical signal. The camera lens projects an image onto the imager surface, exposing the photosensitive array to light. This light exposure is converted into an electrical charge. At {{the end of}} the timed exposure, the imager converts the accumulated charge into a continuous analog voltage at the imager's output terminals. After the conversion is complete, the <b>photosites</b> reset to start the exposure of the next video frame.|$|R
