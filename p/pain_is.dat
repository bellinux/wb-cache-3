5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> caused by the illness and most acute (short-term) <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} monetary rewards on the rate of pain discounting. Our aim, also, {{was to understand the}} effect of previous painful dental experiences on the rate of discounting pain. Two groups (N = 148) completed a discounting task. In the first group, delayed <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> weaker than immediate pain, and in the second group delayed <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> stronger than immediate <b>pain.</b> Two conditions <b>were</b> studied: <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> either accompanied by a monetary reward or not. We found that people preferred immediate <b>pain</b> when it <b>was</b> weaker than delayed pain; however, when delayed <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> stronger than immediate <b>pain,</b> there <b>was</b> no clear preference. In both groups the preference for immediate <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> higher when <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by a monetary reward. Previous painful experiences were not related to the rate of discounting. It was concluded that the preference for delayed pain depends on the intensity of pain, and it can be modified by rewards that accompany pain...|$|R

5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} into treatments for Dercum's disease has identified liposuction {{as a possible}} treatment.

5|$|Pain: acute <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the}} best treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence, direct costs, and indirect costs of back pain. A retrospective analysis was conducted of the 1996 portion of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Data in the MEPS were collected from a representative sample of 22, 601 respondents and included demographics, health status and conditions, use of and payments for medical care, and health insurance and employment information. Back <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> defined using International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 9 -CM) codes determined by an expert panel as indicative of back pain. Prevalence of aggregate or total, work related, and missed workdays back <b>pain</b> <b>were</b> calculated by frequency of occurrence of back pain ICD- 9 -CM codes. Direct costs of back <b>pain</b> <b>were</b> calculated based on patient and third-party payments made for medical care and included prescriptions medications, inpatient care, emergency room visits, outpatient care, office-based provider visits, home health care. Indirect costs of missed workdays back <b>pain</b> <b>were</b> calculated using the human capital method. Sample estimates were weighted and projected to the population. The prevalence of aggregate back <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> 8. 74 percent (95 % C. L. = 8. 24 to 9. 24), the prevalence of work-related back <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> 1. 52 percent (95 % C. L. = 1. 31 to 1. 72), and the prevalence of missed workdays back <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> 1. 76 percent (95 % C. L. = 1. 54 to 1. 98). Back <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> more prevalent among individuals with a high school level of education, among Caucasian individuals, among individuals whose incomes were greater than $ 12, 000, and among individuals working in heavy industry and manual labor occupations. Direct costs of back <b>pain</b> <b>were</b> $ 14, 701, 417, 650 with higher proportions of cost incurred for office-based medical provider, inpatient, and outpatient care. Indirect costs of back <b>pain</b> <b>were</b> $ 18, 533, 583, 620 indicating considerable losses in productivity in the workforce as a result of back pain.

5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of <b>pain</b> <b>is</b> processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E
