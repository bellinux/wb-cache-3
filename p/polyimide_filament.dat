40|$|In this work, a new {{generation}} of intramuscular multi-channel electrode for EMG recording and muscle stimulation is presented. The electrode is based on double-sided polyimide microtechnology, and features electrode contacts on both sides of a thin <b>polyimide</b> <b>filament.</b> The structure is attached to a cannula, allowing insertion and application of the electrode system similar to conventional intramuscular wire electrodes. In the presented design, the electrode has 12 small recording sites {{on one side of the}} structure, and 3 large stimulation sites on the other side. Applications of the system include diagnosis and treatment of tremor. To this end, the electrode has been successfully tested in tremor patients. In the future, the concept will be extended to other fields of application including intraneural electrodes...|$|E
40|$|A high {{temperature}} resistant polyimide fiber that has a dielectric constant of less than 3 is presented. The fiber was prepared by first reacting 2, 2 -bis (4 -(4 aminophenoxy) phenyl) hexafluoropropane with 2, 2 -bis (3, 4 -dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride in an aprotic solvent to form a polyamic acid resin solution. The polyamic acid resin solution is then extruded into a coagulation medium to form polyamic acid fibers. The fibers are thermally cured to their polyimide form. Alternatively, 2, 2 -bis(4 -(4 -aminophenoxy) phenyl) hexafluoropropane is reacted with 2, 2 -bis(3, 4 -dicarboxyphenyl) hexafluoropropane dianhydride to form a polyamic acid, and the polyamic acid is chemically converted to its polyimide form. The polyimide is then dissolved in a solvent to form a polyimide resin solution, and the polyimide resin is extruded into a coagulation medium to form a <b>polyimide</b> wet gel <b>filament.</b> In order to obtain polyimide fibers of increased tensile properties, the <b>polyimide</b> wet gel <b>filaments</b> are stretched at elevated temperatures. The tensile properties of the fibers were measured and found {{to be in the}} range of standard textile fibers. Polyimide fibers obtained by either method will have a dielectric constant {{similar to that of the}} corresponding polymer, viz., less than 3 at 10 GHz...|$|R
