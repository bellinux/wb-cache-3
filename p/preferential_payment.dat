In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel preferential shares before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to <b>preferential</b> <b>payment</b> as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits.

2500|$|While both {{need to be}} registered, the {{distinction}} between a fixed and a floating charge matters greatly because floating charges are subordinated by the Insolvency Act 1986 to insolvency practitioners' expenses under section 176ZA, preferential creditors (employees' wages up to £800 per person, pension contributions and the EU coal and steel levies) under section 175 and Schedule 6 and unsecured creditors' claims up {{to a maximum of}} £600,000 under section 176A. The floating charge was invented as a form of security in the late nineteenth century, as a concept which would apply to the whole of the assets of an undertaking. The leading company law case, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, exemplified that a floating charge holder (even if it was the director and almost sole shareholder of the company) could enforce their priority ahead of all other persons. As Lord MacNaghten said, [...] "Everybody knows that when there is a winding-up debenture-holders generally step in and sweep off everything; and a great scandal it is." [...] Parliament responded with the <b>Preferential</b> <b>Payments</b> in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897, which created a new category of preferential creditors - at the time, employees and the tax authorities - who would be able to collect their debts after fixed charge holders, but before floating charge holders. In interpreting the scope of a floating charge the leading case was Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd where a receiver contended an instrument was void because it had not been registered. Romer LJ agreed, and held that the hallmarks of a floating charge were that (1) assets were charged present and future and (2) change in the ordinary course of business, and most importantly (3) until a step is taken by the charge holder [...] "the company may carry on its business in the ordinary way". A floating charge is not, technically speaking, a true security until a date of its [...] "crystallisation", when it metaphorically descends and [...] "fixes" [...] onto the assets in a business' possession at that time.|$|R
25|$|Over the 20th century, {{reform efforts}} focused on three main issues. The first {{concerned}} setting a fair system of priority among claims of different creditors. This primarily centred upon {{the ability of}} powerful contractual creditors, particularly banks, to agree to take a security interest over a company's property, leaving unsecured creditors without any remaining assets to satisfy their claims. Immediately after Salomon's case and the controversy created {{over the use of}} floating charges, the <b>Preferential</b> <b>Payments</b> in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 mandated that preferential creditors (employees, liquidator expenses and taxes at the time) also had priority over the holder of a floating charge (now IA 1986 section 175). In the Enterprise Act 2002 a further major change was to create a ring-fenced fund for all unsecured creditors out of around 20 per cent of the assets subject to a floating charge. At the same time, the priority for taxpayers' claims was abolished. Since then, debate for further reform has shifted to whether the floating charge should be abolished altogether and whether a ring-fenced fund should be taken from fixed security interests. The second major area for reform was to facilitate the rescue of businesses that could still be viable. Following the Cork Report in 1982, the Insolvency Act 1986 created the administration procedure, requiring (on paper) that the managers of insolvent businesses would attempt rescue the company, and would act in all creditors' interests. After the Enterprise Act 2002 this almost wholly replaced the receivership rules by which secured creditors, with a floating charge over all assets, could run an insolvent company without regard to the claims of unsecured creditors. The third area of reform concerned accountability for people who worsened or benefited from insolvencies. As recommended by the Cork Report, the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 meant directors who breached company law duties, or committed fraud could be prevented from working as directors for up to 15 years. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 created liability for wrongful trading. If directors failed to start the insolvency procedures when they ought to have known insolvency was inevitable, they would {{have to pay for the}} additional debts run up through prolonged trading. Furthermore, the provisions on fraudulent conveyances were extended, so that any transaction at an undervalue or other preference (without any bad intent) could be avoided, and unwound by an insolvent company.|$|R
40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for upstream manufacturers to make payments to downstream firms in order to obtain <b>preferential</b> treatment. These <b>payments</b> may generally be called “consideration payments. ” Examples of this include the slotting allowance payments often discussed in the grocery, pharmaceutical, and consumer electronics industries. Payola in the radio industry shares many of the same characteristics as slotting allowances. The prohibition of radio payola in 1960 gives us an opportunity to empirically examine the effect that these payments had on the record labels using them and on overall product variety. We construct a unique variety measure based on the musical styles of Billboard chart artists and supplement this with information on radio airplay from Billboard charts to evaluate the effects of payola. We find that the prohibition of payola reduced musical variety and overall record sales, but may have helped increase access for smaller record labels. These findings support the theory that payola payments, which may impose a non-trivial financial burden on the record label, serve to reduce the radio station’s risk.

40|$|The thesis {{covers the}} topic of {{criminal}} implications managing a company crisis and is focused on inspecting connections between traditional criminal offences expected by Regio Decreto n. 267 / 1942 and the new alternative solutions to bankruptcy generated by civil section of bankruptcy law’s last reforms, i. e. new “concordato preventivo” (art. 160 l. f.), “accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti” (art. 182 -bis l. f.) and “piano attestato di risanamento” (art. 67, comma 3, lett. d) l. f.). 	In recent years, to increase indeed the intended-to-overcome-bankruptcy-crisis agreement instruments’ appeal, the Legislator worked for a substantial modification of original bankruptcy law fundamentals. 	From this didn’t ensue however a corresponding coordinating process between renewed institutes and traditional criminal disposals. As {{a result of this}} an obvious imbalance between aforementioned institutes arose, thus lacking the parallelism that conveniently marked the birth of 1942 bankruptcy law, which – as stated by best legisltory politic’s practice - punished criminal behavior enacted within the range of liquidatory or based-on-agreements instruments of before-mentioned civil section. 	After an analysis on bankruptcy law’s evolutionary path from 1942 to this day - in a way that outlines the current shape of institutes whose purpose lies in regulating the timing of company crisis and seizing the evolution of legal protection guidelines emerged around recent reforms - the research mostly expands along two paths. 	The first considers the issues about the chance that behaviors performed in accordance with new civil instruments available to the entrepreneur in trouble could be punished by usual criminal offence - i. e. different kinds of bankruptcy, kept unaltered - in the unfortunate chance that the company’s rescue plan wouldn’t succeed. 	For this eventuality to be avoided, along with law n. 122 / 2010 converting d. l. n. 8 / 2010, art. 217 bis regarding bankruptcy frauds, indexed “Esenzione dai reati di Bancarotta”, was introduced. 	Such norm, clearly born with the purpose of assuring protection, even from a criminal point of view, to the entrepreneur making <b>preferential</b> <b>payments</b> only to a subset of his debtors in accordance with an agreed plan, carries a set of issues, first and foremost its dogmatic characterization and actual range of implementation, that casts doubt on the norm’s adequacy to settle all existing critical matters. 	On the other hand, the second research path inspects the Professional Attestator’s criminal responsibility. This figure - present with different characterizations in all three institutes of agreement introduced - constitutes a significant novelty, given the characteristic role it conducts during the delicate phase of company crisis resolution. 	In short summary the Legislator assigned to the aforementioned Professional the power to judge rightness and feasibility of the plan arranged unilaterally by the entrepreneur or agreed upon by his debtors. Such crucial topic, traditionally belonging to bankruptcy court’s competence - due to obvious interest implied in such inspection - is assigned now to a private individual of entrepreneur’s choice, in order to speed up the process of moving forward to a fruitful crisis’s resolution. 	About this issue the introduction by d. l. n. 83 / 2012 of a new norm, art. 236 bis l. fall. (“Falso in attestazioni e relazioni”), punishing exposition of false information or omission of relevant information by Professional Attestators in charge of redacting programs and guaranteeing economic and patrimonial firmness of plans. 	This work moreover takes account of consequences derived by the new concordato preventivo structure as opposed to the unaltered criminal offence of art. 236 l. fall., the only one directly focused on safeguard of instruments alternative to bankruptcy. On a broader level, with regard to the results of these and other hermeneutic topics, the research exposes a general view on the new balance between the two sections of bankruptcy law, especially with reference to the new legal goods upheld by Bankruptcy law, where a substantial constriction of the traditional principle of par condicio creditorum can be perceived, on behalf of the need of protecting “company value”...|$|R
