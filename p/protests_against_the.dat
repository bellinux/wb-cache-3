5|$|Parts of the Icelandic public have {{arranged}} <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Central Bank, the Parliament and the government's alleged lack of responsibility {{before and after}} the crisis, attracting between 3000 and 6000 people (1–2% of Iceland's population) on Saturdays.|$|E
5|$|Euskadiko Ezkerra, the Communist Party of Spain and the People's Alliance also issued {{statements}} {{condemning the}} attack. Herri Batasuna organised numerous <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> incident, which at times resulted in street violence and arrests. They also organised {{a general strike}} in the Basque Country, though observance of this was limited to San Sebastián and the home towns of those killed.|$|E
50|$|Thousands of Lebanese took to <b>the</b> {{streets to}} <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sectarian {{nature of the}} {{governing}} system. This was <b>the</b> third <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sectarian political system.|$|R

25|$|In East Germany, <b>protesting</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{state was}} often prohibited. Despite this, the song Ermutigung by Wolf Biermann became a widely popular <b>protest</b> song <b>against</b> <b>the</b> SPU government.|$|R
5|$|Gambira {{first became}} {{well known in}} August 2007 during {{widespread}} <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the military government which had ruled the country since suppressing the previous uprising in 1988. The protests were sparked when the SPDC cut fuel subsidies without warning, causing fuel and other commodity prices to suddenly rise.|$|E
5|$|He {{entered the}} Imperial University of Warsaw in 1902, but was soon {{expelled}} after {{taking part in}} <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Russian administration's curtailment of student rights. Threatened with conscription into the Imperial Russian Army, he chose to emigrate and in early 1904 left Warsaw for Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I, popular <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> electoral law discriminating against Poles led to new elections in 1918, in which 521 deputies were elected in the Grand Duchy; that Sejm would support {{the integration of the}} Grand Duchy territories to the newly formed Second Polish Republic.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, {{the generous}} donativum {{bestowed}} upon the soldiers following his accession {{was expected to}} swiftly silence any <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> violent regime change. The Praetorians considered these measures insufficient, however, and demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Continued dissatisfaction with {{this state of affairs}} would ultimately lead to the gravest crisis of Nerva's reign.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{completion}} of the M3 had been ongoing since 1973, {{with the formation of}} the M3 Joint Action Group by David Pare. The group gathered together a petition of 19,000, of which 11,227 were Winchester residents. The group was also active in distributing leaflets to the local community.|$|E
5|$|The second Egyptian {{attempt was}} the last; the Port Said Sector did not launch another attack {{to capture the}} fort. Thus Budapest {{remained}} the only Israeli fortification of the Bar Lev Line to remain under Israeli control. Four months after the Yom Kippur War, Captain Motti Ashkenazi, the commander of Fort Budapest, led the <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Israeli government's handling of the war.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of President Nixon's law-and-order philosophies, Nunn called out the National Guard {{to break up}} violent protests in the state. In May 1968, he sent the Guard to Louisville to break up race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations. The latter protest culminated in the burning {{of one of the}} university's ROTC buildings.|$|E
5|$|Africans who did {{not have}} the right to vote after the South African War protested racial {{discrimination}} on 16 December 1910. Other <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> government dealing with racial discrimination continued to be held on 16 December. In 1929, 1930 and 1934, anti-pass demonstrations were held by the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) on that day. The All African Convention (AAC) was held during the same time in 1935, covering dates 15 December through 18 December.|$|E
5|$|Students {{across the}} nation protested the Vietnam War, {{including}} at similar {{institutions such as the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where students picketed and blocked access to the Draper Laboratory that was producing guidance systems for the Poseidon missile. While The Technique did publish editorials against the United States' involvement, the Student Council easily defeated a bill endorsing the Vietnam Moratorium in the fall of 1969. There were significant protests at other institutions that conducted military research, but there were no <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> military electronics research at the Georgia Tech Research Institute.|$|E

5|$|The deaths led {{to public}} {{mourning}} and <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Provisional IRA. Pressure to act precipitated a political crisis {{for the government}} of Northern Ireland, {{which led to the}} resignation of Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Chichester-Clark. The British Army raised the minimum age needed to serve in Northern Ireland to 18 in response to this incident. In 2010 a memorial was dedicated to the three soldiers near to where they were killed in north Belfast.|$|E
5|$|This design {{replaced}} the historical white-red-white flag {{used by the}} Belarusian People's Republic of 1918, before Belarus became a Soviet Republic, and again after it regained its independence in 1991. Opposition groups have continued to use this flag, though its display in Belarus has been restricted {{by the government of}} Belarus, which claims it was linked with Nazi collaboration during the Second World War. The white-red-white flag is used in <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> government and by the Belarusian diaspora.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{also served}} as a focal point for <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman {{occupation}} of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops {{in the vicinity of the}} mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In one instance, in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.|$|E

50|$|After {{the passage}} of the Canon 28, Rome filed a <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{reduction}} of honor given to Antioch and Alexandria. However, fearing that withholding Rome's approval would be interpreted as a rejection of the entire council, in 453 the pope confirmed the council's canons with a <b>protest</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> 28th.|$|R
5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} {{the construction of an}} airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid to rest in the early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Reich {{bought an}} {{oscillograph}} and attached it {{to friends and}} students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, {{he was married to}} Reich's secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Nazis. Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with the permission of the hospital's director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in Experimentelle Ergebniße Über Die Elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und Angst (The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety).|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Williamson {{was murdered}} in his {{apartment}} by an acquaintance, Dwight Hayden, whom he had been aiding with financial handouts. Police believed that Hayden's motive was robbery, although J-FLAG also suggested that homophobia {{may have played a}} part in the killing. Hayden was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. Upon learning of the murder, a crowd assembled in New Kingston to celebrate Williamson's death, chanting homophobic slogans and lyrics. Conversely, the Jamaican LGBT community held a secret memorial for him, while <b>protests</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> killing were held by LGBT rights groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
