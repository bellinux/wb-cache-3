40|$|Ten epidemiologically {{unrelated}} Staphylococcus aureus isolates with borderline {{levels of}} susceptibility to antistaphylococcal penicillinase-resistant penicillins (PRPs) were investigated together with appropriate S. aureus control strains. By a nitrocefin microplate assay, all borderline PRP-susceptible <b>test</b> <b>strains</b> {{were found to}} produce comparable amounts of beta-lactamase. Hydrolytic activity against another chromogenic substrate (PADAC) and against the PRPs was also demonstrated in membrane preparations from induced cells of 9 of the 10 borderline <b>test</b> <b>strains.</b> When bacterial membranes were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two methicillin-inducible bands of about 32 and 31 kDa were detected, after Coomassie blue staining, in the membrane protein patterns of the same nine borderline <b>test</b> <b>strains.</b> By gel renaturation and zymographic detection of beta-lactamase activity, both methicillin-inducible membrane proteins were detected with nitrocefin as a substrate, whereas only one band (presumably the smaller protein) was detected with PADAC. With the remaining borderline <b>test</b> <b>strain</b> (a 40), only the larger band was detected in the renatured gels with nitrocefin as a substrate. Plasmid DNA analysis revealed that the borderline susceptible <b>test</b> <b>strains,</b> again {{with the exception of}} a 40, shared a 17. 2 -kb plasmid yielding four HindIII fragments of 7. 0, 5. 3, 3. 5, and 1. 4 kb.

Five other S. aureus strains, belonging to phage group 94 / 96, were found to display the borderline phenotype, including such distinguishing features as the membrane-associated PRP- and PADAC-hydrolyzing activity, the two methicillin-inducible membrane proteins, and the 17. 2 -kb plasmid. These results suggest that borderline susceptible S. aureus strains share more common features than reduced susceptibility to PRPs...|$|R

40|$|While mat A and mat a wild types {{or other}} fertile strains of known mating type {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the mating type of segregants or newly acquired strains, the highly fertile aconidiate mutant fluffy (fl) is superior to wild type when used as the female <b>parent</b> in <b>tests.</b> fluffy <b>strains</b> form abundant perithecia more quickly and the perithecia are more readily observed, especially in small slants where wild type strains produce overlying macroconidia that may obscure perithecia and ascospores. Absence of macroconidia in fertilized fluffy cultures permits ejected ascospores to be shot to an opposing surface without interference. The usefulness of fluffy testers is not limited to determining mating type. They have been important mainly in two categories of experiments [...] those that require examining the unordered asci and ascospores that are ejected from the perithecium, and those that involve determining whether perithecia are fertile or barren (Perkins et al. 1989). Using fluffy testers to observe the presence and patterns of mutant or aborted ascospores has expedited the detection and diagnosis of chromosome rearrangements (Perkins 1974) and of Spore killer elements (Turner and Perkins 1993). fluffy testers have been used to study mutations that are expressed in the sexual phase (e. g. per- 1, Perkins 1988), to demonstrate the occurrence of barrage reactions (Griffiths 1979, Perkins 1988; see Fig. 37 in Perkins et al. 2001), to show that repeat induced point mutation (RIP) occurs in long segmental duplications (e. g., Perkins et al. 1997), and to examine th...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} by phenotypic and molecular tools the antibiotic resistance profile and the virulence markers of 100 environmental Escherichia coli strains isolated from marine water in Constanta, Romania. The antibiosusceptibility testings were performed by disk diffusion method (CLSI, 201, including the phenotypic screening of beta-lactamases. The presence of different antibiotic resistance markers was correlated with the plasmidial pattern of the analyzed strains. Eleven (11) virulence factors were tested by using specific culture media. PCR was performed for the following antibiotic resistance and virulence genes: sul 1, 2, 3, aggR, EAST- 1, AAFI/II. The <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> exhibited high susceptibility to imipenem, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin (99 %), tobramycin (98 %), cephtazidime (97 %), gentamycin and amikacin (96 %), ciprofloxacin (93 %), nalidixic acid and chloramphenicole (92 %) sulphametoxazole (89 %) and high resistance levels to ampicillin (94 %). The <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> exhibited between 1 and 8 antibioresistance markers, the most frequent associations being: MP+SXT (10 %), AMP+C (9 %), AMP+CIP (8 %) and AMP+NA (7 %). Morevoer, the <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> exhibited tolerance to heavy metals, i. e. to Zn (72 %), Mn (98 %), Cu (98 %), Co (95 %), and Ni (99 %). 43, 6 % strains exhibiting resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics proved to be positive for the presence of beta-lactamases when tested by nitrocephine rapid test. The synergy test was negative for all <b>tested</b> <b>strains.</b> 25 % of the <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> exhibited at least one plasmid with variable molecular weights.

40|$|We {{have shown}} the {{usefulness}} of the heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) for phylogenetic analysis and for the discrimination of closely related Colletotrichum species. Because the heteroduplex mobility of a <b>tested</b> <b>strain</b> shows a unique banding pattern that is the function of the sequence of the referred strain, we further explored the potential use of heteroduplex DNA patterns (HPs) as DNA fingerprints for the identification of these fungi. The 29 Colletotrichum strains previously identified by HMA to be taxonomic members of CG, CA, CM, CC and CL species groups were re-examined with an emphasis on their unique heteroduplex banding patterns. The species attributes of these <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> were characterized by HMA using ITS fragments amplified from six representative Colletotrichum strains as pairwise compared references. By comparing the unique homoduplex and heteroduplex banding patterns of each <b>tested</b> <b>strain</b> on a polyacrylamide gel with those of the respective reference strain, the species identity of <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> was determined. The obtained barcode-like HPs classified these 29 Colletotrichum strains into 6 distinctive groups: CG 1, CG 2, CA, CM, CC and CL. Notably, the HPs differentiated strains CG 1 and CG 2, which differed in their ITS sequences by only six bases. The presented results revealed that the species-characteristic barcode-like HP classification of ITS regions is a relatively rapid and valuable system for species identification of Colletotrichum species. The potential use of the established barcode-like system for the identification of anthracnose fungi and other fungal pathogens is discussed...|$|R

The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the PAEs of the combinations differed from the PAEs of the antibiotics alone. Methods: The PAEs of the combinations of 5 -FU plus meropenem or ciprofloxacin were determined with viable counts against four reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two clinical isolates of S. epidermidis. The results were compared with the PAEs of the antibiotics drugs and 5 -FU alone. The gram-positive <b>strains</b> were <b>tested</b> for slime production, both alone and {{in the presence of}} 5 -FU. Results: Against two of the three <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> of S. epidermidis, the combination of ciprofloxacin and 5 -FU gave a synergistic prolongation of the PAE in comparison with the PAEs induced by the drugs alone. The combinations showed indifference against the other bacteria. The combination of meropenem and 5 -FU had a synergistic PAE against one of the three <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> of S. epidermidis and an additive effect against E coli but showed indifference against the rest of the strains. Conclusions:The presence of 5 -FU did not influence the PAEs of the antibiotics against most of the <b>tested</b> <b>strains,</b> but caused a synergistic prolongation of the PAEs induced by ciprofloxacin and meropenem against some of the <b>tested</b> <b>strains</b> of S. epidermidis. 5 -FU inhibited slime production in the same S. epidermidis strains, which might have contributed to the longer PAE...|$|R

40|$|The {{significance}} of Pseudomonas cepacia as an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients {{has become increasingly}} recognized. Particularly disturbing is its increased incidence, reported by several North American centers, in respiratory tract cultures from patients with cystic fibrosis. Epidemiological studies of P. cepacia have been hampered {{by a lack of}} typing methods. In this paper we report the development of a typing scheme based on bacteriocin production and susceptibility. For bacteriocin production, test isolates of P. cepacia were rapidly applied to the surfaces of agar plates with a multiple inoculator. After incubation of these test isolates for 5. 5 h and their exposure to chloroform, indicator strains were applied in agar overlays without prior removal of the <b>test</b> <b>strain</b> growth. After 18 h of incubation, inhibition zones caused by bacteriocin activity were recognized. A similar procedure was used to examine the bacteriocin susceptibility of the <b>test</b> <b>strain.</b> The bacteriocin type of the <b>test</b> <b>strain</b> was defined based on its bacteriocin production as judged by zones of inhibition against a set of eight indicator strains and by susceptibility or resistance of the <b>test</b> <b>strain</b> to bacteriocin produced by six producer strains. Of 373 strains of P. cepacia, 95. 2 % were typed into a total of 44 type combinations.

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 4 (BoHV- 4) is {{a useful}} model for the human pathogenic gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus. Although genome manipulations of this virus have been greatly facilitated by the cloning of the BoHV- 4 V. <b>test</b> <b>strain</b> as a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC), {{the lack of a}} complete genome sequence for this strain limits its experimental use. Methods In this study, we have determined the complete sequence of BoHV- 4 V. <b>test</b> <b>strain</b> by a pyrosequencing approach. Results The long unique coding region (LUR) consists of 108, 241 bp encoding at least 79 open reading frames and is flanked by several polyrepetitive DNA units (prDNA). As previously suggested, we showed that the prDNA unit located at the left prDNA-LUR junction (prDNA-G) differs from the other prDNA units (prDNA-inner). Namely, the prDNA-G unit lacks the conserved pac- 2 cleavage and packaging signal in its right terminal region. Based on the mechanisms of cleavage and packaging of herpesvirus genomes, this feature implies that only genomes bearing left and right end prDNA units are encapsulated into virions.
