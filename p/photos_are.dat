5|$|The film {{plays out}} with a {{recapitulation}} of a mock Kazakhstan national anthem glorifying the country's potassium resources and its prostitutes as being the second cleanest in the region. The visual melange of Soviet-era <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> mixed with the real flag of Kazakhstan and, incongruously, the final frames show the portrait of Ilham Aliyev, real-life president of Azerbaijan, a country {{that had not been}} otherwise mentioned in the film.|$|E

5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> necessary to complete the journalistic record, and that the photos would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that bin Laden is still alive. Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E

They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop.

When the <b>photos</b> <b>are</b> finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used.

Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy.

Both Sherece and Lauren's <b>photo</b> <b>were</b> criticized for not being alive in their <b>photo,</b> while Holly <b>was</b> praised for her face, {{but the rest of}} her <b>photo</b> <b>was</b> a disaster. Abigail and Dani ended up in bottom two, and Abigail was saved from elimination due to her good posture and is deemed to having more potential. Dani was eliminated because of her lack of personality in the photo shoot and the judges belief that she wasn't working hard enough.|$|R

In-tank <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> acquired for Tanks BX 111 and T 111. The BX 111 <b>photos</b> <b>were</b> used to create the waste surface map and to measure the waste surface elevation.
