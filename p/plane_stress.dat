40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} is {{dependent}} on material properties and loading parameters. Critical areas of industrial components are often subjected to complex stresses, either because multiaxial loads are applied or because residual stresses {{are present in the}} material. In <b>plane</b> <b>stresses</b> are taken into account through mode I, II and III stress intensity factors. Out of <b>plane</b> <b>stresses</b> are usually not included in fatigue crack growth models. However, experimental evidences of the influence of out-of <b>plane</b> <b>stresses</b> on fatigue crack growth are reported in the literature. This paper is centered {{on the role of the}} T-stress during mode I fatigue crack growth. The effect of a T-stress on fatigue crack growth is studied through its effect on crack tip blunting. As a matter of fact, fatigue crack growth is characterized by the presence of striations on the fracture surface, which implies that the crack grows by a mechanism of blunting and re-sharpening. From a mechanical point of view, this means that forward and reverse plasticity occurs within the crack tip plastic zone. The presence of a T-stress modifies significantly the evolution of plastic deformation at crack tip and thus plastic blunting. In the present study, crack tip blunting is a global scalar variable, which is calculated using the finite element method as the average value of the permanent displacement of the crack faces over the whole K-dominance area. Experimental measurements have also been conducted using cross-correlation of image...|$|R

2500|$|Consider {{the case}} of a thin, solid, parallel-sided {{rotating}} disc of axial thickness t (L) and radius R (L). [...] The disc has a density ρ (M/L3), rotates at an angular velocity ω (T−1) and this leads to a stress S (MT−1 in the material. [...] There is a theoretical linear elastic solution, given by Lame, to this problem when the disc is thin relative to its radius, the faces of the disc are free to move axially, and the <b>plane</b> <b>stress</b> constitutive relations can be assumed to be valid. [...] As the disc becomes thicker relative to the radius then the <b>plane</b> <b>stress</b> solution breaks down. [...] If the disc is restrained axially on its free faces then a state of plane strain will occur. [...] However, if {{this is not the case}} then the state of stress may only be determined though consideration of three-dimensional elasticity and there is no known theoretical solution for this case. [...] An engineer might, therefore, be interested in establishing a relationship between the five variables. [...] Dimensional analysis for this case leads to the following (5−3=2) non-dimensional groups: ...|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to study {{at the same time}} the {{dynamics}} of wave propagation in plane and axisymmetric plates by finite-difference numerical calculation and by the method of dynamic photoelasticity. In many cases it is possible to carry out the investigation of the dynamic stressed state of solid structures under the impact of seismic waves in plane statement, observing the foundation and the building itself in the conditions of plane deformation. Such problems in structural mechanics are usually investigated on plates providing the conditions of generalized <b>plane</b> <b>stressed</b> condition and accounting for the necessity of the known substitution of elastic constants. In case of applying the model of generalized <b>plane</b> <b>stressed</b> state for investigating two-dimensional waves’ propagation in three-dimensional elastic medium it may be necessary to observe certain additional conditions, which for example limit the class of external impacts of high frequencies (short waves). The use of candling for wave recording in plane models explored with the method of dynamic photoelasticity in the observed cases of impulse loading of the plates with finite thickness gives satisfactory results...|$|R

2500|$|Tensile {{strength}} {{represents the}} ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress. [...] Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94. [...] The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens. [...] Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions. [...] During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained. [...] The multiaxial tensile test provides a <b>plane</b> <b>stress</b> boundary condition {{at the edges of}} the sample. [...] A typical range of tensile strengths in the machine direction are from 225 to 245lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.|$|E

40|$|The acoustoelastic {{technique}} for the nondestructive evaluation of stress {{is based on}} the stress-induced changes in the speed of wave propagation. In the application of acoustoelasticity, three different approaches have been adopted. For the sake of discussion, we will consider the case of a <b>plane</b> state of <b>stress</b> in an initially isotropic material. The most common technique uses shear waves propagating normal to the <b>plane</b> of <b>stress</b> [1, 2]. This technique takes advantage of the stress-induced birefringence of the shear waves which, in the case considered, is proportional to the difference in the principal stresses. Another technique which is currently receiving considerable attention involves two shear-horizontal (SH) waves propagating in the principal stress directions, with their polarizations in the other principal direction [3 – 5]. In this approach, the difference in the speeds of the two SH waves can be related to the difference in principal stresses directly. Knowledge of the material’s elastic or acoustoelastic constants is not required. The final approach uses a single longitudinal wave propagating perpendicular to the <b>plane</b> of <b>stress,</b> with the change in the speed of this wave being proportional to the sum of the principal stresses [6, 7]...|$|R
