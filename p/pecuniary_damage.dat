60|$|WONDERFUL DISCOVERY--Some {{six months}} ago Signor John Smitthe, an American gentleman now some years a {{resident}} of Rome, purchased for a trifle {{a small piece of}} ground in the Campagna, just beyond the tomb of the Scipio family, from the owner, a bankrupt relative of the Princess Borghese. Mr. Smitthe afterward went to the Minister of the Public Records and had the piece of ground transferred to a poor American artist named George Arnold, explaining that he did it as payment and satisfaction for <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage</b> accidentally done by him long since upon property belonging to Signor Arnold, and further observed that he would make additional satisfaction by improving the ground for Signor A., at his own charge and cost. Four weeks ago, while making some necessary excavations upon the property, Signor Smitthe unearthed the most remarkable ancient statue that has ever been added to the opulent art treasures of Rome. It was an exquisite figure of a woman, and though sadly stained by the soil and the mold of ages, no eye can look unmoved upon its ravishing beauty. The nose, the left leg from the knee down, an ear, and also the toes of the right foot and two fingers of one of the hands were gone, but otherwise the noble figure was in a remarkable state of preservation. The government at once took military possession of the statue, and appointed a commission of art-critics, antiquaries, and cardinal princes of the church to assess its value and determine the remuneration that must go to the owner of the ground in which it was found. The whole affair was kept a profound secret until last night. In the mean time the commission sat with closed doors and deliberated. Last night they decided unanimously that the statue is a Venus, and the work of some unknown but sublimely gifted artist of the third century before Christ. They consider it the most faultless work of art the world has any knowledge of.|$|E
6000|$|It is of importance, {{especially}} considering the part which {{what are called}} the [...] "leading minds" [...] of the South are expected to play in reconstruction, to keep clearly before our eyes the motives and {{the manner of the}} Rebellion. Perhaps we should say inducements rather than motives, for of these there was but a single one put forward by the seceding States, namely, the obtaining security, permanence, and extension for the system of slavery. We do not use the qualifying epithet [...] "African," [...] because the franker propagandists of Southern principles affirmed the divine institution of slavery pure and simple, without regard to color or the curse of Canaan. This being the single motive of the Rebellion, what was its real object? Primarily, to possess itself of the government by a sudden coup d'état; or that failing, then, secondarily, by a peaceful secession, which should paralyze the commerce and manufactures of the Free States, to bring them to terms of submission. Whatever may have been the opinion of some of the more far-sighted, it is clear that a vast majority of the Southern people, including their public men, believed that their revolution would be peaceful. Their inducements to moving precisely when they did were several. At home the treasury was empty; faithless ministers had supplied the Southern arsenals with arms, and so disposed the army and navy as to render them useless for any sudden need; but above all, they could reckon on several months of an administration which, if not friendly, was so feeble as to be more dangerous to the country than to its betrayers, and there was a great party at the North hitherto their subservient allies, and now sharing with them in the bitterness of a common political defeat.[8] Abroad there was peace, with the prospect of its continuance; the two great maritime powers were also the great consumers of cotton, were both deadly enemies, like themselves, to the democratic principle, and, if not actively interfering, would at least throw all the moral weight of their sympathy and encouragement on the Southern side. They were not altogether mistaken in their reckoning. The imbecility of Mr. Buchanan bedded the ship of state in an ooze of helpless inaction, where none of her guns could be brought to bear, and whence nothing but the tide of indignation which followed the attack on Sumter could have set her afloat again, while prominent men and journals of the Democratic party hastened to assure the Rebels, not only of approval, but of active physical assistance. England, with indecent eagerness, proclaimed a neutrality which secured belligerent rights to a conspiracy that was never to become a nation, and thus enabled members of Parliament to fit out privateers to prey with impunity on the commerce of a friendly power. The wily Napoleon followed, after an interval long enough to throw all responsibility for the measure, and to direct all the natural irritation it excited in this country, upon his neighbor over the way. England is now endeavoring to evade the consequences of her hasty proclamation and her jaunty indifference to the enforcement of it upon her own subjects. The principle of international law involved is a most important one; but it was not so much the act itself, or the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage</b> resulting from it, as the animus that so plainly prompted it, which Americans find it hard to forgive.|$|E

50|$|Sir:I {{have the}} honor {{to report that}} in {{obedience}} to your order, and with the means and equipment furnished me by you, I left this city on the 26th of July last, for {{the line of the}} James River, to operate with the Horological Torpedo against the enemy’s vessels navigating that river. I had with me Mr. R. K. Dillard, who was well acquainted with the localities, and whose service I engaged for the expedition. On arriving in Isle of Wright County, on the 2nd of August, we learned of immense supplies of stores being landed at City Point, and for the purpose, by stratagem, of introducing our machine upon the vessels there discharging stores, started for that point. We reached there before daybreak on the 9th of August last, {{with a small amount of}} provisions, having traveled mostly by night and crawled upon our knees to pass the East picket line. Requesting my companion to remain behind about half a mile, I approached cautiously the wharf with my machine and powder covered by a small box.Finding the captain had come ashore from a barge then at the wharf, I seized the occasion to hurry forward with my box. Being halted by one of the wharf sentinels, I succeeded in passing him by representing that captain had ordered me to convey the box on board. Hailing a man from the barge, I put the machine in motion and gave it in his charge. He carried it aboard. The magazine contained about twelve pounds of powder. Rejoining my companion, we retired to a safe distance to witness the effect of our effort. In about an hour the explosion occurred. Its effect was communicated to another barge beyond the one operated upon and also to a large wharf building containing their stores (enemy’s), which was totally destroyed. The scene was terrific, and the effect deafened my companion to an extent from which he has not recovered. My own person was severely shocked, but I am thankful to Providence that we have both escaped without lasting injury. We obtained and refer you to the enclosed slips from the enemy’s newspapers, which afford their testimony of the terrible effects of this blow. The enemy estimates the loss of life at 58 killed and 126 wounded, but we have reason to believe it greatly exceeded that. The <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage</b> we heard estimated at $4,000,000 but, of course, we can give you no account of the extent of it exactly.|$|E

40|$|Introduction__ Imagine the {{following}} example. A {{woman has a}} job interview and is turned down because ulti-mately the employer prefers a man for the position. The woman goes to court to seek justice. The court in fact does allow the woman’s claim {{because there is a}} substantive rule of equal op-portunity in private law forbidding gender discrimination in employment contracts. According to the private law system that the court had to apply, the appropriate remedy is compensation for damage. However, as there was no contract between the woman and the employer, in effect the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage</b> that the woman suffered were the travel expenses she made {{in order to get to}} the job interview. That was all she got compensated for. This is a silly example of a case in which the substantive rule, which aimed at preventing gender discrimination, was defeated by an inefficacious enforcement instrument. It is obvious that if pri-vate law rules aim at preventing a wrong, then the remedy should at least aspire to have a pre-ventive effect. So, this example sounds like a bad joke about lawyers. In fact, the joke gets worse...|$|E

Kai kuriose Europos Sąjungos šalyse, pavyzdžiui, Vokietijoje, Olandijoje, Prancūzijoje, Portugalijoje ir Lenkijoje, teisė į neturtinės žalos atlyginimą yra paveldima, o Lietuvos Respublikoje taikoma teisės praktika ir doktrina aiškiai ir tiksliai neatsako į klausimą ar asmens teisė į neturtinės žalos atlyginimą yra pereinama paveldėjimo būdu. Vieninteliame Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucinio teismo 2006 m. rugpjūčio 19 d. priimtame nutarime aiškinama, kad neturtinė žala, atsiradusi dėl neteisėtų valstybės institucijų pareigūnų veiksmų, kurių pasekoje nukentėjusysis mirė, turi būti paveldima jo įpėdinių. Tačiau šis nutarimas apsistojęs ties valstybės institucijų pareigūnų padarytos neturtinės žalos paveldėjimu ir plačiau neaiškina, ar ta pačia taisykle galima vadovautis siekiant gauti nukentėjusiojo asmens iki mirties patirtos neturtinės žalos, kuri buvo padaryta kito asmenes, kuris nėra valstybės institucijos pareigūnas, atlyginimą. Magistro baigiamąjį darbą sudaro trys dalys. Pirmojoje dalyje analizuojama neturtinės žalos samprata, jos atlyginimo funkcijos ir esmė. Aiškinamasi, kokiais atvejais ir kam yra atlyginama neturtinė žala, kai asmuo dėl neteisėtų veiksmų, nukreiptų prieš jo turtines ir neturtines teises, mirė.

Trečioji darbo dalis skirta, naudojant lyginamąjį bei kritinį metodus, išsiaiškinti, ar asmens neturtinė žala gali būti pereinama paveldėjimo būdu.

This Master's {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to analyze whether the legal system of the Republic of Lithuania has formulated a possibility to inherit a person's right to receive compensation of non-pecuniary damages. In the majority of European countries this right is possible but the legal system of the Republic of Lithuania does not clearly and accurately answer the question whether {{it is possible to}} inherit a person‘s right to receive compensation of non-pecuniary damages. In the sole ruling of The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania there is an explanation that the non-pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful actions of officers of public institutions which have resulted in the death of a victim must be inherited by successors of a victim. However, this ruling is stuck at the compensation of the damage caused by the officers of public institutions and there is no further explanation wheter it is possible to use the same ruling to receive a compensation of damage which was caused by a person who is not an officer of public institutions. This Master's thesis consists of three parts. The first part analyzes the concept of non-pecuniary damage, the functions of compensation and it‘s essence. It is examined in which circumstances and to whom the compensation of non-pecuniary damage is being given if the person has died because of the unlawful actions, directed against their pecuniar and non-pecuniar rights. The circle of individuals, who may receive the non-pecuniary damage compensation in case of death of a relative is discussed, too. The second part discusses essential legal relationships of inheritance and also the structure of a property that may be the object of inheritance is being reviewed. The third part is devoted to the use of comparative and critical approaches to find out whether a person‘s non-pecuniary damage could be inherited. There are also basic rules extracted under which the right of inheritance seems impossible. However, with help of a critical method, contrary arguments of the authors and a legal doctrine, which presuppose the possibility to inherit this right, are being presented. The hypothesis that a person‘s right to receive a compensation of non – pecuniary damages may be inherited is being tested in this Master‘s thesis. The aim of this Master‘s thesis is to find out whether the compensation of non – pecuniary damages can be taken over by inheritance. The method of analyzing academic sources, legislations and court jurisprudences is being used to answer the question. These objectives were brought up in order to fulfill the aim of this Master‘s thesis: •	to disclose the content of compensation of non – <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage</b> and to distinguish subjects who have the right to receive a compensation of non – pecuniary damage; •	to analyze the compensatory function and the main function of compensation of non – <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage</b> in order to find out whether the compensation of non – pecuniary damages can be taken over by inheritance; •	to present the main principles and the essence of inheritance of non – pecuniary damage; •	to divide the arguments that were found in a court practice and in scientific sources into two groups: the group that supports the hyptothesis and the group that denies it; •	to criticise both the rebutting and the supporting arguments that were presented in this thesis.; •	to analyze the court practice and scientific sources in order to find out whether the right to inherit a non – <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage</b> can be included into the structure of the inherited property. In order to implement the aims and objectives and to solve the issue that was brought up in this Master‘s thesis, the analysis comparison method was used on court practice, scientific sources and legislations. The analysis showed that the hypothesis, which was raised in the beggining of the analysis of the question, has been confirmed and this means that a person‘s right to receive a compensation of non-pecuniary damage can be inherited...|$|E
40|$|Technology killed slander. Slander, the tort of {{defamation}} by spoken word, {{dates back}} to the ecclesiastical law of the Middle Ages and its determination that damning someone’s reputation in the village square was worthy of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damage.</b> Communication in the Twitter Age has torn asunder the traditional notions of person-to-person communication. Text messaging, tweeting and other new channels of personal exchange have led one of our oldest torts to its historic demise. At common law, slander was reserved for defamation by speech; libel was actionable for the printed word. This distinction between libel and slander, however, rests on a historical reality that is no longer accurate. Originally, permanence and breadth of dissemination always coincided. Slander carried only as far as one’s voice. Because of slander’s presumed evanescence, common law required plaintiffs to plead special damages—proof of economic harm—in order to recover for slander. The advent of broadcast technology, with its ability to amplify the spoken word, challenged the traditional division of defamation and forced courts and legislatures to reconsider old classifications. Jurisdictions split in their decision to characterize broadcast speech as libel or slander, largely because of divergent views about which aspect of the speech—permanence or breadth of dissemination—was more important. Post-broadcast technology has further complicated the defamation arena, leaving parties unsure of how best to plead their defamation case. In the past decade technology has again changed the way we communicate. The digital communication revolution has created instances of widespread dissemination through quick, nonreflective and often passing statements. This past year, for example, Wael Ghonim’s tweet to join him in an Egyptian village square lead to the downfall of Egypt’s political powers. His fleeting comments to those willing to listen caused an entire nation to fall. This Article considers how courts should rule when these tweets, or text messages, not quite printed, not quite spoken, are defamatory. This Article argues that the advent of text messaging, tweeting and other forms of digital communication, which I call “technospeech,” renders the medieval tort of slander irrelevant in today’s technological world. The article provides new support for the contention that courts and legislatures should treat libel and slander uniformly and should abolish the archaic requirement of proof of special damages, a burden traditionally reserved for the spoken word. Maintaining slander in the Twitter Age, with its requirement of proof of economic harm, vitiates the common law purpose of defamation. Treating all defamation similarly promotes fairness for plaintiffs seeking to rehabilitate their damaged reputation and provides predictability to those bringing defamation claims. A thoughtful and orderly treatment of technospeech mandates that courts and legislatures put the proverbial final nail in the coffin of slander...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of wrongful dismissal is the damage sustained by the unlawfully dismissed person. It may occur in two forms: as material damage and as non- non-material damage. In the event of a wrongful termination of employment, material damage is reflected in loss of earnings and other income that could have been received if there had been no wrongful dismissal, as well as in failure to pay contributions for mandatory social insurance. The compensation for material <b>damage</b> (<b>pecuniary</b> <b>damages)</b> for wrongful termination of employment {{is not a matter of}} controversy in Serbian theory and practice. Besides material damage, wrongful dismissal may also cause non-material damage. In the spirit of Serbian law, it may be reflected in sustained mental pain (for the violation of dignity and reputation, and/or violation of one's personality rights) and sustained fear. The right to claim compensation for non-material damage (non-pecuniary damages) is a subject matter of debate particularly in legal practice. The major issue of dispute in wrongful dismissal cases is the question whether it is necessary to award non-pecuniary damages for sustained mental pain or distress (in addition to <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damages),</b> or whether the rendered court decision (establishing that the dismissal has been wrongful and that the employee shall return to work) is a sufficient satisfaction. Inter alia, the same question has been posed in respect of the cases involving the unlawfully dismissed judges and prosecutors. The authors advocate the standpoint that a wrongful act cannot be fully remedied in all cases only by awarding declaratory relief and returning the employee to work. Hence, non-pecuniary damages should be awarded as compensation for non-material damage caused by wrongful termination or dismissal whenever it is justified by the circumstances of the case...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} determining the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>damages</b> in personal injury litigation is to discount future wages to present value using a discount rate {{based on current}} or historic interest rates on Treasury securities. In addition to overcompensating the plaintiff by providing a set of choices that could not otherwise be obtained in a world characterized by imperfect and incomplete capital markets, the degree of overcompensation is even greater when valuing employer contributions to a retirement program. This is the result of: (a) the restrictive nature of qualified retirement plans that greatly reduce their liquity; (b) the retirement fund may be invested in risky assets; and (c) the portfolio of assets may not meet the Markowitz efficiency standard. Two major themes are developed. First an analysis is made of the welfare gains to an individual who is awarded a large sum to replace future employee retirement contributions {{as a result of}} being able to access the capital market and to choose an efficient portfolio. Second, an analysis is made of the gains from being able to reallocate consumption intertemporally. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{light of}} the fact that dentists may be held civilly liable for their practice, it is {{important}} to understand the current situation of lawsuits filed against these professionals by studying current legal decisions and the literature. The objective of this study was to analyze the case law of the Court of Justice of São Paulo, Brazil, relative to the profile of patients and professionals, the most commonly involved specialties, the amounts litigated and the court decisions pertaining to civil liability lawsuits against dentists. In an inductive approach, a single researcher screened and collected civil liability rulings by accessing the Court’s website, and following a statistical-descriptive procedure and an indirect observation technique. The most frequently involved specialty was prosthodontics. However, oral and maxillofacial surgery was related to a higher incidence of damages awarded to settle claims and to higher damage amounts. The dentist was found guilty in 44. 32 % of the cases researched. <b>Pecuniary</b> <b>damages</b> ranged between R$ 485. 50 and R$ 12, 530. 00, and non-pecuniary damages ranged between R$ 2, 500. 00 and R$ 70, 000. 00. Most lawsuits were filed by women against male dentists. An increase in the relative number of lawsuits against companies versus individuals was observed...|$|R
