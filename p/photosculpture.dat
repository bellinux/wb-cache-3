5000|$|... 2003 {{marked the}} launch of the first in a trilogy of ambitious solo {{exhibitions}} Inez and Vinoodh staged at Matthew Marks in New York, The Now People, which became more radical and experimental in format as they progressed. The first, Part I: Paradise (2003), consisted of three large-scale black and white portraits that alluded to a contemporary Garden of Eden, while the 13 works that made up Part II: Life on Earth (2005) investigated political spiritualism. This show saw Inez and Vinoodh carrying motifs from their commercial imagery into their artwork, both in a vast frieze of images created in collaboration with M/M (Paris) and in the inclusion of several <b>photosculptures</b> drawn from their ongoing collaboration with Inez’s uncle, the esteemed sculptor Eugene van Lamsweerde. This repurposing of existing photographic imagery—whether through graphic innovations such as the 26 letters cut from model portraits to make up the silkscreen poster series created with M/M (Paris), The Alphabet (2001), or by electing to exhibit their imagery in pop cultural forms such as stickers or T-shirts — has become a recurrent strategy in the exhibition presentation of Inez and Vinoodh’s work over the past decade. The third installment of The Now People, Part III: The Women (2008), at the Andreas Grimm Gallery in Munich, Germany, focused on female archetypes. This show featured an installation entitled The Séance; a collection of silk-screened photographs pierced by metal as if to make thoughts, energies and emotions physical and tangible.|$|R

50|$|Szczepanik {{was born}} in the Austrian Partition, in the village of Rudniki near Mościska (now Mostyska, Ukraine) but {{relocated}} as infant with his mother to Zręcin in the industrial region of Krosno, where he grew up. His birthplace was controlled by Austria-Hungary between 1772-1918 after the partitions of Poland. Szczepanik graduated from a teachers' college and {{spent a lot of time}} reading scientific literature and journals. He moved to Vienna after his attempt to advance the Jacquard loom from France (invented in 1801) was rejected by some local weavers for fear of losing business. His knowledge of fabric however, enabled him to create the first ballistic vest using silk. Spanish king Alfonso XIII (who used it in 1901) awarded him an order for its invention. Szczepanik was granted awards by other royal courts. The Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria relieved him of mandatory military service fascinated with <b>photosculpture</b> - known also as photoplastigraphy - introduced to him by Szczepanik. It was based on an idea patented in 1859 by François Willème (1830-1905) for producing portrait sculpture using synchronized photo projections. The Emperor gave him a pair of pistols for that as a souvenir.|$|E
40|$|This thesis essay contextualizes a {{specific}} aspect of my art practice - {{the use of}} the mouth as sculptural tool. It examines the destructive and formative element of the bite exploring this gesture from a physiological, sense-related and art historical perspective. What drives my practice-based research (Borgdorff, Sullivan) is the question of how embodied sensations can be transferred from the mouth to an object. Descriptions of bodily sensations related to the ingestion of food and its rejection (De Beauvoir) and theories of embodied perception (Merleau-Ponty, Grosz) inform my investigation of the biting process. Affect as a liminal space of acting and being acted upon (Seigworth, Gregg) and the relation between sensorial perception and emotions (Highmore) are considered in relation to the mouth. The process of biting and chewing is compared to traditional sculpting techniques such as molding using art historian Georges Didi- Huberman’s analysis of the empreinte [impression] as backdrop. Related to explorations of soft materials and chance (Duchamp, Oppenheim, Benglis), as well as feminist art practices involving the body, I focus on the works Petit Dessert I (1970 - 71) and <b>Photosculptures</b> (1971) by Alina Szapocznikow, The Destruction of the Father (1974) by Louise Bourgeois, and Gnaw (1992) by Janine Antoni to situate my practice within {{a specific}} artistic context. The essay also considers the physical contextualization of the chewed objects within the sculptures through the concept of ‘spitting’. The sculptures represent the liminal position of biting, between destruction and formation, through physical instability and suggestion. Personal, noncommercial use of this item is permitted...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{manufacture}} and test {{a set of}} phase plates for the calibration of ocular aberrometers {{and apply it to}} the calibration of an ocular laser ray tracing aberrometer. METHODS: The set of phase plates is made by a greyscale single-mask <b>photosculpture</b> in photoresist method. Each plate induces a given amount of a particular aberration (Zernike) mode. The set contains two subsets: 1) pure Zernike modes to test the accuracy among different orders (from 3 rd to 7 th, approximately 0. 3 to 0. 4 μm); and 2) plates having different amounts of the same mode, 3 rd order coma ranging from 0. 11 to 0. 47 μm. After manufacturing, the plates were tested twice, as a crosscheck, measuring the aberration pattern of each plate with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and a single-pass Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor. The set was then applied to the calibration of an ocular double-pass laser ray tracing aberrometer. RESULTS: Close agreement was found between the three types of measurement. The maximum difference between Hartmann-Shack and laser ray tracing measurements was 0. 032 μm (ie, approximately λ/ 20, half of the typical measuring error in human eyes). This permitted detection of a small bias in the ocular laser ray tracing aberrometer. CONCLUSIONS: The calibration set may be a powerful tool for the assessment of accuracy and reliability in ocular aberrometry. It discovered a small bias, which is almost impossible to detect when working with human eyes or trial lenses. This type of calibration tool is especially important in ciinical environments.

40|$|When {{matter and}} {{antimatter}} come into contact, they annihilate – disappearing {{in a flash}} of energy, leaving traces, producing new artefacts and ideas. Annihilation Event invites a contrary group of artists, archivists, archaeologists, historians, technical experts and theorists from all over Europe to bring their objects, machines, speculative processes and performances into constellation. Annihilation Event will take place in the Lethaby Gallery at CSM in March 2017. In the lead up to this students and graduates from MA and BA Fine Art at CSM and ENSAV La Cambre, Brussels have been working in research groups on a prototype event. For one day at Tate we will run public workshops and demonstrate processes including casting, photogrammetry, reflectance transformation imaging and virtual reality applications. The Department of Subjective Archaeology will install its offices and participative laboratory. Make your own object to scan or see some curiosities from UAL archives and special collections close up. Bring your subjective archaeological artefacts for replication and analysis. Come and learn: Casting/Ghosting - <b>Photosculpture</b> - Display/Support - Open Lab Schedule 12 noon: General Intro to Annihilation Event, its objects and people: Students from CSM, CCW Digital Derive Group, Winchester School of Art and ENSAV La Cambre Brussels, Andy Jones, Monkton-Up-Wimborne chalk block, Paul Reilly, Digital Old Minster, Pierre Huyghebaert, Waend, Belgian Litho Stone, Naomi Dines, Portolan Map, Anna McSweeney, Papersqueeze, Kate Jarvis, Claudia Zehrt, British Museum, Mick Finch and Johannes von Muller, Bilderfahrzeuge, Jim Thrower, Jean-Pierre Muller, the Printmaking Union, Sion Fletcher, Nelson Crespo, Louisa Minkin, Elizabeth Wright, Nicola Lorini, the Campari Fountain, John Wollaston, Jet Jet, Pete Smithson, Ian Dawson, Assassination Weapon, The Department of Subjective Archaeology, UAL Archives and Special Collections, and other participants.

To {{manufacture}} and test {{a set of}} phase plates for the calibration of ocular aberrometers and eventually to apply it to the calibration of an ocular laser ray tracing aberrometer. Methods.

The calibration set may be a powerful tool for the assessment of accuracy and reliability in ocular aberrometry.
