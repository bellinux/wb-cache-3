He wears huge sabots--no doubt of beechwoods and (as {{fragments of the}} inscription [...] "John Stickells, Iping," [...] show) sacks for socks, and his trousers and jacket are unmistakably cut from {{the remains of a}} gaily <b>patterned</b> <b>carpet.</b> Underneath that there were rude swathings of flannel; five or six yards of flannel are tied comforter-fashion about his neck. The thing on his head is probably another sack. He stares, sometimes smiling, sometimes a little ruefully, at the camera. Even when he was only five years old, one sees that half whimsical wrinkling over his soft brown eyes that characterised his face.|$|E

Originally the Epicurian Room, and renamed the Escoffier Restaurant in 1974, the restaurant originally served classical French cuisine in an old-fashioned formal French dining room. It had French chandeliers, gilded mirrors, <b>patterned</b> <b>carpets,</b> and high-backed chairs. The redesign intended it to now resemble a brasserie, with polished steel lights, smoked-oak floors, and bentwood armchairs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{covers the}} use of monocular vision to control {{autonomous}} navigation for a robot in a dynamically changing environment. The solution focused on using colour segmentation against a selected floor plane to distinctly separate obstacles from traversable space, this is then supplemented with canny edge detection to separate similarly coloured boundaries to the floor plane. The resulting binary map (where white identifies an obstacle-free area and black identifies an obstacle) could then be processed by fuzzy logic or neural networks to control the robot’s next movements. Findings shows that the algorithm performed strongly on solid coloured carpets, wooden and concrete floors but had difficulty in separating colours in multi-coloured floor types such as <b>patterned</b> <b>carpets.</b> ...|$|R

It also has a console-mounted microwave, vertical wave <b>pattern</b> <b>carpeting,</b> [...] "Turntable" [...] seating, a Bose media system, and Around View Monitor.

Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton Carpets were initially produced on 27inch(3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand.

50|$|Hicks's early clients mixed aristocracy, {{media and}} fashion. He did {{projects}} for Vidal Sassoon, Helena Rubinstein, Violet Manners (who became the Duchess of Rutland), Mrs. Condé Nast and Mrs. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. He made carpets for Windsor Castle and decorated the Prince of Wales's first apartment at Buckingham Palace. Hicks started to design <b>patterned</b> <b>carpets</b> and fabrics {{when he found}} none on the market that he considered good enough. These and his hyper-dynamic colour sense {{formed the basis of}} a style which was much admired and copied. In 1967, Hicks began working in the USA, designing apartments in Manhattan for an international clientele, {{and at the same time}} promoting his carpet and fabric collections. Hicks also designed sets for Richard Lester's 1968 movie Petulia, starring Julie Christie.|$|R
