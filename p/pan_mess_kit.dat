50|$|The Australian Army has {{separate}} <b>mess</b> <b>kits</b> {{for summer}} and winter. The summer <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> {{is a white}} jacket, almost identical between different branches of the army. The winter <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> is made of thicker material, with jackets in the colour (scarlet or dark blue) of the wearers' corps. The winter mess dress includes a waistcoat. Both kits have the same barrathea blue trousers, but trousers vary in the colour and width of leg stripe denoting corps. Women's mess attire is the same, except that women wear a skirt instead of trousers. Both versions are worn with a bow tie and white shirt; Marcella for winter and plain for summer.|$|R

As such, it may sacrifice certain features, or use other features to complement it.|$|R
5000|$|They {{were mainly}} used in {{conjunction}} with a folding Esbit stove, which, when folded, could store Esbit pellets and occupy a very small area.

50|$|The U.S. Army's flat ovoid M-1932 wartime-issue <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> {{was made}} of {{galvanized}} steel (stainless steel in the later M-1942), and was a divided pan-and-body system. When opened, the <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> consisted of two halves: the deeper half forms a shallow, flat-bottom, ovoid Meat Can Body, designed to receive the Meat Ration, the meat portion of the prewar canned Reserve Ration. The Meat Can Body, with its folding handle extended, can double as a crude skillet. The <b>Mess</b> <b>Kit</b> Plate (lid) is even more shallow, and is pressed to form two compartments, with a center divide wide enough to accommodate the folding handle. The plate also has a very secure ring that is {{held in place by}} friction.|$|R

50|$|In the Tropics British Army {{officers}} invariably wore white <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> jackets when appropriate. Officers of 7th Gurkha Rifles however, {{always wore}} dark jackets.

50|$|In {{the years}} prior to World War II, two factors {{influenced}} {{the design of the}} U.S. Army's M-1926, M-1932, and M-1942 <b>mess</b> <b>kits.</b> First, unlike most other armies of the day, the U.S. <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> was designed to serve men queuing in feeding lines and served in unit formations from large garrison-type field kitchens when not in actual daily combat operations. Secondly, U.S. soldiers in the field were never expected to either forage or to completely cook their rations, even in daily combat or frontline service. Instead, when not used as a serving tray for company-size or larger units, the <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> was used to re-heat pre-measured servings of the canned Reserve Ration. After 1938, it was used for the new C-ration, a canned combat ration with several menu precooked or dried food items. Today, though canned and dried combat rations have further evolved into the MRE, these can now be self-heated, and thus only a containment tray is required for most units.|$|R
5000|$|During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet army <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> was a two-piece design {{similar to}} that used by the Wehrmacht forces that {{consisted}} of a large main canteen part, and a smaller saucepan component that also doubled as the mess tin lid. The kit also had a wire handle which many soldiers used to hang the <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> from their web equipment or backpack. This design was supplemented in the mid-1980s with a second design that featured a metal water bottle held in the middle. The next layer of the set was a large canteen / cooking pot with a wire handle, then a smaller saucepan-type component with a folding metal handle. This last component fitted over the base of the larger cooking pot, the handle was then folded up and clipped over the cooking pot and the lip of the water bottle. The mess set was sometimes issued with a pouch, although this was by no means certain and many soldiers simply hung it onto their equipment from the wire handle. Officers were often issued a satchel-type bag for their <b>mess</b> <b>kits</b> in keeping with their smart image. This latest design of <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> continues to be used today in the army of the Russian Federation and doubtless [...] is still used in the armies of former Soviet republics.|$|R

When folded, the [...] can be inserted in a fitting slot on the Finnish army <b>mess</b> <b>kit,</b> although this is discouraged because, more often than not, it slips off from the fittings and starts to rattle around. The Finnish army conscripts are allowed to carry their civilian puukkos while in uniform, and everyone is assumed to own one, so a separate knife is not needed.|$|R

50|$|The Swedish (m/42) <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> is a {{complete}} package, similar in design to a German <b>mess</b> <b>kit,</b> but larger. It breaks down into two parts, the first part being a steel stand/windshield/wood-burning stove (with a Svea alcohol burner unit), whilst the other part consists of two pots (usually aluminium). The larger pot has a wire handle, or bail, for suspending over a fire; the smaller has hinged handle. The two pots nest together and stow inside the windshield. The set is completed by a small plastic fuel bottle. It is recommended that the fuel bottle and burner unit be stored separately, outside the pots (since alcohol may otherwise seep out). A Swedish army plastic mug can also be fitted inside the pots.|$|R

50|$|The Swiss <b>mess</b> <b>kit</b> (French gamelle) {{design is}} closer to the Canteen-cup system design: a tall, one liter canteen, with a stove (burns woodchips, etc.) that cups the bottom of the bottle and a cup/pot that goes over the canteen; the cup can fit inside the stove, better heating its contents.|$|R
50|$|The German <b>Mess</b> <b>kit</b> (Essgeschirr) was {{designed}} in 1908. Originally the base held two liters, marked into 1/4 sections, and the lid holding another 1/4.

50|$|The Japanese Army enlisted men's <b>mess</b> <b>kit,</b> or Han gou {{differed}} from other armies' <b>mess</b> <b>kits</b> in several respects. No {{attempt was made}} to conform the Han gou to the Japanese one-liter M-94 oval water bottle, which was larger than that issued to the armies of some other nations. The Han gou consisted of a kidney-shaped, brown-painted, oval-bottom, heavy-gauge aluminum rice cooker pot with lid, containing a soup pot, lid, and tray which stored inside the pot. All of the lids also doubled as serving trays for side dishes of pickled vegetables or other items. With its thick-gauge aluminum construction and individual serving trays, the Han gou was ideal for cooking rice, fish, stews, and vegetables (frequently obtained from local sources). A simplified model, the Ro, was introduced later in the war, which lacked the soup pot insert.|$|R
