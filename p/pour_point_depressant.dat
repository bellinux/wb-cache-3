30|$|The {{base oils}} cannot satisfy all the {{requirements}} of modern engines. Hence, {{a large number of}} functional additives are added to the lube oil to enhance the characteristic properties already present or to impart some new additional properties. Their amount varies from > 1  % to 30  % or more [3]. The lube oil additives commonly used are viscosity modifier (VM) or viscosity index improver [4], <b>pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> (PPD) [5], antioxidant [6, 7], antiwear [8, 9], extreme pressure agent etc. Since multifunctional additives induce more than one of the above performances, research throughout the world is increasingly directed toward producing such type additives. The commercial synthetic acrylate-based additives are non-biodegradable and their widespread use has raised many environmental concerns. Due to increasing environmental pollution the direction towards the development of environmentally benign green polymeric additive in the lubricant chemistry is increasing day by day. There are lots of examples where biodegradable vegetable oils [10, 11, 12] are used for the synthesis of such type of polymeric additives. Sulfurized vegetable oil derivatives are used as lubricating oil additive since long time [13]. The US Patent 4970010 (1990) and 5282989 (1994) disclosed the use of sulfurized vegetable oils as lube oil additive (as extreme pressure and antiwear). Sulfurized vegetable wax esters as an antiwear, friction modifier and extreme pressure additive were described in US pat. No. 4152278. The biodegradable vegetable oil composition for lubricant was disclosed in US Patent 6534454 B 1 in the year 2003. The application of meadowfoam oil and meadowfoam oil derivatives as lubricant additive was claimed in US Patent 4925581 (1990). US Patent 3849323 refers to blended petroleum products for lubrication containing natural oil, such as jojoba oil.

30|$|Lubricating oils {{play a very}} {{important}} role in automobile industry. It keeps the moving parts lubricated and protects them against rust and corrosion. Lubricating oils alone cannot satisfy all the requirements of modern engines. Some additives are to be blended with lube oil to improve the overall performance of the lubricant [1]. The role of additives in lubricant is very significant. They optimize the performance of lubricant and generally fall into two major categories viz. surface active additive and performance enhancing additive [2]. The first one protects the metal surfaces of the engine from corrosion, such as antiwear, anti-rust and extreme pressure additives [3]. The second type reinforces the base stock performance, such as viscosity index improver (VII) [4, 5], <b>pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> (PPD) [6, 7], antioxidant [8], and detergent–dispersant [9]. Generally, in the formulation of a high performance lubricant, different types of additives at different percentages are blended with the base stocks. This increases the overall cost of the furnished lubricant. The addition of additives having multifunctional character to the base fluid may lead to formulate a cost effective as well as better performing lubricant. Therefore, research in this area has attracted much attention. In this work we have synthesized multifunctional additives which showed excellent VII and PPD performances. Lot of works in this direction has carried out so far. Kamal and his group [10] in their work have shown the application of copolymers of vinyl acetate (VA) and esters of acrylic acid as viscosity index improver for lubricating oil. They also studied the rheological properties of lube oil with and without polymeric additives. Al-Sabagh and his group [11] have mentioned the application of copolymers of VA with n-alkyl itaconate as pour point depressants in lubricating oil. The rheological properties were also studied by the same research team. Abdel-Azim et al. [12] has synthesized the copolymers of dialkyl fumarate with vinyl acetate and recognized that the copolymer of didodecyl fumarate with VA is the most effective as PPD for lubricating oil. In 2008, Nassar [13] had prepared six polymers at different molar ratios of 2 -ethylhexyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate and studied the VI property of the lubricants. He reported that most efficient VI property is obtained when the ratio of acrylate and vinyl acetate is 1 : 0.2. The potential application of copolymer of vinyl acetate (VA) as <b>pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> for crude oil is also well documented. VA—α olefin copolymers [14] and VA—methacrylate copolymers [15] were used as <b>pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressant</b> for crude oil. The copolymers of vinyl acetate, styrene and n-butyl acrylate having different monomer ratios were used to study the rheological behaviours of Mexican crude oil [16]. Borthakur and his group [17] have shown the application of alkyl fumarate and vinyl acetate copolymer in combination with alkyl acrylate as a flow improver for high waxy Borholla crude oil. Machado et al. [18] studied the influence of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers on viscosity and pour point of a Brazilian crude oil. Al-Shafy and Ismail prepared an ester of polyethylene acrylic acid with 1 -docosanol and finally it was grafted with vinyl acetate to produce graft ester. The grafted product was used as flow improver for Egyptian waxy crude oils [19].|$|E

For such analysis, n-eicosane (C 20 or CH 3 (CH 2) 18 CH 3), n-tetracosane (C 24 or CH 3 (CH 2) 22 CH 3) and n-hexatriacontane (C 36 or CH 3 (CH 2) 34 CH 3) were used as wax component, with either n-heptane or toluene as the solvent component. It was noticed that the maximum pour point depression efficacy occurs when the PPD polymer solubility temperature is approximately 15  °C lower than the wax solubility temperature, in mixtures containing 20  wt% wax.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the problem of}} paraffin deposition during production, transportation and processing of crude oil and gas condensate. The troublesome paraffin stands for normal hydrocarbons ranging from approximately C 18 -C 38, mixed with small amounts of branched paraffin, monocyclic paraffin, polycyclic paraffin, and aromatics. The amount of paraffin found in crude oils {{as described in the}} literature, varies from less than 1 to more than 50 percent. The solubility of paraffin depends on chemical composition, temperature and pressure. Paraffin precipitates at an equilibrium temperature and pressure defined as the cloud point. The paraffin deposits often begin on surfaces cooler than the liquid. The viscosity is increased by the presence of paraffin crystals and if the temperature is reduced sufficiently, the crude oil/gas condensate will become very viscous(pour point). The crude oil/gas condensate viscosity behaves in a Newtonian manner until wax crystals begin to form and, after lowering the temperature, behaves in a non-Newtonian manner. Many options are available to counter the problems caused by paraffin wax deposition. These include various mechanical, thermal and chemical means (for example, steam heating, blending with lighter cutter stocks and treating with chemical additives). A preferred option would be to use wax modifier additives, commonly known as <b>pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressants.</b> Crystal modifiers are copolymers from these groups: copolymers of ethylene vinyl acetate, poly alpha-olefins, alkyl fumarate- vinyl acetate copolymers of C 18 -through C 22 methacrylates and copolymers of maleic anhydride esters. The mechanism of paraffin deposition and prevention is described. The additives modify {{the size and shape of}} the crystal and inhibit the formation of large wax crystal lattices. With efficient additives, crude oil/gas condensate behaves in a Newtonian manner at low temperature. A section of the paper {{describes the}} influence of chemical structure and molecular weight of the flow improver additives for crude oils and gas condensates prepared by the authors of this review article. The additives are based on methacrylic long chain alkyl ester homopolymers or copolymers with vinyl carboxylic acids or vinyl aromatic monomers. The quality of the prepared additives as <b>pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressants</b> and rheology improvers was proved by applying them to crude oil from INA fields Števkovica, Obod and Deletovci as well as gas condensate fields Molve, Kalinovac, Stari Gradac, Gola, and Hungarian gas condensate field Barcs.

However, it is not adequate to describe the gelling properties of waxy crude oils under flow conditions with gel <b>point</b> or <b>pour</b> <b>point,</b> since the rheological behavior of crude oils is dependent on shear history. Waxy crude oils tend to gel at a low temperature. Based on gelation theory, the characteristic temperature of waxy crude oil was determined by analyzing viscosity-temperature data. Two mathematical models were developed for calculating characteristic temperatures of virgin crude oils and <b>pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressants</b> (PPD) beneficiated crude oils, respectively. By using these two models, the characteristic temperatures of crude oils that have experienced shearing and thermal histories can be predicted. The model for predicting the characteristic temperature of virgin crude oils has an average relative deviation of 4.5 %, and all predicted values have a deviation within 2 °C. Tested by 42 sets of data, the prediction model for crude oil treated with PPD has a high accuracy, with an average relative deviation of 4.2 %, and 95.2 percent of predicted values have a deviation within 2 °C. These two models provide useful ways for predicting the flowability of crude oils in pipelines when only wax content, wax appearance point and gel point are available.|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} or crystallization of wax paraffin from {{crude oils}} {{is one of}} the crucial issues faced in the petroleum industry particularly when the temperature of the crude oil is below the wax appearance temperature (WAT). <b>Pour</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressants</b> (PPDs) chemical is proven to be an efficient way to solve this problem. This study investigated poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate(EVA)) and Poly(maleic anhydride-alt- 1 -octadecene) (MA) polymers inhibitors on the van der Waals intermolecular interaction between the major wax component molecule n-Octacosane C 28 H 58, via molecular dynamics simulation (MD) technique on Material Studio 5. 5 software Package. COMPASS force field was applied to analyse the desired structural property Radial Distribution Function (RDF). The results showed that the radial distribution function and g (r) value shows that is able to give the insight on which particular type of atoms were benefit to inhibit the self-agglomerate of the wax crystal formation. The present of carbonyl oxygen in EVA play a significant role to inhibit the wax formation through the van der Waals interaction between active hydrogen atoms in n-Octacosane molecule. Therefore the chances of wax inhibition in octacosane is less by introduce EVA as inhibitor compare to MA. ...|$|R
