This objective is accomplished by incorporating the functionwhich represents the feature of the watershed surface geometry, which is called the geo-metric <b>pattern</b> <b>function</b> in this study, into the basic equations of the kinematic wave modeland by using the flow-depth relation equation in the field covered with an A-layer. Whenthe watershed surface is linearly diverging or converging, its geometric pattern functionhas linear form, and the numerical simulations only in such a case are given here. If the meaning of the geometric <b>pattern</b> <b>function</b> is extended, that is, if the geometricpattern function is regarded as a new parameter of the kinematic wave model, however,the kinematic wave model with a geometric <b>pattern</b> <b>function</b> becomes very flexible one.

The study was carried out using three factorial experiments. Variables varied on three levels.

Compilation of Pareto effect charts allowed estimation {{of the significance of}} function indexes. Analysis of surface <b>pattern</b> <b>function</b> has revealed the optimal correlation between additive quantity and compaction time, cement quantity and additive quantity, cement quantity and compaction time.

40|$|Spatial qudit {{states can}} be {{realized}} by using multi-slits to discretize the transverse momentum of a photon. The merit {{of this kind of}} spatial qudit states is that the implementation of higher dimensional qudits is relatively easy. As we have recently shown, the quantum states of these spatial qudits can be analyzed by scanning a single interference pattern. This method of single scan tomography can also be applied at higher dimensions, but the reconstruction becomes more sensitive to smaller details of the scanned patterns as the dimensions increase. In this paper, we investigate the effect of finite measurement resolution on the single scan tomography of spatial qutrits. Realistic measurement operators describing the spatial resolution of the measurement are introduced and the corresponding <b>pattern</b> <b>functions</b> for quantum state reconstruction are derived. We use the <b>pattern</b> <b>functions</b> to analyze experimental results for entangled pairs of spatial qutrits generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).

30|$|This {{presentation}} {{proposes to}} formulate the (static) imaging problem in both unfocused and focused cases as a MIMO multirate multidimensional transmission problem. We show how steering at several depths in the focused {{case can be}} interpreted as an induced 4 D MIMO convolution model, subject to standard linear estimation/equalization problems. In the unfocused case, the amount of induced space and time diversity will be the determinant factor for the accuracy in reflectivity estimation. For the focused scenario, the central idea is to perform estimation of the entire object in one shot, once data from all points inside the object have been collected. As an important special case, we consider the single-antenna, free-space, narrowband, far-field scenario. This results in a Toeplitz structured transmission matrices so that when the beam <b>pattern</b> <b>function</b> is separable, efficient superfast estimation receivers based on the known transmitted pulse exist. This has significant impact on all radar-based applications requiring sub-millimeter resolution, which call for efficient receivers in order to cope with the often massive amount of data involved.|$|E
