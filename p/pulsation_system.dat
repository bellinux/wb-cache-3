40|$|High {{frequency}} {{fatigue testing}} always provokes {{questions about whether}} the testing conditions are representative for the real application conditions. Therefore, any influences coming from the testing procedure must be known and understood before relying on the fatigue data based on high frequency testing for component design and validation phases. For this reason and because metastable austenitic steels are well known for their strain rate sensitivity (Müller-Bollenhagen, 2011; Sorich, 2016), the steel AISI 304 and the role of surface micro-defects produced by laser beam cutting were analyzed regarding the influence of load frequency on the cyclic response and fatigue behavior, and the findings of the investigation are thoroughly discussed in this paper. Fatigue tests were performed at load frequencies of 100 Hz and 1000 Hz using two resonance <b>pulsation</b> test <b>systems,</b> as well as by means of a servo-hydraulic test machine at 1 Hz and 50 Hz. All fatigue experiments were performed at tensile-tensile loading condition (R = 0. 1). The cyclic deformation behavior was characterized based on the evaluation of stress-strain hysteresis loops and temperature measurements. The deformation-induced phase transformation from γ-austenite to α′-martensite was globally and locally evaluated by means of magneto-inductive measurements and EBSD analysis, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time it was possible to compare test results generated by a 1000 Hz resonance <b>pulsation</b> test <b>system</b> with results from a conventional resonance test stand cycling at around 100 Hz. The analyses showed that higher amounts of α′-martensite and lower plastic strain amplitudes are observed when the cyclic experiments are carried out at lower frequency, promoting higher fatigue strengths. Nevertheless, the influence of test frequency for specimens containing surface micro-defects is dominant in the low cycle fatigue (LCF) regime while in the high cycle fatigue (HCF) and very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) range the fatigue life determining parameter is the severity of the micro-notches present along the laser cut surface...|$|R

Given the increased recognition of the importance of MGD, a great amount of attention has been paid to therapies targeting this condition. The traditional treatments of MGD consist of warm compresses and lid hygiene for removing an obstructed meibum, as well as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents to improve the quality of the meibum. However, each of these treatments has a different shortcoming and the treatment of MGD remains challenging. Despite the numerous possible treatment options for MGD, it is still difficult to obtain complete relief of signs and symptoms.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the milking characteristics of the Bodmin NuPulse milking machine. The first experiment describes the mode of operation of the NuPulse pulsation mechanism and establishes that the NuPulse has a distinctly different mode of action from the conventional type of milking machine. The aim of the 2 nd experiment {{was to determine if}} the liner movement characteristics of the NuPulse cluster had any advantage over the conventional type of pulsation and liner movement, in terms of milk production and mastitis over the period of a lactation. Ten pairs of infection-free identical twins were allocated to the experiment; one member of each pair was milked by the NuPulse <b>pulsation</b> <b>system</b> and the other member was milked by the NuPulse cluster which had been modified for the conventional pulsation treatment by removal of the NuPulse pulsation mechanism. Because of this modification the experiment did not examine the difference between the NuPulse and a conventional machine but only {{the difference between the two}} pulsation mechanisms. The Mark I NuPulse Cluster was used for both treatments in order to eliminate any possible effects of cluster weight, size and stability on the cow during milking. The trial cows were grazed with a 100 cow, mixed aged herd. The herd was milked in an eight bail walk-through, high pipe-line dairy, equipped with four NuPulse clusters and four conventional (modified NuPulse) units. The non-trial cows in the herd were milked by one machine or the other, at random, whereas the trial cows were milked by any one of the four machines appropriate to their treatment. Before 'cups-on' the teats of all cows (including the trial cows) were squirted for five to ten seconds with water and only washed if they were dirty. At times during the summer months, cows with clean teats received no wash at all. During the experiment (and including the first 3 months of the following lactation) no significant difference in mastitis or teat end condition developed between the two treatment groups. The one line NuPulse cluster, with the pulsator incorporated into the claw piece was associated with the same problem of frothing as other one line machines used with high lift pipeline machines. However, the production data indicated that the pulsation mechanism of the NuPulse influenced the cows in some way during milking. The NuPulse group of twins recorded higher milk yields during the last 5 months of lactation and at the time of drying-off, were giving significantly (P < 0. 01) higher yields than the group of twins milked by the conventional machine. The group milked by the conventional machine (modified NuPulse) reached the drying off yield of the NuPulse group (5. 9 l/day) 12 days earlier. When the lactation was ended for both groups at a yield of 5. 9 l/day and the total production for both groups compared, it was found that the NuPulse group achieved significantly higher yields (P < 0. 05). Compared to the conventional (or modified NuPulse) machine, the higher milk yields recorded with the NuPulse during the last 5 months of lactation suggests that the NuPulse was associated with a more positive stimulation effect during milking. However, in view of the small number of animals used in the experiment further studies should be made to verify the increased production effect of the NuPulse on a larger scale, as the efficiency of such increases in production has wider economic implications. Possible stimulation mechanisms associated with the mode of action of the NuPulse are discussed...|$|E

The instability is Rayleigh-Taylor, and develops for a fairly {{broad range of}} accretion rates and stellar rotation rates and magnetic fields.

The instability appears for relatively small misalignment angles, Θ≲ 30 ^∘, between the star's rotation and magnetic axes, and is associated with higher accretion rates. The hot spots and light curves during accretion through instability are generally much more chaotic than during stable accretion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During sessile droplet evaporation, {{studies with}} IR {{thermography}} and shadowgraphs have indicated temper-ature pulsations. We confirm those observations with micro-thermocouples, but microthermocouples also indicate temper-ature pulsations {{in the atmosphere}} of the droplet. The pressure in this atmosphere pulsated as well and was correlated with the temperature pulsations in the droplet. Also, we find that if a droplet evaporates into its own vapor, there are no temperature or pressure pulsations. The pulsations occur only if the droplet evaporates into an atmosphere with a component having a heat of solution with the droplet when it adsorbs−absorbs. None of the currently proposed mechanisms for the temperature pulsations provide an explanation for the coupling between the temperature pulsations in the droplet and the vapor-phase pressure pulsations, and for the absence of the <b>pulsations</b> when the <b>system</b> is single-component.

Both wall shear stress and pressure gradient are augmented with frequency compared to steady flow, though the pressure gradient increases more significantly as a result of growing inertial losses. The three distinct regimes of unsteadiness are shown to display unique relationships between the parameters pertinent to heat transfer and should therefore be considered independently with respect to thermal enhancement capability.

40|$|We {{have studied}} a hydromagnetic wave {{event in the}} early noon sector of the cusp region, using HF radar data {{collected}} in the southern hemisphere and ground-based magnetic data from both hemispheres. There were three distinct pulsations, which {{appear to have been}} driven by changes in the solar wind, beginning with the passage of a powerful interplanetary shock. This shock triggered the first pulsation, a strong ssc, at 1346 UT. It was followed at 1402 UT by a second pulsation, which had a stable dominant frequency of 3. 3 mHz and lasted about half an hour. Although this frequency was close to that of the ssc, the new pulsation was clearly differentiated from the ssc by an abrupt 180 ° change of phase. A further such phase discontinuity at 1434 UT (near noon MLT) marked the start of a third distinct ULF pulsation with a clearly lower frequency of 2. 8 mHz, which continued for another half hour, until 1505 UT, and was correlated with the magnitude of the IMF. These latter two pulsations yielded a successful calibration of the radar observations with ground-based magnetometer measurements; the <b>pulsation</b> current <b>systems</b> in the northern and southern hemispheres were found to be highly correlated and conjugate. The 3. 3 -mHz pulsation was observed over a range of ∼ 10 ° in invariant latitude, and its amplitude showed a strong, broad maximum close to the latitude of the cusp as inferred from an independent radar-satellite analysis of cusp signatures. The zonal E × B motion associated with the pulsation showed a linear latitudinal decrease in phase (25 ° per degree of latitude) while the meridional motion had nearly constant phase. The longitudinal phase variation corresponded to an m value of ∼ 10 with a source at later MLT. We discuss the possibility that the dominant wave activity near 3 mHz in the latter two pulsations was due to a hydromagnetic surface wave at the magnetopause stimulated by the ssc and modified by the forcing action of the solar win...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a novel, non-invasive, non-contact system to measure pulse waveforms of artery via applying laser triangulation method to detect skin surface vibration. The proposed arterial <b>pulsation</b> measurement (APM) <b>system</b> chiefly {{consists of a}} laser diode and a low cost complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. Laser triangulation and centroid method are combined with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in this study. The shape and frequency of the arterial pulsation can be detected rapidly by using our APM system. The relative variation of the pulse at different measurement points near wrist joint {{is used as a}} prognostic guide in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). An extensive series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the performance of the designed APM system. From experimental results, the pulse amplitude and frequency at the Chun point (related to the small intestine) of left hand showed an obvious increase after having food. In these cases, the peak to peak amplitudes and the frequencies of arterial pulsations range from 38 to 48 µm and from 1. 27 to 1. 35 Hz, respectively. The height of arterial pulsations on the area near wrist joint can be estimated with a resolution of better than 4 µm. This research demonstrates that applying a CMO...|$|R
