5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program {{to provide students with}} a better environment for learning. Parents donated <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans,</b> and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation of}} a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|On October10, 1984, the Government of Cape Verde {{appealed for}} {{international}} assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month {{supply of food}} for 1,124families, 1,064mattresses, 532kerosene stoves, 2,128sets of dinner ware, 2,128mugs, 1,064cooking <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans,</b> 532water buckets, 2,128sheets, 1,064blankets, 2,660articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094houses. In January1985, the government of Cape Verde announced that they had made significant progress with relief assistance. However, repairs to roads, infrastructure, and crops were still required. Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the Cape Verde Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984USD). France, Finland, the Soviet Union, and the United States supplied 4000tons of cereals, $79,000 (1984USD) to the Red Cross, $250,000 (1984USD) for home repairs, 32packages of medicines, and 17packages of blankets.|$|E

25|$|Pottery {{has been}} used to make {{cookware}} from before dated history. <b>Pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> made with this material are durable (some could last a lifetime or more)and are inert and non-reactive.

25|$|By the 17th century, it {{was common}} for a Western kitchen to contain a number of skillets, baking pans, a kettle and several pots, along {{with a variety of}} pot hooks and trivets. Brass or copper vessels were common in Asia and Europe, whilst iron pots were common in the American colonies. Improvements in {{metallurgy}} during the 19th and 20th centuries allowed for <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> from metals such as steel, stainless steel and aluminium to be economically produced.|$|E
25|$|Metal pots {{are made}} from a narrow range of metals because <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> need to conduct heat well, but {{also need to be}} {{chemically}} unreactive so that they do not alter the flavor of the food. Most materials that are conductive enough to heat evenly are too reactive to use in food preparation. In some cases (copper pots, for example), a pot may be made out of a more reactive metal, and then tinned or clad with another.|$|E

25|$|But the {{simultaneous}} {{increase in the}} availability of capital, the changing flux of technology (metallurgy), the availability of skilled foreign labour {{and the rise of}} an educated middle class meant that iron-making in the Weald would presage change across England. It would, in many ways, pave the way for the rise of the new industrial middle class. A trade consisting mostly of weapons would evolve into other more common tools as well: fire-backs, andirons, anvils, hammers, <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> and even grave slabs.|$|E
25|$|ICT {{appears to}} be {{vanishing}} {{as a result of}} greater genetic diversity within the affected populations in conjunction with educational programs to ensure that tinned cooking utensils are used instead of copper <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans</b> being directly exposed to cooked foods.

25|$|Benvenuto Cellini worked {{almost ten}} years on this bronze (1545-1554). His wax design was {{immediately}} approved by Cosimo I de' Medici. He met numerous difficulties which, according to his autobiography, almost {{brought him to the}} brink of death. The casting of this bronze statue was several times unsuccessful. When attempting again, the melting furnace got overheated, spoiling the casting of the bronze. Cellini gave orders to feed the furnace with his household furniture and finally with about 200 pewter dishes and plates, and his <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans.</b> This caused the bronze to flow again. After the bronze had cooled, the statue was finished, except for three toes on the right foot. These were added later.|$|E

50|$|In simple terms, {{the power}} {{scrubber}} is a pot brush {{with an electric}} motor. Recognizing the effort it takes to scrub pots with baked-on food or grease, at least one manufacturer has designed these brushes to rotate on flexible power shafts <b>and</b> scour <b>pots,</b> <b>pans</b> <b>and</b> utensils with minimal effort. The power unit for the scrubber typically mounts on the wall at the <b>pot</b> sink <b>and</b> is connected to a six-foot flexible shaft used to scrub the soiled dishware. One manufacturer makes a variety of brushes and scrubbers {{that can be easily}} changed on the shaft. In addition to the traditional brushes, there are wire brushes for scouring tougher soil and even an impregnated plastic composite head for scrubbing baked-on carbon deposits from <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> baking <b>pans.</b>|$|R

25|$|Lilleshall was not {{immediately}} dissolved but, {{like most of the}} marginal houses, surrendered itself to the king, before being compulsorily suppressed, on 16 October 1538. Henry VIII's agent, William Cavendish arrived on 16 October to take possession of the demesne lands and the abbey buildings. The abbey community was down to Abbot Robert Watson and ten canons. The gross revenue was found to be about £340 – a little more than in 1538, when the Lilleshall estate itself had been omitted. Watson was given a pension of £50 and the London house or, according to Walcott's transcription of the Court of Augmentations record, the “mansion of Longdon, wyth on acre of grounde ajoynyng to the seid mansion, and competente tymber for the reparacion of the samehouse, and also sufficient fyer woode duryng hys lyfe.” The canons were granted pensions of £5 to £6 each and a small lump sum as a “reward” on leaving – generally 50 shillings. The contents of the abbey and monastic buildings were sold and systematically listed as they were taken away, from liturgical items like altars and plate, to beds and bedding, <b>pots</b> <b>and</b> <b>pans.</b> The livestock, the small store of grain the hay were sold. Altogether, the sale of contents fetched £74 18s., although the bells, substantial amounts of plate and lead roofing remained initially unsold.|$|E

50|$|Geographically and historically, Burcht was {{originally}} {{part of the}} province of East Flanders, which fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Count of Flanders. However, in 1923, the village was transferred to the Province of Antwerp. Burcht was primarily agrarian, but by the middle of the nineteenth century, it had become the site of heavy industry. The fertile land in Borgerweert (part of Burcht) was filled in with dredged slurry from the river Scheldt to accommodate the building of factories.
