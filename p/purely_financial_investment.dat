40|$|In my thesis, I explore German-Turks’ social {{identity}} and research {{its impact on}} their <b>financial</b> <b>investment</b> decisions. A systematic literature review reveals a research gap on <b>financial</b> <b>investment</b> decision making, {{as well as on}} qualitative research on {{social identity}}. I collected primary data by means of semi-structured, in-depth, multiple interviews with German-Turkish participants, who are interested in and/or hold <b>financial</b> <b>investments.</b> I analyze the data using a phenomenological approach. Social identity is found to have many different bi-cultural shades, but <b>financial</b> <b>investments</b> are clearly viewed through the lens of professional German social identity. Notwithstanding, <b>financial</b> <b>investments</b> are found to be a family affair. This includes involving experienced family members in the decision-making process, as well as providing financial support to the extended family in order to maintain a web of loyalty. My study extends social identity theory to <b>financial</b> <b>investment</b> decision making of the ethnic Turkish population in Germany, identifies a new mechanism of social creativity and explains the mechanism of bi-cultural social identity. Practical implications of my study draw on the identification of decision making processes, which involve not only the customer herself/himself but also financially literate family members. Financial services institutions can gain better understanding and access to this target group. Appropriate communication with customers and those who significantly influence buying decisions can increase customer satisfaction. Social identity theory is usually associated with quantitative research, using questionnaires and experiments for generating data; therefore my qualitative approach is methodologically relevant. Thus, I demonstrate that a qualitative approach can be applied successfully and meaningful results are obtained...|$|R
