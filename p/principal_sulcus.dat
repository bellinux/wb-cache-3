5000|$|The dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC or DL-PFC) is an area in the prefrontal cortex of the brain of humans and {{non-human}} primates. It {{is one of the}} most recently evolved parts of the human brain. It undergoes a prolonged period of maturation which lasts until adulthood. The DLPFC is not an anatomical structure, but rather a functional one. It lies in the middle frontal gyrus of humans (i.e., lateral part of Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 46). In macaque monkeys, it is around the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus</b> (i.e., in Brodmann's area 46). Other sources consider that DLPFC is attributed anatomically to BA 9 and 46 [...] and BA 8, 9 and 10. [...] The DLPFC has connections with the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (specifically, the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex (including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas). The DLPFC is also the end point for the dorsal pathway (stream), which is concerned with how to interact with stimuli. An important function of the DLPFC is the executive functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstractreasoning. However, the DLPFC is not exclusively responsible for the executive functions. All complex mental activity requires the additional cortical and subcortical circuits with which the DLPFC is connected. The DLPFC is also the highest cortical area that is involved in motor planning, organization and regulation.|$|E

The males' hind femora often vary in size from 1.5 mm to 3mm from the end of the femora. O. speciosa are sexually dimorphic; the females are much larger than the males. Female body sizes range from 16-21.5 mm with antennae that are 5-6mm long, tegmina that are 9-16mm long, and hind femora that are 9.5-12 mm long. Males range from 13-14mm in total length with antennae 4.5-6.5mm in length, tegmina, 101-13 mm in length, and hind femora are 8.5-10 mm in length.

O. speciosa individuals exhibit much variation in color, especially combinations of green and brown. Females are often light green with a dark coloration on the vertex of the head. Females are occasionally brown and have a line on the sides of the pronotum. O. speciosa looks very similar to a related species in the same genus, O. pelidna. These two species can be identified from one another by looking at the fastigium (the part of the head that is located in between the eyes of the grasshoppers and their size. O.speciosa has a small median ridge on the fastigium and is much smaller than O. pelidna. O. pelidna has a semicircular indentation that is set farther back than on O. speciosa, and O. pelidna has a lateral carinae that is incised twice.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Intertropical Pleistocene taxa of dasypodids and pampatheriids are {{reported}} for the Lagoon-Barrier III System (Arroio Chuí locality) and for the Touro Passo Formation (Ponte Velha I locality), both from Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil. The record of pampatheriids includes new specimens that confirm the presence of Pampatherium humboldti in the Arroio Chuí assemblage. Material previously assigned to Holmesina majus is identified as H. paulacoutoi. The record of dasypodids includes a large-sized specimen of the genus Dasypus, represented by an isolated pelvic buckler osteoderm, closely related to Dasypus (Hyperoambon) kappleri, and of Propraopus sulcatus, represented by isolated moveable and fixed osteoderms. This southernmost Brazilian record of P. sulcatus extends their distribution by about 2200 km from Lagoa Santa (Minas Gerais State, Brazil). The first record of P. sulcatus also includes specimens previously referred to as Propraopus cf. grandis from the Touro Passo Formation. Propraopus sulcatus differs from P. punctatus and P. grandis in having: osteoderms with wrinkled external surface, with wide and relatively deep sulci; principal figure plane, ranging from subcircular to hexagonal in fixed osteoderms; and moveable osteoderms with <b>principal</b> <b>sulci</b> forming a lageniform figure, and with four to five larger foramina distributed on the posterior half of these sulci. The late Pleistocene mammals of the coastal province and western Rio Grande do Sul were previously considered closely related {{to those of the}} Pampean region of Argentina.

Although human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are implicated in implementing rule-guided behavior, the crucial contributions made by different regions within these areas are not yet specified.

40|$|Theories of dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC) {{involvement}} in cognitive function variously emphasize its involvement in rule implementation, cognitive control, or working and/or spatial memory. These theories predict broad effects of DLPFC lesions on tests of visual learning and memory. We evaluated the effects of DLPFC lesions (including both banks of the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus)</b> in rhesus monkeys on tests of scene learning and strategy implementation that are severely impaired following crossed unilateral lesions of frontal cortex and inferotemporal cortex.

They were also without effect on the ability to adjust choice behaviour in response to a change in reinforcer value, a capacity that requires interaction between the amygdala and frontal lobe.

40|$|Eighteen brain {{points in}} prefrontal and thalamic areas {{of each of}} three adult male macaques were tested {{for the effects of}} {{electrical}} stimulation and coagulation during the delayed response test. During the delay period, stimulation of prefrontal areas and dorsomedial thalamus caused severe impairment in two subjects. Stimulation caused less impairment during the baiting period than during the delay period; continuous stimulation throughout the test caused less impairment than intermittent stimulation; intermittent stimulation throughout the test was the most effective mode of stimulation. Distraction tests produced the same standard of performance achieved during control tests; peripheral shocks produced a slightly impaired performance. Even aversive peripheral stimuli did not produce as many errors as did central stimuli which produced no behavioral effects. Prefrontal lesions had more disruptive and longer-lasting effects than did thalamic lesions, but the order in which the lesions were made had no effect on performance.

60|$|But {{the truth}} that the three {{structures}} in question are as well developed in apes' as in human brains, or even better; {{and that it is}} characteristic of all the Primates (if we exclude the Lemurs) to have these parts well developed, stands at present on as secure a basis as any proposition in comparative anatomy. Moreover, it is admitted by every one of the long series of anatomists who, of late years, have paid special attention to the arrangement of the complicated sulci and gyri which appear upon the surface of the cerebral hemispheres in man and the higher apes, that they are disposed after the very same pattern in him, as in them. Every <b>principal</b> gyrus and <b>sulcus</b> of a chimpanzee's brain is clearly represented in that of a man, so that the terminology which applies to the one answers for the other. On this point there is no difference of opinion. Some years since, Professor Bischoff published a memoir (70. 'Die Grosshirn-Windungen des Menschen;' 'Abhandlungen der K. Bayerischen Akademie,' B. x. 1868.) on the cerebral convolutions of man and apes; and as the purpose of my learned colleague was certainly not to diminish the value of the differences between apes and men in this respect, I am glad to make a citation from him.|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{bilateral}} frontal lesions on locomotor activity were studied under various stimulus conditions. 8 monkeys were tested after, and 13 monkeys before and after, partial ablation of lateral frontal granular cortex or as un-operated controls. Ss with lesions that included <b>sulcus</b> <b>principals</b> were hyperreactive to light. Their locomotor activity in light {{as well as}} darkness was more enhanced by relatively familiar auditory stimuli, and more de-pressed by relatively novel stimuli than that of unoperated Ss, or of Ss with lateral frontal lesions which spared sulcus principalis.

40|$|To {{define the}} {{cortical}} areas that subserve spatial working memory in a nonhuman primate, we measured regional {{cerebral blood flow}} (rCBF) with [15 O]H 2 O and positron emission tomography while monkeys performed a visually guided saccade (VGS) task and an oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) task. Both Statistical Parametric Mapping and regions of interest-based analyses revealed an increase of rCBF in the area surrounding the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus</b> (PS), the superior convexity, the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus (AS), the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), the frontal pole (FP), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lIPS) and the prestriate cortex. In the prefrontal cortex (PS, superior convexity, AS, lOFC and FP), rCBF values correlated positively with ODR task performance scores. From the hippocampus, rCBF values correlated negatively with ODR task performance. From the AS, superior convexity, lOFC, FP, ACC and lIPS, rCBF values of the PS correlated positively with rCBF values and negatively with hippocampus rCBF values. These results suggest that neural circuitry in the prefrontal cortex directly contributes the spatial working memory processes and that, in spatial working memory processes, the posterior parietal cortex and hippocampus have a different role to the prefrontal cortex...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{distribution}} of visual and oculomotor activity across the macaque brain, we performed {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) on awake, behaving monkeys trained to perform visually guided saccades. Two subjects alternated between periods of making saccades and central fixations while blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) images were collected [3 T, (1. 5 mm) 3 spatial resolution]. BOLD activations from each of four cerebral hemi-spheres were projected onto the subjects ’ cortical surfaces and aligned to a surface-based atlas for comparison across hemi-spheres and subjects. This surface-based analysis revealed pat-terns of visuo-oculomotor activity across much of the cerebral cortex, including activations in the posterior parietal cortex, superior temporal cortex and frontal lobe. For each cortical domain, we show the anatomical position and extent of visuo-oculomotor activity, including evidence that the dorsolateral frontal activation, which includes the frontal eye field (on the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus), extends anteriorly into posterior <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus</b> (area 46) and posteriorly into part of dorsal premotor cortex (area 6).

40|$|The {{inferior}} convexity of the macaque {{prefrontal cortex}} (icPFC) {{is known to}} be involved in higher order processing of sensory information mediating stimulus selection, attention and working memory. Until now, the vast majority of electrophysiological investigations of the icPFC employed single electrode recordings. As a result, relatively {{little is known about the}} spatiotemporal structure of neuronal activity in this cortical area. Here we study in detail the spatiotemporal properties of local field potentials (LFP's) in the icPFC using multi electrode recordings during anesthesia. We computed the LFP-LFP coherence as a function of frequency for thousands of pairs of simultaneously recorded sites anterior to the arcuate and inferior to the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus.</b> We observed two distinct peaks of coherent oscillatory activity between approximately 4 - 10 and 15 - 25 Hz. We then quantified the instantaneous phase of these frequency bands using the Hilbert transform and found robust phase gradients across recording sites. The dependency of the phase on the spatial location reflects the existence of traveling waves of electrical activity in the icPFC. The dominant axis of these traveling waves roughly followed the ventral-dorsal plane. Preliminary results show that repeated visual stimulation with a 10 s movie had no dramatic effect on the spatial structure of the traveling waves. Traveling waves of electrical activity in the icPFC could reflect highly organized cortical processing in this area of prefrontal cortex...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{functional}} imaging {{studies have}} suggested that the prefrontal cortex (PF) is engaged in the performance of transverse patterning (TP), which consists of 3 conflicting discriminations (A+/B−, B+/C−, C+/A−). However, the roles of PF in TP are still unclear. To address this issue, we examined the neuronal responses in 3 regions [the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus</b> (PS), dorsal convexity (DC), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPF) ] of the macaque PF during the performance of an oculomotor version of TP. A delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) task was used as a control task. The TP task-responsive neurons were most abundant in MPF. We analyzed the dependency of each neuronal response on the task type (TP or DMS), target shape (A, B, or C), and target location (left or right). Immediately after the choice cue presentation, many MPF neurons showed task dependency. Interestingly, some of them already exhibited differential activity between the 2 tasks before the choice cue presentation. Immediately before the saccade, the number of target location-dependent neurons increased in MPF and PS. Among them, many MPF neurons were also influenced by the task type, whereas PS neurons tended to show location dependency without task dependency. These results suggest that MPF and PS are involved in the execution of TP: MPF appears to be more important in the target selection based on the TP rule, whereas PS is apparently more related to the response preparation. In addition, some neurons showed a postsaccadic response, which {{may be related to the}} feedback mechanism...|$|E

Although these areas differ {{in a number of}} their cortical connections, some of the first anatomical evidence for these networks came from tracer studies demonstrating their distinct patterns of connectivity with the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus of the thalamus. Here, we present evidence for a similar topography of MD thalamus prefrontal connections, using non-invasive imaging and diffusion tractography (DWI–DT) in human and macaque. DWI–DT suggested that there was a high probability of interconnection between medial MD and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, between caudodorsal MD and medial frontal/cingulate cortex, and between lateral MD and lateral prefrontal cortex, in both species.

In Expt. 1, half of each group learned problems in which the position of a pair of visual stimuli, to the monkey's left or right, indicated which of the visual stimuli was the correct (rewarded) one. The other animals learned problems in which visual stimuli indicated, irrespective of their own spatial position, whether reward was to be found on the monkey's left or on the right. The animals with fornix transection were impaired in both tasks. The animals with sulcus principalis ablation were also impaired in both tasks. The impairment caused by fornix transection was more severe than that caused by sulcus principalis ablation. Within each of the two operated groups, the degree of impairment in the two tasks was equal, when assessed in proportion to the difficulty of each task for control animals. Expt. 2 showed that neither of the operated groups was impaired in visual discrimination learning with spatial position irrelevant. Expt. 3 tested spatial discrimination learning (acquisition and reversal of a left-right discrimination) with irrelevant visual cues. Here the fornix-transected group was impaired but the group with sulcus principalis ablations was normal. It is suggested, {{on the basis of these}} findings and previous results, that fornix transection produces a general deficit in remembering the spatial arrangement of whole scenes, while sulcus principalis ablation produces a deficit in high-order integration involving spatial information...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to define the origin of prefrontal and agranular cingulate afferents to F 7 and F 2, in the light of functional and hodological evidence showing that these areas do not appear to be functionally homogeneous. Different sectors of F 7 and F 2 were injected with neural tracers in seven monkeys and the retrograde labelling was qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. The dorsorostral part of F 7 (supplementary eye field, F 7 -SEF) was found to be a target of strong afferents from the frontal eye field (FEF), from the dorsolateral prefrontal regions located dorsally (DLPFd) and ventrally (DLPFv) to the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus</b> and from cingulate areas 24 a, 24 b and 24 c.

40|$|The {{inferior}} convexity of the macaque {{prefrontal cortex}} (icPFC), the cortical area anterior to the arcuate and {{inferior to the}} <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus,</b> consists the final endpoint of the ventral visual stream. It {{has been suggested that}} the icPFC is involved in higher order processing of non spatial visual information like stimulus selection, attention and working memory. However, early findings demonstrated that spiking activity in the icPFC is also modulated by visual stimulation during anesthesia. Here we used multi-electrode recordings to study in more detail the neural coding of visual information as well as the spatial distribution of this information in the icPFC of the anesthetized macaque. We recorded local field potentials (LFP) and multi and single unit spiking activity, and calculated the Shannon (mutual) information between these neurophysiological signals and a dynamic movie stimulus. We found that the phase of low frequency (1 - 10 Hz) local field potentials (LFP) conveyed significant visual information about the movie. Significant information was also conveyed by the energy of the low frequency (1 - 10 Hz) LFP. However the mutual information between the energy of the 1 - 10 Hz LFP and the movie was an order of a magnitude less than the information conveyed by the phase. Information in the LFP phase was distributed evenly across all recorded sites, with almost all channels lying between 50 and 150 of the average amount of information. However, the information carried by the LFP amplitude was highly clustered around a small group of electrodes. Almost half of the recorded sites carried less than 50 of the mean information across electrodes, and around 15 recorded sites had more than 3 times the average information. High frequency LFP phase and energy were highly variable across repeated presentations of the movie and were thus non-informative. Similarly, multi unit and single unit spiking activity pattern or rate codes conveyed no information about the movie. Our results show that input and intracortical processing in the icPFC during anesthesia conveys significant information about dynamic visual stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Horizontal {{binocular}} disparity {{is a powerful}} depth cue, both for relative and absolute depth information. Sensitivity to {{binocular disparity}} is found in various cortical areas in both the dorsal and the ventral visual stream. Previous research has found a correlation between the neural activity in both the Anterior Intraparietal area (AIP) and inferior temporal cortex (IT), and the behavioral choices in a stereo discrimination task (Verhoef 2010). Both areas have anatomical connections to area 46 of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Additionally, a previous awake monkey imaging study has hinted at the existence of disparity-selectivity in area 46 (Joly et al. 2009). Our goal {{was to examine the}} disparity selectivity of single neurons in area 46. We recorded from 76 cells in area 46 (in the ventral bank of the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus)</b> of 1 macaque monkey using standard extracellular recording methods, while the monkey passively fixated Random Dot Stereograms that depicted curved 3 D shapes, presented at the fixation point. Thirty-four out of 76 (45 %) responsive neurons tested showed significant disparity selectivity that could not be accounted for by the monocular responses. These neurons were further tested to determine the order of depth selectivity - zero-order (positionpositionin- depth), or higher order - by presenting stimuli at different positions in depth. Nineteen out of 34 neurons (56 %) preserved their 3 D-shape preference across positions in depth, hence being considered as higher-order disparity selective. Vergence eye movements were small (average 0. 15 degrees) compared to stimulus disparities (>= 1 degree) and emerged on average 200 ms after stimulus onset. The neural selectivity latency was remarkably long (median: 200 ms). Higher order neurons were tested with approximations of the original smoothly curved stimuli, portraying inclined surfaces (first-order stereo), linear approximations (second-order stereo, wedge), discrete approximations (three separate planes at different positions-in-depth) and smoothly curved gradients (second order stereo, curvature). We found that area 46 neurons could be either first-order or second-order disparity selective, and could be selective for 3 D wedges or smoothly curved surfaces. The tuning for the amplitude of the disparity variation (ranging from 0. 03 to 1. 27 degrees) was largely monotonic, similar to previous findings in AIP. These data demonstrate that area 46 neurons can show disparity-defined 3 D shape selectivity during passive fixation.

40|$|We used transneuronal {{retrograde}} transport and electrical simulation {{to study the}} anatomy of the oculomotor system and the phyiology of eye‐head coordination, respectively. To obtain a more comprehensive view of the oculomotor system, we injected rabies virus in the lateral rectus (LR) extraocular muscle of primates. We {{took advantage of the}} fact that the transfer of rabies virus through synapses is time dependent to distinguish the brain reions providing monosynaptic, disynaptic and polysynaptic input to the extraocular motorneurons of the abducens nucleus (Abd). We were particularly interested in the distribution of oculomotor related neurons in the frontal cortex and the elucidation ofgradients of SC neurons that might serve as a substrate of the spatiotemporal transformation. In our physiological study, the feline SC was electrically stimulated and the electromyographic (EMG) activity of several neck muscles was monitored to test the influence of the eye position on the decomposition of the gaze commnd issued by SC into the eye and head movement components. In the frontal cortex, numerous labeled neurons were found in the arcuate sulcus (AS), occupying both of its banks, the spur, the prearcuate convexity and a small part of the postarcuate cortex. All in all, this area was found to be much bigger than the low threshold frontal eye fields (FEF). In addition, clusters of labelled cells were found in the dorsomedial frontal cortex, occupying an area that corresponded well to the supplementary eye fields (SEF). Additional clusters were found in the <b>principal</b> <b>sulcus</b> and in parts of the cigulate and orbitofrontal cortices. These data show that a network of higher level neuronal structures work in tandem to control eye movements. In the brainstem, numerous regions were oligosynaptically connected with the Abd. Besides areas implicated in horizontal and vertical eye movements, substantial labeling was observed in the cholinergic system of the brainstem, in pretectal and accessory optic nuclei, in parabrachial and paralemniscal areas, and in the deep cerebellar nuclei. In the SC, we estimated the density of labeled cells along the horizontal meridian (representing purely horizontal saccades) and found it to increase from rostal to caudal locations. This rostrocaudal gradient could only partially serve as the substrate of the spatiotemporal transformation, as it was not as steep as the one we deduced from both experimental data and modeling arguments. It may be the case that several mechanisms work in parallel to implement this transformation. In the gaze decomposition study the amplitude of the electrically evoked phasic EMG responses of neck muscles was often found o increase when the eyes deviated in their pulling direction. This increase in amplitude was always accompanied by a decrease in response latency. However, the effect of eye position was not consistent since eye position accounted for 10 ‐ 50 % of the variance of EMG amplitude and in several SC sites there was no correlation between the two variables...|$|E
