25|$|Electronic analog <b>PID</b> <b>control</b> loops {{were often}} found within more complex {{electronic}} systems, for example, the head positioning of a disk drive, the power conditioning {{of a power}} supply, or even the movement-detection circuit of a modern seismometer. Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using microcontrollers or FPGAs, to implement PID algorithms.

25|$|In the {{interest}} of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be critically damped. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move {{it away from the}} required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a PLC or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned <b>PID</b> <b>control</b> system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.|$|E
25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded <b>PID</b> <b>control.</b> In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a library of}} (PID) controller models adopting the object-oriented approach, and written in Modelica. Peculiar to this work is that controllers are represented both as dynamic continuous-time and digital models, achieving consistence between the two and accounting for the functionalities of typical industrial implementations. This allows the designer to use realistic controllers, maintaining the possibility of choosing the continuous-time or digital (event based) representation. The former allows for example for variable-step simulation, {{to the advantage of}} efficiency, while the latter represents very realistically the actual control system’s operation, clearly at the cost of more simulation time.

40|$|Since chaos systems {{generally}} have the intrinsic properties of sensitivity to initial conditions, topological mixing and density of periodic orbits, they may tactfully use the chaotic ergodic orbits {{to achieve the}} global optimum or their better approximation to given cost functions with high probability. During the past decade, they have increasingly received much attention from academic community and industry society throughout the world. To improve the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO), we herein propose a chaotic proportional integral derivative (<b>PID)</b> <b>controlling</b> PSO algorithm by the hybridization of chaotic logistic dynamics and hierarchical inertia weight.

Thereafter, the convergent analysis of chaotic <b>PID</b> <b>controlling</b> PSO is under deep investigation.
