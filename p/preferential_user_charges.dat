We assessed the effect of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> on inpatient hospitalizations rate and equity in Haryana State. Methods: The inpatient department (IPD) statistics {{of the public sector}} facilities in Yamuna Nagar district where <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> had been introduced were analysed and compared with Rohtak district which did not have <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> between 2000 and 2006. National Sample Survey data of Haryana for the 2004 - 2005 period were analyzed to compare utilization of public sector facilities for hospitalization, cost of hospitalization, and prevalence of catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure by income quintiles in three districts which had <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> and 17 districts of Haryana which did not levy <b>user</b> <b>charges.</b> Results: During 2000 and 2006, hospital admissions declined by 23. 8 per cent in Yamuna Nagar district where <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> had been introduced compared to an almost static hospitalization rate in Rohtak district which did not have <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> (P< 0. 01). Public sector hospital utilization for inpatient services had a pro-rich (concentration index 0. 144) distribution in the three districts with <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> and propoor (concentration index - 0. 047) in the 17 districts without <b>user</b> <b>charges.</b> Significantly higher prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure was observed in public sector institutions with <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> (48 %) compared to those without <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> (35. 4 %) (P< 0. 001).

Quantitative data is collected from a subset of the population in walk-in Urgent Care Clinics and General Practitioner surgeries to assess their responses to <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> and whether <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> are a viable source of part-funding healthcare in Ireland. Examining the economic theories of Becker (1965) and Grossman (1972), the research has assessed {{the impact of}} <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> on patient choice in terms of affordability and accessibility in healthcare. The research examined a number of private, public and part-publicly funded healthcare services in Ireland for which varying levels of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> exist depending on patients’ healthcare cover. Firstly, the study identifies the factors affecting patient choice of privately funded walk-in Urgent Care Clinics in Ireland given <b>user</b> <b>charges.</b> Secondly, the study assesses patient response to <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> for a mainly public or part-publicly provided service; prescription drugs. Finally, the study examines patients’ attitudes towards the potential application of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> for both public and private healthcare services when patient choice is part of a time-money trade-off, convenience choice or preference choice. These services are valued in the context of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> becoming more prevalent in healthcare systems over time. The results indicate that the impact of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> on healthcare services vary according to socio-economic status. The study shows that <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> can disproportionately affect lower income groups and consequently lead to affordability and accessibility issues. However, when valuing the potential application of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> for three healthcare services (MRI scans, blood tests and a branded over a generic prescription drug), this research indicates that lower income individuals {{are willing to pay for}} healthcare services, albeit at a lower <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> than higher income earners. Consequently, this study suggests that <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> may be a feasible source of part-financing Irish healthcare, once the <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> is determined from the patients’ perspective, taking into account their ability to pay...|$|R

Some African countries have been diligent in expanding the infrastructure necessary to provide public services, but unfortunately, most have not {{done a very good job}} of paying for them. Imposition of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> to fund public services would go far toward eliminating the financial problems faced by many African countries in providing services and would raise additional revenues that could be used to pay for other government expenditures. In addition to the financial benefits of <b>user</b> <b>charges,</b> there are many other benefits from their imposition. <b>User</b> <b>charges</b> have the potential to greatly improve the public sector’s efficiency, to impart a more equitable distribution of the financing burden of public services, to provide better information regarding infrastructure needs, and to improve the quality of existing services. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the general nature of user charges: what they are, the services upon which they should be imposed, and evidence of the willingness to pay them. Section 3 discusses the extent to which <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> have been imposed in Africa in the past. Section 4 articulates the theory behind the efficient pricing of public services, resulting in a guide for setting appropriate <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> - in general as well as under special but common circumstances. Section 5 addresses the revenue implications of <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> financing, including the tendency of efficient prices to raise adequate revenues, ways to recover costs when efficient prices lead to deficits, and the attractiveness of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> for taxation.

Meanwhile, a majority of states have adopted tax and expenditure limitations (TELs) in an attempt to constrain the revenue and spending levels of local governments including municipalities. In the era of TELs, how <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> perform their multiple roles in promoting local autonomy, political accountability, allocative efficiency, horizontal equity, and responsive government deserves considerable attention in the field of public finance. This dissertation explores the causes and consequences of the increased use of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> by American municipalities. First, I provide an overview of fiscal trends in American municipalities. Chapter 1 discusses the context in which municipal revenue policy is made, the definitions of <b>user</b> <b>charges,</b> the salience of the issue, and the aims and organization of the dissertation. Chapter 2 investigates the effect of TELs on municipal reliance on <b>user</b> <b>charges.</b> The analysis is based on a sample of 724 cities for the period of 1970 to 2004. I employ fixed effects regression techniques to help control for the unobserved city-level characteristics that vary across cities but are time invariant. Results indicate that the implementation of TELs leads to a substantial increase in per capita <b>user</b> <b>charges.</b> The effect becomes even more pronounced when the endogoneity of TELs is taken into account using a two-stage least squares model. This finding implies that TELs may have unintended consequences and lead to a bigger government. Results also suggest that the restrictiveness and the number of TELs make a difference and different types of TELs generate varying effects on <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> reliance. Chapter 3 examines the impact of <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> financing on municipal expenditure levels.

Although <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> are widely employed to recover the costs of publicly provided investments, proper theoretical foundation {{has not been made}} for their application to inland waterway transport. In this paper we shall provide this foundation focusing on efficiency of allocation of resources, on equity of taxation, and on administration simplicity of each toll scheme. ? 1 of this paper presents the criteria to be used in evaluating waterway <b>user</b> <b>charges.</b> ? 2 appraises possible alternative tolls and estimates the rates that would be needed to recover current expenditures. A combination of toll schemes (segment tolls, locking fees, and congestion tolls) are argued to be economically and politically feasible and to dominate fuel taxes and license fees. The Appendix presents an example of the benefits and costs of waterway expansion and a test of the predictive power of the queueing model. 1. Criteria for Evaluating <b>User</b> <b>Charges</b> In this section we examine the basis for assessing <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> as well as three criteria by which alternative <b>user</b> <b>charge</b> methods can be evaluated...|$|R
