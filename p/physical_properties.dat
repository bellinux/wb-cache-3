30|$|In addition, {{geological}} and geophysical constraints play {{an important}} role in the gravity inversion. The geological and geophysical constraints are varied, and they can be classified into two different kinds: (1) geometry constraints like structure boundaries, orientations, and locations information; (2) <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> constraints such as surface material content and information from drill holes. All these constraints can be described as the function of the <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> and positions. In our inversion method, as we divided the subspace into different tesseroid cells, the constraints become the function of the <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> and index number of the tesseroid cells.|$|R

Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their <b>physical</b> <b>properties,</b> such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its <b>physical</b> <b>properties</b> have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine atoms {{have nine}} {{electron}}s, one fewer than neon, and electron configuration 1s22s22p5: two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one {{more to be}} filled. The outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear shielding, and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 − 2 = 7; this affects the atom's <b>physical</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|E

However, the choices about {{the form of}} km {{and the value of}} μ0 are totally human decisions, taken by international bodies composed of representatives of the national standards organizations of all participating countries. The parameter μ0 is a measurement-system constant, not a physical constant that can be measured. It does not, in any meaningful sense, describe a <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> of the vacuum. [...] This is why the relevant Standards Organizations prefer the name [...] "magnetic constant", rather than any name that carries the hidden and misleading implication that μ0 describes some <b>physical</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R

5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other <b>physical</b> <b>properties.</b> Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. <b>Physical</b> <b>properties</b> include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E

The average value is 0.056±0.003 for the objects larger than 57km, and 0.121±0.003 (R-band) for those smaller than 25km.
