5|$|On January 29, 1909, the {{sovereign}} government of Cuba was restored, and José Miguel Gómez became president. No explicit evidence of Magoon's corruption ever surfaced, but his parting gesture of issuing lucrative Cuban contracts to U.S. firms was a continued <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention.</b> Several months later, Magoon received an official commendation from President Taft for his excellent service in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report.

Lara Croft is also considered a sex symbol, {{one of the earliest}} in the industry to achieve widespread attention.

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase, Texas, particularly southeastern Texas, {{had become an}} increasing <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> between Spain and the United States. Various failed attempts, such as the Long Expedition, were made by groups from the U.S. {{to take control of}} parts of Texas, resulting in some temporary settlements near the bay including Perry's Point near modern Anahuac.

5|$|The D'Oliveira {{affair was}} a {{prolonged}} political and sporting controversy {{relating to the}} scheduled 1968–69 tour of South Africa by the England cricket team, who were officially representing the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).

With South Africa under apartheid, the potential inclusion by England of a non-white South African in their tour party became a political issue.|$|E

5|$|The TVR {{line would}} {{dominate}} the transportation of coal throughout the Rhondda's industrial history, and its monopoly was a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention,</b> as with no rivals the colliery owners could not negotiate for haulage rates. Several {{attempts were made}} to break the monopoly including the opening of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, between 1885 and 1895, which linked Blaenrhondda {{at the head of the}} Rhondda Fawr to the Prince of Wales Dock. To achieve this rail link the Rhondda Tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to Blaengwynfi; at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.|$|E
5|$|A key <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> in {{the case}} was the {{unmatched}} left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E
5|$|A <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> among {{scholars}} is {{the role}} played by Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E

5|$|Another <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> {{came from}} the navy's heavy use of {{corporal}} punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{imposition}} of new taxation categories {{that were a}} departure from both secular Ottoman law and the traditionally accepted Islamic law drew local Muslim anger at the authorities.

That day, Ibrahim Pasha convened {{with all of the}} clan leaders from both cities to demand the drafting of one out of every five Muslim men of fighting age. The order would begin with the conscription of 200 men from Jerusalem, a combined 3,500 men from Sanjak al-Quds and Sanjak Nablus, and 500 men from Hebron. By May 1834, the only prominent ally of the Egyptians in Palestine was the Abd al-Hadi clan.|$|E

5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were the scenes set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry rebuilt his {{alliance}} with Fulk of Anjou, {{this time by}} marrying Matilda to Fulk's eldest son, Geoffrey. The pair were betrothed in 1127 and married the following year. It is unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping his son-in-law's status deliberately uncertain. Similarly, although Matilda was granted a number of Normandy castles {{as part of her}} dowry, it was not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. Fulk left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine. The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not particularly like each other and the disputed castles proved a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention,</b> resulting in Matilda returning to Normandy later that year. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but in 1131 the couple were reconciled. Much to the pleasure and relief of Henry, Matilda then gave birth to a sequence of two sons, Henry and Geoffrey, in 1133 and 1134.|$|E
5|$|Other {{remains of}} similar animals were found {{throughout}} the late 19th century and 20th century. Another well-preserved skeleton from the slightly older Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada, was named T. warreni by William Parks in 1926. This skeleton had notable differences from T. neglectus, and so Charles M. Sternberg placed it in a new genus, Parksosaurus, in 1937. Sternberg also named an additional species, T. edmontonensis, based on another articulated skeleton, this time including a partial skull (NMC8537), and {{drew attention to the}} genus' heavy build and thick bones. Due to these differences from the regular light hypsilophodont build, he suggested that the genus warranted its own subfamily, Thescelosaurinae. T. edmontonensis has, since Peter Galton's 1974 review, generally been considered a more robust individual (possibly the opposite sex of the type individual) of T. neglectus. However, Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of Thescelosaurus and regarded the specimen as of uncertain placement within the genus. The other <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> regarding T. edmontonensis is its ankle, which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted, but which was regarded by William J. Morris (1976) as truly different from T. neglectus.|$|E

5|$|Ottoman conquests {{led to the}} Battle of Krbava field (1493) and the Battle of Mohács (1526), both decisive Ottoman victories, {{the latter}} of which caused a {{succession}} crisis in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the 1527 election in Cetin, Ferdinand I of Habsburg {{was chosen as the}} new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire, which had extended as far as Lika in the immediate hinterland of the region since 1522. As the region became a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contention</b> between the Habsburgs, Ottomans, and Venetians, its defense was given high importance in the newly established Croatian Military Frontier, as exemplified by the Uskoks of Senj. After the Ottoman conquest of their original base in Klis, the Uskoks established a new headquarters in Nehaj Fortress as a bulwark against westward expansion by the Ottomans. They also launched raids against Christian communities under Ottoman rule and Venetian commerce and subjects. Increasing conflict between the Uskoks and Venice culminated in 1615– 1617 Uskok War, which resulted in the resettling of the Uskoks, whose final years in Senj were marked by piracy and looting. Between 1684 and 1689, the Ottomans were forced to retreat from Lika and the entire hinterland of the region.|$|E
