Purnell panics when he sees Billy in his car, but after a short pursuit, Purnell is arrested. The agents fail to find Billy in the vehicle. Elsewhere, Josh Underwood is abducted {{at a gas station}} while looking at a horse trailer. The symbol appears on the trailer.|$|E
5|$|The {{transporter}} {{had originally}} been developed for the television series {{as a matter of}} convenience; it would have been prohibitively expensive to show the Enterprise land on every new planet. For the redesign Michelson felt that the transporter should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> at work. The space between the transporter platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were scrambling to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher’s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked to disengage from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with {{a part of his}} forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon’s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had read into his enemy’s intentions and directed <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> to support Marmont.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Light and Galileo {{did meet}} at Ascot in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, {{for which the}} Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old was sent off the 1/2 {{favourite}} ahead of Fantastic Light at 7/2. The race {{was the subject of}} considerable advance publicity, and was portrayed as a clash between the two most <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> in European racing; Godolphin, represented by Fantastic Light, and Ballydoyle/Coolmore represented by Galileo. As in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, Dettori settled Fantastic Light in the early stages before moving him out to challenge in the straight. Galileo had already taken the lead but Fantastic Light moved up and went level a furlong out. The two horses raced side-by-side for several strides, but Galileo then pulled ahead to win by two lengths.|$|E
5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality {{was one of the}} most <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E

25|$|Wales was not colonized by the Vikings {{significantly}} as {{in eastern}} England. The Vikings did, however, settle in small {{numbers in the}} south around St Davids, Haverfordwest, and the Gower.

The Vikings, however, were not able to set up a Viking state or control Wales, owing to the <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> of Welsh kings, and, unlike in Scotland, the aristocracy was relatively unharmed.|$|E
25|$|A trial {{date was}} not set {{for almost a}} year.

This prompted Oregon’s new governor, Walter M. Pierce, to formally ask the United States Attorney General for assurances that the case would go forward. The Attorney General confirmed that the prosecution would proceed. The trial date was finally set for April 1924.|$|E
25|$|Very {{early on}} 28 June 1778, Wilhelm von Knyphausen's {{division}} {{set out from}} Monmouth Court House, followed {{a few hours later}} by Cornwallis' division. Lee neglected to scout the area and announced to his subordinates that he had no plan of battle other than to act according to circumstances. He only began moving forward at 7:00 AM with 5,000 troops to bring on the Battle of Monmouth. When Lee began to threaten the British rear guard, Clinton turned back to help with <b>powerful</b> <b>forces.</b> After some tentative attacks, Lee's troops began withdrawing in confusion but not panic.

25|$|The Plumed Serpent, an {{ideogram}} of {{the metaphor}} of Quetzalcoatl, alludes {{to one of the}} most <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> of nature. A Said metaphor is recorded in the Nahuatl language:Quetzalcoatl: he was the wind; he was the guide, the road sweeper of the rain gods, of the masters of the water, of those who Brough rain. And when the wind increased, it was said, the dust swirled up, it roared, howled, became dark, blew in all directions; there was lightning; it grew wrathful.The metaphor served to not only describe a powerful seasonal phenomenon, but was also the title of rulership and priestly office; additionally, the name figured in Toltec ties as a military title and emblem.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 August 917, the battle between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines began by the river Achelous near the modern village Acheloi, 8 {{kilometers}} {{to the north of}} Anchialus (modern Pomorie) on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. The Byzantine generals planned to outflank the right Bulgarian wing in order to detach Simeon's troops from the Balkan Passes. The Bulgarian ruler concentrated his most <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> in the two wings and left the centre relatively weak in order to surround the enemy when the centre would yield to the Byzantine attack. Simeon himself was in charge of large cavalry reserves hidden behind the hills which were intended to strike the decisive blow.|$|E
25|$|Polyploidy is a {{very common}} feature in plants. It is {{believed}} that at least half plants are or have been polyploids. Polyploidy leads to genome doubling, thus generating functional redundancy in most genes. The duplicated genes may attain new function, either by changes in expression pattern or changes in activity. Polyploidy and gene duplication {{are believed to be}} among the most <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> in evolution of plant form. It is not known though, why genome doubling is such a frequent process in plants. One probable reason is the production of large amounts of secondary metabolites in plant cells. Some of them might interfere in the normal process of chromosomal segregation, leading to polypoidy.|$|E

25|$|In time, Mayor Pântea found {{a middle}} ground between the various {{political}} factors, and selected his own administrative team from a mixture of Bessarabian and Soviet clerks. In addition to Vice Mayor Vidrașcu, it included old unionist combatants (Vladimir Chiorescu, Elefterie Sinicliu) and Odessan notabilities (Dr. M. Zaevloshin, architect Vladimir Cundert). Reportedly, City Hall did not exercise political repression against known communists, who were merely required to register on a special list. The Romanian Mayor was also careful to preserve contacts with the two most <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> battling each other for control, namely the Germans and the Soviet partisans. His intervention saved the life of Yelena Rudenko, sister of Soviet General Fyodor Tolbukhin, who had fallen severely ill at the family home in Odessa.|$|E
25|$|Last of the Gaderene by Mark Gatiss and Deadly Reunion by Terrance Dicks and Barry Letts {{are both}} close homages to the Delgado/Pertwee stories. In Last of the Gaderene, the Master, {{disguised}} as Police Inspector LeMaitre, assists an alien race called the Gaderene to invade Earth, {{starting with a}} small village. In Deadly Reunion, he attempts to control <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> through a cult, but finds himself {{at the mercy of}} a godlike alien. The Delgado Master also appears in Verdigris by Paul Magrs, a more parodic take on the Pertwee era. The eponymous genie spends much of the novel impersonating the Master, who is in fact controlling him: the real Master appears in the novel's epilogue, buying a Chinese takeaway.|$|E

The most <b>powerful</b> <b>forces</b> {{in the land}} were the great Hiberno-Norman Earldoms such as the Geraldines, the Butlers and the de Burghs (Burkes), who controlled vast territories which were almost independent of the governments in Dublin or London. The Lord of Ireland was King John, who, on his visits in 1185 and 1210, had helped secure the Norman areas from both {{the military and the}} administrative points of view, {{while at the same time}} ensuring that the many Irish kings were brought into his fealty; many, such as Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair, owed their thrones to him and his armies.|$|E
