50|$|In December 2010 Bournemouth Council {{announced}} that ASR would {{return in the}} spring of 2011 to make modifications to the reef. Four bags were to be situated on the south-east corner of the reef and a further three <b>pillow</b> <b>bags</b> between existing sections of the reef. The intention is that the wave depth will be improved through the gentler slope thus created, resulting in the right-hand ride length extended to 65metres. ASR will receive £55,000 on completion of this work out of the £150,000 withheld final payment. In April 2011 one bag was removed and another repaired after what was suspected to be propeller damage from an unknown boat colliding with the reef. The reef was closed during the summer of 2011 having been closed for safety reasons in March, in July Bournemouth Councillor Rod Cooper, Cabinet Member for Economy & Tourism {{announced that}} ASR ltd would undertake the repair work and begin the improvement work in early August. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement on the repair works for the Boscombe reef and {{that we will be able}} to start the improvement works at the same time. This remains our flagship project and, as ever, we are committed to delivering a right-hand wave that Bournemouth and ourselves can be proud of.” Nick Behunin, Managing Director of ASR Ltd, July 2011 ASR Ltd began the repair work in mid August 2011. In October 2011 Bournemouth council announced that due to the autumn weather the repair and improvement work would not be completed until spring 2012. ASR went into Liquidation in September 2012. By September 2013 no further work had been undertaken and the reef remained closed.In October 2013 Mark Smith, service director for tourism at Bournemouth Council, was quoted as saying “The council has successfully reached an insurance settlement for the surf reef and so is now undertaking the necessary work to ensure the reef is safe for people to use. This is progressing well and the reef will form an integral part of the Coastal Activity Park, which is scheduled to open in Spring 2014.”. Bournemouth council received £306,531 in respect of two insurance claims for damage to the reef, the council's intention being to repair the reef to its original condition and reopen it in April 2014.

5000|$|In early 1953, Saunders-Roe at Anglesey {{completed}} the Mark 3 airborne lifeboat to be fitted underneath the Avro Shackleton maritime reconnaissance aircraft.

Dropped from a height of 700 ft, the Mark 3 descended under four 42 ft parachutes {{at a rate of}} 20 ft per second into the rescue zone. As the lifeboat dropped, pressurized bottles of carbon dioxide inflated the self-righting chambers at the bow and stern. Upon touching the water, the parachutes were released to blow away, and a drogue opened to slow the boat's drift and aid in the survivors reaching the lifeboat. At the same time, two rockets fired, one to each side, sending out floating lines to provide easier access to the lifeboat for ditched airmen. Doors that opened from the outside provided access to the interior, and the flat deck was made to be self-draining. The craft was powered by a Vincent Motorcycles HRD T5 [...] engine with enough fuel to give a range of 1250 mi. Sails and a fishing kit were provided, as well as an awning and screen to protect against sun and sea spray.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY One Line Pitch: A {{boutique}} {{paint and}} textile retailer selling an edited palette of paints and a unique line of textiles to customers having {{a penchant for}} locally produced, environmentally friendly products for the well lived and well loved home. Business Summary: We offer professional architectural color consulting services, specifying our own tested and edited palette of premium paint colors. Our line of paints coordinates directly to a line of modern textiles, screen-­‐printed locally in Portland, Oregon. The paints are sold by the quart or gallon and the textiles are sold by the yard in our Pearl District retail location. Look out for our tote <b>bags,</b> <b>pillows</b> and other textiles for the table as well. Product/Services: Bolt and Brush will offer professional, architectural color consulting services and a premium line of environmentally friendly paints for retail sale. A line of textiles, designed and screen-­‐printed locally, will also be sold by the yard. Other ancillary products made from the same yardage sold in the store like tote <b>bags,</b> <b>pillows</b> and textiles for the dining table will also be made locally and sold both online and in retail stores. Target Market: Bolt and Brush’s targeted customer, both male and female, is design savvy with a strong appreciation for locally produced goods that are also environmentally friendly. Typically these consumers have at least some level of higher education. They {{are in the middle}} to upper middle class income range and despite the economic downturn; these customers are still financially capable of make purchases for premium goods and services. Management: Sarah Miller, Founder and sole employee, having color and textile design experience in multiple industries, a BFA in Textile Design and the near completion of an MBA. Sarah’s natural inclination is towards the arts and design, but steadfast persistence in the practicalities of opening a business makes her a likely candidate for entrepreneurial success in the design field. Sales/Marketing Strategy: Bolt 2 ̆ 6 Brush’s marketing strategy focuses initially on local support, i. e. newspaper and magazine write-­‐ups, radio spots, and word of mouth from satisfied customers of the color consultation process. The company will gain needed brand awareness nationally with a strong on-­‐line presence and personality that taps into the design-­‐centric community. Financial Strategy: We have established a three-­‐year ramp up period of developing brand recognition in the online design community using guerilla-­‐marketing tactics. At the end of the three-­‐year period, once the strength of the brand has been established, we will invest in the overhead of a retail storefront, which will allow for additional avenues for growth. Risk Assessment: The risk involved lies mostly on Sarah Miller and her spouse. 50, 000 in seed money is from their personal funds and Sarah would be compromising other career opportunities by focusing her creative energies on growing the business. The risk of failure, otherwise, at this stage is minimal and will affect few. The worst-­‐case scenario would be that customers would not respond to the patterns and colors brought to market. If this occurred, Sarah would shift the focus of her business and reevaluate the company’s direction...|$|R
40|$|Cry Bar is a Beijing-based {{start-up}} company comprising a relaxed lounge dedicated to providing comfortable and private spaces {{in which young}} people can pour out their feelings to well-trained consultants and get a good cry. It intends to gain an advantage {{of being the first}} company to target a completely new sector in China, i. e. young citizens who find themselves under pressure. It aims to become a leading provider of emotional support to local white-collar workers and college students. Market research already conducted has suggested a ready market for such a venture. Guo Xin, who has a good knowledge of starting a new venture, will be the sole manager of Cry Bar. The company is scheduled to begin operations on October 1 st 2009 and will recruit 4 employees, including one caterer, two servers and a part-time accountant. Training will be given to the two servers to deliver a professional and personalised customer service in response to the needs of such a highly pressured group. Cry Bar’s initial marketing strategy is to send out attractive leaflets to office workers and students around Zhongguan Village. The largest free-access social networking website (xiaonei. com) will be used as a communication platform to give Cry Bar a high exposure rate. Moreover, cc 98. com, which is the most famous BBS (on-line forum) has a large number of Beijing bar fans, will also be utilised to implement online marketing. Psychological clinics and other bars in Beijing will be direct competitors to Cry Bar, especially the existing “venting bar”, which provides a series of venting facilities including punch <b>bags,</b> <b>pillows</b> and a screaming room, although the venting bar has problems in terms of its operation and pricing policy, and efforts have been made to enable Cry Bar overcoming such operational drawbacks.

40|$|The Veggie {{vegetable}} {{production system}} was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2014. Veggie {{was designed by}} ORBITEC to be a compact, low mass, low power vegetable production system for astronaut crews. Veggie consists of a light cap containing red, blue, and green LEDs, an extensible transparent bellows, and a baseplate with a root mat reservoir. Seeds are planted in plant <b>pillows,</b> small growing <b>bags</b> that interface with the reservoir. The Veggie technology validation test, VEG- 01, was initiated with the first test crop of 'Outredgeous' red romaine lettuce. Prior to flight, lettuce seeds were sanitized and planted in a substrate of arcillite (baked ceramic) mixed with controlled release fertilizer. Upon initiation, astronauts open the packaged plant pillows, install them in the Veggie hardware, and prime the system with water. Operations include plant thinning, watering, and photography. Plants were grown on the ISS for 33 days, harvested, and returned frozen to Earth for analysis. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in controlled environment chambers reproducing ISS conditions of temperature, relative humidity, and CO 2. Returned plant samples were analyzed for microbial food safety and chemistry including elements, antioxidants, anthocyanins and phenolics. In addition the entire plant microbiome was sequenced, and returned plant pillows were analyzed via x-ray tomography. Food safety analyses allowed us to gain approvals for future consumption of lettuce by the flight surgeons and the payload safety office. A second crop of lettuce was grown in 2015, and the crew consumed half the produce, with the remainder frozen for later analysis. This growth test was followed by testing of a new crop in Veggie, zinnias. Zinnias were grown to test a longer duration flowering crop in preparation for tests of tomatoes and other fruiting crops in the future. Zinnias were harvested in February. Samples from the second harvest of lettuce and the zinnia harvest are frozen on the ISS and will return with the next cargo return flight. Some challenges occurred in all tests, especially {{in the area of}} watering, with plants receiving insufficient or excess water leading to stressed growth. Zinnia plants were also challenged with fungal growth. Initial tests with Veggie have given us great insight into future crop production scenarios as we work to develop regular supplemental salad crop production on ISS and larger food production systems for our journey to Mars. Funding for this research comes from NASA's Space Biology Program...|$|R
