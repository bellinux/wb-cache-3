2500|$|These {{laws have}} been {{recorded}} in the media being put into play in Uppsala: the district court punished {{a man with a}} monetary fine and probation for possession of manga-style images. This was appealed and taken to the Court of Appeal. In court, Judge [...] stated that a [...] "person" [...] (as in the definition of a [...] "child") is a human being. The man possessing the illustrations, as well as his lawyer, stated that a comic character is not a person (a comic character is a comic character and nothing else) and that a person does not have cat ears, giant eyes, or a tail and that a person has a nose. Some of the pictures featured illustrations of characters with these unusual body parts. The prosecutor and an expert on child pornography argued that these body parts had no effect and that the comic characters indeed were persons. As examples of what is not a person, the child pornography expert mentioned The Simpsons and Donald Duck. The Court of Appeal upheld the former verdict, for 39 of the 51 pictures, and the monetary fine was reduced. It was immediately further appealed to the Supreme Court. While the Prosecutor General agreed with the verdict of the Court of Appeal, he still recommended that the Supreme Court hear the case, to clarify the issue, and the Supreme Court decided to do so. On 15 June 2012, the Supreme Court found him not guilty. They decided that the images were not realistic and could not be mistaken for real children, and that they therefore could not be counted as exceptions to the constitutional law of freedom of speech. One picture was still considered realistic enough to be defined as child pornography according to Swedish law. However, his possession of it was considered defensible through his occupation as a <b>professional</b> <b>expert</b> of Japanese culture, particularly manga.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of <b>professional</b> <b>experts</b> in the {{diffusion}} of innovative practices that subvert the interests of stakeholders. I do so by studying {{the role of}} external auditors in the diffusion of stock-option backdating in the United States. Practices that are eventually accepted as misconduct may emerge as liminal practices, not categorized as misconduct until social control agents notice, scrutinize, and react to them. I examine how the role of external auditors in the diffusion of stock-option backdating changed as the practice shifted from liminality to being illegal and illegitimate. The findings suggest that <b>professional</b> <b>experts</b> involvement in the diffusion of liminal practices is highly responsive to the institutional environment. Initially, <b>professional</b> <b>experts</b> diffuse these practices via local networks. However, when the legal environment becomes more stringent, implying that the practice will become illegitimate, these offices reverse their role and extinguish the practice. The larger network remains largely uninvolved in both the diffusion, and extinguishment, of the liminal practice...|$|R

5000|$|The former ASTM F1677 was {{the test}} method for the Brungraber Mark II (also known as Portable Inclinable Articulated Strut Tribometer or PIAST) device, {{and the former}} ASTM F1679 test method was written for the English XL Variable Incidence Tribometer (VIT). Shortly after being {{published}} in 2004, ASTM withdrew these standards in 2006, with no replacement.

[...] ASTM offers the following, similar 'withdrawn rationale' for F1677: [...] "Formerly under the jurisdiction of Committee F13 on Pedestrian/Walkway Safety and Footwear, this test method was withdrawn as an active ASTM standard by action of the Committee of Standards (COS) on September 30, 2006 for failure to include an approved precision statement (violating Section A21 of the Form and Style for ASTM Standards), and for including reference to proprietary apparatus where alternatives exist (violating Section 15 of the Regulations Governing ASTM Technical Committees)."
