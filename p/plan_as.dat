5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a <b>plan</b> <b>as</b> the need arose.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1909 Bogue plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been {{considered}} for a civic center. The Civic Auditorium (later the Opera House, now McCaw Hall), the ice arena (later Mercer Arena), and the Civic Field (rebuilt in 1946 as the High School Memorial Stadium), all built in 1927 had been placed there based on that <b>plan,</b> <b>as</b> was an armory (the Food Circus during the fair, later Center House).|$|E

5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered all}} the Muslim armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya.

5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to the Marshall <b>Plan</b> <b>as</b> an important application of moral law to public policy.

The scrapping was delayed so Melbourne could be studied by the People's Liberation Army Navy (<b>PLAN)</b> <b>as</b> part of a secret project to develop a Chinese aircraft carrier and used to train PLAN aviators in carrier flight operations.|$|E

5|$|The {{opportunity}} to create an entire batch of locomotives within the 8P category was declined by the Railway Executive.

5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of <b>plan.</b> <b>As</b> Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E
5|$|Brian Griffin is {{a strict}} high school English teacher at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico who never accepts late {{homework}} and is demanding of his students.

However, instead of allowing him back in, Mr. Griffin decides to make him repeat the class next semester. Fellow students in the class include David Ruggles, Jeff Garrett, Betsy Cline, and Susan McConnell. Mark suggests kidnapping Mr. Griffin, and convinces David, Jeff, and Betsy to join in on the <b>plan</b> <b>as</b> a way of scaring him and getting revenge because they feel he has treated them poorly.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able {{to attack the}} Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this <b>plan</b> <b>as</b> excellent.|$|E

Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his <b>plan,</b> <b>as</b> well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform <b>plan</b> <b>as</b> well as the disarming of the resistance {{as part of the}} transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1947 Molotov {{took part}} in all four {{conferences}} of foreign ministers of the victorious states in World War II. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, {{at the direction of}} the Soviet government, condemned the Marshall <b>Plan</b> <b>as</b> imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan. The plan created several bilateral relations between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).|$|E
5|$|In 1925, however—the year bids from {{contractors}} were to {{be entertained}} by the city—the project was halted and the project's engineering staff laid off. Officially, the plan was delayed {{due to lack of}} funding, but Hylan and New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) Chairman John Delaney also wanted to secure freight service for the tunnel. The status of the tunnel as mixed-use created tension and deadlock between Hylan, Delaney and the New York State Transit Commission; the latter emphasized passenger service for the tunnel. After an investigation issued by Governor Al Smith, planners eliminated freight service from the <b>plan,</b> <b>as</b> per the Nicoll-Hofstadter Act signed into law by the governor; this then led to lack of interest from contractors.|$|E
5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority {{refused to accept the}} <b>plan,</b> <b>as</b> they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original plan would have had the tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E
