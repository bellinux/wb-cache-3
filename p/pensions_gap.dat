30|$|The Oaxaca-Blinder {{decomposition}} {{procedure is}} used to quantify the share of different explaining factors concerning {{the development of the}} gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap.</b> For the older cohort, differences in education and employment history account for 60  % of the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> in the entitlements from individual employment, for 65  % of the difference in the statutory pension entitlements, and for 54  % of the difference in the old age incomes. The largest share of explained difference can be ascribed to the duration of full-time employment in the private sector: If older women were employed full-time in the private sector for the same duration as their male counterparts the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> would be reduced by 67  % for the statutory pension entitlements and by 55  % for the old age incomes. Even though we find distinct differences in the level of education, this explains only a relatively small amount of the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> (3 to 6  %). For the younger cohort the duration of full-time employment in the private sector contributes an even higher share than for the older cohort: If younger women were in this status for the same duration as men the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> would be reduced by 77  % for statutory pension entitlements and by 59  % for old age incomes. The increased prevalence of part-time employment for the younger cohort is also mirrored in the results. If women showed reduced levels of part-time employment comparable to their male counterparts, the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> would increase by 22  % (statutory pension entitlements) and 16  % (old age incomes). The relevant shares in the older cohort amount to 15  % and 13  %.|$|R
30|$|Societal {{changes such as}} the {{increased}} prevalence of divorces and {{a greater share of}} unmarried couples also imply a growing importance of individual pension entitlements. Various institutional measures were introduced to improve women’s old age security in the different pillars of the old age pension system: pension entitlements for periods of childcare were improved in the statutory pension scheme for parents of children born after 1992, vesting periods for eligibility were shortened in occupational pension schemes and special state subsidies for parents were introduced for the Riester pension schemes. However, the present study concludes that so far neither these measures nor higher levels of education or {{the increased}} participation in employment have led to a distinct reduction of the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> for the younger cohort examined. Regulations within the statutory pension scheme do reduce the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> and the compensatory effect of child benefits will most probably lead to a reduction of the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> for future generations.

The result will {{run counter to the}} primary objectives of social security that aims to eliminate poverty of the aging population and narrow down the gap between the rich and poor. In fact, given that pensions are inheritable, the pension deficit is not necessarily connected with the aging population, and there are a few uncertainties about the effect of the retirement delay over the alleviation of the pension deficit (Zhang 2006). Yet, if we put the growing life expectancy into consideration, the <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> will be in a correlation with the aging population. By extending retirement age, the social security program can pool more funds because people have to pay more money into their pension accounts for a longer time, which could offset the effect of the retirement delay over closing the <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> (Zhang 2007).|$|R

30|$|Societal changes, {{such as the}} {{increasing}} number of divorces and the high proportion of non-married couples, lead to a rising importance of individual old-age incomes above the poverty line for women. Although this goal seems increasingly attainable due to a rise in female employment participation, inequalities on the labor market continue to have negative implications for women’s career and earning potential. Based on data on “Old Age Provisions in Germany (AVID) 2005 ” this study analyzes the influence of different aspects of employment histories on the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> in West Germany. We compare projected old-age incomes including statutory pension entitlements, occupational and private pensions for two cohorts born in 1942 – 1946 and 1957 – 1961. Using Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition techniques we quantify the share of different factors in explaining the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap.</b> The study concludes that so far neither women’s higher levels of education nor their increased employment participation have led to a distinct reduction in the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap.</b> It still amounts to 51  % for the younger cohort, compared to 58  % for the older cohort. Multivariate results show that it is mainly the gap between full-time and part-time employment which causes the continuously large difference in men’s and women’s old-age incomes.|$|R

In this paper we ask, whether this <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> might lead {{to the rise of}} a fourth pillar of retirement income: labor earnings. Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel, we find that retirees with low nonlabor income are more likely to work after normal retirement age. The negative relationship between nonlabor income and the participation probability is robust across educational and employment groups and particularly strong for retirees with low income. We conclude that labor market earnings constitute a pillar of retirement income already today...|$|R

This paper examines the extent to which households are in a position today to close this gap with their personal assets, assuming that they stick to their current saving and asset accumulation behaviour. Four critical factors are relevant to this issue: 1. the anticipated life expectancy, 2. the level of personal assets on retirement, 3. the expected age of retirement and 4. the anticipated interest rate.

30|$|The {{influence}} of various biographical factors on the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> is {{examined in this}} paper for West Germany using data on “Old Age Provisions in Germany (AVID) 2005 ”. The database individually combines process-produced data with specifically compiled survey data. We compare projected old-age incomes including statutory pension entitlements, occupational and private pensions for two cohorts born in 1942 – 1946 and 1957 – 1961. Firstly, the {{influence of}} regulations in the statutory pension scheme is examined by comparing pensions accruing only from individual employment with the overall amount of pensions which includes compensations i.e. for periods of child care or unemployment. In a second step we analyse the influence of additional pension schemes by comparing the statutory pension entitlements with the overall sum of old age incomes including occupational and private pensions. If {{we focus on the}} entitlements accruing from individual employment only, we find a gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> of 61  % in the older cohort and of 59  % in the younger one. Including social compensations in the statutory pension insurance reduces the gender specific difference in pensions to 53  % for the older cohort and 49  % for the younger one. Adding projected old age incomes from occupational schemes and private provisions increases the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> again to a percentage share of 58  % for the older cohort and 51  % for the younger one. Social compensations within the statutory pension system thus clearly function in favour of women.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of various biographical factors on the difference in men’s and women’s old age incomes, the so-called gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap.</b> The development of different pension outcomes is framed theoretically by employing the life course paradigm. The underlying concept of the life course is captured by the term of “endogenous causality”, which implies that the life course is structured by the consequences of former decisions and living conditions. For example, gender specific occupational choices or preferences for certain fields of study lead to labour market positions associated with lower occupational prestige or lower wages. For younger women the situation has improved in various ways: Compared to older cohorts their participation in education and thereby their career chances have improved. Their increased employment participation has a direct positive impact on their individual public pension entitlements. Indirectly, it also improves their chances of realizing occupational pensions and their possibilities for private provisions.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of the phenomenon of increasing gender inequalities that happen at old age regarding women’s pension. Moving from recent life-course theories and studies, this study analyzes the reasons behind gender-biased pension levels and how their cumulative effects result in (continuous) significant gender gaps. The article presents a European overview of <b>pension</b> gender <b>gap,</b> focusing on family and work-life issues in Italy. This is one of the first critical reviews of the small but growing literature and national data concerning the effect of gender inequalities related to <b>pension</b> <b>gaps</b> in Italy. In the past, research on the balance of welfare provision between State, family, and market has ignored gender, while more recent studies have barely explored how gender roles, changing over time, interact with the shifts in pension policies. Considering the effects of work-life balance policies since the 2000 Lisbon agenda process and its development, the study especially focuses on the Italian case within the European context. The article examines how the choices in work-life balance policies vary between different national contexts and welfare regimes, by highlighting the Italian case. In this country, welfare and social policy regimes remain very unbalanced, showing a lack of awareness of family and women’s needs, as in many Southern countries, and Italy is not able to give appropriate answers to these problems and to the question of the growing gender gap. This article finally shows the poignancy of structural and cultural reasons for gender differentiated pension levels in Italy, within the European context, according to patterns of employment, marital, and maternal status between earlier and later generations of women...|$|R
30|$|Even {{though the}} {{retirement}} delay {{is able to}} reduce the <b>pension</b> <b>gap,</b> its impact to the labor market cannot be ignored. Some experts have discussed this question. Li (1997) argues that unemployment rate is related to labor cost. Early retirement means the pensioners can enjoy {{a longer period of}} pension collection, which rise the labor cost. As a result, unemployment rate goes up. Thus, the retirement delay can mitigate employment pressures and the extension of life expectancy makes it feasible. As their life expectancy grows, the insured can get higher return on investment in human capital and become more willing to retire late (Lin and Gong 2007). From an empirical view, Hairault et al. (2010) analyze the boost of the retirement delay to employment. They argued that a low level of statutory retirement age would not only increase the unemployment rate of the insured before retirement but also make more new workers lose their job. The retirement delay can mitigate the structural contradiction created by the oversupply of labor force.|$|R

In contrast, the average pension paid to eastern German women far exceeds that of their western counterparts. A cohort comparison shows a narrowing of the gender gap when it comes to pension entitlements in eastern Germany. This decline is less a result of higher pension entitlements among eastern German women than a consequence of significant drops in pensions among eastern German men. In western Germany, however, the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> has remained consistently high throughout the cohort comparison.

The <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> is supposed to be plugged by the second and third pillars of pension provision. However, people require reliable planning information if they are to exercise greater individual responsibility. It is therefore absolutely essential that adequate information is made available about the level of pension benefits that will be generated by each pillar of old-age pension provision. This paper outlines a number of different means of presenting the level of future pensions and the assumptions on which such extrapolations are necessarily based. Our work is based on an assumed average rate of inflation of 1. 5 % and an average rate of real income growth not exceeding 1. 5 %. This last figure is derived from calculations made in the framework of a macroeconomic simulation model. This model also shows that while the funded pillar of old-age pension provision is not entirely immune to population aging, it is not substantially threatened by a substantial decrease in stock market prices, the so-called "asset meltdown". ...|$|R

The <b>gap</b> in public <b>pension</b> incomes is negligible and reduces the overall <b>pension</b> <b>gap,</b> but only partially. Furthermore, the pension income and contribution gap is significantly larger for more recently arrived immigrant cohorts, consistent with evidence of weaker earnings for this group. We provide age profiles of pension income and contributions and discuss problems in interpreting the results without adjusting for age. Controlling for age and earnings differences, immigrants are still about 11 {{percent less likely to}} make contributions to a private pension program, but there is no difference in the contribution rates out of earnings of those who contribute. Recently arrived immigrants are significantly less likely to make contributions to a private pension program and appear to be neglecting private pension contribution opportunities more than earlier immigrants and the native born, which may have adverse implications for Canada's public retirement programs. ...|$|R

Crucially, {{at a time when}} low interest rates and revised prudential standards strain the ability of life insurers and pension funds to offer guaranteed returns, Europe lacks a framework ensuring the quality and accessibility of long-term investment solutions for small retail investors and defined contribution pension plans. This report considers the potential to steer household financial wealth – accounting for over 60 % of total financial wealth in Europe – towards long-term investing, which would achieve two goals at once: higher growth and higher pensions. It follows a holistic approach that considers both solution design – how to gear product structuring towards long-term investing – and market structure – how to engineer a competitive market setting that is able to deliver high-quality and cost-efficient solutions. The report also considers prudential rules for insurers and pension funds and the potential to build a single market for less-liquid funds, occupational and personal pensions, with improved investor protection. It urges policy-makers to act aggressively to deliver more inclusive, efficient and resilient retail investment markets that are better equipped and more committed to deliver value over the long-term for beneficiaries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{gender issues}} {{with respect to}} public pensions in China. Because provision of public pensions in China is highly fragmented, with different programs applying to different groups of people, {{we focus on the}} largest mandatory public pension program in urban China, the Urban Employees’ Pension Program. The paper uses data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) for 2011 to empirically analyze the causes of gender differences in benefit levels between men and women. We argue that raising the retirement age for women from its current age for most women of 50 would be a major step toward gender equality in public pension benefits. Women would have higher benefits than currently due to having longer working careers, and they may have higher wages {{as a result of their}} longer careers. They would also have higher benefits from the individual accounts pensions due to more years of contributions and investment earnings, and a more generous benefit conversion factor due to the older age when they started receiving benefits. Nonetheless, an important feature of the Chinese public pension system is that the gender gap in benefits is less than the gender gap in earnings. In many countries, the reverse is the situation, in part because women have fewer years of work, as well as lower earnings, than men. We explore reasons why the gender <b>pension</b> <b>gap</b> in China reduces the gender gap in compensation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the pervasiveness of}} women's lack of income security in old age across {{a large number of}} countries, but also points to a number of important policy measures that can be taken to address gender <b>pension</b> <b>gaps.</b> It focuses on how pension systems interact with other social and labour market conditions over women's life courses to increase or decrease gender inequalities in old age. It reviews pension systems to pinpoint the key sources of gender inequality in they way they are structured. The paper shows that crucial policy choices for the protection of women must take into account the conditions for entitlements in pension systems, the types of transfers that are promoted between women and men, the policy tools available to offset gender differences in paid work, earnings and unpaid work and the protection of the most vulnerable social groups through redistributive benefits. The paper concludes with some recommendations to make pension systems more gender equitable and suggests that policies aimed at achieving gender equality in pension rights and benefits need to work on several complementary fronts (including measures regarding pension system design, but also labour market regulation and the reconciliation of work and family life) and consider the diversity of women's situation across social strata as well as across countries.

A proposal made by Tsinghua University shows that China will become a super aging society in 2030, in which one social security retiree will be supported by two workers on average. In order to fix the shortage of pension funds, the proposal believes it is necessary to extend the retirement age to 65  years old. Zheng Bingwen, Director of Center for International Social Security Studies, affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, supports that it is a routine method adopted by the international community to deal with an aging population and an unavoidable way to close the <b>pension</b> <b>gap.</b> Yet, Cai Fang, Director of the Institute of Population and Labor Economics, affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, holds another view. He believes the retirement delay should not be a one-size-fits-all policy. A uniformed approach to extend the retirement age will put into a disadvantageous position the low-skilled manpower that do not have competitive human capital. He thinks that if the retirement delay were carried out, the high-skilled manpower that have an edge in human capital should take the brunt. Ren Haoning, a consultant at China Investment Consulting agency, holds a more pointed attitude toward the retirement delay, saying that it is a “rob Peter to pay Paul” strategy. If the retirement age is put off by a year, the pension deficit can be alleviated by 20 billion yuan a year, on the cost of additional 6 – 7 million people jobless. 13 In the face of the worsening pension crisis and the high unemployment rate, what should the Chinese government do? There are heated discussions among some scholars about whether China should adopt a uniformed or a differentiated approach to the retirement delay.|$|R

In addition, facing problems such as diminishing manpower supply, widening <b>pension</b> fund <b>gap,</b> and decreasing financial pressure, there are growing calls for retirement reform internationally...|$|R
