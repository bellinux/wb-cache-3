40|$|Electrical {{power sources}} used in outer planet {{missions}} {{are a key}} enabling technology for data acquisition and communications. State–of-the-art power sources generate electricity from alpha decay of 238 Pu via thermoelectric conversion. However, production of 238 Pu requires specialist facilities including a nuclear reactor, a source of 237 Np for target irradiation and hotcells to chemically separate neptunium and plutonium within the irradiated targets. These specialist facilities are expensive to build and operate, so naturally, a more economical alternative is attractive to the industry. Within Europe 241 Am is considered a promising alternative heat source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and radioisotope heating units (RHUs). As a daughter product of 241 Pu decay, 241 Am exists in 1000 kgs quantities within the UK civil plutonium stockpile. A chemical separation process is required to extract the 241 Am in a pure form and this paper describes the AMPPEX process (Americium and Plutonium <b>Purification</b> <b>by</b> <b>Extraction),</b> successfully developed {{over the past five}} years to isolate 241 Am in high yield (> 99 %) and to a high purity (> 99 %). The process starts by dissolving plutonium dioxide in nitric acid with the aid of a silver(II) catalyst, which is generated electrochemically. The solution is then conditioned and fed to a PUREX type solvent extraction process, where the plutonium is separated from the americium and silver. The plutonium is converted back to plutonium dioxide and the americium is fed forward to a second solvent extraction step. Here the americium is selectively extracted leaving the silver in the aqueous phase. The americium is stripped from the solvent and recovered from solution as americium oxalate, which is calcined to give americium dioxide as the final product. This paper will describe the development of the separation process over a series of six solvent extraction separation trials using centrifugal contactors. The material produced (~ 4 g 241 Am) was used to make ceramic pellets to establish the behaviour of americium oxide material under high temperature (1450 °C) sintering conditions. The chemical separation process is now demonstrated at concentrations expected on the full scale facility taking this process to TRL 4 - 5...|$|E

Actual radioactive waste samples were destroyed by different techniques according to the character of the matrix. After digestion, the concentrations of existing sta-ble Fe, Ni, and Sr were measured in the original sample using an atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) with a graphite atom-izer (standard deviation 5 – 10 %). A modified combined radiochemical separation procedure was applied for simultaneously determining 63 Ni, 55 Fe, and 90 Sr from a single sample aliquot. The effective analytical separation of these isotopes from other traces found in radioactive waste was achieved using the following methods. The basic procedure for Fe and Ni analysis con-sisted of ferric hydroxide coprecipitation, anion-exchange separation of Fe, and extraction chromatographic separation of Ni on the NiSpec column.

Some 6, 000 molecules of the 48 -kilodalton polypeptide bind with high affinity to one merozoite, the free form of the parasite.

We therefore suggest that the 48 -kilodalton polypeptide partially purified from lymphocyte membranes is the antimalarial lymphocyte factor and that it exerts its inhibitory activity by binding to merozoites, thereby preventing their invasion into erythrocytes. The antimalarial lymphocyte factor or a polypeptide sequence thereof could serve for further probing of invasion at the molecular level...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to develop and validate a rapid quantification method able to screen many samples of yam bean seeds to determine the content of two toxic polyphenols, namely pachyrrhizine and rotenone. The analytical procedure described {{is based on the}} use of an internal standard (dihydrorotenone) and is divided in three steps: microwave assisted <b>extraction,</b> <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> solid phase <b>extraction</b> and assay <b>by</b> ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Each step was included in the validation protocol and the accuracy profiles methodology was used to fully validate the method. The method was fully validated between 0. 25 mg and 5 mg pachyrrhizin per gram of seeds and between 0. 58 mg/g and 4 mg/g for rotenone. More than one hundred samples from different accessions, locations of growth and harvest dates were screened. Pachyrrhizine concentrations ranged from 3. 29 mg/g to lower than 0. 25 mg/g while rotenone concentrations ranged from 3. 53 mg/g to lower than 0. 58 mg/g. This screening along with principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) analyses allowed the selection of the more interesting genotypes in terms of low concentrations of these two toxic polyphenols.

40|$|It is {{important}} to evaluate the impact of pesticides on human health because exposure to these compounds {{has been linked to}} harmful effects in many research studies. This exposure may be particularly harmful during the early stages of development (e. g. the prenatal period). The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop an analytical strategy for quantifying a number of pesticides and their metabolites in meconium (the neonate׳s first faeces), in order to characterize the extent of foetal exposure. The meconium sample was dried and grinded in order to homogenize the sample, prior to solid-liquid <b>extraction</b> and a <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> solid-phase <b>extraction</b> using a weak anion mixed-mode polymeric sorbent. Analyte separation and quantification was performed by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Five pesticide families (carbamates, organophosphates, pyrethroids, phenylureas and phenoxy herbicides) and their metabolites could be quantified in meconium with limits of quantification ranging between 0. 2 ng/g and 200 ng/g. This method was applied to a set of 171 meconium samples collected in the Picardie region of northern France. The highest prevalence was observed for metabolites of organophosphates and carbamates (57. 9 % and 22. 8 %, respectively). The parent pesticides were rarely present and were only found at very low concentrations, except for the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and cypermethrin, which were found in 7. 6 % of meconium samples at concentrations of between 43. 8 and 480 ng/g. The most frequently detected contaminant was the organophosphate metabolite dimethyl thiophosphate detected in 49. 1 % of the samples and quantified with a median concentration of 344 ng/g. These data evidence significant foetal exposure to organophosphate pesticides, pyrethroids and carbamates. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants (WWTPs) {{are one of}} the main sources of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds in freshwater ecosystems, and several studies have reported bioaccumulation of these compounds in different organisms in those ecosystems. River biofilms are exceptional indicators of pollution, but very few studies have focused on the accumulation of these emerging contaminants. The objectives of this study were first to develop an efficient analytical methodology for the simultaneous analysis of 44 pharmaceuticals and 13 endocrine disrupting compounds in biofilm, and second, to assess persistence, distribution, and bioaccumulation of these contaminants in natural biofilms inhabiting a WWTP-impacted river. The method is based on pressurized liquid <b>extraction,</b> <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> solid-phase <b>extraction,</b> and analysis <b>by</b> ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) in tandem. Recoveries for pharmaceuticals were 31 - 137 %, and for endocrine disruptors 32 - 93 %. Method detection limits for endocrine disruptors were in the range of 0. 2 - 2. 4 ng g- 1, and for pharmaceuticals, 0. 07 - 6. 7 ng g- 1. A total of five endocrine disruptors and seven pharmaceuticals were detected in field samples at concentrations up to 100 ng g- 1 This study has been co-financed by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the project WATER-Fate (CTM 2012 - 38314 -C 0201), by the EU through the FP 7 project GLOBAQUA (Grant agreement No. 603629) and by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

40|$|A novel, fast, {{and simple}} method to {{determine}} three phytoestrogens [xanthohumol (XN), isoxanthohumol (IXN), and 8 -prenylnaringenin (8 PN) ] in beer samples by {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} with diode-array detection has been developed. The selected method involves <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> solid phase <b>extraction</b> and separation achieved on a C 18 column by using a gradient elution program. This consists of a mixture of acetonitrile, water, and methanol (all of them with 1 % of acetic acid) at a flow ratio of 1 mL/min. The detection wavelengths were set at 370 nm for XN and 280 nm for IXN and 8 PN. Average analyte recoveries were higher than 75 % with relative standard deviations lower than 5 %. The detection limits were between 0. 01 and 0. 08 mg/L, and the quantitation limits were between 0. 02 and 0. 15 mg/L. The method has been validated and applied {{to the analysis of}} several types of commercial beers obtained from local markets, where results showed the presence of IXN and 8 PN in most of the samples and the absence of XN. Thus, the presented method gives to brewing chemists a validated, reliable, fast, and affordable analytical tool to identify and quantify the three most important hop's prenylflavonoids in beer. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|Commercial {{actinide}} oxides, after <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> {{standard procedures}} (<b>extraction</b> chromatography, precipitation, etc.) {{are reduced to}} metals. The actinide metals Am, Bk, Cf, Es are obtained by metallothermic reduction in vacuum with lanthanum metal, Cm, Ac, Pu by the same process with Th metal as reductant. U, Np, Pu metals are prepared by tantalothermic reduction of the carbides. These volatile metals are efficiently refined by repeated evaporation and condensation. Pa and Th are prepared in a pure form in a van Arkel process by thermal dissociation of their iodides starting from the carbide. Large single crystals of the more volatile metals (Am, Cm) are prepared by physical vapour deposition and annealing at high temperature. Single crystals of Th and Pa are obtained by chemical vapour deposition with I 2 as transporting agent. Pure actinide compounds in powder form are prepared by direct synthesis from the elements. Composition {{and structure of the}} compouds can be controlled by the reaction conditions. Single crystals of the actinide, dioxides, dipnictides and dichalcogenides are produced by chemical vapour transport with TeCl 4 or I 2 as transporting agent. Monopnictide single crystals are prepared by chemical vapour deposition using the van Arkel process. The crystals are characterized by chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction (Debye-Scherrer, Weissenberg, Laue) techniques...|$|R
