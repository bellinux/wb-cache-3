30|$|Cognitive radios enable an {{adaptive}} approach in utilizing existing wireless spectrum. This approach introduces a different concept of physical layer operations and ultimately affects the whole upper layers. Despite the challenges, cognitive radios have become {{popular in the}} past few years. The main reasons are because they provide the ability for secondary users (SUs) to use and share the licensed <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> opportunistically and support prioritization for the transmissions of licensed/primary users (PUs), simultaneously. Hence, cognitive radios are potential to increase the spectrum utilization. In order to use the licensed <b>spectrum</b> <b>band,</b> SUs must have at least one cognitive radio transceiver. With the cognitive radio transceivers, SUs search for vacant spectrum, called spectrum opportunity, by conducting spectrum sensing. Since PUs have the authority to use the licensed <b>spectrum</b> <b>band,</b> SUs must not interrupt the transmissions of PUs by performing reconfiguration of transmission parameters or moving to other vacant <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> [1]. This creates dynamic use of <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands,</b> where the SUs are able to switch among different spectrums.|$|R

40|$|Cognitive radio {{has been}} {{identified}} as a promising solution to the so-called spectrum scarcity problem. The basic idea of this paradigm is to allow unlicensed users to access in an opportunistic and non-interfering manner some licensed bands temporarily unoccupied by licensed users. Cognitive radio is expected to dramatically improve the efficiency of spectrum usage. However, before this paradigm can turn into reality, a full understanding of the spectrum dynamic usage in real wireless communications systems is required. Current spectrum utilization has already been evaluated in some measurement campaigns all over the world. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous study has assessed the spectrum occupancy and the feasibility of the cognitive radio technology in different allocated <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> under Spanish regulations. In this context, this paper presents a <b>pioneer</b> <b>spectrum</b> occupancy measurement in Spain conducted in the frequency range from 75 MHz to 7075 MHz in an outdoor environment in urban Barcelona.

30|$|Currently, most of {{the above}} {{subsystems}} are designed in isolation and deployed in a chimney-type manner. From the spectrum usage perspective, {{most of the}} existing subsystems have been allocated exclusive <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands.</b> However, there is quite limited <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> that could be utilized to support new platforms or new services, since most of favorable <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> have already been licensed to various existing services. In the contrary, SIN is well recognized as a promising paradigm to bridge and unify various subsystems for building an integrated and heterogeneous network system, where spectrum can be efficiently utilized via various dynamic spectrum sharing techniques. Dynamic spectrum sharing among subsystems will be one trend to improve spectrum utilization and support more emerging services.|$|R
30|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{wireless}} services shows an inevitable overcrowding of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands,</b> in large {{part due to the}} rapid increase of wireless mobile services in recent years. Conventionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) statically assigned <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> to licensed users for exclusive use on a long-term basis, precluding anyone else from access [1, 2]. Yet, analysis of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> clearly indicate that current FCC policies have created severely under-utilized channels, causing a bottleneck for new wireless services [1, 3, 4]. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is the proposed solution to alleviate the overcrowding of bands by allowing licensed primary users (PUs) to share unused spectrum with unlicensed secondary users (SUs) in an opportunistic fashion [1, 5].|$|R

30|$|Meanwhile, the {{recently}} proposed cognitive radio (CR) technology {{is able to}} address the spectrum scarcity problem by allowing the secondary users who have no licensed <b>spectrum</b> <b>band</b> to share the <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> licensed to the primary users [2]. In {{order to protect the}} licensed primary users, the activities of the secondary users cannot affect the QoS of the primary users. Various problems in CR networks have been studied, such as resource allocation [3 – 8] and security issues [9, 10]. Generally, if the primary users cannot benefit from allowing the secondary users to transmit using their licensed <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands,</b> the primary users have no incentive to do so. Therefore, in the situation where the primary networks are overloaded and the secondary networks are light loaded, some primary users can direct their data traffic to the secondary networks for better service experience, and as a reward for the secondary networks, they can access the licensed <b>spectrum</b> <b>bands</b> as long as the QoS of the primary users is satisfied. Particularly, CR networks can form small cells to deal with the data traffic offloaded from the primary networks.|$|R
