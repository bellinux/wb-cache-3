50|$|Pay TV only {{began to}} become common after the {{widespread}} installation of cable television {{systems in the}} 1970s and 1980s; early premium channels were most often movie broadcasters such as the US-based Home Box Office and Cinemax, both currently owned by Time Warner. Signals were obtained for <b>distribution</b> <b>by</b> <b>cable</b> companies using C-band satellite dish antennae of up to ten feet in diameter; the first satellite signals were originally unencrypted as extremely few individual end-users could afford the large and expensive satellite receiving apparatus.|$|R
50|$|A Satellite {{contribution}} link or {{service is a}} means to transport video programming by a satellite link from a remote source (such as an outside broadcast unit) to a broadcaster's studio or from the studio to a satellite TV uplink centre (for onward <b>distribution</b> <b>by</b> DTH, <b>cable</b> etc.).|$|R

50|$|On April 18, 2011, Quebecor Media {{launched}} a new 24-hour news channel, Sun News Network; although Quebecor intended to have Sun News replace CKXT-TV, the company instead replaced the channel's entertainment programming with a simulcast of Sun News Network - which was licensed as a Category C specialty service intended only for <b>distribution</b> <b>by</b> <b>cable</b> and satellite providers - on that date. Quebecor would later voluntarily shut down CKXT on November 1, 2011, amid questioning by the CRTC on the company's usage of the station to simulcast Sun News Network. Sun News eventually ceased operations on February 13, 2015, citing persistently low viewership {{and the failure to}} obtain CRTC approval to require mandatory carriage of the channel on domestic pay television providers, and after failed attempts to sell the network to ZoomerMedia (owned by veteran Canadian television executive Moses Znaimer) and Leonard Asper.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, {{as part of}} a {{coalition}} of recording artists, singers, musicians, and others, AFTRA members worked with Congress to enact the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. All three laws granted a performance right in sound recordings {{for a wide range of}} digital uses, including home recording and <b>distribution</b> <b>by</b> internet, <b>cable,</b> and satellite. AFTRA helped develop mechanisms to assure payments to recording artists from the collection and distribution of royalties established by the laws.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s, Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom) began distributing CHAN-TV (channel 8) from Vancouver, British Columbia, CITV-TV (channel 13) from Edmonton, Alberta, and CHCH-TV (channel 11) from Hamilton, Ontario, {{primarily}} for <b>distribution</b> <b>by</b> smaller <b>cable</b> systems throughout Canada. Coincidentally, these stations were, like Cancom, owned (or later acquired) by Western International Communications. As {{a result of their}} early availability, which predated most Canadian specialty channels, these stations (the first two are now owned by Shaw Media, the latter by Channel Zero) continue to have a superstation-type status on analog cable in many smaller Canadian communities, and in the United States along border-area cable systems (such as Buffalo/Niagara Falls, New York, Burlington, Vermont, and Bellingham, Washington).|$|R

40|$|A {{prestressed}} suspension {{structure is}} a type of structures that allows covering long spans due to rational use of structural materials. Prestressing of a suspension structure allows minimizing cinematic displacements. The prestressed suspension structure with the main span equal to 200 m was considered as an object of investigation. Replacement of a single steel main cable of the prestressed suspension structure by the hybrid composite cable with CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) middle layer and external steel layers with cross-section variable <b>by</b> the <b>cable</b> length considerably decreases dead weight of the cable. Hybrid composite cable ensures functioning of the structure in case of destruction of the middle CFRP layer. The considered prestressed suspension structure was investigated by the FEM software ANSYS. Rational steel <b>distribution</b> <b>by</b> the <b>cable</b> length was determined by optimization. Behaviour of the hybrid composite main cable in the case of destruction of the middle CFRP layer was experimentally tested using the physical model. The dynamic coefficient was obtained...|$|R

The module examines issues in the debates that govern scholarly, ethical and political thinking about the actual or desired relationship of media to public life and considers the relative significance and benefits of private, public and mixed-ownership media. This unit discusses `media' regulation and the public means of mass communication, especially the press, radio and television, but also including film and recorded music {{as well as a}} number of newer means of <b>distribution</b> <b>by</b> way of <b>cable,</b> satellite, discs, tapes, etc. Of increasing importance is the internet, which can now be regarded as a `mass medium' in its own right on the grounds of its gradual diffusion to majorities in many countries and its use for a number of public communication functions in the sphere of both entertainment and information. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{high levels}} of poverty and {{inadequate}} domestic food grain production, Kerala {{has been one of}} the most food insecure states in India. Its adverse implications, however, have been mitigated through active state government intervention and highly subsidized public distribution system operated under public vigil. As a result, per capita cereal consumption has increased in spite of a decline in domestic cereal production. Yet, about 80 per cent of the population suffer from inadequate calorie intake. The scale of the public distribution system is substantial; but its effective utilization is less than 50 per cent of the potential due to inadequate economic access and poor quality of food grains. Still the system is not sustainable for fiscal reasons. The ongoing adjustment programme has sought to streamline the food <b>distribution</b> <b>programme</b> <b>by</b> reforming its pricing rule and by targeting it only to the poor. The present article examines its implications for food security and social development in Kerala. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

5000|$|Its first {{chairman}} was Andreas Hermes, who {{had been}} a prominent member of the Centre Party during the Weimar Republic and a three-time minister. He fled to the West in 1946 and was replaced by Jakob Kaiser, another former Centre Party member. Kaiser had been a prominent member of the Centre's left wing, and favoured nationalisation of heavy industries and a land <b>distribution</b> <b>programme</b> suggested <b>by</b> the Communists. However, his criticism of the Communists resulted in him being pushed out in 1947 in favour of the more pliant Otto Nuschke, {{a former member of the}} German Democratic Party. Nuschke and his supporters gradually pushed out those CDU members who were not willing to do the Communists' bidding. This culminated at the Sixth Party Congress in 1952, at which it formally transformed itself into a loyal partner of the Communists. At this gathering, it declared itself [...] "a Socialist party without any limitations" [...] in accordance with the new line of [...] "Christian realism".|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} verify the {{hypothesis}} that the set of food insecure is larger than the set of poor in India. Any attempt to reform safety nets like a food <b>distribution</b> <b>programme</b> <b>by</b> targeting it only to the latter would penalize those who are non-poor but food insecure. Towards this end, the paper attempts to: exemplify the issue with reference to measures and criteria for identifying the poor and food insecure; to estimate the incidence of poverty and food insecurity at the national and state levels; and to examine how far their magnitudes tally across states. This limited exercise shows that aggregate estimates of poverty and food insecurity broadly tally at the national level and for several states. The targeted public distribution system covers the majority of the food insecure who are poor, but excludes those sections/regions whose consumption patterns have changed by choice. This calls not for any income transfer but, if at all, for nutrition education programmes to influence consumer choice.
