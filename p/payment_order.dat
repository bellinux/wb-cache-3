50|$|<b>Payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow was a {{practice}} pioneered by Bernard Madoff, {{and the practice}} has long been controversial. However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow, the New York Stock Exchange sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow on its electronic exchange(s).The NYSE is proposing to pay for limit orders {{in order to put}} more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of <b>payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow that pays only for market <b>orders.</b> <b>Payment</b> for <b>order</b> flow has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the tick size and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, <b>payments</b> for <b>order</b> flow were much larger than they became after 2001 when the tick size in U.S. markets fell to one cent.
