40|$|AbstractIdeal heat {{exchangers}} recover as much heat {{as possible from}} an engine exhaust {{at the cost of}} an acceptable pressure drop. They provide primary heat for a thermoelectric generator (TEG), and their capacity and efficiency is dependent on the material, shape, and type of the heat exchanger. Six different exhaust {{heat exchangers}} were designed within the same shell, and their computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were developed to compare heat transfer and pressure drop in typical driving cycles for a vehicle with a 1. 2 L gasoline engine. The result showed that the serial plate structure enhanced heat transfer by 7 baffles and transferred the maximum heat of 1737 W. It also produced a maximum pressure drop of 9. 7 kPa in a suburban driving cycle. The numerical results for the pipe structure and an empty cavity were verified by experiments. Under the maximum power output condition, only the inclined plate and empty cavity structure undergoes a pressure drop less than 80 kPa, and the largest pressure drop exceeds 190 kPa. In this case, a mechanism with a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch</b> is essential to bypass part of the exhaust...|$|R
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve controller that uses an existing <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> as {{some or all}} of the power source for valve operation. In a high pressure environment, such as downhole in an oil or gas well, the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> between the inside of a pipe and the outside of the pipe may be adequately large to drive a linear slide valve. The valve is operated hydraulically by a piston in a bore. When a higher pressure is applied to one end of the bore and a lower pressure to the other end, the piston moves in response to the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> and drives a valve attached to it. If the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> is too small to drive the piston at a sufficiently high speed, a pump is provided to generate a larger <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> to be applied. The apparatus is conveniently constructed using multiport valves, which can be rotary valves...|$|R

The approach was to adapt the commercially available Fuller-Kinyon pump to feed coal against a <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> of 100 psi or more. The pump was modified and tests performed at various <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials,</b> with differently pitched screws, various screw rotational speeds, and various seal lengths and configurations. Successful operation of the modified Fuller-Kinyon pump was generally limited to <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> of 60 psi or less. Although the results are not conclusive, test data and observations were made that indicated that higher <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> could be attained by further modifications of the test setup. In particular, {{it is recommended that}} further testing be performed after replacing the 40 -horsepower pump motor presently in the test setup with a motor having a significantly high power rating (thereby allowing pump operation with longer seals and at higher <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> than those tested so far) ...|$|R

40|$|During {{passage through}} the {{different}} components of a spray application system, a nematode suspension will undergo pressure changes. The extent of damage to three species of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) (Steinernema carpocapsae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, and Heterorhabditis megidis) in suspension due {{to the effects of}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> was studied. A French pressure cell and press was used to subject the newly emerged EPN suspensions to a series of <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> ranging from 1283 kPa (186 psi) to 10, 690 kPa (1550 psi). Aged suspensions (3 weeks) of H. bacteriophora and H. megidis were also evaluated. Damage was quantified by counting living and dead (whole and pieces) EPNs and by bioassay techniques. As the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> increased, the relative viability of the EPNs decreased. Entomopathogenic nematodes that survived the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> were, in general, able to survive for at least 1 week and maintain infectivity to Galleria mellonella at rates equivalent to EPNs that had not been pressure treated. In general, the relative viabilities of fresh and aged EPNs were equivalent after <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> treatments. The relative viability of the treated EPNs remained above 85 % for <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> {{less than or equal to}} 1283 kPa for H. megidis and 2138 kPa (310 psi) for S. carpocapsae and H. bacteriophora, but decreased rapidly for higher <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials.</b> Greater reduc-tions in relative viability were experienced by Heterorhabditis spp. than S. carpocapsae, indicating that nematode species is an important factor to consider when defining spray operating conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Diagnosis and {{treatment}} of hydrocephalus is hindered {{by a lack of}} systemic understanding of the interrelationships between pressures and flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Control volume analysis provides a fluid physics approach to quantify and relate pressure and flow information. The objective {{of this study was to}} use control volume analysis and magnetic resonance velocity imaging to non-invasively estimate <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> in vitro. Method A flow phantom was constructed and water was the experimental fluid. The phantom was connected to a high-resolution <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor and a computer controlled pump producing sinusoidal flow. Magnetic resonance velocity measurements were taken and subsequently analyzed to derive <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> waveforms using momentum conservation principles. Independent sensor measurements were obtained for comparison. Results Using magnetic resonance data the momentum balance in the phantom was computed. The measured <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> force had amplitude of 14. 4 dynes (pressure gradient amplitude 0. 30 Pa/cm). A 12. 5 % normalized root mean square deviation between derived and directly measured <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> was obtained. These experiments demonstrate one example of the potential utility of control volume analysis and the concepts involved in its application. Conclusions This study validates a non-invasive measurement technique for relating velocity measurements to <b>pressure</b> <b>differential.</b> These methods may be applied to clinical measurements to estimate <b>pressure</b> <b>differentials</b> in vivo which could not be obtained with current clinical sensors. </p...|$|R
