5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{is home to}} a {{world-class}} <b>primate</b> behavioural research centre, Living Links. Living Links consists of a field station and research centre that was developed in a partnership with the University of St Andrews.

5|$|In 2001, the {{discovery}} of Bugtilemur, a fossil <b>primate</b> from Pakistan dating to the Oligocene and initially {{thought to be a}} cheirogaleid lemur, further challenged the theory of lemur origins; however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform <b>primate</b> and not a lemur.|$|E
50|$|The order <b>Primates</b> was {{traditionally}} {{divided into}} two main groupings: prosimians and anthropoids (simians). Prosimians have characteristics more {{like those of the}} earliest <b>primates,</b> and include the lemurs of Madagascar, lorisoids, and tarsiers. Simians include monkeys, apes and hominins. More recently, taxonomists have preferred to split <b>primates</b> into the suborder Strepsirrhini, or wet-nosed <b>primates,</b> consisting of non-tarsier prosimians, and the suborder Haplorhini, or dry-nosed <b>primates,</b> consisting of tarsiers and the simians.|$|R
500|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of lemurs occurred {{in isolation from}} other <b>primates,</b> {{on the island of}} Madagascar, for at least 40million years. Lemurs are <b>primates</b> belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini, which branched off from other <b>primates</b> less than 63mya (million years ago). [...] They share some traits with the most basal <b>primates,</b> and thus are often confused as being ancestral to modern monkeys, apes, and humans. [...] Instead, they merely resemble ancestral <b>primates.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Order <b>Primates</b> {{is part of}} the clade Euarchontoglires, {{which is}} nested within the clade Eutheria of Class Mammalia. Recent {{molecular}} genetic research on <b>primates,</b> colugos, and treeshrews has shown that the two species of colugos are more closely related to <b>primates</b> than to treeshrews, even though treeshrews were at one time considered <b>primates.</b> These three orders make up the clade Euarchonta. The combination of this clade with the clade Glires (composed of Rodentia and Lagomorpha) forms the clade Euarchontoglires. Variously, both Euarchonta and Euarchontoglires are ranked as superorders. Some scientists consider Dermoptera to be a suborder of <b>Primates</b> and use the suborder Euprimates for the [...] "true" [...] <b>primates.</b>|$|R

500|$|<b>Primates</b> first evolved {{sometime}} between the Middle Cretaceous {{and the early}} Paleocene periods on either the supercontinent of Laurasia or in Africa. [...] According to molecular clock studies, the last common ancestor of all <b>primates</b> dates to around 79.6mya, although the earliest known fossil <b>primates</b> are only 54–55million years old. The closest relatives of <b>primates</b> are the extinct plesiadapiforms, the modern colugos (commonly and inaccurately named [...] "flying lemurs"), and treeshrews.

5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the <b>primate</b> brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the <b>primate</b> neocortex. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, working memory, motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E

50|$|Predators of <b>primates</b> include {{various species}} of carnivorans, birds of prey, {{reptiles}} and other <b>primates.</b> Even gorillas {{have been recorded}} as prey. Predators of <b>primates</b> have diverse hunting strategies and as such, <b>primates</b> have evolved several different antipredator adaptations including crypsis, alarm calls and mobbing. Several species have separate alarm calls for different predators such as air-borne or ground-dwelling predators. Predation may have shaped group size in <b>primates</b> as species exposed to higher predation pressures appear to live in larger groups. With their technology and increased intelligence, modern humans are nearly free of threats from non-human predators and are themselves apex predators.|$|R

5|$|In 1092 {{and again}} in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained about what he felt were {{infringements}} of York's rights. The first of these occasions was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter {{was referred to as}} <b>Primate</b> of England. The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury. The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the <b>primate.</b> Hugh the Chanter, {{who was a member of}} the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used. Modern historical opinion is divided, with Frank Barlow, author of The English Church 1066–1154 inclined towards the primatial title, but with Richard Southern, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title. The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts.|$|E

5|$|Jakobsson {{served as}} the game's artist, designer, and programmer. His levels are made by hand in a {{standalone}} level editor. The designer brushes recurring, cloned elements, such as plants and chains, onto the map. The software combines and processes to add shadow. At one point, Rain World included a multiplayer mode, and separate story and custom modes. <b>Primate,</b> who {{is also known as}} James Therrien, wrote Rain World soundtrack, handled the indie studio's business, and designed levels. <b>Primate</b> first found the game on an indie game Internet forum and sent Jakobsson 12 tracks as a successful pitch. He originally composed a chiptune-style soundtrack with his musician partner Lydia Esrig, but turned to field recordings of litter for otherworldly sounds. Rain World music is low-fi and electronic. <b>Primate</b> wanted the music to approximate the game's eclectic visuals, which mix industrial, science fiction, jungle, and various architectural elements. In lieu of traditional character dialogue and narration, Rain World story was partly communicated through its soundtrack. The early game sound is primitive and based on the Slugcat's feelings of fear and hunger, and eventually builds to describe new areas. Rain World has over 3.5 hours of recorded music across 160 tracks. At any given time, between eight and twelve tracks will simultaneously layer to create ambiance and respond to the Slugcat's in-game context. The development team successfully crowdfunded some development costs via Kickstarter in early 2014. By early 2015, about four years into development, the team had switched to the Unity game engine and released a test version of the game to its Kickstarter backers.|$|E
500|$|The early <b>primates</b> {{include both}} nocturnal and diurnal small-bodied species, {{and all were}} arboreal, with hands and feet {{specially}} adapted for maneuvering on small branches. Plesiadapiforms from the early Paleocene are sometimes considered [...] "archaic primates" [...] because their teeth resembled those of early <b>primates,</b> and because they possessed arboreal adaptations, such as a divergent hallux (big toe). Although plesiadapiforms were closely related to <b>primates,</b> they may represent a paraphyletic group from which <b>primates</b> {{may or may not}} have directly evolved, and some genera may have been more closely related to colugos, also known as dermopterans or [...] "flying lemurs", which are thought to be closely related to <b>primates.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>primates,</b> it {{is thought}} that risk of {{infanticide}} is the primary driver for the evolution of socially monogamous relationships. <b>Primates</b> are unusual in that 25% of all species are socially monogamous; additionally, this trait has evolved separately in every major clade. <b>Primates</b> also experience higher rates of infanticide than most other animals, with infanticide rates as high as 63% in some species. Opie, Atkinson, Dunbar, & Shutlz (2013) found strong evidence that male infanticide preceded the evolutionary switch to social monogamy in <b>primates</b> rather than bi-parental care or female distribution, suggesting that infanticide is the main cause for the evolution of social monogamy in <b>primates.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Primates</b> exploit {{a variety}} of food sources. It {{has been said that}} many {{characteristics}} of modern <b>primates,</b> including humans, derive from an early ancestor's practice of taking most of its food from the tropical canopy. Most <b>primates</b> include fruit in their diets to obtain easily digested carbohydrates and lipids for energy. However, they require other foods, such as leaves or insects, for amino acids, vitamins and minerals. <b>Primates</b> in the suborder Strepsirrhini (non-tarsier prosimians) are able to synthesize vitamin C, like most other mammals, while <b>primates</b> of the suborder Haplorrhini (tarsiers, monkeys and apes) have lost this ability, and require the vitamin in their diet.|$|R
