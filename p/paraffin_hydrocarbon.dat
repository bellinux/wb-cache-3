30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of coprecipitation {{of the most}} high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with asphaltenes at the standard procedure of deasphalting was used by us for studying the redistribution of high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> between oils and solid deposits formed in well equipment during oil production.

30|$|The {{study of}} the {{composition}} of <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in oil asphaltenes allowed identifying the peculiarities of redistribution of high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> between oil and wax deposits. In asphaltenes of oils higher molecular weight, n-alkanes are found {{in comparison with the}} corresponding wax deposits. This indicates that in the wax deposits not all high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are concentrated. A part of higher molecular n-alkanes remains in oil and initiates crystallization of more low molecular weight homologs, causing their deposition from crude oil to a greater degree.|$|R
30|$|It is {{impossible}} to avoid the coprecipitation of high molecular <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with asphaltenes under the standard procedure of oil deasphalting.

Hence the goal of this paper is focused on an examination of the waxes in asphaltenes of different oils and corresponding solid deposits.|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{asphaltenes}} contain <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with a {{wide range}} of carbon numbers from 10 to 60 (depending on the composition of oil), and their MMD can depend on the structure of asphaltenes and hydrocarbon composition of oil.

The content and composition of waxes isolated from deasphalting resin-free oil do not represent the total content, and compositional features of all waxes present in crude oil.

40|$|Plutonium {{production}} at U. S. Department of Energy Hanford site has created {{massive amounts of}} radioactive and mixed wastes. Over 1. 3 trillion liters of liquid waste have been discharged into the ground, the largest part {{of which has been}} absorbed by the upper soil layers with a small fraction migrating into the groundwater. Approximately 350 million liters of other low and high-level mixed wastes were stored in underground tanks between 1944 and 1980. These tanks contain organic materials that were introduced during the production and processing of plutonium, such as ethylenediametetraacetic acid (EDTA), tributyl phosphate, hexone, <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and other minor organic and inorganic components. The quantity of EDTA is estimated to be 83 metric tons in the underground tanks. Several single-shell tanks are known or suspected to have leaked.

30|$|The solid deposit {{formed in}} {{producing}} wells, in borehole equipment, and pipelines {{is known to}} represent a complex mixture of waxes, asphaltenes, and resins along with trapped oil, water, and inorganic material. The amount and composition of the solid deposits are a function of changing temperature, pressure, and oil composition during oil production (Leontaritis 1996; Chouparova et al. 2004). It is known that solid deposits produced from different depths of the same well vary in amount and composition: the closer to the surface the bigger the amount of solid deposits and the bigger the share of low molecular weight n-paraffin hydrocarbon (macrocrystalline waxes) in them. At greater depths, little solid deposit is formed, but it contains {{a high proportion of}} the most high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (microcrystalline waxes) (Chouparova et al. 2004). Thus, it is believed that most unstable macro- and microcrystalline waxes may precipitate from oil and form the solid deposits at different depths in the well, in borehole equipment, and pipelines, and therefore high molecular weight hydrocarbons are practically absent in produced oils. This fact has been demonstrated repeatedly by comparative analyses of MMD of <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in oils and in the corresponding solid deposits (Philp et al. 1995; Garcia 2001; Paso and Fogler 2004; Yang and Kilpatrick 2005). Since we have shown that the most high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are concentrated in asphaltenes; then in order to study the peculiarities of redistribution of the most high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> between oil and solid deposit, we studied the composition of n-alkanes in asphaltenes of solid deposits and compared it with that of the corresponding oils.|$|R

The equipment, which is assembled in glove boxes, includes three 16 -stage miniature mixer-settler banks with associated in-line monitors, pumping equipment, and sampling apparatus. Following shakedown runs with solutions containing uranium only, two flowsheet test runs were made with a simulated LWR fuel solution (U/Pu = 100). The solution was fed to an extraction-scrub bank, where 30 % tributyl phosphate in normal <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> diluent was used to coextract uranium and plutonium. The extract was fed to a second mixer-settler bank, where all of the plutonium was stripped into an aqueous product stream using hydroxylamine nitrate for plutonium reduction; a controlled fraction of the uranium was simultaneously stripped to produce a U/Pu ratio of {similar_to} 2. The amount of the uranium stripped with the plutonium was regulated by careful control of an organic backscrub stream. Finally, the residual uranium in the solvent was stripped in the third mixer-settler bank. The success of the experiments depended on precise control of very low liquid flow rates, and on in-line monitors which indicated the uranium or total heavy-metal concentrations. The most useful in-line device was the Mettler-Paar density meter, from which metal concentrations could be determined to within {similar_to} 1 g/L. A miniature spectrophotometer also gave promising results for uranium analysis.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} control {{particulate}} matter (PM) in the exhaust of diesel-powered automobiles, {{a better understanding}} of the components of PM is required. In this report, the ECE R 49 13 -mode engine test cycle was performed on a heavy-duty diesel engine. Unlike the usual ECE R 49 13 -mode sample method, PM in the exhaust was separately sampled in this research under every test mode. Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the exhaust were also measured. Soluble organic fraction (SOF) and insoluble fraction (ISF) of the PM were partitioned with an ultrasonic elution, and then every SOF sample was analysed by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results show that the mass flux of PM increases with increasing engine loads, and there is an exponential growth function between the PM mass flux and the engine power under the same engine speed. Concerning the engine’s NOx emissions, there is an exponential decay function between the con-centration of NOx and engine power. By comparing the results obtained, the effects of load and speed on the contents of ISF and SOF in PM were observed. The percentages of ISF and SOF contents in PM are markedly changed with the load, but are less influenced by the speed at the same percentage of load. The dominant component in SOF is <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and second is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The percentage of PAH content in PM is higher at lower loads.

40|$|Problem statement: This {{article was}} {{developing}} learning equipment for flammability limit behavior which designed for study {{the relation of}} Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and combustion. The equipment can be use as an instructional media for obviously experiment of combustion. Approach: The test chamber was designed by using the stainless as a structure. The mirror with safety film was used for safety purpose to the tester. The mirror was the additional equipment for the ignition vision. The size of test chamber was 40 Ã 25 Ã 20 cm. The top of chamber can be opened when the ignition was occurred to reduce the inner pressure that can break the mirror or can be a cause of damage to other parts. The 2 of stainless plates {{with the size of}} 15 Ã 40 cm. were used and the hinges were attached at the upper edges of the chamber from both sides. The metal was closely attached at the chamber edge to reduce the leak of fuel to outer environment. The bottom structure of the chamber installs the control mainboard of electronics system and motor. The control of heat gain system inside the heat chamber. Results: The test chamber is designed to demonstrate the ignition. So, the size has to be suitably designed and large enough for convenience in monitoring. It can be seen that when the test is conducted in a real system, the result is extremely differed from the theory. The reason is the experimentation by the theory using the cup burner or a cylindrical glass cup. This cup has an outside diameter of 28 mm. and around the cup tunnel has an inside diameter of 8. 5 or 9. 5 cm with 53. 5 cm. of height. The ratios of both testing equipments are extremely differed, so there is an opportunity that the accuracy is highly shifted.

40|$|A {{major effort}} at Hanford {{over the next}} few years will be to sample and analyze wastes {{contained}} in 149 single-shell tanks (SSTs). In preparation for this effort, selected analyses were performed on four archived samples to compare analytical methods and to determine applicability of these methods to the waste samples. The analyses, performed by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL), used a variety of analytical methods including both PNL technical procedures and adaptations of U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) technical procedures. Although data are reported for analyses of actual waste tank samples, the data do not serve to characterize any waste in Hanford tanks. Since this investigation was intended only as a comparison of analytical methods, and the samples are from an archive repository, the results are preliminary in nature. The numerical values are to be evaluated with appropriate respect for the limited usefulness of small amounts of data generated through an analytical development process using only four samples. The analysis of the archived SST waste material provides three important types of data for use in planning later phases of sample analysis. The data serve as input for 1) establishing analysis procedures and methods for waste samples, 2) evaluating the impact that using a silicon-based lubricant and normal <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (NPH) in field sampling has on extracting inorganics or radionuclides from the SST sample, and 3) identifying trends in amounts of occupational radiation exposure expected from performing the various analysis procedures. Inorganic analysis work was undertaken to determine 1) the applicability of various analytical methods to the test samples, 2) if mercury can be determined by cold vapor atomic absorption (CVAA), 3) if the inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer has sufficient sensitivity for the analysis of EP Toxicity metal ions (excluding mercury), and 4) which of the 22 EPA pollutant metal ions can be determined by ICP analysis. Poor reproducibility was obtained with water leach and EP Toxicity methods, but acid digestion gave good reproducibility. Some of the procedures were changed if, due to interference by other elements, the methods did not provide the levels of sensitivity, accuracy, or precision usually required for EPA work. When appropriate, other methods are suggested for trial as alternatives. Some procedural adjustments were required for mercury analysis by CVAA. Problems areas identified are ICP sensitivities and ICP spectral corrections when analyzing for minor constituents (e. g., Ag, As, Pb, Se, Tl, and V); if elements of this class are critically important, they should be determined by alternative methods. Organics analysis investigations were conducted to determine if the EPA semivolatile organic method can be employed on SST samples. Silicone·based lubricants and NPH from the sampling process impact the semivolatile analysis; however, with slight modification the procedure of EPA SOW 288 can be used. The results show that the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is vulnerable to fouling and overload and that a combination of dilution and acidification is required to provide acceptable results. Work also included evaluation of 1) screening procedures for gas chromatography (GC) and total organic carbon (TOC), 2) extraction procedures and related problems, and 3) surrogate spiking to test extraction efficiencies and matrix effects. Development work was performed to gather information relevant to the potential use of radionuclide ratioing and parent-daughter relationships for the estimation of radionuclides within samples. The radionuclides expected in the SST tank waste samples were measured to determine the level of accuracy and precision that can be expected. These data reveal that some level of procedure development is needed for a large number of the radionuclides analyses. Tests were conducted to determine whether the NPH from the field sampling process extracted significant quantities of the inorganics or radionuclides from the SST samples. No such extraction was observed; however, the NPH does have a significant adverse effect on organic analysis, and alternatives to NPH should be investigated. Effects of silicon-based lubricant were not experimentally evaluated apart from sample analysis. Trends in expected occupational exposure were obtained by measuring the radiation level of samples and having the analysts record estimates of the contact time with the samples.

Sampling and analysis, in distinct phases, are planned to involve laboratory investigations to determine both chemical and radionuclide inventories, so that waste disposal decisions can be developed. During 1989, trial analyses were performed on four archived samples from SSTs at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory using established U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protocols and radiochemical procedures. The analysis of the archived SST waste material provides three important types of data for use in planning Phase I-A and Phase 1 -B sample analysis. The types of data served as input to I) fi na 1 i zing the waste samp 1 e analysis procedures and methods and identify where procedure developmen~ may be needed, 2) evaluating the impact of normal <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (NPH) lubricant {used in field sampling) on extracting inorganics or radionuclides from the SST sample, and 3) identifying trends in amounts of occupational radiation exposure expected from performing the various analysis procedures. Overall, the results are qualitative in nature, and the conclusions given are {{to be used with}} appropriate respect for the limitations of small amounts of data from four samples used in development processes. The results of the Phase I-A and I-B sample analysis will provide essential data for method performance for use in finalizing Phase I-C planning and methods development scope. Section 2. 0, Inorganic Analysis, encompasses sample preparation, sample analysis, identification of methods performance limitations, and possible alternatives. Performance of the inorganic analytical methods was evaluated and changes were made to some of the procedures. In some cases, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (referred to in this report as ICP) did not provide the levels of accuracy and precision usually required for EPA work due to interference by other elements. In these cases, other methods are suggested as appropriate for trial as alternatives. In all cases, duplicates, spikes, and blanks were used to establish performance of the methods for the specific waste matrix. Results focused on problems in using the methods tested on the samples, the suitability of the ICP method of determining EP Toxicity metal ions and 22 EPA pollutant metal ions, and the suitability of cold vapor atomic absorption (CVAA) for mercury determinations. Problems areas identified are ICP spectral corrections, poor reproducibility from water leach and EP Toxicity methods, and adjustments needed for mercury analysis by CVAA. Section 3. 0, Organics Analysis, details two screening procedures [total organic carbon (TOC) and gas chromatography (GC) ], extraction procedures and related problems, surrogate spiking to test extraction efficiencies and matrix effects, and semivolatile organics via GC/mass spectroscopy (MS). The results show that the GC/MS is vulnerable to fouling and overload and that a combination of dilution and perhaps acidification are required to provide acceptable results. NPH and silicone-based lubricants from the sampling process impact the semivolatile analysis; however, with some modification the semivolatile method based on EPA SOW 288 can be used. Section 4. 0, Radionuclide Analysis, evaluates procedures used to measure the radionuclides that might be found in the SST tank waste samples and establishes the level of accuracy and precision that can be expected. These data reveal that additional procedure development is needed in order to measure all of the radionuclides listed in Table 4 - 14 of the Waste Characterization Plan. In addition, the archive samples analyzed may not be representative of the tank population and considerable adaptation of the radiochemical procedures may be necessary to perform the desired measurements. NPH tests were conducted to determine whether the NPH from the field sampling process extracted significant quantities of the inorganics or radionuclides from the SST samples. Results indicate that no such extraction is anticipated; however, the NPH does {{have a significant effect on}} the organic analysis and its use should be investigated.

30|$|The {{research}} found that asphaltenes contain <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{with a wide}} MMD from 12 to 60. On {{the example of the}} oils of different ages from the Samara region, Russia, it is shown that the composition of <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in asphaltenes depends on the age of the oil reservoir from which oil is produced. The higher the age of oil reservoir, the smaller the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in asphaltenes. That {{may be due to the}} decrease in the share of low molecular weight n-alkanes in oil and the fact that with increasing depth of occurrence of the oil reservoir, the asphaltenes become denser and their ability to occlude low molecular weight hydrocarbons reduces. The increase in the share of high molecular weight n-alkanes in asphaltenes with an increase in the age of oil reservoir is explained by the increase in their share in the oil, from which asphaltenes are precipitated.|$|R
30|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} composition and thermal properties of <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in asphaltenes of crude oils and the corresponding wax deposits shows that the asphaltenes of crude oils contain higher molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (Figs.  1, 5). Indeed, the maxima of MMD of n-alkanes in oil asphaltenes 3, 4, and 5 was at 54 – 56, 40 – 44, and 54 – 56 (Fig.  1), whereas the maxima of MMD of n-alkanes in corresponding wax deposit asphaltenes showed n-alkanes with {{a smaller number of}} carbon atoms with maxima at 41 – 43, 40 – 42, and 49 – 51, respectively (Fig.  5). The temperatures of melting of waxes in oil asphaltenes 3 – 5 were 101.2, 85.2, and 89.5  °C while those in the corresponding asphaltenes of wax deposits were 88.1, 81.4, and 81.2  °C. The higher temperatures of melting of waxes in oil asphaltenes confirm the higher molecular weight composition of waxes in them.|$|R
3000|$|Thus, it {{is found}} that in {{produced}} oil there are higher molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> that are absent in the wax deposits formed in the borehole equipment during production of this crude oil. In other words, the highest molecular weight n-alkanes do not precipitate out and remain dispersed in the oil. It should be noted that this fact is not surprising for mixture of individual n-alkanes in solvents and is predictable for crude oil. So, previously the polydispersity and cocrystallization of individual n-alkanes in solvents reduce the mass and high molecular weight homolog fraction in a deposit formed using a coldfinger apparatus (Senra et al. 2008). As to crude oils, the share of high molecular weight hydrocarbons in them is very low [a recurrence ratio of C n+ 1 /C n [...] is approximately 0.7 – 0.8 (Senra 2009)]; therefore, the n-alkanes that will crystallize out at the cloud point should not necessarily be the highest molecular weight n-alkanes present in the crude oil. However, it is known from papers (Philp et al. 1995; Garcia and Carbognani 2001; Paso and Fogler 2004; Yang and Kilpatrick 2005) that <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the wax deposits are higher molecular weight in comparison with those in the oil. The investigation of asphaltenes in which the highest molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are concentrated shows that indeed the wax deposit consists not the most high molecular weight hydrocarbons of crude oils. Evidently, more high molecular weight n-alkanes initiate the crystallizing of the more low molecular homologs causing their deposition from crude oil in a greater degree.|$|R

However, in most cases, the higher molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (microcrystalline type) {{are present in}} very low concentrations or are absent in produced oils. This is due to their low mobility and limited solubility in crude oil. As a result, these components remain in the reservoir rocks or precipitate out in borehole equipment when the temperature and pressure change. It was demonstrated repeatedly that high molecular weight n-alkanes were concentrated in solid deposits formed in well equipment and pipelines (Philp et al. 1995; Chouparova et al. 2004). Moreover, the concentrations of high molecular weight <b>paraffin</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in oils, which are determined by high temperature gas chromatography (HTGC, {{one of the main}} methods for investigating hydrocarbon composition of oils) (Lipsky and Duffy 1986; Hawthorne and Miller 1987), are underestimated because of the poor solubility of the high molecular weight hydrocarbons in the solvent and the difficulty in eluting of such high boiling components even at 440  °C, resulting in the bias of response toward the shorter-chain homologs (Philp et al. 1995).|$|R
