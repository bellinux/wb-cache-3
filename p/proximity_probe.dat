Measurements of steady-state conditions made with standard eddy-current proximity probes are susceptible to error caused by temperature variations during normal operation of the component under investigation. Errors resulting from temperature effects for the specific probes {{used in this study}} were approximately 1. 016 x 10 to the - 3 mm/deg C over the temperature range of - 252 to 100 C. This report examines temperature caused changes on the eddy-current <b>proximity</b> <b>probe</b> measurement system, establishes their origin, and discusses what may be done to minimize their effect on the output signal.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{proximity}} ligation assay (PLA) detects proteins via {{their interaction}} with pairs of <b>proximity</b> <b>probes,</b> which are antibodies coupled to noncomplementary DNA oligonucleotides. The binding of both <b>proximity</b> <b>probes</b> to their epitopes {{on the target}} protein brings the oligonucleotides together, allowing them to be bridged by a third oligonucleotide with complementarity to the other two. This enables their ligation and the detection of the resulting amplicon by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), which acts as a surrogate marker for the protein of interest. Hence PLA has potential as a clinically relevant diagnostic tool {{for the detection of}} pathogens where nucleic acid based tests are inconclusive proof of infection. MethodsWe prepared monoclonal and polyclonal <b>proximity</b> <b>probes</b> targeting Clostridium difficile toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) and used hydrolysis probe-based qPCR and digital PCR (dPCR) assays to detect antibody/antigen interactions. ResultsThe performance of the PLA assays was antibody-dependent but both TcdA and TcdB assays were more sensitive than comparable ELISAs in either single- or dualplex formats. Both PLAs could be performed using single monoclonal antibodies coupled to different oligonucleotides. Finally, we used dPCR to demonstrate its potential for accurate and reliable quantification of TcdA. ConclusionsPLA with either qPCR or dPCR readout have potential as new diagnostic applications for the detection of pathogens where nucleic acid based tests do not indicate viability or expression of toxins. Importantly, since it is not always necessary to use two different antibodies, the pool of potential antibodies useful for PLA diagnostic assays is usefully enhanced...|$|R

40|$|To {{obtain a}} more {{vibration}} resistant pressure sensor {{for use on}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine, a <b>proximity</b> <b>probe</b> based, diaphragm type pressure sensor breadboard was developed. A fiber optic <b>proximity</b> <b>probe</b> {{was selected as the}} sensor. In combination with existing electronics, a thermal stability evaluation of the entire probe system was made. Based upon the results, a breadboard design of the pressure sensor and electronics was made and fabricated. A brief series of functional experiments was made with the breadboard to calibrate, thermally compensate, and linearize its response. In these experiments, the performance obtained in the temperature range of - 320 F (liquid N 2) to + 200 F was comparable to that of the strain gage based sensor presently in use on the engine. In tests at NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), after some time at or near liquid nitrogen temperatures, the sensor output varied over the entire output range. These large spurious signals were attributed to condensation of air in the sensing gap. In the next phase of development of this sensor, an evaluation of fabrication techniques toward greater thermal and mechanical stability of the fiber probe assembly must be made.

40|$|Proximity {{ligation}} is {{a recently}} established technique {{that can provide}} answers to questions about the concentration, localization, interactions, modifications and functions of proteins. The method enables sensitive protein measurements with a detection limit in the low femtomolar range in complex biological samples. In proximity ligation, the challenge of detecting specific proteins is converted {{to the analysis of}} specific DNA sequences. <b>Proximity</b> <b>probes</b> containing oligonucleotide extensions are designed to bind pairwise to target proteins, and to form amplifiable tag sequences upon ligation when brought in proximity. Protocols for the conversion of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies into <b>proximity</b> <b>probes</b> through the attachment of oligonucleotide sequences are described in the thesis. In addition, the thesis describes the adaptation of the proximity ligation technology for detection of microbial pathogens, analysis of interactions between proteins and nucleic acids, and of inhibition of receptor-ligand interactions. Nucleic acid amplification allows specific detection of pathogens with single-copy sensitivity. There are many circumstances, however, when analysis of pathogen surface antigens or the antibody response can provide increased diagnostic value. Proximity ligation reactions were used to measure numbers of virus and bacteria by detection of viral or bacterial surface proteins. Detection sensitivities similar to those of nuclear acid-based detection reactions were achieved directly in infected samples for a parvovirus and for an intracellular bacterium. Biological processes are orchestrated by interactions of proteins with molecules in their environment, and investigations of interactions between proteins and other biomolecules are thus of great importance. Protocols were established for very specific and sensitive homogeneous-phase analysis of interactions between proteins and specific nucleic acid sequences.

To validate and improve the condition monitoring techniques, this paper focuses on the de-velopment of an innovative and versatile bearing test rig. The rig allows applying a fully controlled multi-axial static and dy-namic load on different types and sizes of bearings. Easy ad-justment to mount bearings with different inner diameter, outer diameter and width is possible, without compromising on perfor-mance.
