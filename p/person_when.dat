According to the Chronicle of his reign, the Emperor also appointed his daughters and nieces as governors over eight of his provinces. These appointments were not successful.|$|E

His boldness leaves a considerable impression, but when Ramudu declares his love for Indu a day before his death sentence for meeting Indu secretly, the king is reminded of the astrologers' prediction that only a brave man can save her from a wicked sorcerer. He then challenges Ramudu to amass wealth {{equal to that of}} his to marry Indu, to which Ramudu agrees. He is released from prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1327 Michael Shishman became {{involved}} in the renewed civil war in the Byzantine Empire, taking the side of his brother-in-law Andronikos III, while his grandfather and rival Andronikos II obtained the support of the Serbian king. Andronikos III and Michael Shishman met at Chernomen (according to Nicephorus Gregoras at Dimotika) and concluded an aggressive alliance against Serbia. The Byzantine emperor promised to Bulgaria territory with several towns and large amount of money if he would become a sole emperor. Based on that alliance, Andronikos III gained control of Macedonia but his success made Michael Shishman, who aimed at a prolonged conflict within the Byzantine Empire, enter into negotiations with Andronikos II, offering military support in exchange for money and the cession of some border lands. The Bulgarian ruler sent a detachment of 3,000 cavalry, commanded by Ivan the Russian, from Yambol to guard the Imperial Palace in Constantinople and Andronikos II but his intentions were to capture the old emperor and the city. Forewarned by his grandson, Andronikos II prudently kept the Bulgarians away from the capital and his <b>person.</b> <b>When</b> Michael Shishman understood that his plans were revealed he sent Ivan a letter to retreat with a singe feather which meant that the orders had to be promptly executed.|$|E

Ruksar had run away from her home Lucknow with her best friend to become a film star. The two bond over their careers but part ways after arriving in Bombay. Govind befriends Radhika (Prachi Desai), a confident and modern girl, who is charmed by his simplicity. Ruksar and Govind meet again and hit it off at a party, but Govind notices a photo journalist following them. He holds Radhika's hand to mislead the journalist, unaware that Radhika has {{fallen in love with}} him. Radhika is the best friend Ruksar had run away with, and the two tell each other about the man they've fallen in love with, not realising he is the same <b>person.</b> <b>When</b> Ruksar, Radhika and Govind all meet, the three realise what happened and brokenheartedly part ways.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant Carinthia branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in <b>person</b> <b>when</b> Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was {{in sharp contrast to the}} party's position in Haider's Carinthia (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E

Leeds' body is found in his car, but his partner, Stedman, is missing, along with cult leader Anthony Tipet (Keith Szarabajka): the man with the third eye. The FBI later finds Stedman at his locked-up condo with a fatal blow to the head.

5|$|Nelson wrote dispatches to the Admiralty and oversaw {{temporary}} {{repairs to}} the Vanguard, before sailing to Naples {{where he was}} met with enthusiastic celebrations. The King of Naples, in company with the Hamiltons, greeted him in <b>person</b> <b>when</b> {{he arrived at the}} port and William Hamilton invited Nelson to stay at their house. Celebrations were held in honour of Nelson's birthday that September, and he attended a banquet at the Hamiltons', where other officers had begun to notice his attention to Emma. Jervis himself had begun to grow concerned about reports of Nelson's behaviour, but in early October word of Nelson's victory had reached London. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl Spencer, fainted on hearing the news. Scenes of celebration erupted across the country, balls and victory feasts were held and church bells were rung. The City of London awarded Nelson and his captains swords, whilst the King ordered them to be presented with special medals. The Tsar of Russia sent him a gift, and Selim III, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, awarded Nelson the Order of the Turkish Crescent for his role in restoring Ottoman rule in Egypt. Lord Hood, after a conversation with the Prime Minister, told Fanny that Nelson would likely be given a Viscountcy, similar to Jervis's earldom after Cape St Vincent and Duncan's viscountcy after Camperdown. Earl Spencer however demurred, arguing that as Nelson had only been detached in command of a squadron, rather than being the {{commander in chief of the}} fleet, such an award would create an unwelcome precedent. Instead, Nelson received the title Baron Nelson of the Nile.|$|E
