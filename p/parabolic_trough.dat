5|$|A <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> {{consists}} of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. <b>Parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of concentrating {{technologies}} exists: among the best known are the <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough,</b> the compact linear Fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough,</b> the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower.

25|$|Full-scale <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> systems {{consist of}} many such troughs {{laid out in}} {{parallel}} over a large area of land. Since 1985 a solar thermal system using this principle has been in full operation in California in the United States. It is called the Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) system. Other CSP designs lack this kind of long experience and therefore it can currently {{be said that the}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> design is the most thoroughly proven CSP technology.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of this design above the <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> design is the higher temperature. Thermal energy at higher temperatures {{can be converted to}} electricity more efficiently and can be more cheaply stored for later use. Furthermore, there is less need to flatten the ground area. In principle a power tower can be built {{on the side of a}} hill. Mirrors can be flat and plumbing is concentrated in the tower. The disadvantage is that each mirror must have its own dual-axis control, while in the <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> design single axis tracking can be shared for a large array of mirrors.|$|E

The most common reflector geometries are flat plate, disc and <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> type.

40|$|Purpose Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants {{based on}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>troughs</b> utilize {{auxiliary}} fuels (usually natural gas) to facilitate start-up operations, avoid freezing of HTF and increase power output. This practice {{has a significant}} effect on the environmental performance of the technology. The aim {{of this paper is to}} quantify the sustainability of CSP and to analyse how this is affected by hybridisation with different natural gas (NG) inputs. Methods A complete Life Cycle (LC) inventory was gathered for a commercial wet-cooled 50 MWe CSP plant based on <b>parabolic</b> <b>troughs.</b> A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the environmental performance of the plant operating with different NG inputs (between 0 and 35...|$|R

25|$|Rival single axis {{tracking}} technologies {{include the}} relatively new linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) and compact-LFR (CLFR) technologies. The LFR {{differs from that}} of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> in that the absorber is fixed in space above the mirror field. Also, the reflector is composed of many low row segments, which focus collectively on an elevated long tower receiver running parallel to the reflector rotational axis.|$|E
25|$|The Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center is {{a hybrid}} 75 {{megawatt}} (MW) <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> solar energy plant that {{is owned by}} Florida Power & Light Company (FPL). The solar plant is {{a component of the}} 3,705MW Martin County Power Plant, which is currently the single largest fossil fuel burning power plant in the United States. Completed at the end of 2010, it is located in western Martin County, Florida, just north of Indiantown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> {{power plants}} use a curved, {{mirrored}} trough which reflects the {{direct solar radiation}} onto a glass tube containing a fluid (also called a receiver, absorber or collector) running {{the length of the}} trough, positioned at {{the focal point of the}} reflectors. The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the orthogonal axis. For change of the daily position of the sun perpendicular to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight parallel to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver. Thus the trough design does not require tracking on a second axis. The receiver may be enclosed in a glass vacuum chamber. The vacuum significantly reduces convective heat loss.|$|E
50|$|All five power stations, {{the three}} {{commissioned}} and two under development, will be utilizing <b>parabolic</b> <b>troughs,</b> a technology to use concentrated solar power. The three commissioned power stations are also equipped to support natural gas as its secondary fuel source for power generation.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} to use two <b>parabolic</b> <b>troughs,</b> curved in perpendicular directions, to bring sunlight to a point focus as does a paraboloidal reflector.The incoming light strikes one of the troughs, which sends it toward a line focus.

The {{study found}} that the land-use footprint, given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour (m2a/MWh), was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by utility-scale solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using <b>parabolic</b> <b>troughs</b> and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18m2a/MWh.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} potential {{methods to}} reduce water consumption associated with CSP. Four main {{concentrating solar power}} technologies are described in this report: <b>parabolic</b> <b>troughs,</b> linear Fresnel, power towers, and dish/engine. <b>Parabolic</b> <b>troughs</b> are the most commercially available technology. Linear Fresnel and power tower technologies are presently being planned as commercial plants, but none have yet {{been built in the}} U. S. The first three of these technologies use the heat collected from the sun to power conventional Rankine steam cycles, similar to those used for coal and nuclear plants. Steam cycle power plants require cooling to function (cooling is needed to condense the steam and complete the cycle). This cooling can be provided via water cooling, air cooling or a combination. Dish/engine systems use sunlight to power a small engine at the focal point. Stirling cycle engines using hydrogen as the working fluid are typically employed in dish/engine systems. These are air-cooled and only require water for mirror washing...|$|R

2500|$|A cost/performance {{comparison}} between power tower and <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> concentrators {{was made by}} the NREL which estimated that by 2020 electricity could be produced from power towers for 5.47 ¢/kWh and for 6.21 ¢/kWh from parabolic troughs. The capacity factor for power towers was estimated to be 72.9% and 56.2% for parabolic troughs. [...] There is some hope that the development of cheap, durable, mass producible heliostat power plant components could bring this cost down.|$|E
