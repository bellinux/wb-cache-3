2500|$|Right {{from the}} start, the Japanese Army planned to turn Manchukuo into the {{industrial}} powerhouse of the Japanese empire {{and carried out}} a policy of forced industrialization with a reckless disregard for human life; the model for Manchukuo was the Soviet First Five Year Plan. Deeply distrustful of capitalism, the military completely excluded the Zaibatsu from investing in Manchukuo, and instead all of the industrial development of Manchuria {{was carried out by}} state-owned corporations. Reflecting the military's ideas about the [...] "national defense state", Manchukuo's industrial development was focused completely upon heavy industry such as steel production for the purposes of arms manufacture. In 1935, Kishi was appointed Manchukuo's Deputy Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi was given complete control of Manchukuo's economy by the military, with the authority to do whatever he liked just as long as industrial growth was increased. After his appointment, Kishi persuaded the military to allow private capital into Manchukuo, successfully arguing that the military's policy of having the state-owned corporations leading Manchukuo's industrial development was costing the Japanese state too much money. Kishi envisioned a [...] "planned economy" [...] for Manchukuo where bureaucrats such as himself would direct the zaibatsu into selected industries, which would create the necessary industrial basis for the [...] "national defense state". In place of the previous policy of [...] "one industry, one firm" [...] for Manchukuo, Kishi brought in a new policy of [...] "all industries, one firm". One of the zaibatsu that Kishi selected to invest in Manchukuo, the Nissan group, was headed by another of Kishi's uncles. In order to make it profitable for the zaibatsu to invest in Manchukuo, Kishi had a policy of lowering the wages of the workers to the lowest possible point, even below the [...] "line of necessary social reproduction" [...] as he once put it. The purpose of Manchukuo was to provide the industrial basis for the [...] "national defense state" [...] with Driscoll noting [...] "Kishi's planned economy was geared towards production goals and <b>profit</b> <b>taking,</b> not competition with other Japanese firms; profit come primarily from rationalizing labor costs as much as possible. The ne plus ultra of wage rationalization would be withholding pay altogether-that is unremunerated forced labor." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{respects the}} {{governor}}, {{and the other}} high functionaries of the colony, some indulgence was entertained; it being the popular notion that men who lived so much within doors, and whose hands got to be so soft, were not {{exactly the sort of}} persons who would be most useful at the oar. Heaton, and the merchants, Pennock, and the two younger Woolstons, with the clergyman, were easily excused in the popular mind; but the governor was known to be a prime seaman, and a silent expectation appeared to prevail, that some day he would be seen in the bow of a boat, lancing a whale. Before the first season was over, this expectation was fully realized; Governor Woolston heading no less than four of what were called the colony boats, or boats that belonged to the state, and fished as much for honour as <b>profit,</b> <b>taking</b> a fine whale on each occasion. These exploits of the governor's capped the climax, in the way of giving a tone to the public mind, on the subject of taking whales. No man could any longer doubt of its being honourable, as well as useful, and even the boys petitioned to be allowed to go out. The Kannakas, more or less of whom were employed in each vessel, rose greatly in the public estimation, and no young man could expect to escape animadversion, unless he had been present at least once at the taking of a whale. Those who had struck or lanced a fish were now held in a proportionate degree of repute. It was, in fact, in this group that the custom originally obtained, which prohibited a young man from standing {{at the head of the}} dance who had not struck his fish; and not at Nantucket, as has been erroneously supposed.|$|E

In preparation, Eddie initiated a scheme in 1979 to skim less each year. Since more income was actually being reported, this had the effect of showing drastically increasing profit margins. While the company's actual <b>profits</b> (<b>taking</b> into account skimmed profits) from 1980 to 1983 increased approximately 13%, reported profits increased nearly 171%.|$|R

5000|$|The {{government}} {{sought to}} accelerate growth in urban areas. One of its policies was to tax the rice industry {{and use the}} profits to fund much-needed projects in the larger cities. Thai authorities levied taxes on rice exports known as the [...] "rice premium". This increased tax revenues, {{while at the same}} time decreasing the price of rice domestically. The government, in enacting this policy, shifted from protecting the farmers to leaving the rice industry to market forces, often leading to unethical <b>profit</b> <b>taking.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{alternate}} currency, denominated in labour time, {{would prevent}} <b>profit</b> <b>taking</b> by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced {{only in terms}} of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim 'Cost the limit of price'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the New Harmony communal settlement by Josiah Warren in 1826, and in his Cincinnati 'Time store' in 1827. Warren ideas were adopted by other Owenites and currency reformers, even though the labour exchanges were relatively short lived.|$|E

50|$|In {{the stock}} indices, the common retrace {{of the market}} after a trend channel line {{overshoot}} is put down to <b>profit</b> <b>taking</b> and traders reversing their positions.

This is identified by the overshoot bar being a climactic exhaustion bar on high volume. It leaves nobody left to carry on the trend and sets up the price action for a reversal.|$|E
50|$|Okishio {{does not}} believe his famous Okishio's theorem rules out entirely the {{possibility}} of the Falling Rate of <b>Profit</b> <b>taking</b> effect. A falling rate of profit might be realized in the long run due to competitive pressures among capitalists, bargaining power of labor, or other reasons. The crux of Okishio's theorem is that the constant technological progress in the capitalist system of change and if the rate of profit falls in the long run, there must have happened an increase of real wage rate. The real wage rate will change in the process of technical change and it is very much doubtful whether this dynamic process converges to a stationary production price situation. Nevertheless, Okishio's theorem is relevant because it denies that the FRP is established automatically from technical change by itself.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis {{have used}} large data sets of closed-end funds, where {{comparison}} with valuation is possible, {{in order to}} determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that <b>profit</b> <b>taking</b> occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the [...] "buying on dips" [...] does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.|$|E

It finds a significant change in behaviour in late 1996. In 1995 and 1996 generator behaviour was consistent with the static Nash equilibrium assumption if the majority of their output was covered by financial contracts which hedged prices. After 1996 their behaviour was inconsistent with the static Nash equilibrium assumption given their contract cover but it was consistent with tacit collusion. static oligopoly models, market power, Nash equilibrium, tacit collusion, electricity markets...|$|R
