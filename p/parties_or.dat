5|$|No {{political}} <b>parties</b> <b>or</b> {{national elections}} are permitted in Saudi Arabia {{and according to}} The Economist's 2010 Democracy Index, the Saudi government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated.

5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at <b>parties</b> <b>or</b> events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the <b>parties,</b> <b>or,</b> if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Games {{have been}} criticised as {{upholding}} (and {{in some cases}} increasing) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either {{in the name of}} the Olympics by associated <b>parties</b> <b>or</b> directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production, erasure, commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
