25|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{completed}} by seven different visual effects houses: Digital Domain, Giant Studios, The Third Floor, MPC, Soho VFX, Rodeo FX and Hatch Productions. Creating the giants took four main steps. The {{first step was}} Pre-Capture, in which performance capture was used to capture the actor's facial and body movements and render them in a real-time virtual environment. The second step took place during principal photography, where Simulcam technology was used to help the human characters virtually interact with the giants that were rendered earlier in Pre-Capture. The third step was Post-Capture, a second performance capture shoot to adjust giants' movements to seamlessly fit the live-action performances. The final step involved <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the giant's animation, skin, hair and clothing, and composition in the shots. Creating the beanstalk involved two main requirements: set extension for shots of the actors interacting with the beanstalk, which were shot against a bluescreen, and complete CG renderings for shots of the beanstalk growing and extending from Earth {{into the world of}} the giants.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{began its}} {{schedule}} {{of spring training}} games on February 25 with three straight road games. With construction crews still <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the stadium during the morning, the Nationals and Astros opened the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches with their first game there on February 28, with the Nationals playing as the home team at the shared facility. Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred cut a ceremonial ribbon, and a helicopter flyover {{took place during the}} opening ceremonies. Before a crowd of 5,897, Nationals non-roster invitee Jeremy Guthrie threw the first pitch at 1:07p.m. EST, to Astros first baseman Marwin González, whom he eventually struck out. In the bottom of the first inning, second baseman Daniel Murphy doubled for the first hit in the ballpark′s history, and a few minutes later scored its first run when right fielder Bryce Harper doubled to drive him home. In the top of the fourth inning, Astros designated hitter Carlos Beltrán hit the stadium′s first home run, and catcher Derek Norris hit the first Nationals home run in the park′s history {{in the bottom of the}} fourth. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, outfielder Michael A. Taylor hit a walk-off solo home run to give the Nationals a 4-3 victory in their first game at their new spring training home.|$|E

Williams also later confirmed via her Twitter account that Unexpected would soon receive a full UK re-release with [...] "Hello Heartbreak" [...] serving as its lead single. In July 2009, Williams elaborated further on the re-release in an interview for Digital Spy, confirming that Sony Music (London division) was considering a re-issue of the album for which some new songs could be recorded.

2500|$|Having {{concluded}} additional recording {{sessions with}} Warryn Campbell, Theron Feemster and Organized Noise, in November 2003, Atlantic Records announced that Norwood was <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> her still-untitled album, {{at that time}} scheduled for a release on March 2, 2004, and she would shoot a music video for the [...] "hyper, bass-heavy" [...] banger [...] "Black Pepper" [...] during {{the second week of}} December. However, plans for the single fell through as the Timbaland-produced track was scrapped in favor of a new record: [...] "Talk About Our Love," [...] produced by rapper Kanye West.

2500|$|Tiberias, or Tabariyyah in Arab transcription, was [...] "conquered by (the Arab commander) Shurahbil in {{the year}} 13 AH (634 [...] ) by capitulation; {{one half of the}} houses and churches were to belong to the Muslims, the other half to the Christians." [...] Since 636 CE, Tiberias served as the {{regional}} capital, until Beit She'an took its place, following the Rashidun conquest. The Caliphate allowed 70 Jewish families from Tiberias to form the core of a renewed Jewish presence in Jerusalem and the importance of Tiberias to Jewish life declined. The caliphs of the Umayyad Dynasty built one of its square-plan palaces on the waterfront to the north of Tiberias, at Khirbat al-Minya. Tiberias was revitalised in 749, after Bet Shean was destroyed in an earthquake. An imposing mosque, [...] long by [...] wide, resembling the Great Mosque of Damascus, was raised at the foot of Mount Berenice next to a Byzantine church, to the south of the city, as the eighth century ushered in Tiberias's golden age, when the multicultural city may have been the most tolerant of the Middle East. Jewish scholarship flourished {{from the beginning of the}} 8th century to the end of the 10th., when the oral traditions of ancient Hebrew, still in use today, were codified. One of the leading members of the Tiberian masoretic community was Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, who refined the oral tradition now known as Tiberian Hebrew. Ben Asher is also credited with <b>putting</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> the Aleppo Codex, the most accurate existing manuscript of the Hebrew scriptures.|$|E
