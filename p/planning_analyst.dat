40|$|One {{problem in}} current help systems for {{programming}} utility packages is {{their inability to}} provide information {{within the context of}} the task at hand. The relationship of a user's goal to the user's plan to accomplish that goal is not taken into account. Furthermore, even a goal/plan based help system should be informative by following rules of discourse. This paper puts established rules of discourse into the context of a programming environment, and describes how a report based on an analysis of a user's intended goal and stated plan can be generated. The programming environment under discussion is a programmer's tool kit for graphically exploring complex hierarchical data structures. A program that we have developed called the <b>Plan</b> <b>Analyst</b> is described that finds the relationship between a users intended goal and stated plan by mapping the goal to the functions of the tool kit. The report generated is informative because discourse rules have been in coded in the knowledge representation that is searched by the <b>Plan</b> <b>Analyst.</b> The intent of this paper is to demonstrate the potential for applying methods of discourse behavior from Natural Language Processing research to 3 D interactive programming environment...|$|R

40|$|Extreme {{disasters}} {{can generate}} financial deficit {{due to the}} sudden an elevated need of resources for recovering the affected inventories. This paper presents the Disaster Deficit Index (DDI), developed to measure sovereign financial risk and contingent liabilities in a country according to possible catastrophic events. DDI captures {{the relationship between the}} economic loss that a country could experience when a catastrophic event takes place and the availability of funds to address the situation. The proposed model uses the procedures of the insurance industry in establishing probable losses, based on critical impacts during a given period of exposure; for economic resilience, the model allows calculating the country’s financial ability to cope with a critical impact. The DDI can be a guide for fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic risk management; these results can be studied by economic, financial and <b>planning</b> <b>analysts</b> who can evaluate the budget problem and the need to take into account these figures in the financial planning.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology {{to evaluate the}} disaster risk from a macroeconomic perspective. The proposed Disaster Deficit Index (DDI) represents risk from a macroeconomic and financial perspective in case of possible catastrophic events. This requires an estimation of the critical impact during a given exposure time and the financial ability to cope such situation. The DDI captures {{the relationship between the}} demand for contingent resources to cover the maximum probable loss and the public sector’s economic resilience; that is, the availability of internal and external funds for restoring affected inventories. This paper presents the model of the DDI and the results of its application to seventeen countries of the Americas. The DDI can be a guide for economic risk management; these results can be studied by economic, financial and <b>planning</b> <b>analysts</b> who can evaluate the budget problem and the need to take into account these figures in the financial planning.

40|$|The {{benefits}} that rigorous analysis can have for retail store portfolio management in guiding and informing investment decisions (store expansion; closure; extension; refascia and acquisition) {{is well established}} within the economic geography research literature. However, studies of retailers addressing location planning in practice have identified wide variation in the sophistication of techniques and resources employed {{as well as in}} terms of the credibility that such research and analysis receives from senior management within the firm. By drawing on a qualitative research project involving some 40 location <b>planning</b> <b>analysts,</b> consultants and managers at UK-based retailers, we differentiate between three approaches to store portfolio decision-making that differ in terms of resource allocation, sophistication and legitimacy. We seek to explain those differences that are embedded within the context of intra-firm relations and social communities by drawing on theories from strategic management concerning core rigidities, lock-in and legitimisation, and review the challenges that location planners face in gaining legitimacy within the organisation, along with strategies appropriate for increasing their acceptance and influence across the firm...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMilitary image analysts primarily use panchromatic and radar images to aid situational awareness in preparing a mission <b>plan.</b> Although <b>analysts</b> rely {{on these two}} formats, there are situations where these two sensors are unable to detect potential threats, i. e. buried mines. The Department of Defense has proposed using a hyperspectral sensor to detect threats that otherwise may not be detected by existing sensors. In {{order to determine the}} utility of hyperspectral imagery for mission planning, a task analysis was conducted at two Joint Intelligence Centers to measure image analysts' preferences to infrared, radar, panchromatic, and hyperspectral imagery during an amphibious planning process. The results showed that the image analysts were most confident using panchromatic imagery {{for the majority of the}} planning tasks; however, the analysts exhibited uncertainty for other tasks, such as detecting buried mines. Further analysis showed that image analysts could reduce their uncertainty in detecting buried mines and producing bathymetric maps by using hyperspectral imagery. Although hyperspectral imagery reduced uncertainty during mission planning, operators report that this imagery is confusing.

Abnormally high levels of volatility and trading volumes after the presentations indicate that investors find strategic plan presentations informative, especially when these presentations are given by small firms.
