40|$|We {{report on}} the removal of foreign objects from the forestomach of a 200 kg adult male common {{bottlenose}} dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in the Seoul zoo using a modified stainless steel hook and flexible wire snare attached to a gastrointestinal fiberoptic endoscope. The foreign bodies included a 10 × 3. 5 cm plastic tube, 4 × 2. 0 cm stainless steel <b>pipe,</b> <b>brush,</b> and concrete debris. Our technique using a stainless steel wire hook and snare attached to a gastroscope {{can be used to}} remove foreign objects from the forestomach of common bottlenose dolphins...|$|E
50|$|Because {{traditional}} Japanese robes lacked pockets, {{objects were}} often carried by hanging {{them from the}} obi in containers known as sagemono (a Japanese generic term for a hanging object attached to a sash). Most sagemono were created for specialized contents, such as tobacco, <b>pipes,</b> writing <b>brush</b> and ink, but the type known as inrō was suitable for carrying anything small.|$|R
40|$|Assemblies are {{disclosed}} for cleaning the inside walls of pipes and tubes. A first embodiment includes a small turbine with angled blades axially mounted {{on one end}} of a standoff support. An O-ring for stabilizing the assembly within the pipe is mounted in a groove within the outer ring. A replaceable circular brush is fixedly mounted on {{the opposite end of the}} standoff support and can be used for cleaning tubes and pipes of various diameters, lengths and configurations. The turbine, standoff support, and brush spin in unison relative to a hub bearing that is fixedly attached to a wire upstream of the assembly. The nonrotating wire is for retaining the assembly in tension and enabling return of the assembly to the pipe entrance. The assembly is initially placed in the pipe or tube to be cleaned. A pressurized water or solution source is provided at a required flow-rate to propel the assembly through the pipe or tube. The upstream water pressure propels and spins the turbine, standoff support and brush. The rotating brush combined with the solution cleans the inside of the pipe. The solution flows out of the other end of the <b>pipe</b> with the <b>brush</b> rotation controlled by the flow-rate. A second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment but instead includes a circular shaped brush with ring backing mounted in the groove of the exterior ring of the turbine, and also reduces the size of the standoff support or eliminates the standoff support...|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the object}} to which Dirck alluded. It {{was a house}} that stood near the river, but {{sheltered}} and secluded, with the lawn and orchard as described; though at the distance of some two or three miles all the beauties of the spot could not be discovered, {{and many of them}} had to be received on the faith of my companion's admiration. Still I saw very plainly, all the principal objects named; and, among others, the house, the orchard, and the lawn. The building was of stone--as is common with most of the better sort of houses in the country--was long, irregular, and had that air of solid comfort about it, which it is usual to see in buildings of that description. The walls were not whitewashed, according to the lively tastes of our Dutch fellow-colonists, who appear to expend all their vivacity in the <b>pipe</b> and the <b>brush,</b> but were left in their native grey; a circumstance that rendered the form and dimensions of the structure a little less distinct, at a first glance, than they might otherwise have proved. As I gazed at the spot, however, I began to fancy it a charm, to find the picture thus sobered down; and found a pleasure in drawing the different angles, and walls, and chimneys, and roofs, from this back-ground, by means of the organ of sight. On the whole, I thought the little sequestered bay, the wooded and rocky shores, the small but well distributed lawn, the orchard, with all the other similar accessories, formed together one of the prettiest places of the sort I had ever seen. Thinking so, I was not slow in saying as much to my companion. I was thought to have some taste in these matters, and had been consulted on the subject of laying out grounds by one or two neighbours in the county.|$|R
