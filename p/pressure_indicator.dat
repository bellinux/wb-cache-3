40|$|Ecological {{integrity}} (EI), {{a concept}} {{referring to the}} structural and functional components of ecosystems, which {{is closely related to}} the integrity and stability of biotic communities, has deteriorated markedly in freshwater ecosystems across the globe. In New Zealand, many deep lakes appear to have been affected to a lesser extent by anthropogenic activities. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify and quantify a range of key in-lake indicators that could be used to report EI for deep New Zealand lakes, many of which may be expected to have high EI values. Individual indicators of EI in the lakes were related statistically to selected anthropogenic <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators.</b> Values of EI were only weakly related to the anthropogenic <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators,</b> and catchment and lake morphometric and climate characteristics were strong moderators of the relationship and suggests that monitoring of EI requires careful consideration of natural variability amongst different lake ecosystems. Physico-chemical indicators of EI tended to be more closely related to anthropogenic <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> than biological EI indicators. Monitoring of physico-chemical and biological indicators in a set of reference lakes largely devoid of anthropogenic influences will help to better define elements of EI which include “nativeness”, “pristineness”, diversity and resilience.

40|$|High {{uncertainties}} {{may exist}} in the predrill pore pressure prediction in new prospects and deepwater subsalt wells; therefore, real-time pore pressure detection is highly needed to reduce drilling risks. The methods for pore pressure detection (the resistivity, sonic, and corrected d-exponent methods) are improved using the depth-dependent normal compaction equations {{to adapt to the}} requirements of the real-time monitoring. A new method is proposed to calculate pore pressure from the connection gas or elevated background gas, which can be used for real-time pore pressure detection. The pore pressure detection using the logging-while-drilling, measurement-while-drilling, and mud logging data is also implemented and evaluated. Abnormal pore <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> from the well logs, mud logs, and wellbore instability events are identified and analyzed to interpret abnormal pore pressures for guiding real-time drilling decisions.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of ecosystems alterations {{has become a}} crucial task {{in order to develop}} valuable habitats for rare and threatened species. The information extracted from hyperspectral remote sensing data enables the generation of highly spatially resolved analyses of such species’ habitats. In our study we combine information from a species ordination with hyperspectral reflectance signatures to predict occurrence probabilities for Natura 2000 habitat types and their conservation status. We examine how accurate habitat types and habitat threat, expressed by <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators,</b> can be described in an ordination space using spatial correlation functions from the geostatistic approach. We modeled habitat quality assessment parameters using floristic gradients derived by non-metric multidimensional scaling on the basis of 58 field plots. In the resulting ordination space, the variance structure of habitat types and <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> could be explained by 69 % up to 95 % with fitted variogram models with a correlation to terrestrial mapping of > 0. 8. Models could be used to predict habitat type probability, habitat transition, and <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> continuously over the whole ordination space. Finally, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate spectral information from AISA DUAL imagery to floristic pattern and related habitat quality. In general, spectral transferability is supported by strong correlation to ordination axes scores (R 2 = 0. 79 – 0. 85), whereas second axis of dry heaths (R 2 = 0. 13) and first axis for pioneer grasslands (R 2 = 0. 49) are more difficult to describe...|$|R

40|$|The Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality (ANZECC Guidelines) provide default {{national}} guideline {{values for}} a wide range of indicators of relevance to the protection of the ecological condition of natural waters. However, the ANZECC Guidelines also place a strong emphasis on the need to develop more locally relevant guidelines. Using a structured framework, this paper explores indicators and regional data sets that can be used to develop more locally relevant guidelines for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). The paper focuses on the water quality impacts of adjacent catchments on the GBRWHA with the key stressors addressed being nutrients, sediments and agricultural chemicals. Indicators relevant to these stressors are discussed including both physico-chemical <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> and biological condition indicators. Where adequate data sets are available, guideline values are proposed. Generally, data were much more readily available for physico-chemical <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> than for biological condition indicators. Specifically, guideline values are proposed for the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and for chlorophyll-a. More limited guidelines are proposed for sediment related indicators. For most agricultural chemicals, the ANZECC Guidelines are likely to remain the default of choice for some time but it is noted that there is data in the literature that could be used to develop more locally relevant guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Economy-wide {{material}} flow analysis (MFA) and derived indicators {{have been developed}} to monitor and assess the metabolic performance of economies, that is, with respect to the internal economic flows and the exchange of materials with the environment and with other economies. Indicators such as direct material input (DMI) and direct material consumption (DMC) measure material use related to either production or consumption. Domestic hidden flows (HF) account for unused domestic extraction, and foreign HF represent the upstream primary resource requirements of the imports. DMI and domestic and foreign HF account for the total material requirement (TMR) of an economy. Subtracting the exports and their HF provides the total material consumption (TMC). DMI and TMR are used to measure the (de-) coupling of resource use and economic growth, providing the basis for resource efficiency indicators. Accounting for TMR allows detection of shifts from domestic to foreign resource requirements. Net addition to stock (NAS) measures the physical growth of an economy. It indicates the distance from flow equilibrium of inputs and outputs that may be regarded as a necessary condition of a sustainable mature metabolism. We discuss the extent to which MFA-based indicators {{can also be used to}} assess the environmental performance. For that purpose we consider different impacts of {{material flow}}s, and different scales and perspectives of the analysis, and distinguish between turnover-based indicators of generic environmental <b>pressure</b> and impact-based <b>indicators</b> of specific environmental <b>pressure.</b> <b>Indicators</b> such as TMR and TMC are regarded as generic <b>pressure</b> <b>indicators</b> that may not be used to indicate specific environmental impacts.
