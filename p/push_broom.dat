500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] {{was the first}} for {{director}} Samuel Bayer. Bayer stated he believed he was hired because his test-reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be [...] "punk" [...] and [...] "not corporate." [...] The video {{was based on the}} concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot. Inspiration was taken from Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film, Over the Edge, as well as the Ramones' film Rock 'n' Roll High School. Filmed on a soundstage in Culver City, the video featured the band playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The music video features a brief appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene would cut to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a <b>push</b> <b>broom</b> handle. The video ends with the assembled students destroying the set and the band's gear. The demolition of the set captured in the video's conclusion was the result of genuine discontent. The extras that filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. [...] "Once the kids came out dancing they just said ' you,' because they were so tired of this [...] throughout the day," [...] Cobain said. Cobain disliked Bayer's final edit and personally oversaw a re-edit of the video that resulted in the version finally aired. One of Cobain's major additions was the next-to-last shot of the video, which was a close-up of his own face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Bayer noted that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain did not care about vanity, rather that [...] "the video had something that was truly about what they were about." [...] The video had an estimated budget between $30,000 and $50,000.|$|E

50|$|A <b>push</b> <b>broom</b> scanner (also {{known as}} an {{along-track}} scanner) is a device for obtaining images with spectroscopic sensors. The scanners are regularly used for passive remote sensing from space, and in spectral analysis on production lines, for example with near-infrared spectroscopy used to identify contaminated food and feed. The moving scanner line in a traditional photocopier (or a scanner or facsimile machine) is also a familiar, everyday example of a <b>push</b> <b>broom</b> scanner. <b>Push</b> <b>broom</b> scanners and the variant whisk broom scanners (also known as across-track scanners) are often contrasted with staring arrays (such as found in a digital camera or phone), which images objects without scanning, and are more familiar to most people.|$|E

40|$|Topographic {{maps are}} {{compiled}} by manually operated stereoplotters that recreate {{the geometry of}} two wide-angle overlapping stereo frame photographs. Continuous imaging systems such as strip cameras, electro-optical scanners, or linear arrays of detectors (<b>push</b> <b>brooms)</b> can also create stereo coverage from which topography can be compiled; however, the instability of an aircraft in the atmosphere makes this approach impractical. The benign environment of space permits a satellite to orbit the Earth with very high stability as long as no local perturbing forces are involved. Solid-state linear-array sensors have no moving parts and create no perturbing force on the satellite. Digital data from highly stabilized stereo linear arrays are amenable to simplified processing to produce both planimetric imagery and elevation data. A proposed satellite, called MAPSAT, could accomplish automated mapping in near real time. Image maps as large as 1 : 50, 000 scale with contours as close as 20 -m interval may be produced from MAPSAT data...|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2007-2008 year, Amity started its first competitive marching band, known as the Amity High School Spartan Marching Band. Under the direction of Phil Dolan, Amity held its first competitive show in early October 2007. Its 2007 show contained music from the film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl while its 2008 show contained music from the Cirque du Soleil show La Nouba. The Amity Marching Band, while new to the competitive nature of marching band, often came close to the scores of bands who have competed for decades. In addition, they won first place at both of their season's final competitions. In the 2009-2010 season, the Amity Marching Band went on hiatus, while a new staged performance called Music In Motion was put into a trial production. Two shows were held on October 23 and 24, 2009. This new stage production contained a variety of the Amity Band concepts, including marching, jazz, drumline, colorguard and dance. The show included music from The Phantom of the Opera, the film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and the theme music from television show The Simpsons. In addition, several band members put together an imitation of the dance group Stomp, using <b>push</b> <b>brooms</b> and garbage pails to create a chorus of percussion. As of 2010 following 2009's success, Music and Motion permanently replaced the marching band. For the 2010 show, Amity put on a performance including multiple numbers from the show which inspired the program, Blast! such as [...] "Malagueña", [...] "Boléro", and Gee, Officer Krupke! (from West Side Story). In addition, numbers such as [...] "Chameleon" [...] and [...] "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" [...] exclusively featured other sections such as colorguard and jazz band, respectively.|$|R

The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of [...] "an obvious mental breakdown". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and <b>pushed</b> a <b>broom</b> handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so.

50|$|A whisk broom or {{spotlight}} sensor (also {{known as}} an across track scanner) is a technology for obtaining satellite images with optical cameras. It is used for passive remote sensing from space. In a whisk broom sensor, a mirror scans across the satellite’s path (ground track), reflecting light into a single detector which collects data one pixel at a time. The moving parts make this type of sensor expensive and more prone to wearing out. Whisk broom scanners {{have the effect of}} stopping the scan, and focusing the detector on one part of the swath width. Because the detector is only focused on a subsection of the full swath at any time, it typically has a higher resolution than a <b>push</b> <b>broom</b> design for the same size of scan swath.|$|E

This changed the whole process of manufacturing tube-brooms, as one tube could be recycled simply by replacing the brush through replaceable slide-on strips, versus the old method of wrapping the brush around the tube, welding it together, and shipping the tube back for a replacement wrap when it was worn out, or scrapping the tube altogether. Drumm would obtain several patents relating to the strip brush innovation.|$|E

50|$|In spatial scanning, each {{two-dimensional}} (2-D) {{sensor output}} represents a full slit spectrum (x,λ). Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) devices for spatial scanning obtain slit spectra by projecting {{a strip of}} the scene onto a slit and dispersing the slit image with a prism or a grating. These systems have the drawback of having the image analyzed per lines (with a <b>push</b> <b>broom</b> scanner) and also having some mechanical parts integrated into the optical train. With these line-scan systems, the spatial dimension is collected through platform movement or scanning. This requires stabilized mounts or accurate pointing information to ‘reconstruct’ the image. Nonetheless, line-scan systems are particularly common in remote sensing, where it is sensible to use mobile platforms. Line-scan systems are also used to scan materials moving by on a conveyor belt. A special case of line scanning is point scanning (with a whisk broom scanner), where a point-like aperture is used instead of a slit, and the sensor is essentially one-dimensional instead of 2-D.|$|E

40|$|Exterior {{orientation}} parameters’ (EOP) estimation using space resection {{plays an}} important role in topographic reconstruction for <b>push</b> <b>broom</b> scanners. However, existing models of space resection are highly sensitive to errors in data. Unfortunately, for lunar imagery, the altitude data at the ground control points (GCPs) for space resection are error-prone. Thus, existing models fail to produce reliable EOPs. Motivated by a finding that for <b>push</b> <b>broom</b> scanners, angular rotations of EOPs can be estimated independent of the altitude data and only involving the geographic data at the GCPs, which are already provided, hence, we divide the modeling of space resection into two phases. Firstly, we estimate the angular rotations based on the reliable geographic data using our proposed mathematical model. Then, with the accurate angular rotations, the collinear equations for space resection are simplified into a linear problem, and the global optimal solution for the spatial position of EOPs can always be achieved. Moreover, a certainty term is integrated to penalize the unreliable altitude data for increasing the error tolerance. Experimental results evidence that our model can obtain more accurate EOPs and topographic maps not only for the simulated data, but also for the real data from Chang’E- 1, compared to the existing space resection model...|$|E
