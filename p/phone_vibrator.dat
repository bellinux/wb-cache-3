40|$|We {{report on}} {{experiments}} of many small motors [...] cell <b>phone</b> <b>vibrators</b> [...] glued to and interacting through a resonant plate. We find that individual motors {{interacting with the}} plate demonstrate hysteresis in their steady-state frequency due to interactions with plate resonances. For multiple motors running simultaneously, the degree of synchronization between motors increases when the motors' frequencies are near a resonance of the plate, and the frequency at which the motors synchronize shows a history dependence.

5000|$|Cycloramic is an iOS and Windows Phone {{application}} {{that makes the}} Apple iPhone and Compatible Windows Phones rotate 360 degrees without user intervention. It switches the <b>phone’s</b> <b>vibrator</b> at a specific (undisclosed) frequency to make the phone spin around its vertical axis and track the rotation angle using the gyroscope, compass and accelerometer while taking panoramic images. This [...] "handsfree" [...] feature works only on the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s standing on one of its flat edges. Because of this limitation, iPhone 4 users take panoramic photos in a guided mode. Another feature of this program {{is the ability to}} post process panoramic images into 24-second videos for other uses.The update introduced on June 22, 2013 added features to store, edit and share the panoramic pictures.|$|R
40|$|As the {{capabilities}} of smartphones increase, users are beginning to rely on these mobile and ubiquitous platforms to perform more tasks. In addition to traditional computing tasks, {{people are beginning to}} use smartphones to interact with people they meet. Often this interaction begins with an exchange, e. g., of cryptographic keys. Hence, a number of protocols have been developed to facilitate this exchange. Unfortunately, those protocols that provide strong security guarantees often suffer from usability problems, and easyto-use protocols may lack the desired security guarantees. In this work, we highlight the danger of relying on usablebut-perhaps-not-secure protocols by demonstrating an easyto-carry-out man-in-the-middle attack against Bump, the most popular exchange protocol for smartphones. We then present Shake on It (Shot), a new exchange protocol that is both usable and provides strong security properties. In Shot, the <b>phones</b> use <b>vibrators</b> and accelerometers to exchange information in a fashion that demonstratively identifies to the users that the two phones in physical contact are communicating. The vibrated information allows the phones to authenticate subsequent messages, which are exchanged using a server. Our implementation of Shot on DROID smartphones demonstrates that Shot can provide a secure exchange with a similar level of execution time and user effort as Bump. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of electronic devices supporting sensing, actuation, and wireless communication enables the monitoring and/or {{control of a}} variety of physical systems with digital communication. Such “cyber physical systems” blur the boundaries of the digital and physical worlds, where correct information about the physical world is needed for the correct operation of the digital system. Often in these systems the physical source or destination of information {{is as important as the}} information itself. However, the omni-directional and invisible nature of wireless communication makes it difficult to determine communication endpoints. This allows a malicious party to intercept wireless messages or pose as other entities in the system. As such, these systems require new protocols to associate the endpoints of digital communication with physical entities. Traditional security approaches that associate cryptographic keys with names can help verify endpoints in static systems where a string accurately describes the role of a device. In other systems, the role of a device depends on its physical properties, such as location, which change over time. This dynamic nature implies that identification of an endpoint based on a static name is insufficient. Instead, we can leverage devices’ sensing and actuation capabilities to verify the physical properties and determine the physical endpoints of communication. We investigate three different scenarios where the physical source and/or destination is important and propose endpoint verification techniques: verifying the physical endpoints during an exchange between two smartphones, verifying the receiver of information is in a physical space to enable location-based access control, and verifying the source of information to protect Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) applications. We evaluate our proposals in these systems and show that our solutions fulfill the security requirements while utilizing existing hardware. Exchanging Information Between Smartphones Shake on it (SHOT) allows users to verify the endpoints during an exchange of information between two smartphones. In our protocol, the <b>phones</b> use their <b>vibrators</b> and accelerometers to establish a human-observable communication channel. The users hold the phones together while the phones use this channel to bootstrap and verify the authenticity of an exchange that occurs over the higher-bandwidth wireless channel. Users can detect the injection of information from other devices as additional vibrations, and prevent such attacks. Our implementation of SHOT for the DROID smartphone is able to support sender and receiver verification during an exchange between two smartphones in 15 seconds on average. Location-Based Access Control We propose using location-based access control to protect sensitive files on laptops, without requiring any effort from the user to provide security. With a purely wireless electronic system, verifying that a given device is in a physical space is a challenge; either the definition of the physical space is vague (radio waves can travel beyond walls) or the solution requires expensive hardware to measure a message’s time of flight. Instead, we use infrared as a signal that walls can contain. We develop key derivation protocols that ensure only a receiver in the physical room with access to the signal can derive the key. We implement a system that uses the laptop’s webcam to record the infrared signal, derive a key, and decrypt sensitive files in less than 5 seconds. Source Verification for V 2 V Networks A number of V 2 V applications use information about nearby vehicles to prevent accidents or reduce fuel consumption. However, false information about the positioning of vehicles can cause erroneous behavior, including accidents that would not occur in the absence of V 2 V. As such, we need a way to verify which vehicle sent a message and that the message accurately describes the physical state of that vehicle. We propose using LED lights on vehicles to broadcast the certificate a vehicle is currently using. Receivers can use onboard cameras to film the encoding of the certificate and estimate the relative location of the vehicle. This visual channel allows a receiver to associate a physical vehicle at a known location with the cryptographic credentials used to sign a location claim. Our simulations indicate that even with a pessimistic visual channel, visual verification of V 2 V senders provides sufficient verification capabilities to support the relevant applications...|$|R
