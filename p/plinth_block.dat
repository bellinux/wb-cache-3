50|$|Carl W. Miller House; ca 1926; 32 Balton Road, Providence, RI; A two-and-a-half-story, brick-clad, Modern Colonial {{house with}} a central {{recessed}} doorway framed by pilasters and imposts with rosettes and an entablature broken by an architrave with a <b>plinth</b> <b>block</b> above, and flanked by bay windows. Miller was a professor at Brown University.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} a two-story, three-bay clapboard-sided {{structure}} with a hipped roof resting on a large <b>plinth</b> <b>block</b> of undressed ashlar masonry. This foundation also supports a wooden veranda that completely surrounds it. It is bounded with a balustrade featured paneled corner columns and balusters with extremely narrow necks compared to their bellies. Trellised entrances supported by paired Corinthian columns break it on {{the east and west}} sides.|$|E
50|$|A simple wooden {{surround}} {{frames the}} main entrance, {{topped by a}} transom. It opens into a side hall that leads to parlors on the west and (in the wing) on the east. Behind the parlor is the library. Both parlors have Greek Revival interior decorationsâ€”atticurge architraves on the east and corner blocks on the west, where the baseboard forms a <b>plinth</b> <b>block</b> at the floor. A set of stairs near the back leads to the bedrooms upstairs.|$|E
25|$|Building at 61 Central Avenue. Built in 1875, this two-story, five-bay brick {{commercial}} {{building with a}} cast iron storefront {{is the only one}} in the district to have columns supported by high <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|P. B. and H. Moulding Company was {{established}} in 1891. By 1894, Joseph S. Caldwell, Planing and Moulding Mill was in business at 247 Tallman Street. The company manufactured stair rails, newels, balusters, wood mantels and <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Outside {{are several}} {{contributing}} resources. Five are objects, all made of bluestone: a carriage mounting block with [...] "H. BOICE" [...] carved into it, hitching post, two <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks</b> with planters, and a walkway. The former carriage {{house at the}} rear of the property, now converted to a garage, is also contributing.|$|R
50|$|At {{the east}} side of the central lobby, molded marble {{surrounds}} with black granite <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks</b> enclose a bank of six elevators. The north and south lobby walls contain marble-framed double doors with panelized details; these doors lead to the main stairwells, where flights of pink marble stairs and brass railings ascend to the north and south lobbies.|$|R
25|$|In 1874 another {{fire started}} in the Olive Opera House at Brandreth and Central, seriously {{damaging}} it and the neighboring buildings. In the subsequent rebuilding, 145 Main Street was redone in the Renaissance Revival style, with bracketed cornices and pediments and stone trim. On the other side, 61 Central retained its cast iron storefront with columns on high <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks,</b> the only example of that design element in the district.|$|R
50|$|Stone steps {{lead up to}} the {{centrally}} located main entrance. It is sheltered by a stone balcony supported by two smooth rectangular columns in front with inverse-stepped capitals supporting a similar cornice, whose stonework also has been damaged. A wider section {{in the rear of}} the balcony is supported by slightly larger pilasters with similar treatment. Both columns and pilasters are in turn resting on tall <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks.</b> Atop the balcony is a stone balustrade.|$|R
50|$|The {{courthouse}} is a two-story, 5-by-8-bay rectangular gable-roofed frame building, with clapboard siding on {{the north}} and south sides and horizontal planks on its west (front) facade. The pedimented gable is supported by the four Corinthian columns, behind which is the main entrance, with molded classical detail. Similar ornamentation {{can be found on the}} window lintels. The two front corners have large pilasters; the original stone <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks</b> have been replaced with concrete copies and the astragals taken down to help prevent dry rot in the columns.|$|R
5000|$|Six full-width stone steps, {{with four}} {{decorative}} iron handrails, {{lead up to}} the entrance portico on the east (front) elevation, which itself is almost {{as wide as the}} building. From stone <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks</b> on the portico rise four fluted round wooden columns topped by Ionic capitals. Above them is a wide frieze between molded cornices and an entablature with [...] "First Congregational Church" [...] engraved across the width in capital letters. A dentilled cornice tops it, setting off a pediment with a recessed bullseye window in the tympanum and triangular moldings on each side, topped with another dentilled cornice.|$|R
50|$|The second-floor oval {{drawing room}} {{is the most}} highly {{decorated}} {{room in the house}} and is where the women of the house retired to after dinner. Papered in apricot, it features elaborate plaster moldings covered with 24-karat gold leaf and <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks</b> at the base painted to resemble lapis lazuli. The Adamesque ornamentation of the fireplaces' mantles and cornices are among the most detailed in the city. The curved entry doors are faux-grained to resemble flame-grained mahogany on the exterior and tortoise shell on the interior. Curved mullioned mirrors {{on one side of the}} room balance the windows to provide symmetry and reflect light in the room.|$|R
50|$|The north bay {{has a small}} {{projecting}} portico sheltering {{the main}} entrance. The steps leading up to it and its deck are made of large gray limestone blocks. Wide cheek walls {{on either side of}} the stairs have a quarter-round profile following the steps' fall line to identical square stone pedestals topped with cap blocks, currently holding large flower pots, identical to the <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks</b> underneath the two wooden fluted Ionic columns supporting the portico's hipped roof. It has an elaborate entablature with cornice, frieze, dentilled taenia and architrave. The gutter is surrounded on three sides by a gutter with acroteria topped with an anthemion. Two engaged pilasters with Tuscan capitals support the roof at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the south}} is a square parlor with two windows on {{the south and east}} walls, all with {{recessed}} panels on either side and below. They are bordered by paneled pilasters on <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks</b> with beveled tops. A door on the south opens into a small office with a treatment similar to the foyer. The north parlor, occupying the wing on that side, has similar treatments as well but their size varies with each window and door, reflecting its origins as three separate rooms combined into one. It is floored in chestnut planks. On the west wall is a fieldstone fireplace with [...] "H & JG, '69" [...] carved into the masonry for its owners and construction date.|$|R
50|$|The {{pedestal}} {{rests on}} a <b>plinth</b> of <b>blocked</b> rusticated brown sandstone on a stepped concrete base. The lower portion of the pedestal is columnar, with leaded marble plaques, and {{rests on a}} block with shaped corners. The upper portion has a central wreathed column surrounded by colonnettes, and the statue is mounted on rounded base which caps the colonnettes.|$|R
50|$|The Hotel Cecil is a two {{storeyed}} rendered masonry hotel {{located on}} the corner of Down and Lowry Streets at North Ipswich. Built in 1887, the Hotel is constructed of brick with a rendered ruled ashlar finish with a continuous sill to the ground floor walls upon which semi circular headed openings with cement rendered architraves finish on <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks.</b> The main entry to the building is from Down Street through a large 6 panel timber door with sidelights and a semi headed fanlight decorated with leadlights that include the name 'Hotel Cecil 1887'and stained glass panels depicting native flora. There are additional entrances at the truncated corner of the building and two further along Lowry Street. The arched windows to the main bar areas at the main corner of the building comprise pairs of semi headed double hung windows with circular lights above.|$|R
50|$|Bakenkhonsu's {{sarcophagus}} {{is located}} in the World Museum Liverpool, England. He is also noteworthy for a famous block statue inscribed with four vertical columns of hieroglyphs relating his life story. The <b>plinth</b> of the <b>block</b> statue is also engraved with hieroglyphs.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the first}} of four churches built in {{downtown}} Ossining in the late 19th century. The other buildings in the district were primarily built in the wake of four fires. The first, in 1871, primarily affected the corner of the Post Road and Broadway (then called Mill Street) {{to the north of the}} district. Its primary casualty was 217 Main Street, rebuilt in brick instead of frame later that year; however, the village's records, all stored in the basement, were lost. In 1872, the next fire destroyed all the buildings on lower Main Street. In its wake, the Barlow family, who had operated a hardware and furniture business in the original building since 1844, built the block named for it at 129-139 Main Street, retaining the original's bracketed cornice and adding pediments. The Barlows intended for it to be the central commercial location in Ossining.In 1874 another fire started in the Olive Opera House at Brandreth and Central, seriously damaging it and the neighboring buildings. In the subsequent rebuilding, 145 Main Street was redone in the Renaissance Revival style, with bracketed cornices and pediments and stone trim. On the other side, 61 Central retained its cast iron storefront with columns on high <b>plinth</b> <b>blocks,</b> the only example of that design element in the district.|$|R
50|$|The <b>plinth</b> area of <b>Block</b> A is 930,297 sq. ft. (86,460 sq. m), {{while that}} of Block B is 743,900 sq. ft. The dome is cast in stone and closed with glass and will {{function}} as the principal iconic element. A park was initially created on the 5th floor of the Secretariat complex where the upper house was to be situated.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{complex is}} located on the eastern beach area which comprises a low coastal flat with adjacent sandy beach. Physical evidence from this complex includes remnants of buildings, particularly concrete building pads of varying sizes, concrete spoon drains, timber stumps and CGI water tanks. A network of stone-lined pathways also criss-cross the area. Other notable features include a concrete <b>plinth,</b> an engine <b>block</b> base, brick furnace remnants and the remains of an iron oven and stove (Figure 5).|$|R
50|$|The {{operational}} {{areas of}} the Station are housed at ground level and the living quarters for the superintendent occupy the upper level. At the ground floor the large entry doorways open into a drive through plant room surrounded by subsidiary spaces including a committee room, office, bathroom, bearers' bedroom, bearers' dayroom and casualty room. The minor front entrances open into the committee room {{to the left and}} the casualty room to the right. A timber platform has been built over the concrete floor to the plant room. The loggia {{to the rear of the}} building accommodating a car washing space and laundry has been enclosed with weatherboards and the former rear door to the plant room relocated to the centre of this outer wall. The garages constructed immediately to the rear on a raised concrete <b>plinth</b> have <b>blocked</b> the drive through route of the plant room. Internal stairs in the laundry connect to the residence in the upper level.|$|R
25|$|Above {{the main}} cornice, which unites the towers with the portico {{and the outer}} walls, the details are boldly scaled, in order to read well from the street below and from a distance. The towers rise above the cornice from a square <b>block</b> <b>plinth</b> which is plain apart from large oculi, that on the south being filled by the clock, while that on the north is void. The towers are {{composed}} of two complementary elements, a central cylinder rising through the tiers {{in a series of}} stacked drums, and paired Corinthian columns at the corners, with buttresses above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with the square plinth on which it stands. The entablature above the columns breaks forward over them to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The cap, an ogee-shaped dome, supports a gilded pineapple-shaped finial.|$|R

The cap, like a bell-shaped miniature dome, supports a gilded finial, a pineapple supported on four scrolling angled brackets, the topmost expression of the consistent theme.|$|R
5000|$|The cross {{stands at}} the {{junction}} of Romsey Road (the A3057 road) and Church Road in the centre of King's Somborne. It is in Portland stone, consisting of a tapering, lozenge-shaped shaft with short arms moulded close to the top. It sits on a three-tiered <b>plinth</b> of stone <b>blocks</b> which itself sits on a narrow coved plinth which splays upwards from the bottom to provide {{a seat at the}} foot of the cross. The plinth rests on base of three shallow stone steps. On the front of the plinth is the inscription: [...] "TO THE GLORIOUS MEMORY OF THE MEN OF KINGS SOMBORNE / MCM XIV + MCM XIX / MCM XXXIX + MCM XLV" [...] and on the back: [...] "THANKS BE TO GOD WHO GIVETH US THE VICTORY". The names of the fallen from both world wars are inscribed below the dedication around the plinth; the inscriptions related to the Second World War were added at a later date.|$|R
50|$|They call it Sassi da Kallara, {{or simply}} Kaalar, and connect {{it to the}} popular legend of Sassi, the washermanâ€™s {{daughter}} of Bhambore in Sindh, who here becomes a princess, and Punnu, the prince of Kech (Makran), who {{is transformed into a}} camel driver. Standing on the crest of a crumbly clay and sandstone ridge {{on the banks of the}} seasonal Leti Kas (Stream) in the extreme northwest corner of Talagang tehsil, the stubby ruin is visible from a distance. Built with large kiln fired bricks (440 mm to 480 mm x 260 mm x 50 mm), it is the only Hindu Shahya temple in the Salt Range to use this material. All others being constructed with porous, fossileferous limestone.Situated at the very edge of the crumbly hill, the building raised above a high <b>plinth</b> of limestone <b>blocks,</b> is entered from the east via the remains of a portico that fell away years ago. Indeed, the erosion that undermined the entrance now threatens to sweep away the entire building. Inside, the floor of the cella has been partially dug up, very likely by treasure hunters. The walls, fortunately, are intact, above which the original roof has been replaced by a cement and steel dome - the brave attempt of some concerned archeologist to preserve the deteriorating structure.|$|R
5000|$|He {{had broken}} his {{tour of duty}} at Berlin to {{conclude}} the purchase of Stainborough {{in the summer of}} 1708, and returned to Berlin, armed with sufficient specifications of the site to engage the services of a military architect who had spent some years recently in England, Johann von Bodt. who provided the designs. Wentworth was in Italy in 1709, buying paintings for the future house: [...] "I have great credit by my pictures," [...] he reported with satisfaction: [...] "They are all designed for Yorkshire, and I hope to have a better collection there than Mr. Watson." [...] To display them a grand gallery would be required, for which James Gibbs must have provided the designs, since a contract for wainscoting [...] "as desined by Mr Gibbs" [...] survives among Wentworth papers in the British Library (Add. Mss 22329, folio 128). The Gallery was completed in 1724. There are designs, probably by Bodt, for an elevation and a section showing the gallery at Wentworth Castle in the Victoria and Albert Museum (E.307-1937), in an album of mixed drawings which belonged to William Talman's son John. the gallery extends one hundred and eighty feet, twenty-four feet wide, and thirty high, screened into three divisions by veined marble Corinthian columns with gilded capitals, and with corresponding pilasters against projecting piers: in the intervening spaces four marble copies of Roman sculptures on <b>block</b> <b>plinths</b> survived until the twentieth century. Construction was sufficiently advanced by March-April 1714 that surviving correspondence between Strafford and William Thornton concerned the disposition of panes in the window sashes: the options were for windows four panes wide, as done in the best houses Thornton assured the earl, for which crown glass would do, or for larger panes, three panes across, which might requite plate glass: Strafford opted for the latter. The results, directed largely by letter from a distance, are unique in Britain. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner found the east range [...] "of a palatial splendour uncommon in England." [...] The grand suite of parade rooms on the ground floor extended from the room at the north end with a ceiling allegory of Plenty to the south end, with one of a Fame.|$|R
