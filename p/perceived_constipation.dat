40|$|A {{satisfactory}} {{definition of}} constipation is elusive. An important and measurable element is slow colonic transit. Whole gut transit time, {{a proxy for}} colonic transit time, can be estimated from self recorded data on stool form and frequency. Our aim was to compare whole gut transit time with subjective definitions {{in the context of}} the general population. In a community based sample of 731 women aged 25 - 69 years the estimated whole gut transit time was compared with two subjective assessments of constipation-the woman's own perception and a symptom based definition proposed by an international working team (Rome definition). We have defined slow whole gut transit time as > 2 SD above the mean in women who seldom passed lumpy stools (that is, > 92 hours). Slow transit was present in 9. 3 % of the sample. Similar numbers met the subjective definitions (8. 5 % and 8. 2 %). However, the overlap between the three definitions was poor. Of 68 women with estimated slow transit, 28 had self <b>perceived</b> <b>constipation,</b> 20 had Rome defined constipation, and only 11 had both. Of subjects classified as constipated by the subjective definitions only 37 % had slow transit; they had a high prevalence of irritable bowel symptoms. In conclusion, this study showed that the term constipation is ambiguous and often misleading and that attempts to base a definition on symptoms are misguided. In epidemiological studies, conclusions about the prevalence of constipation should be based on records of stool type and timing...|$|E
40|$|Constipation is a {{prevalent}} symptom in {{the hospice}} population, negatively effecting {{quality of life}} for patients. Constipation is frequently overlooked, undiagnosed, and untreated by healthcare providers. The role of the hospice nurse is ideal for managing the symptom of constipation with traditional and alternative therapies. Literature review reveals very limited research on constipation and hospice patients, and alternative therapies for constipation. No research was found regarding nurse attitudes towards alternative therapies, such as abdominal massage for constipation. This research study tested the following hypothesis: Hospice nurses <b>perceive</b> <b>constipation</b> as significantly impacting the {{quality of life for}} the hospice patient, and hospice nurses have a positive attitude towards abdominal massage as an alternative intervention for constipation. A descriptive survey, guided by the theoretical framework of Jean Watson 2 Ì† 7 s philosophy of science and caring, was conducted using a convenience sample of hospice nurses. The results indicated that hospice nurses do <b>perceive</b> <b>constipation</b> as significantly impacting quality of life; and, hospice nurses have an open attitude towards abdominal massage. It is concluded that hospice nurses would benefit from education regarding abdominal massage as an alternative intervention for constipation. The implications of this study have the potential to impact nursing practice and {{the quality of life for}} hospice patients and their families...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} whether variables identified as likely to impact the experience of constipation in other clinical settings similarly affected the experiences of constipated palliative care patients. Background: The majority of palliative care patients with cancer {{are likely to be}} bothered by constipation symptoms {{at some point in their}} disease trajectory. Despite this, it remains unclear as to which factors predict more severe problems. Methods: This study was conducted in a sample of 94 constipated palliative care patients who were asked to voluntarily complete a series of questions regarding their demographic and other characteristics, including whether they had chronic constipation symptoms, that is, constipation symptoms for 12 months. Other variables included age, body mass index, sex, performance status, and regular opioids and their doses. At the same time, they were asked to complete the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) questionnaires. Results: Descriptive statistics summarized baseline data. Unadjusted associations between the selected variables on PAC-SYM were examined by using bi-variate analyses. Significant variables identified on bi-variate analyses were included in a multivariate analysis. The final results identified that only the chronicity of constipation symptoms predicted more severe symptoms. This relationship persisted when this single variable was retained in the final model, illustrating that PAC-SYM scores are 0. 41 higher in patients with chronic constipation compared with those without it (p = 0. 02). In contrast, regular opioid use was not identified as a significant factor (p = 0. 56). Discussion: This study suggests that the factor most likely to predict worse constipation symptoms was the duration that people had experienced problems. Further, those who <b>perceived</b> their <b>constipation</b> symptoms to be more severe had a poorer quality of life. More work is required to better define constipation risk factors and ways to best modify a patient's experiences...|$|R
