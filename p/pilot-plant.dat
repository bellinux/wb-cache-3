40|$|Before {{they can}} be re-smelted and fed back into the raw [...] {{material}} cycle, oil-contaminated metallic grinding sludges from the metal and steel industries must have {{the greater part of}} all hydrocarbons removed from them. Currently, there is no full-scale de-oiling process avialable, although various de-oiling processes involving thermal and extractive procedures are being developed. NOELL Abfall- und Energietechnik GmbH has developed a washing process to de-oil rough metal-shavings which it is possible to modify so that the residues from the rolling of steel and metallic grinding sludges can be de-oiled. After screening, the materials are conditioned and then a detergent is added. Subsequently, the material is washed in one or more wash-stages and finally the product, now free of oil, is de-watered. According to its use, it can be further dried and briquetted (for use in the smelting bath) or left moist (for use in the blast furnace, after pre-treatment in the sintering plant). The process parameters for the removal of oil from these residues are determined in laboratory experiments. At the <b>pilot-plants</b> level, a continuous removal of oil from metallic grinding sludge (26 - 35 % oil content) to give a residue containing < 1 % hydrocarbons was attained. In removing oil from this sludge, an oil content of < 1 % in the residue is technically possible using the washing process which has been developed. This oil content is sufficiently low for the material to be used in a pyrometallurgical process and thus recycled. (orig.)

40|$|Environmental hazard by leaking sewers {{depends on}} {{potential}} {{of risk and}} of frequency of every individual sewer damage. We know about {{the different kinds of}} sewer damages and about their frequency in the public sewerage system, but nothing about the total quantity of sewer exfiltration, because exfiltration measurement have not yet been practised. Investigations about consequences of infiltration of groundwater to leaking sewers have been carried out really seldom. We know, that sewer infiltration water can cause hydraulic overloading of the sewerage system and some troubles of the biological treatment process of the sewage treatment plant. Main targets of this research project were to measure sewer exfiltration and sewer infiltration directly on the spot, to find out the important side-parameters for the quantity of this, to evaluate the environmental hazard and to cooperate in a workgroup for to acquire an evaluation system for the most profitable sequence of the activities of sewer rehabilitation. Quantity of sewer exfiltration was measured by means of a special measuring appliance, which was developed and constructed at the institute. Investigations have been carried out by short-term measurement on broken sewers directly on the spot as well as by long-term measurement on two <b>pilot-plants.</b> Water pollution caused by sewer infiltration was investigated by computer simulation. As a result of the measurements it is possible to give a figure for the sewer exfiltration and to predict the long-term behaviour of a leaking sewer. The migration of exfiltration water and harmful wastewater components is not all constant, even if there are no changes in the rate and in the depth of flow in the defective sewer damage and surrounding soil. Another result was to find out a selfsealing of a sewer damage in consequence of sewer film and particulate wastewater matter. But this selfsealing is only a temporary effect, it can be undone by a high depth of flow or pressure head in the pipe. The long-term investgations by means of pilot plants showed a clear decrease of the concentration of some wastewater components. Sewer infiltration was found to cause a higher effluent load because of the receding efficiency of wastewater treatment plants. Another pathway for a higher water pollution is more frequent spilling with a longer duration of combined sewer overflows. (orig.)

40|$|Evaporation and {{crystallization}} are key thermal separation {{processes for}} concentrating and purifying inorganic and organic products with energy consumption over 1, 000 trillion Btu/yr. This project {{focused on a}} challenging task of recovering low-temperature latent heat that can have a paradigm shift in the way thermal process units will be designed and operated to achieve high-energy efficiency and significantly reduce the carbon footprint as well as water footprint. Moreover, this project has evaluated the technical merits of waste-heat powered thermal heat pumps for recovery of latent heat from distillation, multi-effect evaporation (MEE), and crystallization processes and recycling into the process. The Project Team has estimated the potential energy, economics and environmental benefits with the focus on reduction in CO 2 emissions that can be realized by 2020, assuming successful development and commercialization of the technology being developed. Specifically, with aggressive industry-wide applications of heat recovery and recycling with absorption heat pumps, energy savings of about 26. 7 trillion Btu/yr have been estimated for distillation process. The direct environmental benefits of this project are the reduced emissions of combustible products. The estimated major reduction in environmental pollutants in the distillation processes is in CO 2 emission equivalent to 3. 5 billion lbs/year. Energy consumption associated with water supply and treatments can vary between 1, 900 kWh and 23, 700 kWh per million-gallon water depending on sources of natural waters [US DOE, 2006]. Successful implementation of this technology would significantly reduce the demand for cooling-tower waters, and thereby the use and discharge of water treatment chemicals. The Project Team has also identified and characterized working fluid pairs for the moderate-temperature heat pump. For an MEE process, the two promising fluids are LiNO 3 +KNO 3 +NANO 3 (53 : 28 : 19) and LiNO 3 +KNO 3 +NANO 2 (53 : 35 : 12). And for an H 2 O 2 distillation process, the two promising fluids are Trifluoroethanol (TFE) + Triethylene Glycol Dimethyl ether (DMETEG) and Ammonia+ Water. Thermo-physical properties calculated by Aspen+ are reasonably accurate. Documentation of the installation of <b>pilot-plants</b> or full commercial units were {{not found in the}} literature for validating thermo-physical properties in an operating unit. Therefore, it is essential to install a pilot-scale unit to verify thermo-physical properties of working fluid pairs and validate the overall efficiency of the thermal heat pump at temperatures typical of distillation processes. For an HO 2 process, the ammonia-water heat pump system is more compact and preferable than the TFE-DMETEG heat pump. The ammonia-water heat pump is therefore recommended for the H 2 O 2 process. Based on the complex nature of the heat recovery system, we anticipated that capital costs could make investments financially unattractive where steam costs are low, especially where co-generation is involved. We believe that the enhanced heat transfer equipment has the potential to significantly improve the performance of TEE crystallizers, independent of the absorption heat-pump recovery system. Where steam costs are high, more detailed design/cost engineering will be required to verify the economic viability of the technology. Due to the long payback period estimated for the TEE open system, further studies on the TEE system are not warranted unless there are significant future improvements to heat pump technology. For the H 2 O 2 distillation cycle heat pump waste heat recovery system, there were no significant process constraints and the estimated 5 years payback period is encouraging. We therefore recommend further developments of application of the thermal heat pump in the H 2 O 2 distillation process with the focus on the technical and economic viability of heat exchangers equipped with the state-of-the-art enhancements. This will require additional funding for a prototype unit to validate enhanced thermal performances of heat transfer equipment, evaluate the fouling characteristics in field testing, and remove the uncertainty factors included in the estimated payback period for the H 2 O 2 distillation system...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance the}} overall {{efficiency}} {{of the use of}} biomass in the energy sector in Europe, the large electricity production potential from small-scale biomass heating systems should be utilised. So far, no technologically sound (in terms of efficiency and reliability) and economically affordable micro- and small-scale biomass CHP technologies are, however, available. Therefore, the present ERA-NET project (MiniBioCHP) aimed at the further development and test of new CHP technologies based on small-scale biomass combustion in the electric capacity range between some W and 100 kW. Within the project, an international consortium consisting of 12 partners from 4 countries, including university institutions, institutes and industry (both engineering and manufacturing), collaborated closely to perform high level R&D on three promising micro/small-scale biomass based CHP technologies which are covering a broad range of applications in the residential heating sector. The Austrian engineering company BIOS, coordinated the international project. The project was based on earlier basic research and development work related to these promising new technologies and aimed at the achievement of a technological level which allows a first (commercial) demonstration {{after the end of the}} project. The three CHP concepts included in the MiniBioCHP project were; 1. Pellet stoves with a thermoelectric generator (TEG) 2. Small-scale biomass boilers (10 - 30 kWth) with a micro-ORC process 3. High temperature heat exchanger (HT-HE) for an externally fired gas turbine (EFGT) The Swedish part of the project was focused on the development of the concept of biomass based EFGT with dedicated R&D activities related to the development of the HT-HE system. The Swedish project consisted of the research partners Umeå University (project leader), Luleå University of Technology, Chalmers University of Technology and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, together with the industrial partners Enertech AB/Osby Parca and Ecergy. The expertise of the Swedish partners regarding ash related problems, grate boiler combustion and modelling, deposit formation and high temperature corrosion, were combined with the know-how of a Polish partner regarding HT-HE design, construction, testing and optimisation. The HT-HE is the most crucial component in EFGT processes significantly influencing the investment costs, availabilities as well as the efficiencies that can be achieved. With a thermal capacity from several hundred kW up to 2 - 3 MWth) the CHP technology based on a biomass boiler and an EFGT is suitable for district heating systems, or process heat consumers. The electricity produced by the gas turbine (up to some 100 kWel) can be used to cover the own electricity consumption of a company and/or fed into the grid. Even though the concept of biomass based EFGT has been an interesting alternative for small-scale CHP production for some decades, and R&D activities have been undertaken, tackling both economic and technical aspects, only a few <b>pilot-plants</b> have been in operation and no initiative has so far reached the level of commercial implementation. Thus, the concept of EFGT fed with biomass is still considered to be in a rather early development stage and the main technical challenges are related to alkali deposit induced corrosion and thermal stress of the HT-HE material, turbine design/operation and system integration. Within the present project, a HT-HE prototype aimed for an EFGT system was therefore designed, constructed and successfully tested at flue gas temperatures up to 900 °C. Thus, appropriate guidelines for a compact design of the HT-HE and recommendations have been worked out to minimize thermal stresses as well as ash related problems regarding ash deposit formation and high temperature corrosion in a biomass boiler system. Furthermore, different concepts for the overall biomass based EFGT system have been worked out and evaluated. The outcome of the project will hopefully be used in the further development work and form the basis for a first testing and demonstration plant within the coming years. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A <b>pilot-plant</b> {{test that}} can treat {{an amount of}} 30 ton per day of {{wastewater}} is performed. The purpose of this test is to prove the usefulness and applicability of newly developed microfiltration membranes made from chlorinated poly (vinyl chloride) and polyester nonwoven.

The membrane consists of the novel structure in which small particles made from hydroxyl-propyl cellulose gel are homogeneously dispersed and attached {{on the surface of}} micro fibrils in the structure. The result of the <b>pilot-plant</b> test shows that the newly developed membrane has anti-fouling properties better than that of a conventional membrane made from chlorinated poly (vinyl chloride) by another company. It still shows high hydrophilicity after the use of one year, while the conventional one loses such properties.

In addition, it is recommended that two small-scale systems, one processing radioactive waste feed and one processing a simulated waste feed be used for validation of waste simulants. The actual scale of the <b>pilot-plant</b> will be determined from the technologies included in conceptual design of the plant.

It is recommended that a detailed data needs package and integrated flowsheet be developed in FY 95 to clearly identify data requirements and identify relationships with other TWRS elements. A <b>pilot-plant</b> will contribute to the reduction of uncertainty in the design and initial operation of the vitrification facility to an acceptable level. Prior to pilot-scale testing, the components will not have been operated as an integrated system and will not have been tested for extended operating periods. Testing for extended periods at pilot-scale will allow verification of the flowsheet including the effects of recycle streams. In addition, extended testing will allow evaluation of wear, corrosion and mechanical reality of individual components, potential accumulations within the components, and the sensitivity of the process to operating conditions. Also, the pilot facility will provide evidence that the facility will meet radioactive and nonradioactive environmental release limits, and increase the confidence in scale-up.

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} produces sludge {{which is}} usually dewatered prior to disposal to reduce disposal costs. This work used compressive rheology tools to accurately measure the dewatering properties of selected sewage sludges {{with a focus on}} sludge produced by Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD). Sludges were sampled from a 500 litre ATAD <b>pilot-plant</b> at Killarney Co. Kerry, and from wastewater treatment plants in Australia, Ireland, Germany and Luxembourg. The project aims to outline the dewatering properties of these sludges and to determine some of the factors which govern wastewater sludge dewatering. The theoretical basis of this work was the phenomenonological solid-liquid separation theory of Buscall and White (1987). The gel-point, compressibility, and permeability have been established as the fundamental physical properties that determine suspension dewaterability. However, until recently, the experimental determination of these properties for wastewater sludges (which exhibit atypical behaviour) was limited due to theoretical and experimental constraints. Recently, new qualitative and quantitative methods based upon the Buscall and White (1987) approach to dewatering characterisation have been developed, and have been successfully applied to wastewater sludges (Stickland, 2005). In this study these methods were applied to ATAD sludges for the first time. Filtration, settling and centrifugation tests were used to measure the material characteristics of several ATAD sludges, some of which were conditioned using polymeric flocculants and inorganic coagulants. All wastewater treatment sludges which were investigated in this work exhibited nontraditional filtration characteristics, forming highly networked suspension at low solids concentrations.

An alternative approach to performing time and material consuming <b>pilot-plant</b> experiments is modelling with the drop population-balance model ReDrop.

The mean particle diameters (Mean D) of all the powders produced by <b>pilot-plant</b> spray dryer were {{in the range of}} 11.26 – 18.23  μm. It can be observed that by increasing the inlet (outlet) air temperature, the diameter of the particles increased. By increasing the inlet air temperature, the top surface dried quickly. This hard layer did not allow internal moisture to leave the particle and led it to inflation, which increased the particle size. Comparing <b>pilot-plant</b> with industrial samples, it can be inferred that although industrial samples are more homogenous, they are similar to each other regarding particle size. Inlet (outlet) air temperature above water boiling point leads to water boiling in the drops; consequently, particles are inflamed and diameter of the particles increases.

40|$|Strains of Acinetobacter {{which showed}} marked {{variation}} {{in their ability}} to accumulate intracellular polyphosphate (Pn) were isolated from a <b>pilot-plant</b> which was removing phosphate biologically. Variants which could not accumulate Pn under the same growth conditions were derived from two of the isolates which accumulated high levels of Pn. The activities of five enzymes reported to have a role in Pn synthesis showed {{no significant differences between the}} two variants, their parent strains and two other natural isolates. In the presence of 20 μm N,N 2 ̆ 7 -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), growth of the variant strains was suppressed, whereas the parent strains were still able to grow and form polyphosphate. A mechanism which depends upon the trans-membrane proton gradient of the cell is proposed to account for the high levels of polyphosphate formed by some strains of Acinetobacter. Each of the Acinetobacter strains isolated from the <b>pilot-plant</b> carried several plasmids. Comparison of one strain, which accumulated a high level of Pn, and its variant, showed that a deletion of approximately 20 kb of plasmid DNA from the parent strain had occurred.

Considering the volume of spray dryer and its capacity, heating time for particles was too long, which caused more conversion of lactose into lactic acid. Accordingly, EC in industrial samples was more and PH level was lower.|$|E
