Following mesenchymal stem cell growth on the laser treated samples, it was identified that CO 2 laser surface treatment gave rise to an enhanced response with an increase in viable cell count of up to 60, 000 cells/ml when compared to the as-received sample. The effect of surface parameters modified by the CO 2 laser surface treatment on the mesenchymal stem cell response is also discussed along with potential trends that could be identified to govern the mesenchymal stem cell response...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pharmaceutical drug {{development}} costs have risen rapidly {{over the past}} twenty years. However, the number of new molecular entities being approved has not increased. As <b>pharmaceutical</b> companies <b>scale</b> back their R&D in light of this deteriorating productivity, significant unmet medical needs remain unaddressed. Much of these rising costs can be traced to work on compounds that are abandoned before getting to market. There is a growing need to recover these abandoned compounds. The inside-out branch of open innovation provides a way to increase the performance of pharmaceutical firms, both in addressing unmet societal needs, and potentially in identifying new revenue sources and business models for a more distributed model of commercializing new drugs. This aspect of open innovation is not much discussed in the literature to date. The medical research community, in conjunction with a number of industry and nonprofit organizations, has started several projects to recover more abandoned compounds. These new initiatives are still at an early stage, and have not received much critical evaluation to date. Examining four of these initiatives, we find that they do extend the cognitive frames in the research phase, while doing less to extend those frames in the commercialization phase...|$|R

40|$|The configurational {{lability}} of enantiomers can {{be characterized}} by different terms, each defining a specific process. Racemization relates to the macroscopic and statistical process of the irreversible transformation {{of one of the}} enantiomers into the racemic mixture. Enantiomerization refers to the microscopic and molecule process of the reversible conversion of one enantiomer into the other. Methods allowing the experimental determination of rate constants of racemization (k(rac)) and enantiomerization (k(enant)) are discussed, and it is shown that k(enant) = 112 K-rac. Neglect of this fact is a source of some confusion in the literature. When two or more elements of chirality are present in a molecule {{and one of them is}} configurationally labile, epimerization occurs, a particular case of diastereomerization. These processes of interconversion between diastereomers are kinetically more complicated than racemization and enantiomerization since the rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions are always different (k(diast) /A-to-B not equal k(diast/B-to-A)), however small the difference. An important aspect of the configurational lability of stereoisomeric drugs is the time scale of the phenomenon. When interconversion occurs to a significant extent during the residence time of a drug in the body, a pharmacological time scale is implied. In contrast, the <b>pharmaceutical</b> time <b>scale</b> refers to slower rates of interconversion that affect the configurational purity of a drug during its shelf-life.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decades, {{the role of}} the {{pharmacist}} and of pharmacy practice have moved from that of drug manufacturing and technical dispensing to a more cognitive role with patient orientation. The concept of pharmaceutical care focuses on the process of ‘using a drug’, bearing in mind that the dispensing of a drug is neither the beginning nor the end of this process. Pharmaceutical care is based on a relationship between the patient and the pharmacist who accepts responsibility for the patient. However, much of the impetus for pharmaceutical care provision has been driven by academics, and only limited published data {{on the extent to which}} pharmaceutical care has been adopted and implemented are available. The aim of project A was to evaluate the current provision of pharmaceutical care by European community pharmacists and the impact of a range of factors that could affect its implementation. For this study, the behavioural <b>pharmaceutical</b> care <b>scale</b> (BPCS) was used. A total of 4, 696 questionnaires were obtained. The mean total BPCS scores ranged from 50. 6 (Denmark; DK) to 83. 5 (Ireland). The results of project A suggest that the provision of pharmaceutical care in a comprehensive fashion is still limited within Europe. Pharmacists rarely documented activities related to patient care and did not often engaged in implementing therapeutic objectives and monitoring plans. With project B, we aimed to explore differences between standard pharmacists, pharmacists participating in quality circles, and Danish pharmacists.

40|$|Rationale, Aims & Objectives: Pharmaceutical care {{involves}} patient-centred pharmacist {{activity to}} improve medicines management by patients. The {{implementation of this}} service in a comprehensive manner, however, requires considerable organisation and effort and indeed it is often not fully implemented in care settings. The main objective was to assess how pharmaceutical care provision within community pharmacy has evolved over time in Europe. Method: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of community pharmacies, using {{a modified version of}} the Behavioural <b>Pharmaceutical</b> Care <b>Scale</b> (BPCS) was conducted in late 2012 /early 2013 within 16 European countries and compared with an earlier assessment conducted in 2006. Results: The provision of comprehensive pharmaceutical care has slightly improved in all European countries that participated in both editions of this survey (n= 8) with progress being made particularly in Denmark and Switzerland. Moreover, there was a wider country uptake, indicating spread of the concept. However, due to a number of limitations, the results should be interpreted with caution. Using combined data from participating countries, the provision of pharmaceutical care was positively correlated with the participation of the community pharmacists in patient-centred activities, routine use of pharmacy software with access to clinical data, participation in multi-disciplinary team meetings and having specialised education. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated a slight evolution in self-reported provision of pharmaceutical care by community pharmacists across Europe, as measured by the BPCS. The slow progress suggests a range of barriers which are preventing pharmacists moving beyond traditional roles. Support from professional bodies and more patient centred community pharmacy contracts, including remuneration for pharmaceutical care services, are likely to be required if quicker progress is to be made in the future...|$|R

The paper measures technical efficiency of the {{pharmaceutical industry}} of Bangladesh using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) over a period of 2009 to 2013. We use the non-parametric DEA with one output- annual sales and three inputs; viz. (i) fixed asset; (ii) raw material cost; and (iii) cost of salary. Results of the analysis reveal that Malmquist total factor productivity index (TPI) has maintained a slightly upward trend during the study period with a value of 4. 7 % annually. It has also been observed that the major contributor of TPI growth is technological change with a value of 10. 8 % positive growth annually. Additionally, all changes of technical efficiency; pure efficiency and scale efficiency have regressed with values of 5. 5 %, 2. 1 % and 3. 5 % respectively. The overall productivity progress was due to technological progress and an overall efficiency regress.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{critique}} of Margaret Berger and Aaron Twerski, “Uncertainty and Informed Choice: Unmasking Daubert,” forthcoming in the Michigan Law Review. Berger and Twerski propose that courts recognize a cause of action that would allow plaintiffs who claim injury from pharmaceutical products, but {{who do not have}} sufficient evidence to prove causation, to recover damages for deprivation of informed choice. Berger and Twerski claim inspiration from the litigation over allegations that the morning sickness drug Bendectin caused birth defects. Considering the criteria Berger and Twerski suggest for their proposed cause of action in the context of Bendectin, it appears that a pharmaceutical manufacturer could be held liable for failure to provide informed choice: (a) even when there was never any sound scientific evidence suggesting that the product caused the harm at issue, and there was an unbroken consensus among leading experts in the field that the product did not cause such harm; (b) when the product prevented serious harm to a significant number of patients, and prevented substantial discomfort to a much greater number, even when there were no available alternative products; (c) when a plaintiff claims that she would not have taken the product had she been informed of an incredibly remote and completely unproven risk; and (d) when the defendant is unable to prove a negative - that the product in question definitely did not cause the claimed injury. No rational legal system would allow such a tort. Putting the Bendectin example aside, the informed choice proposal has the following additional weaknesses: (1) it invites reliance on unreliable junk science testimony; (2) it ignores the fact that juries are not competent to resolve subtle risk assessment issues; (3) it reflects an unwarranted belief in the ability of juries to both follow limiting instructions and ignore their emotions; (4) it ignores the problems inherent to multiple trials - even if defendants were to win most informed choice cases, safe products could still be driven off the market by a minority of contrary verdicts; (5) it ignores the inevitable costs to medical innovation as <b>pharmaceutical</b> companies <b>scale</b> back on researching product categories that would be particularly prone to litigation; (6) to preempt litigation, pharmaceutical companies would overwarn, rendering more significant warnings less useful; and (7) FDA labeling requirements would arguably preempt the proposed cause of action...|$|R

Δ 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC) is the psychoactive cannabinoid. The high lipophilicity of Δ 9 -THC is a hindering factor in the further development of this compound into a large <b>scale</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> product. In an effort to generate highly polar derivatives of Δ 9 -THC, we screened 206 alkane degrading bacterial strains. In total, eight derivatives were produced on milligram. All of these biotransformation products harbored modified alkyl chains, with hydroxy, carboxy and ester functionalities. We also investigated the potential of cell suspension culture of Catharanthus Roseus to transform Δ 9 -THC. Unlike bacterial strains, Catharanthus Roseus cells transformed Δ 9 -THC to its glycosylated and additionally hydroxylated derivatives. The behavioral effects of ∆ 9 -THC are mediated by the centra l CB 1 receptor in rats. CB 1 receptors show high degree of sequence conservation in vertebrates. We used zebrafish embryos as a model to study the behavioral effects of cannabinoids. We conclude that cannabinoids have behavioural effects in zebrafish that are comparable {{to some of those}} reported in the literature for mammals. In particular, the acute exposure response resembles behavioural effects reported for adult. This suggests that some similarity in cannabinoid response pathways between zebrafish and mammals exists.

40|$|Abstract Background Nanoparticle based {{delivery}} of anticancer drugs {{have been widely}} investigated. However, a very important process for Research & Development in any <b>pharmaceutical</b> industry is <b>scaling</b> nanoparticle formulation techniques so as to produce large batches for preclinical and clinical trials. This process is not only critical but also difficult as it involves various formulation parameters to be modulated {{all in the same}} process. Methods In our present study, we formulated curcumin loaded poly (lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-CURC). This improved the bioavailability of curcumin, a potent natural anticancer drug, making it suitable for cancer therapy. Post formulation, we optimized our process by Reponse Surface Methodology (RSM) using Central Composite Design (CCD) and scaled up the formulation process in four stages with final scale-up process yielding 5 g of curcumin loaded nanoparticles within the laboratory setup. The nanoparticles formed after scale-up process were characterized for particle size, drug loading and encapsulation efficiency, surface morphology, in vitro release kinetics and pharmacokinetics. Stability analysis and gamma sterilization were also carried out. Results Results revealed that that process scale-up is being mastered for elaboration to 5 g level. The mean nanoparticle size of the scaled up batch was found to be 158. 5 [*]±[*] 9. 8 nm and the drug loading was determined to be 10. 32 [*]±[*] 1. 4 %. The in vitro release study illustrated a slow sustained release corresponding to 75 % drug over a period of 10 days. The pharmacokinetic profile of PLGA-CURC in rats following i. v. administration showed two compartmental model with the area under the curve (AUC 0 -∞) being 6. 139 mg/L h. Gamma sterilization showed no significant change in the particle size or drug loading of the nanoparticles. Stability analysis revealed long term physiochemical stability of the PLGA-CURC formulation. Conclusions A successful effort towards formulating, optimizing and scaling up PLGA-CURC by using Solid-Oil/Water emulsion technique was demonstrated. The process used CCD-RSM for optimization and further scaled up to produce 5 g of PLGA-CURC with almost similar physicochemical characteristics as that of the primary formulated batch. </p...|$|R
40|$|Milling {{has been}} the key unit {{operation}} in controlling particle size of <b>pharmaceutical</b> powders at <b>scale.</b> The work carried out in this thesis is a comprehensive study of the stability of pharmaceutical solids post-milling and upon storage, from molecular level up to bulk handling scale. It {{is an attempt to}} fill key gaps in knowledge with regard to the anomalous behaviour and physical instability of milled powder through the development of advanced novel techniques. The physical instability of milled or amorphous pharmaceutical powders often manifest in changes in derived powder properties. Moisture induced dimensional changes of amorphous lactose compacts were monitored by in-situ environmental controlled optical profilometry. The complex volumetric behaviour involves glassy-rubbery phase transition followed by amorphous-crystalline transformation under the influence of water. These associated changes were not observed in physical aging of amorphous lactose compacts by measuring specific surface area. At the molecular level these physical changes are governed by relaxation processes. By operating within the linear viscoelastic region, low strain uni-axial indentation of small molecule organic glasses at a range of temperature generated master curves using WLF analysis. Viscoelastic behaviour of these materials were determined to be controlled by local β-relaxation around the glass transition rather than globally for polymers. At the bulk level, due to the non-equilibrium nature of milled and amorphous powders, their surface energies tends to be significantly higher than the equivalent crystalline forms. This can be detrimental as highly cohesive and poor flowing powders are difficult to process. The unconfined compression test was adapted to measure cohesion of small weak pharmaceutical powder compacts. More significantly, a positive relationship was confirmed between surface energetics and cohesion of modified D-mannitol. At the particle level, the mechanism(s) by which milling or micronisation creates low levels of amorphicity remains unclear. MOUDI fractionation of bulk micronised α-lactose monohydrate and characterisation of fine fractions has clearly demonstrated that micronisation as well as mechanical particle size reduction also generates low levels of highly amorphous ultrafine particles within bulk crystalline powder which will {{have a significant effect on}} powder physical stability post-milling and upon storage. In conclusion, using the novel techniques developed here, significant progress has been towards understanding the physical behaviour of milled and amorphous pharmaceutical solids.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} crystal nucleation, growth and dissolution processes, focussing particularly on the behaviour of the crystal surface. To facilitate this various methods of microscopy were used, as well as electrochemical techniques, with the goal to separate mass transport towards the crystal surface and the processes which occur close to the crystal surface, and measure intrinsic growth/dissolution rates. In order to do this, crystal systems were screened for their relevance to applications in industrial processes, and those chosen were related to <b>pharmaceutical</b> crystallization and <b>scale</b> formation in o↵ shore oil wells. For each system, different methods of electrochemical measurement and microscopy were investigated to chose a technique which works best for the problem in hand. Further to the experimental data produced, these were supported by mass transfer models, {{with the aim of}} finding out more quantitative information about the surface behaviour of the crystal systems observed. Firstly, salicylic acid micro-crystals were observed in aqueous solution by optical microscopy to visualise growth/dissolution rates of individual faces. It was found from finite element method (FEM) simulations that the most active (001) face was strongly mass transport controlled, and that the (110) and (¯ 110) were closer to the surface controlled regime. Salicylic acid crystals were further analysed by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using 3 dimensional (3 D) scans containing a series of approaches to the surface. By inducing dissolution on the crystal surface, and measuring a change in ultramicroelectrode (UME) current, the dissolution rate constant of the (110) face of salicylic acid was determined for this heterogeneous surface. Barite nucleation and growth was observed by optical microscopy, using a flow cell with hydrodynamic flow. High supersaturations were used and the crystals were deposited onto foreign surfaces with differing surface charge. It was found that the flux of material, once initial nucleation was achieved, matched closely to simulated mass transport fluxes. Finally, nanoprecipitation was induced at the opening of a nanopipette (ca. 100 nm) diameter and an ion current was applied to induce the early stages of barite nucleation. It was possible to observe nucleation and blockage of the nanopipette from the current transient produced. This process was used to test the effectiveness of different phosphonate inhibitors. ...|$|R

Diffusive mixing from the avalanching particles appears to be the dominant mechanism of mixing in both the axial and radial direction for the double helical ribbon blender. This result can guide the development of future continuous pharmaceutical powder blenders by optimizing the mixing elements to increase the amount of particles transported to a position where they can avalanche/flow and diffusively mix. A range of particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions were examined for their effects on flow behavior and blend homogeneity. Three particle properties were examined: particle size, polydispersity and cohesive force. (cont.) Particle size was observed to be positively correlated to both flow rates and blend homogeneity. Polydispersity had no effect on flow rate and was negatively correlated to homogeneity. Cohesive force was negatively correlated to flow rate and had little to no effect on homogeneity. Two modifications of blender design were analyzed: changes in blender size and changes in shaft design. Blender size was observed to be positively correlated to flow rate and negatively correlated to homogeneity. The paddle shaft designs created a more homogeneous powder blend than the double helical ribbon shaft. Two operating parameters were also studied: rotation rate and fill fraction. Rotation rate was positively correlated to both flow rate and homogeneity. Fill fraction had the interesting result of being positively correlated to the absolute flow rate, but negatively correlated to the fill mass normalized flow rate. In addition, fill fraction has a clear negative correlation to homogeneity above fill fractions of 0. 55, but is inconsistent for fill fractions lower than this. This research on particle properties, blender designs and operating conditions will help to guide the operation of continuous pharmaceutical blenders and the design of continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. Process simulations comparing model batch and continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing systems have quantified some of the potential size, cost and performance benefits of continuous processes. The models showed significant reductions in process equipment sizes for continuous manufacturing particularly in the blending step. (cont.) This reduction in equipment size translates to capital cost (CAPEX) savings for both the continuous process equipment and manufacturing facilities. The steady state operation of continuous processing also reduces the labor requirements and gives the continuous processes an operating cost (OPEX) advantage over batch processes. This research has contributed to the understanding of continuous pharmaceutical powder blending and quantified some of the benefits of continuous downstream pharmaceutical manufacturing. This work is being continued by the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing whose work is providing the foundation for future industrial <b>scale</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> continuous manufacturing systems. by Matthew J.

Adomaitienė; Lietuvos sveikatos mokslų universitetas, Slaugos fakultetas, Vilniaus dailės akademijos Kauno fakultetas, Humanitarinių mokslų katedra, Kaunas, 2017, - 68 psl. Tyrimo tikslas – įvertinti grupinės dailės terapijos poveikį šizofreniją sergantiems pacientams. Uždaviniai: 1. Įvertinti šizofrenija sergančių pacientų pozityvių ir negatyvių simptomų pokytį grupinės dailės terapijos proceso eigoje ir palyginti su kontroline grupe. 2. Įvertinti šizofrenija sergančių pacientų nerimo ir depresijos pokytį grupinės dailės terapijos proceso eigoje ir palyginti su kontroline grupe. 3. Įvertinti šizofrenija sergančių pacientų bendro funkcionavimo pokytį grupinės dailės terapijos proceso eigoje ir palyginti su kontroline grupe. 4. Įvertinti šizofrenija sergančių pacientų bendradarbiavimo gydymosi eigoje pokytį grupinės dailės terapijos proceso eigoje ir palyginti su kontroline grupe. Tyrimas buvo įgyvendintas trimis etapais. I etape buvo apklausiami 107 šizofrenija sergantys pacientai, iš kurių 9 pacientai atsisakė dalyvauti tyrime, o 15 neatitiko atrankos kriterijų, likę 83 sutiko dalyvauti tolimesniuose tyrimo etapuose. Apklausos metu buvo vertinami: sociodemografiniai rodmenys, negatyvūs ir pozityvūs simptomai (pozityvių (SAPS) ir negatyvių (SANS) simptomų skalės), bendras funkcionavimas (bendro veiklos vertinimo skalė (BVVS)), nerimas ir depresija (nerimo ir depresijos skalė (HAD)), bendradarbiavimas gydymosi procese (vaistų vartojimo vertinimo skalė (VVVS)). II etape 40 pacientų pasirinko standartinį gydymą (kontrolinė grupė), o 43 pacientai sutiko prie medikamentinio gydymo lankyti dailės terapiją (tiriamoji grupė). Pastarieji pacientai kas antrą dieną dalyvavo 12 -oje DT uždarų užsiėmimų (grupėje po 8 dalyvius). DT užsiėmimai buvo orientuoti į emocijų atpažinimą bei raišką, bendravimo lavinimą, motyvacijos veiklai didinimą, vidinių resursų paiešką. Tyrimo eigoje dalis tiriamųjų atsisakė tęsti DT (N= 7), dalis tiriamųjų išvyko iš stacionaro nebaigus tyrimo (N= 4). III etape abiejų grupių tiriamieji vėl buvo vertinami tomis pačiomis skalėmis. Tyrimo rezultatai parodė, jog po grupinės dailės terapijos tiriamosios grupės pacientai pasižymėjo mažiau išreikšta bendra negatyvia simptomatika ir jos komponentais: mažiau išreikštu emociniu blankumu, apatija, anhedonija-asocialumu ir pasižymėjo geresne dėmesio koncentracija, taip pat pasižymėjo mažiau išreikšta bendra pozityvia simptomatika ir jos komponentais: mažiau išreikštomis haliucinacijomis, kliedesiais, mąstymo sutrikimo požymiais, nei kontrolinės grupės pacientai, kurie nedalyvavo grupinėje dailės terapijoje. Nustatyta jog, šizofrenija sergantiems pacientams, kurie dalyvavo grupinėje dailės terapijoje, reikšmingai sumažėjo nerimo ir depresijos požymiai lyginant su nedalyvavusiais grupinėje dailės terapijoje. Nustatyta, kad pacientams, kuriems buvo taikyta grupinė dailės terapija reikšmingai pagerėjo bendras funkcionavimas lyginant su nedalyvavusiais grupinėje dailės terapijoje. Gauta, kad šizofrenija sergantiems pacientams, kurie dalyvavo grupinėje dailės terapijoje, reikšmingai pagerėjo bendradarbiavimas gydymosi eigoje lyginant su nedalyvavusiais grupinėje dailės terapijoje.

Adomaitienė; Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Faculty of Nursing, Vilnius University, Kaunas Faculty of Arts, Kaunas, 2017 : 68 pages. The research {{aim is to}} assess the impact of a group art therapy for patients with schizophrenia. Tasks: 1. Evaluate the patients with schizophrenic changes of positive and negative symptoms in group art therapy process and compare with the control group. 2. Evaluate the patients with schizophrenia anxiety and depression change in a process of group art therapy and compared with the control group. 3. Evaluate common functioning of the patients with schizophrenia changes in the group art therapy process and compared with the control group. 4. Evaluate co-operation changes of patients with schizophrenia during treatment in the group art therapy process and compared with the control group. The study was carried out in three stages. During the Ist stage were interviewed 105 patients with schizophrenia of which 9 rejected to participate in a research, 15 did not match survey criterion, 83 agreed to participate in further stages of the study. During the survey were assessed: sociodemographic readings, negative and positive symptoms (positive SAPS and negative (SANS) symptoms scales), common functioning (common functioning scale (BVVS)), anxiety and depression (anxiety and depression scale (HAD)), co-operation during the treatment (<b>pharmaceuticals</b> evaluation <b>scale</b> (VVVS)). During the IInd stage 40 patients chose the standard treatment (control group), 43 patients agreed to combine the standard treatment and art therapy (observational group). Observational every second day participated in a 12 private art therapy sessions (8 participants per one group). Art therapy sessions were orientated to recognition and expression of emotion, exercise of co-operation, amplification of motivation and inner resources search. During the research part of observational rejected to continue the art therapy (N= 7), part of observational left stationary during treatment period (N= 4). During the IIIrd stage both observational group were assessed on the same scales again. Survey result showed, that after the group art therapy patients characterized by less common negative symptoms and its components: expressed less emotional dimness / stupidity, apathy, anhedonia-asocial and characterized by a better concentration of attention and less expressed common positive symptoms and its components: less expressed hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder symptoms, compared to the control group of patients who did not participate in group art therapy. It was found that, in patients with schizophrenia who participated in the group art therapy significantly decreased expression of anxiety and depression than patients who did not participate in the group art therapy. Also was found that after the group art therapy for patients of observational group significantly ameliorated common functioning than patients who did not participate in the group art therapy. Furthermore it was found that patients with schizophrenia who participated in the group art therapy significantly ameliorated co-operation during course of treatment than patients who did not participate in the group art therapy...|$|R
