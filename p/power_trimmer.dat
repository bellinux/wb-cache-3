40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} a circulation control rotor blade undergoing three degrees of motion (flap, lag, and torsion) is investigated in forward flight. Quasi-steady strip theory {{is used to}} evaluate the aerodynamics forces; and the airfoil characteristics are from data tables. The propulsive and the auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>trims</b> are calculated from vehicle and rotor equilibrium equations through the numerical integration of element forces in azimuth as well as in radial directions. The nonlinear time dependent periodic blade response is calculated using an iterative procedure based on Floquet theory. The periodic perturbation equations are solved for stability using Floquet transition matrix theory. The effects of several parameters on blade stability are examined, including advance ratio, collective pitch, thrust level, shaft tilt, structural stiffnesses variation, and propulsive and auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>trims...</b>|$|R
50|$|Trim is {{the angle}} of the motor in {{relation}} to the hull, as illustrated below. The ideal trim angle is the one in which the boat rides level, with most of the hull on the surface instead of plowing through the water.If the motor is trimmed out too far, the bow will ride too high in the water. With too little trim, the bow rides too low. The optimal trim setting will vary depending on many factors including speed, hull design, weight and balance, and conditions on the water (wind and waves). Many large outboards are equipped with <b>power</b> <b>trim,</b> an electric motor on the mounting bracket, with a switch at the helm that enables the operator to adjust the trim angle on the fly. In this case, the motor should be trimmed fully in to start, and trimmed out (with an eye on the tachometer) as the boat gains momentum, until it reaches the point just before ventilation begins or further trim adjustment results in an RPM increase with no increase in speed. Motors not equipped with <b>power</b> <b>trim</b> are manually adjustable using a pin called a topper tilt lock.|$|R

50|$|The Ch-24, Che-26 and Che-28 are all braced, {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} flying boats, which {{differ in the}} number and type of engines and in their seat numbers. The wings are identical, with no sweep and constant chord out to trapezoidal, upturned tips. Full span, slotted flaperons are fitted. There are two streamlined bracing struts on each side, one from mid-fuselage to about one third span and a shorter, more vertical one from higher on the fuselage. These are assisted by further light struts bracing {{the rear of the}} wing centre section via the cabin roof. The engines, one placed centrally on the Ch-24 and two on the other variants are all mounted above and forward of the wing leading edge. The fin, integral with the fuselage, and balanced rudder are swept, tapered and generous. The tailplane is mounted midway up the fin, externally braced from below. Both the rudder and elevators have electrically <b>powered</b> <b>trim</b> tabs.|$|R

40|$|The {{preliminary}} design stage of helicopters consists of various operations {{and in each}} operation design several detailed analysis tasks are needed. The analysis tasks include performance and the required power estimation. In helicopter design, those are usually carried out by adopting the momentum theory. In this paper, an explicit form of computational analysis based on the blade element theory and uniform/non-uniform inflow model is developed. The other motivation of the present development is to obtain <b>trim</b> and required <b>power</b> estimation for various helicopter configurations. Sectional and hub loads, <b>power,</b> <b>trim,</b> and flapping equations are derived by using a symbolic tool. Iterative computations are carried out till convergence is achieved in the blade response, inflow, and trim. The predictions regarding the <b>trim</b> and <b>power</b> estimation {{turn out to be}} correlated well with the experimental results. The effect of inflow is further investigated. It is found that the present prediction for the lateral cyclic pitch angle is improved with the non-uniform inflow model as compared to that by the uniform inflow model. The presently improved <b>trim</b> and <b>power</b> estimation will be useful for future helicopter sizing and performance analysis...|$|R

50|$|A pilot {{begins with}} {{three months of}} {{intensive}} formation aerobatic training, starting with relatively simple manoeuvres (such as loops and rolls in echelon or line astern) performed at altitude, and progressing through more complex and demanding ones (such as corkscrews, ripple rolls and rollbacks), close formation line abreast aerobatics (which requires constant fine attention to <b>power</b> and <b>trim</b> settings), and eventually working up to the full six-aircraft display routines.
