50|$|For MY 2012, new LED tail-lights became {{available}} on certain models, although entry-level models retain the previous style. For MY 2013, the XC90 received a cosmetic refresh that included standard LED {{daytime running lights}} and taillights, and exterior revisions including body colour bumpers, rocker panels and silver trim replacing black <b>plastic</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{wedge shape}} of the two-door model was distinctive, {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the unusually high rear end. In response to criticism of the tail design, a black <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> panel between the tail lights was added. Like many other BMW models, the C-pillar of the E21 features a Hofmeister kink.|$|E
5000|$|The SE model ensured it {{continued}} into the new range and again featured a body coloured rear spoiler and front fog lamps over the standard 216 Coupé. The K-Series 1.6 litre engine produced the same [...] as the previous Honda engine and could reach the same speed. The automatic transmission was again available for the 216 and 216 SE Coupé models only. The 1.6 was fitted with steel wheels with <b>plastic</b> <b>trims</b> or could be specified with a cost option six spoke 'turbo' alloy wheels. The SE came with an all new five spoke alloy wheels.|$|R
25|$|SLX: was {{the second}} tier variant fitted with the 1.8-litre engine in coupled to either a {{five-speed}} manual or three-speed automatic transmission. The SLX also featured full <b>plastic</b> wheel <b>trims,</b> {{as opposed to the}} steel centre hubcap fitted to the SL.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1978, the ER was {{produced}} through the 1980s with relatively few detail changes. In 1984, the headlights and front turn signals were switched from round to rectangular units. In 1991, the driver's compartment was redesigned, {{with a much}} larger windshield. During the late 1990s, this model was distinguished from MVP-series ERs by its optional black <b>plastic</b> headlight <b>trim.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additions {{include a}} flat Gorilla Glass screen (instead of the curved plastic of its predecessors) {{surrounded}} with <b>plastic</b> <b>trim,</b> a faster processor, an upgraded camera.

2500|$|The Camry {{was given}} a {{facelift}} in 1994 for the 1995 model year. Minor exterior changes included a revised front fascia with different front turn signals and reshaped headlamps. Additionally, the rear fascia was updated, now with body-coloured plastic between the tail lamps where the model name [...] "Camry" [...] was printed. This was instead of the red <b>plastic</b> on higher <b>trim</b> levels and black <b>plastic</b> on lower <b>trim</b> levels of the 1992 to 1994 models. The tail lamps themselves were also slightly different. Another change, this time mechanical came in 1996; the 2.2-liter engine was detuned slightly to [...] to meet stricter emissions standards. Additionally, in 1996 the cam angle sensor in the distributor was also replaced with a crank angle sensor to achieve a smoother idle.|$|R
50|$|A {{sporting}} derivative (1.3 L Supersport) {{was offered}} in Europe for the 1980 model year, using the 1.3 L Kent Crossflow engine, effectively {{to test the}} market for the similar XR2 introduced a year later, which featured a 1.6 L {{version of the same}} engine. Black <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> was added to the exterior and interior. The small square headlights were replaced with larger circular ones, with the front indicators being moved into the bumper to accommodate the change.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the bumper and <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> {{on the front of}} the van, like the Visa car, was {{designed}} to aerodynamically reduce the deposition of dirt on the headlights, and to reduce the risk of stone chips to the headlights, bonnet and windscreen. The heating and ventilation system, (even though it used only a water control valve for temperature control and not air mixing), could provide cold air from fascia side vents, to the face while warming the car.|$|E
50|$|Anders Warming (born 1972) is a Danish {{automotive}} designer {{currently working}} for Borgward. He {{was the chief}} of Design for the Mini division of BMW, but resigned in July 2016. Many 1st and 2nd Generation Mini owners disliked his styling approach for the third generation cars. The most often criticized design element was the front end, something many people called a 'fish mouth' due to its large oval grille and lip-like black <b>plastic</b> <b>trim.</b> Before working at MINI, he was recently the chief of exterior design for BMW from 2007 {{to the end of}} 2010.|$|E
50|$|Thermwood {{incorporates}} {{a lot of}} technology into its business. It developed a unique molding process to make its plastic parts. Most of its <b>plastic</b> molding and <b>trimming</b> machinery is designed and built in-house. In the 1970s, Thermwood developed CNC machine tool control {{and used it to}} create machinery that would <b>trim</b> its <b>plastic</b> parts. It began selling this trim equipment for various applications and the CNC router was created. Thermwood is now {{known as one of the}} oldest CNC router companies.|$|R
5000|$|The plant {{first opened}} its doors in 1966 when Ford Motor Company {{relocated}} it from nearby Brooklyn, Michigan to Saline. The plant specialized early on in <b>plastics</b> and <b>trim</b> manufacture. In 2000 the plant {{began a series of}} ownership changes. The first of which was Visteon Corporation in 2000. Visteon was spun off from Ford Motor Company and became an independent, publicly traded company. In 2005 Visteon struck a deal with its former parent company to transfer ownership of Saline, and several of their facilities, back to Ford Motor Company in an effort to avoid bankruptcy. The new company was called Automotive Components Holdings, LLC. ACH was owned by Ford Motor Company and its primary mission was to sell or close the plant by December 2008. The workers of the plant are represented by the Saline Local 892 chapter of the UAW.|$|R
50|$|Aug 1980: Introduction of the Maxi 2 {{range in}} 1750 L, 1750 HL and 1750 HLS variations. All models feature new {{revisions}} including new bumpers incorporating indicators (front) and reversing lights (rear), new side repeaters, full cover <b>plastic</b> wheel <b>trims</b> and broader side moulding inserts. Inside the instrument bezels were now in matt black, the switchgear was also again revised, the headlight switch was {{now on the}} steering column {{and there was a}} choke warning light. The L replaced the previous Base model and added LM/MW push button radio, nylon trim, door bins, laminated windscreen and walnut veneer dashboard. The HL gained intermittent screen wipe, velour seats, tinted glass and extra sound insulation. The HLS gained a burr walnut veneer dashboard. However, LHD export Maxi 2s were still referred to as 'Austin' Maxis in sales literature, only one version being available, the single carburettor HL, though unlike the UK spec cars it did not feature a radio as standard.|$|R
50|$|The CMF-A {{cars will}} come from the Renault-Nissan Alliance plant and {{technical}} center in Chennai, which opened in 2010. The first vehicle to be produced was the Nissan Micra. Starting in 2011, the plant began building the Renault Koleos and Fluence. The factory is located in the Oragadam Expansion Scheme and represents an investment of about €800 million over seven years from February 2008 to 2015. The plant - which has full stamping, body, paint, <b>plastic,</b> <b>trim,</b> and chassis shops with two test tracks—will have the capacity to produce 400,000 vehicles a year at full ramp up.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} of three JDM Allex trim levels were not {{differentiated}} with a visual badge, but offered similar packages to the RunX with the base model featuring the 1500 cc 1NZFE engine, the middle range featuring the 1800 cc 1ZZFE engine & the Allex RS180 featuring the 1800 cc 2ZZGE engine. Allex models offered a different colour range & had minor styling differences to the RunX, such examples include the <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> above the license plate area being chrome as opposed to body colour like on the RunX. Interior cloth patterns also differed from the RunX.|$|E
50|$|A {{sporting}} derivative (1.3 L Supersport) {{was offered}} in Europe for the 1980 model year, using the 1.3 L Kent Crossflow engine, effectively {{to test the}} market for the similar XR2 introduced a year later, which featured a 1.6 L {{version of the same}} engine. Black <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> was added to the exterior and interior. The small square headlights were replaced with larger circular ones resulting in the front indicators being moved into the bumper to accommodate the change. With a quoted performance of 0 - 60 mph in 9.3 seconds and 105 mph top speed, the XR2 hot hatch became a cult car beloved of boy racers throughout the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form, a small tabletop or lab size machine {{can be used}} to heat small cut {{sections of}} plastic sheet and stretch it over a mold using vacuum. This method is often used for sample and prototype parts. In complex and high-volume applications, very large production machines are utilized to heat and form the <b>plastic</b> sheet and <b>trim</b> the formed parts from the sheet in a continuous high-speed process, and can produce many thousands of finished parts per hour depending on the machine and mold size {{and the size of the}} parts being formed.|$|R
5000|$|A minor {{facelift}} to {{the front}} end came in 1991 for the 1992 model year, revising the grille, front fenders, hood and headlamps to provide a similar appearance {{with the introduction of}} the Subaru SVX luxury GT coupe, along with interior and exterior color changes. For MY 1994, the USA-spec wagons were available with minor trim packages, called the Alpine Sport and Sun Sport, which were basically [...] "L" [...] trim level wagons with optional equipment, such as heated front seats, added as a [...] "Value Option Group" [...] and also came with graphics denoting the package on the exterior of the vehicle. The USA-spec LSi wagon was available with tan leather interior, with matching leather on the steering wheel, gearshift selector, center armrest, interior door panels, and parking brake handle. The red <b>plastic</b> rear <b>trim</b> piece, on both the sedan and wagon, continues but the word [...] "Subaru" [...] is exchanged for the word [...] "Legacy". Also, the Subaru star logo is no longer used {{on the back of the}} sedan or wagon.|$|R
50|$|This problem {{persists}} {{today in}} spite of the many different retention systems that have been engineered. Hubcaps generally use either clip-on retention, where some type of spring steel clip (or plastic clip in the case of plastic hubcaps) engages a groove in the wheel; or bolt-on retention, where a threaded fastener retains the hubcap, or a plastic washer attached to the lugnut itself holds the hubcap on. Honda and, to a lesser degree, Hyundai tend to use the latter system. Clip-on hubcaps tend to pop off suddenly when the wheel impacts a pothole or curbstone, while bolt-on hubcaps are more likely to vibrate loose over time, and tend to rattle and squeak. To prevent loss, many owners attach <b>plastic</b> wheel <b>trims</b> to the wheel itself using an electrical zip tie, which are sold in a silver colour for this very purpose. Enterprising manufacturers also sell a small kit consisting of spare zip ties, a pair of cutting pliers and latex gloves to allow a trim thus secured to be removed easily {{in the event of a}} puncture.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2008 model year, power deployable/retractable {{running boards}} became available, {{along with a}} rear view backup camera system. The camera, which is mounted under the Expedition's center {{liftgate}} appliqué, utilizes the Gentex auto dimming rear view mirror's picture-in-mirror technology to display what it sees. Expedition King Ranch was also reintroduced after being absent from the 2007 model year trim line-up. Expedition XLT models now get body colored lower body work, replacing the previous black <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> and was the Last Ford Model Year for the nine-passenger Front Bench seating option in the Ford Full-Size SUV's from Ford Motor Company (Ford discontinued the 9-passenger Front Bench Seating Option for 2009 and Forward on the old Ford Full-Size SUVs 2009-present) ...|$|E
50|$|Upper Sandusky’s {{diversity}} {{is reflected in}} the existence of numerous industries, such as metal toilet partitions at Mills Company; radio-controlled hydraulics at Ohio Power Systems; concrete sawing at San-Con Industries; walk ramps and roll up doors at Todco Door; <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> and weatherstrip at Uni-Grip Corporation; machining and machine manufacturing at Design Fabrication; custom conveyor systems and metal fabrication at the Deyco Corporation; glass recycling at Dlubak Glass; special metal cutting tools at Midwest Ohio Tool; loading docks, seals and shelters at Fairborn USA; twin cutting knives at Handy Twine Knife Company; welding and fabrication at Keaton Welding; and interior vehicle trim at M-Tek, Inc. Upper Sandusky recently became the corporate headquarters for the Ithaca Gun Company, a manufacturer of firearms with a new multimillion-dollar manufacturing facility.|$|E
50|$|In all, 436,000 Montegos {{were sold}} in the UK between 1984 and 1995. In August 2006, a survey by Auto Express {{revealed}} that the Montego was Britain's eighth-most scrapped car, with just 8,988 still in working order. Contributing to this, areas of the bodywork that were to be covered by <b>plastic</b> <b>trim</b> (such as {{the front and rear}} bumpers) were left unpainted and thus unprotected. In addition, pre-1989 models fitted with the A and S-series engines cannot run on unleaded petrol without the cylinder head being converted or needing fuel additives. This led to many owners simply scrapping the cars, as leaded petrol was removed from sale in Britain after 1999, and by 2003 most petrol stations had stopped selling LRP (lead replacement petrol) due to the falling demand for it.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1981, the Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx four-door wagons offered {{optional}} simulated {{wood trim}}. GM offered its full-size wagons in wood trim versions until their final year in 1996. From 1982 to 1988, Chrysler used the Town & Country {{name on a}} station wagon version of the K-based, front wheel drive LeBaron, featuring <b>plastic</b> woodgrain exterior <b>trim</b> with three dimensional simulated framework. As the station wagon declined in North America, manufacturers offered faux wood trim on SUVs and minivans (e.g., the Jeep Cherokee and Chrysler minivans). Chrysler offered simulated wood as an option for the Chrysler PT Cruiser, introduced in 2000—and aftermarket firms offered kits as well.|$|R
40|$|Plastics {{are used}} {{throughout}} the interior, exterior, and under the hood of automotive vehicles. The use of plastics {{plays an important role}} in meeting the industry's needs. These include weight and cost reduction as well as end-of-life recycling issues. Within the interior, the material enables manufacturers to decorate with a wide range of colors, finishes, and effects. The use of plastic within the automotive industry is increasing and with 48 % of the plastic content of vehicles used within the interior, it is important to consider the significance of this application. This chapter reviews the current usage of <b>plastic</b> within interior <b>trim</b> components and assesses the future trends that are likely to occur within the industry...|$|R
40|$|Two {{instruments}} for <b>trimming</b> <b>plastic</b> blocks prior to inserting {{them into the}} specimen holder of the microtome have been previously described. One of these is designed to shape the pyramid (1), the other is intended to approach the tissue by trimming the block and leveling the irregular edges of the polymerized plastic from the bottom (2). The usefulness of such instruments is obvious, especially when straight ribbons are required for serial sections. The special grids designed by Anderson (3) to overcome the difficulty of curving ribbons (mainly due to inadequate parallelism of the pyramid sides) is one illustration {{of the need for}} such an instrument. The many bleeding fingers seen in electron microscopic laboratories provid...|$|R
