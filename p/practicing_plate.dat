40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a heuristic algorithm for the two-dimensional free-form bin packing (2 D-FBP) problem, {{which is also}} called the irregular cutting and packing, or nesting problem. Given a set of 2 D free-form bins, which in <b>practice</b> may be <b>plate</b> materials, {{and a set of}} 2 D free-form items, which in <b>practice</b> may be <b>plate</b> parts to be cut out of the materials, the 2 D-FBP problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins {{in such a way that}} the number of bins used is minimized, and for each bin, the yield is maximized. The proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the one-dimensional bin-packing problem; i. e., items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines, and scanlines are packed. The details of the algorithm are given, and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported. The proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms. The basic placement algorithm is a variant of the first-fit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the one-dimensional case to the two-dimensional case by a novel scanline approximation. The group placement algorithm is an extension of the basic placement algorithm with recombination of input items. A numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances, however, the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns. The qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use, and the processing times required for both algorithms are much faster than those by manual nesting. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} buckling behaviour of gusset plate connections under compression. The main focus {{is given to the}} post-buckling resistance of relatively slender gusset plate connections, cases which are commonly found in thin gusset plates in light-weighted structures, and also potentially, as driven by the recent development in steel manufacture industry, in high-strength steel (HSS) gusset plates. The numerical modelling strategy was carefully validated using the results of eight full scale tests previously conducted by the authors and co-workers, and an extensive parametric study was subsequently performed covering a reasonably wide range of geometric configurations and material properties of practical gusset plate connections. Stable post-buckling equilibrium paths were observed for the models with relatively thin gusset plates, and the use of HSS further promotes remarkable post-buckling resistance. The influences of initial imperfection and material strain hardening on the buckling behaviour of gusset plate connections have also been discussed in detail. Based on the results from the numerical study, two design approaches were proposed, namely, Column Buckling Approach, which is based on a modified column analogy from the current design <b>practice,</b> and <b>Plate</b> Buckling Approach, which is based on a plate analogy and modified Winter formulae. While both methods can be used by practicing engineers, the latter may take account of the plate action of gusset plates in a more reasonable manner, and it is also more consistent with the common design rules for plated structures.

5000|$|Electrostatic analyzers are {{designed}} in different configurations. A simple version is a radial cylindrical analyzer, {{which consists of}} two curved parallel plates at different potentials. Ions or electrons enter the analyzer {{at one end and}} either pass through the other end or collide with the walls of the analyzer, depending on their initial energy. In these types of analyzers, only the radial component of the velocity of a charged particle is changed by an ESA since the potential on the plates only varies in the radial direction if one considers the geometry in cylindrical coordinates. Poisson's Equation can be then used to calculate the magnitude of the electric field pointing radially inwards. The resultant inward-pointing force generated by this electric field will cause the particles' trajectories to curve in a uniform circular motion. Depending on initial energy (velocity), only certain particles will therefore have the [...] "correct" [...] motion to exit the analyzer by tracing its physical structure, while others will collide into the walls of the instrument. In addition to the energy, the angle of entry will also affect the particles' time-of-flight through the analyzer as well as exit angle. In <b>practice,</b> the <b>plates</b> are usually oppositely charged and at very high potentials. Also, the inner surface of the analyzer, usually made of aluminum for space missions, is sometimes plated with black chrome or even Ebonol C to absorb stray light, instead of allowing it to bounce its way through.|$|R

40|$|To {{transmit}} the drive, {{in form of}} rotation, produced during the combustion process in the cylinders to the gearbox, where it is transformed into different ratios, a coupling element is needed. This is {{the task of the}} clutch. The clutch is the part that enables a gear change. A disconnection between constantly-spinning crankshaft and the gearbox must be realized to be able to stand still as well as to change gears. Among many principles in design, the classical friction plate clutch has established it ` position in vehicle design. Especially, race car rules predict the use of conventional multi plate clutches (in some cases single plate clutches are also used) which transmit engine torque into the gearbox via friction. A traditional multi plate clutch is composed of three basic elements: the flywheel, the pressure plate and the clutch plates (in race car <b>practice,</b> 4 <b>plates</b> are the limit). The flywheel is attached {{to the end of the}} main crankshaft and the clutch plates are attached to the gearbox input shaft using a spline. When a axial load is applied to the assembly, the friction produced between plates prevents any rotation between them and a solid drive is established without any additional mechanical engagement.

OBJECTIVE: The development and validation of an open-source, partial task simulator that teaches the fundamental {{skills necessary for}} endonasal skull-base neuro-endoscopic surgery. METHODS: We defined the Neuro-Endo-Trainer (NET) SkullBase-Task-GraspPickPlace with an activity area by analyzing the computed tomography scans of 15 adult patients with sellar suprasellar parasellar tumors. Four groups of participants (Group E, n = 4 : expert neuroendoscopists; Group N, n = 19 : novice neurosurgeons; Group R, n = 11 : neurosurgery residents with multiple iterations; and Group T, n = 27 : neurosurgery residents with single iteration) performed grasp, pick, and place tasks using NET and were graded on task completion time and skills assessment scale score. RESULTS: Group E had lower task completion times and greater skills assessment scale scores than both Group N and R (P ≤ 0. 03, 0. 001). The performance of Groups N and R {{was found to be}} equivalent; in self-assessing neuro-endoscopic skill, the participants in these groups were found to have equally low pretraining scores (4 / 10) with significant improvement shown after NET simulation (6, 7 respectively). Angled scopes resulted in decreased scores with tilted plates compared with straight plates (30 ° P ≤ 0. 04, 45 ° P ≤ 0. 001).

The photographic photometry is calibrated using SDSS data, with results that are linear to 2 % or better. All-sky photometric uniformity is achieved by matching plate overlaps and also by requiring homogeneity in optical-to- 2 MASS colours, yielding zero points that are uniform to 0. 03 mag. or better. The typical AB depths achieved are B_J< 21, R_F< 19. 5 and I_N< 18. 5, with little difference between hemispheres. In <b>practice,</b> the I_N <b>plates</b> are shallower than the B_J & R_F plates, so for most purposes we advocate the use of a catalogue selected in these two latter bands. At high Galactic latitudes, this catalogue is approximately 90 % complete with 5 % stellar contamination; we quantify how the quality degrades towards the Galactic plane. At low latitudes, there are many spurious galaxy candidates resulting from stellar blends: these approximately match the surface density of true galaxies at |b|= 30 deg. Above this latitude, the catalogue limited in B_J & R_F contains in total about 20 million galaxy candidates, of which 75 % are real. This contamination can be removed, and the sky coverage extended, by matching with additional datasets. This SuperCOSMOS catalogue has been matched with 2 MASS and with WISE, yielding quasi-allsky samples of respectively 1. 5 million and 18. 5 million galaxies, to median redshifts of 0. 08 and 0. 20.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The Southern African Institute of Steel Construction {{expressed}} concern {{with regard to}} the unit definition of the effective length factor, K, stipulated for compressive elements of parallel chord trusses in Clause 15 of SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 - Limit state design of hot-rolled steelwork. The simplified method for truss design specified in the code assumes all compression members are pin-connected, which allows for greater design simplicity and reduces the amount of code interpretation required by the designer. In addition to this, Clause 15 requires the additional reduction in resistance of the first web compression members by a factor of 0. 85. However, this approach may be considered overly conservative and in current design practice the effective length factor is often reduced to less than 1. 0. This research investigates the effective length factor of web compression members in parallel chord trusses, by means of investigative structural analyses of representative trusses using ANGELINE and Prokon analytical programs, and by designing, constructing and testing six representative trusses, using current design practices. A comparative study of a number of different countries’ codified approaches to truss design is also included. The structural analyses revealed that in-plane buckling of the web compression members was the consistent mode of failure, however at a much greater applied load than the design load determined according to SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005. Contrary to the expected mode of failure, all six tests performed on the representative trusses exhibited elastic out-of-plane buckling, or strongaxis buckling, of the web compression members, but still at a much greater applied load than the design load. The unexpected out-of-plane buckling of the web members is due to the inplane stiffness of the end connections used. In order to stay true to current design <b>practice,</b> gusset <b>plates</b> and longitudinal welds were used to join the web members to the chords. The stiffness of the gusset plates therefore significantly reduced the effective length of the web compression members in-plane, but did not reduce the effective length out-of-plane. Despite the unanticipated behaviour of the tests performed, certain conclusions can still be drawn from the results. The unit definition of the effective length factor for in-plane buckling of web compression members is too conservative and a K factor of 0. 8 is recommended. In addition to this an effective length factor for out-plane-buckling of web compression members of 1. 1 is recommended for trusses with welded connections. The necessity of the reduction in resistance of 0. 85 of the first web compression members requires further investigation. The most important conclusion to be drawn is that out-of-plane buckling of web compression members can be the dominant failure mode, which is not taken into consideration in current design practice...|$|R
