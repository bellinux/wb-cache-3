40|$|Diagnostic {{value of}} iron indices in {{hemodialysis}} patients receiving epoetin. BackgroundIron deficiency remains {{a common cause}} of hyporesponsiveness to epoetin in hemodialysis patients. However, considerable controversy exists regarding the best strategies for diagnosis and treatment. MethodsAs part of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of intravenous versus subcutaneous administration of epoetin, we made monthly determinations of serum iron, total iron binding capacity, percentage transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin. If a patient had serum ferritin < 100 ng/mL or the combination of serum ferritin < 400 ng/mL and a transferrin saturation < 20 %, he/she received parenteral iron, given as iron dextran 100 mg at ten consecutive dialysis sessions. We analyzed parenteral iron use during the trial, the effect of its administration on iron indices and epoetin dose, {{and the ability of}} the iron indices to predict a reduction in epoetin dose in response to <b>parenteral</b> iron <b>administration.</b> ResultsEighty-seven percent of the 208 patients required parenteral iron to maintain adequate iron stores at an average dose of 1516 mg over 41. 7 weeks, or 36 mg/week. Only two of 180 patients experienced serious reactions to intravenous iron administration. Two thirds of the patients receiving parenteral iron had a decrease in their epoetin requirement of at least 30 U/kg/week compared with 29 % of patients who did not receive iron (P = 0. 004). The average dose decrease 12 weeks after initiating iron therapy was 1763 U/week. A serum ferritin < 200 ng/mL had the best positive predictive value (76 %) for predicting a response to <b>parenteral</b> iron <b>administration,</b> but it still had limited clinical utility. ConclusionsIron deficiency commonly develops during epoetin therapy, and <b>parenteral</b> iron <b>administration</b> may result in a clinically significant reduction in epoetin dose. The use of transferrin saturation or serum ferritin as an indicator for <b>parenteral</b> iron <b>administration</b> has limited utility...|$|R
25|$|Epinephrine may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma or serum as a diagnostic aid, to monitor therapeutic administration, or {{to identify the}} causative agent in a potential poisoning victim. Endogenous plasma epinephrine concentrations in resting adults are normally less than 10ng/L, but may increase by 10-fold during exercise and by 50-fold or more during times of stress. Pheochromocytoma patients often have plasma adrenaline levels of 1000–10,000ng/L. <b>Parenteral</b> <b>administration</b> of epinephrine to acute-care cardiac patients can produce plasma concentrations of 10,000 to 100,000ng/L.|$|E
25|$|Identical {{drugs can}} produce {{different}} results {{depending on the}} route of administration. For example, some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after enteral administration is therefore different from that after <b>parenteral</b> <b>administration.</b> This can be illustrated {{by the action of}} naloxone (Narcan), an antagonist of opiates such as morphine. Naloxone counteracts opiate action in the central nervous system when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of opiate overdose. The same drug, when swallowed, acts exclusively on the bowels; it is here used to treat constipation under opiate pain therapy and does not affect the pain-reducing effect of the opiate.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and <b>parenteral</b> <b>administration</b> popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{synthetic}} drug, synephrine {{first appeared in}} Europe in the late 1920s, {{under the name of}} Sympatol. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala. By 1930, Sympatol was referred to as a Boehringer product, while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns & Co. in 1933. Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns & Co was being carried out in the US by 1930. Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or <b>parenteral</b> <b>administration,</b> [...] "of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough)." [...] However, synephrine was dropped from the Council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The third edition (1965) of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine stated, with reservations, that synephrine was [...] "advertised as an antihistaminic {{to be used in the}} treatment of the common cold...", under the trade name of [...] "Synephrin Tartrate", and indicated that the dose was 100mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Published in 1966, the Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a sympathomimetic agent that was [...] "less effective than epinephrine", and which had been used [...] for the treatment of chronic hypotension, collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to hypotension. In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or bacteremic shock, and spinal anesthesia-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of}} a four-year national patient safety program concerning the <b>parenteral</b> drug <b>administration</b> process in the Netherlands. Methods: Structuring the preparation and <b>administration</b> process of <b>parenteral</b> drugs reduces the number of medication errors. A nationwide hospital patient safety program was started in 2008 to improve patient safety in Dutch hospitals. The theme “high risk medication: preparation and <b>administration</b> of <b>parenteral</b> drugs” was assigned as one of the improvement themes. The goal is to reduce medication errors by following a checklist which describes the steps a nurse has to take in the preparation and <b>administration</b> of <b>parenteral</b> drugs. The goal was to implement this process in all Dutch hospitals before December 2012. To evaluate this goal, an observational, prospective study was started in 19 Dutch hospitals. Since most errors occur in the administration of drugs, we only focussed on the <b>parenteral</b> drug <b>administration</b> process. Data was collected during the period December 2011 – December 2012. During 10 monthly visits, a trained research assistant observed the process of intravenous drug administration at three departments (intensive care unit, internal medicine department, and surgery department) by using a checklist containing 9 items representing the steps nurses had to take in the administration process, such as patient identification, hand hygiene, and checking the injection rate. Multilevel analysis was used to determine if the percentage of administration processes in which all required steps were performed changed during the study. Results: In total 2154 observations of administration processes were included, the number of observations ranged from 178 to 247 per moment of measurement. On average, 7 items were performed in 28 % of the administration processes observed, 8 items were performed in 29 % and all 9 items were performed in 19 % of the observations. These percentages remained stable over the study period. However, the number of processes where less than 5 items were performed decreased over the period of our study. surgical and intensive care units), or for different hospital types (teaching versus non-teaching). Slight differences were determined in items scores for different hospital wards and different hospital types. Conclusion: Despite a four year program in which a lot of attention was paid in all Dutch hospitals to the importance and required contents of a high-quality <b>parenteral</b> drugs <b>administration</b> process, the quality of the administration process varies between hospitals. None of the hospitals in our sample already fulfilled the goal of complete and correct implementation of the <b>parenteral</b> drug <b>administration</b> process (to score 100 % in December 2012).
