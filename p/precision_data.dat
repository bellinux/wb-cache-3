5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high <b>precision</b> <b>data</b> points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is needed to determine the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E

50|$|Hobby’s {{executive}} career came to {{a sudden}} end in 1981. Using connections with new, union-friendly Governor Jim Hunt, Hobby secured $1,000,000 in funding for job training programs under the federal Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) between 1977 and 1979. Hobby initially got funds awarded to Precision Graphics, a printing company he headed. Hobby and his business partner, Mort Levi, recognized the need for computers at the union and hoped to cut out the middleman by founding <b>Precision</b> <b>Data</b> together in early 1979. <b>Precision</b> <b>Data</b> proceeded to purchase several expensive computers with multi-year payment plans. Despite having no substantive capital, employees, or history as a company, <b>Precision</b> <b>Data,</b> under Hobby’s direction, applied for a CETA contract to help train women to gain data skills. The board in charge of approving such contracts met the application with skepticism, and instead decided to award it to Precision Graphics, whom they felt were better equipped to use the funds. Suddenly in financial trouble, <b>Precision</b> <b>Data</b> began leasing its computers to Precision Graphics for hefty fees. Over {{the course of the}} next few months, it became apparent that funds were being intentionally diverted from Precision Graphics to <b>Precision</b> <b>Data,</b> most notably a $28,000 payment for “transportation of students” that never occurred.|$|E

Vision-based systems require more computational resources than simple range-finding systems such as lasers, but may employ a digital signal processor embedded with the camera. Cost/precision trade-offs led to less expensive vision-based systems on consumer robots while commercial and industrial robots and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) tend to use laser-based systems.|$|E
50|$|Most of the SSE2 {{instructions}} {{implement the}} integer vector operations {{also found in}} MMX. They use the XMM registers instead of the MMX registers, which are wider and allow for significant performance improvements in specialized applications. Another advantage of replacing MMX with SSE2 is avoiding the mode switching penalty for issuing x87 instructions present in MMX because it is sharing register space with the x87 FPU. The SSE2 also complements the floating-point vector operations of the SSE instruction set by adding support for the double <b>precision</b> <b>data</b> type.|$|E
50|$|Today, it is {{believed}} that Globus II has {{an important role in the}} US anti-ballistic missile system.

In addition, Vardø is well placed for the radar to collect <b>precision</b> <b>data</b> on the warheads and decoys carried by missiles bound for the United States on a transpolar trajectory. These considerations, together with the questionable nature of the advantages of Globus II as a space surveillance sensor, have led to even more controversy, including a series of official complaints by Russia.|$|E
40|$|The ill-posed {{analytic}} continuation {{problem for}} Green's functions or self-energies {{can be done}} using the Padé rational polynomial approximation. However, to extract accurate results from this approximation, high <b>precision</b> input <b>data</b> of the Matsubara Green's function are needed. The calculation of the Matsubara Green's function generally involves a Matsubara frequency summation which cannot be evaluated analytically. Numerical summation is requisite but it converges slowly {{with the increase of}} the Matsubara frequency. Here we show that this slow convergence problem can be significantly improved by utilizing the Padé decomposition approach to replace the Matsubara frequency summation by a Padé frequency summation, and high <b>precision</b> input <b>data</b> can be obtained to successfully perform the Padé analytic continuation.

40|$|At <b>precision</b> {{agriculture}} <b>data</b> analysis workshops {{there are}} often diverging views {{on the kind of}} statistics that is appropriate for sensor based or remotely sensed data such as yield monitor data and imagery. One view is that yield monitor data represent a sample. In that case, some sort of sampling theory applies and well-known tools from spatial statistics and geostatistics should be utilized. The concurrent view is that <b>precision</b> agriculture <b>data</b> on yields actually represent the population; the use of sample statistics is therefore not pertinent and simple averages or proportions referring to this one state-of-the-world can be calculated without having to evoke statistical inference. At first sight, it may seem natural to believe that taking simple averages from treatment blocks and comparing these to other averages provides useful decision making information. Many advocates of the idea that <b>precision</b> agriculture <b>data</b> are population data, farmers and researchers alike, argue that simple averages of yield monitor data are sufficient for whole-farm decision making purposes. Unfortunately this is not the case. Standard farm-level software therefore often includes tools that summarize yield or other site-specific data into classes according to soils or other predefined management zones. Although there are many degrees of freedom with site-specific yield monitor data, this doe...|$|R
