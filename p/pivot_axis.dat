2500|$|An {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a pendulum}} {{that has its}} center of mass above its pivot point. It is often implemented with the pivot point mounted on a cart that can move horizontally and may be called a cart and pole {{as shown in the}} photo. Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 degree of freedom by affixing the pole to an axis of rotation. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a torque at the pivot point, by moving the pivot point horizontally as part of a feedback system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the <b>pivot</b> <b>axis</b> and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the pivot point vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the pivot point in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger. [...] The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.|$|E

25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three gimbals, which are a pivoted supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three gimbals, one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost gimbal to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two gimbals, the outer gimbal, which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to <b>pivot</b> about an <b>axis</b> in its own plane determined by the support. This outer gimbal possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none.

5000|$|The deadbeat {{escapement}} has {{two faces}} to the pallets, a 'locking' or 'dead' face, with a curved surface concentric with the axis {{on which the}} anchor rotates, and a sloping 'impulse' face. [...] When an escape wheel tooth is resting {{against one of the}} dead faces, its force is directed through the anchor's <b>pivot</b> <b>axis,</b> so it gives no impulse to the pendulum, allowing it to swing freely. When the pallet on the other side releases the escape wheel, a tooth lands on this [...] "dead" [...] face first, and remains resting against it for most of the pendulum's outward swing and return. For this period the escape wheel is [...] "locked" [...] and unable to turn. Near the bottom of the pendulum's swing the tooth slides off the dead face onto the slanted 'impulse' face of the pallet, allowing the escape wheel to turn and give the pendulum a push, before dropping off the pallet. It is still a frictional rest escapement because the sliding of the escape tooth on the dead face adds friction to the pendulum's swing, but it has less friction than the recoil escapement because there is no recoil force.|$|E
5000|$|Have both driveshafts of {{the equal}} length by using an {{intermediate}} shaft (or [...] "lay shaft") {{on one side of}} the transmission. This is already implemented on most modern cars. When the driveshafts have different length and excessive torque is applied, the longer half shaft flexes more than the shorter one. However, this is a short term transient effect. To avoid fatigue failure, the amount of drive shaft torsional deflection must necessarily be small. Effects due to one wheel spinning more slowly than the other are usually negligible. Equal lengths of the driveshafts, in the case of no asymmetric suspension deflection due to roll or bump, keep the drive shaft angles equal. The main component of torque steer occurs when the torques in the driveshaft and the hub are summed vectorially, giving a resultant torque vector around the steering <b>pivot</b> <b>axis</b> (kingpin). These torques can be substantial, and in the case of shafts making equal angles to the hub shafts, will oppose one another at the steering rack, and so will cancel. These torques are strongly influenced by the position of the driveshaft universal joint (CV joint) in relation to the steering axis, however due to other requirements such as achieving a small or negative scrub radius an optimum solution is not generally possible with simple suspension configurations such as MacPherson strut.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLNG FPSO&# 146;s {{are getting}} more {{interest}} as the new oil and gas reserves are found in sub seas. But a main technical challenge {{has been identified as}} the liquefaction systems since its considered as the bottle in natural gas processing. The LNG FPSO&# 146;s are subjected to motion in the sea and it&# 146;s been observed that it can affect the flows inside the heat exchangers. Previous research conducted by NTNU and SINTEF research showed that flow patterns are getting changed and disturbed during the motion. Also the phenomenon of multi phase flows and its heat transfer mechanism is studied during the work. The main motivation of this work is to conduct the experiment in the laboratory to observe the changes in flow patterns when motion is induced. For the current study only horizontal motion has been considered due to the technical difficulties that are involved in setting up the experiment. A simple electric motor with eccentric extended arm is used to induce the motion to the platform. The platform was hinged {{in such a way that}} it will allow to move in the horizontal plane with a <b>pivoted</b> <b>axis.</b> The reading has been recorded during the flow when the experiment is in steady state and also when the motion is induced in the setup. Later these results are analyzed using the Matlab coding. Also visual aids have been used to record the flow during the experiment. The results are described in the work by the aid of photographs and also by using the graphs. It should be mentioned here that when motion is induced in test section the signals that has been obtained showed very large disturbance and it was very difficult to be analyzed using Matlab. The code was modified but still the results are non recognizable since the Matlab wasn&# 146;t able to recognize steady state of the flows. Due to this the visual observations by the student and the visual aids in the form of photographs and video has been used to analyze the results. The flow patterns where changing abruptly and the bigger slug flow was observed to be breaking in to smaller ones. Also the velocity of the flow was observed to be changed by the motion. The results are discussed in this report. </p...|$|R
