Soil profiles of current Dutch sport turfs include an installed, about 15 cm thick, upper layer above an installed, 25 cm thick, sublayer. These layers are laid on original soil, often after removal of an upper part of the original soil profile. Depending on the hydrology of the site, drainpipes are applied {{at the bottom of the}} sublayer. The installed sublayer is sand of a certain grading, which should promote quick rainwater drainage. The installed upper layer should allow growth and fuctionning of grass roots, and provide enough bearing capacity and stability for the players, also under wet conditions. It is made by mixing sand with a material that is rich in organic matter. According to prevailing standards, the weight ratio of that material and the sand should be such that the resulting mix (the upper layer) has an organic matter content of 4 %.

It contains also a discussion of certain areas of peat land {{in various parts of}} the state, and purposes for which they are best adapted, whether for agriculture or for the manufacture of <b>peat</b> <b>products.</b> The peat deposits of Minnesota are probably greater than those of any other state in the Union, the quantity of peat being sufficient to make more than six billion tons of good peat fuel. Because of the enormous areas of many of the peat deposits, it was soon realized that any detailed testing of the bogs could be done only on certain selected areas which seem to be especially well situated for development. Such a detailed testing of some of the largest deposits would require years to complete, and in view of the constantly increasing demand in Minnesota for a report on the peat, or muskeg lands of the state, and especially a demand for knowledge as to the agricultural possibilities of these areas, it was decided to examine as many localities as possible and to publish a report of a more general nature which would include descriptions of most of the larger muskegs and peat deposits. Enough soundings were made to determine whether the land should be classified as easily reclaimable, or as better adapted to the manufacture of peat fuel or other <b>peat</b> <b>products.</b> During the two seasons of field work every county in Minnesota was visited and detailed examinations were made in every county which contains peat.

40|$|Soil-dwelling predatory mites {{can be very}} {{effective}} as biological control agents against larvae of the lepidopteral pest Duponchelia fovealis. Some growing media {{were reported to have}} natural high level and stable populations of predatory mite. The objective of this experiment was to define conditions to establish stable predatory mite populations in the rooting medium and to assess the direct effect of the rooting media on pest development. Eight rooting media were prepared, including a range of degradabilities as measured with the Oxygen Uptake Rate method (OUR). The OUR range was created by mixing <b>peat</b> <b>products,</b> coir dust, bark, perlite, compost and wood fiber. Each treatment was split: half with and half without a commercially used mulch to create a drier top layer. Kalanchoës were grown on these rooting media. After one week soil-dwelling predatory mites (Hypoaspis miles) were added. Adults of the pest Duponchelia fovealis were released during a number of weeks. Both populations were counted. Results show that the OUR range was successfully achieved. The commercial mulch, a cork based fine granulate, reduced the numbers of Duponchelia by 32 %. The number of predatory mites was related to the oxygen uptake of the rooting media (R 2 = 0. 87). The predatory mite reduced the numbers of Duponchelia larvae on average by 58 %. Thus, biological control by soil-dwelling predatory mites can be improved by offering rooting media with an increased degradability as measured by the oxygen uptake rate. The combined effects of using predatory mite and mulch layers are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The Deep Mixing Method, which {{involves}} {{the formation of}} in situ stabilized peat columns, is suitable for deep peat stabilization, whereas the mass stabilization technique is used to stabilize the soil of shallow peat deposits instead of the costly and problematic removal and replacement method. The concept of soil-cement stabilization involves the addition of water to cement, resulting in a chemical process known as cement hydration. Stabilization of peat by cement, which requires a significant strength increase in the cement-stabilized peat or organic soil, is attributed largely to physicochemical reactions that include cement hydration, hardening of the resulting cement paste and interactions between soil substances and primary and secondary cementation hydration products. The factors that affect these physicochemical reactions and the interactions of <b>peat</b> soil-cementation <b>products</b> that influence <b>peat</b> stabilization are the amount of solid particles, the water: soil ratio, the quantity of binder, the presence of humic and/or fulvic acids, the soil pH {{and the amount of}} organic matter in the peat. With the Air Curing Technique, stabilized peat samples for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were kept at a normal air temperature of 30 Â Â±Â  2 Â Â°C and strengthened by gradual moisture content reduction instead of the usual water-curing technique or water submersion methods that have been common practice in past experiments involving the stabilization of peat with cement. The principle of using the Air Curing Technique to strengthen stabilized peat is that peat soil at its natural moisture content contains sufficient water (water content from 198 to 417 Â ) that, when mixed with cement, a curing process takes place that causes the stabilized peat soil to gradually lose its moisture content and to become drier and harder throughout the curing period. This process does not require the addition of water...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{investigate}} {{which of the two}} <b>products</b> <b>peat</b> and granular sulphur that generates the least greenhouse gas emissions. The study was performed by doing a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on the two different products. To perform the LCA, a standard from the Swedish Standards Institute was used. Data to put into the calculation was obtained from both Umeå Energi, their contractors and different internet-sources. The data was then multiplied with specific emission factors to get the total emission of greenhouse gases, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. Since peat is considered both a fossil energy source and a renewable energy source two calculations were made in the case of peat production. Results showed that granular sulphur generated the least emissions (23. 0), peat classified as a renewable energy source second most emissions (71. 5) and peat classified as a fossil energy source by far the most emissions (978. 2). The conclusion to be made by this study is that if only the emission of greenhouse gases are important when choosing a product, granular sulphur should be used.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg 2004. A new <b>peat</b> {{replacement}} <b>product</b> {{is being}} manufactured in South Africa. This product which is marketed under {{the brand name}} Fibregro is made from spent wattle bark originating from the tanning extract manufacturing process. Fibregro is currently being used in South Africa to dilute {{and in some instances}} replace local peat in mushroom and horticultural applications. In addition to its role as a peat replacement, Fibregro is in a position where it could also qualify to cany a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) label. Once in full production it is estimated that the company will be able to produce more products than can be sold locally. As a result export opportunities need to be pursued. The United Kingdom (UK) was identified as a potential export destination on account of developments in this country in respect of the certification of forest products (especially FSC certification) and moves to reduce peat mining. A mail survey was undertaken amongst growing media producers in the UK to address two key issues relating to Fibregro, namely: • Whether Fibregro's peat free status could be exploited in the UK growing media and mushroom casing markets. • Whether enough advantages existed in the UK market to justify the extra effort and cost associated with qualifying Fibrego to carry an FSC label. Key findings arising from this survey indicate that a niche is developing in the UK growing media market for a good peat substitute. The addition of an FSC label will render the product unique in the growing media market in this country. A number of recommendations arise from this work. These are: • In order to penetrate the UK growing media market Fibrgro must be positioned as an effective peat reducing agent which is capable of extending the peat reduction levels beyond that of composts. • Fibregro distributors should be identified from amongst the larger growing media producers in the UK. • Potential use of Fibregro as a mushroom casing in the UK appears to be limited. • A combination of peat free and FSC labelling while capable of rendering Fibregro unique in the UK growing media market needs to be carefully considered on account of chain-of-custody requirements along the supply chain...|$|R

The International Energy Agency (IEA) datasets published by the Energy Statistics Division (ESD) contain annual and quarterly time series data from 1960 onwards on energy production, trade, stocks, transformation, consumption, prices and taxes {{as well as on}} greenhouse gas emissions for over the 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Member countries and over 100 non-OECD countries worldwide. In OECD Member countries the data are collected by official bodies (most often the national statistics office in each country) from firms, government agencies and industry organisations and are then reported to the IEA using questionnaires to ensure international comparability. In non-OECD countries the data are collected directly from government and industry contacts and from national publications. Energy Balances of Non-OECD Countries: This database contains energy balances for over 100 non-OECD countries and 11 regions. Detailed energy balances are provided in thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe). Definitions of products and flows, explanatory notes on the individual country data, indicators (including GDP, population and ratios calculated with the energy data) and net calorific values are also included. In general, data are available from 1971. This database is updated by the IEA at the beginning of September each year. This database was first made available by the UK Data Service in June 2005 and is updated annually.

40|$|One {{practicability}} {{to reduce}} COD-loadings of secondary effluents is the activated carbon fixed bed-process. In this project activated carbons (GAC) of different raw <b>products</b> (<b>peat,</b> wood, coal) were loaded with filtrated {{municipal waste water}} (mean COD-concentration: 60 mg CSB/L). After the break-through of adsorption-colums, the carbon was regenerated by means of superheated steam (optimal conditions: #theta#= 300 C, pressure= 2 bar, thermal energie= 10 KW). Regeneration experiments demonstrated, {{that the results of}} steam-treatment of GAC is independent in respects to the preloading of activated carbons and the raw products. The mass of COD, detected in the condensed (liquid) steam-phase, always was in quantity about 10 % of the further COD adsorbed to the GAC. Gaseous reaction products could not evaluated by means of the experimental design. But former perculation cycles of steam-treated carbons and measurments of the specific area (BET-method) indicated, that the adsorption-capacity of regenerated GAC seams {{to be in the same}} quantity, than unloaded carbons. Measurements (GC/MS) of single organic components showed, that humic-substances are catalysed at steam temperatures about 300 C. It seams, that chlorinated hydrocarbons could formed by means of this regeneration method. BOD experiments demonstrated, that substances of the steam-treatment could be biological degraded about 50 % to 60 %. (orig.) Eine Methode, um den Rest-CSB in kommunalen Klaeranlagenablaeufen zu reduzieren, ist die Aktivkohlefiltration. In diesem Projekt wurden Aktivkohlen unterschiedlicher Rohstoffe (Torf, Holz, Kohle) mit filtriertem kommunalem Abwasser beladen (mittlere Konzentration ca. 60 mg CSB/L). Nach Durchbruch der Adsorberkolonnen wurde die Aktivkohle mit Heissdampf regeneriert (Optimale Prozessbedingungen: #theta#= 300 C, Betriebsdruck= 2 bar, thermische Leistung= 2 KW). Die Regenerationsversuche zeigten, dass das Ergebnis der Heissdampfbehandlung unabhaengig von der Beladung und dem Rohstoff der Aktivkohle ist. Die desorbierte Masse, gemessen als CSB im Bruedenkndensat, betrug immer ca. 10 % der adsorbierten Masse auf der Aktivkohle. Gasfoermige Reaktionsprodukte konnten durch die Konstruktion der Versuchsanlage nicht erfasst werden. Weitere Filtrationsversuche dampfregenerierter Kohlen und Bestimmungen der spezifischen Oberflaechen (BET-Methode) zeigten jedoch, dass die Adsorptionskapazitaet regenerierter Kohlen denen unbeladener entspricht. Einzelstoffbestimmungen (GC/MS) zeigten, dass Huminstoffe bei Dampftemperaturen von 300 C katalytisch umgesetzt werden. Es scheint, dass durch diese Regenerationsmethode chlorierte Kohlenwasserstoffe gebildet werden koennen.
