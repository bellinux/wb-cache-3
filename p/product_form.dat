He formed, led, and trained the team that designed the commercial QNAP Computer and Network Performance Modeling Tool. He introduced the Flexsim Object Oriented approach for the simulation in manufacturing systems. He carried {{out some of the}} first work on adaptive control of computer systems, and published seminal papers on the performance optimisation of computer network protocols and on the use of diffusion approximations for network performance. He developed new <b>product</b> <b>form</b> queueing networks with negative customers and triggers known as G-networks. He also introduced a new spiked stochastic neural network model known as the random neural network, developed its mathematical solution and learning algorithms, and applied it to both engineering and biological problems. His inventions include the design of the first random access fibre-optics local area network, a patented admission control technique for ATM networks, a neural network based anomaly detector for brain magnetic resonance scans, and the cognitive packet network routing protocol to offer quality of service to users.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a demand {{analysis}} for the European Union mainland’s import of the different <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> of cod. A system of demand equations are specified with a Linearized Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) to analyze the demand for fresh, frozen, clip, salt and dried cod using a data set from 1988 - 2014. The time series properties are explored and found to be non-stationary but they cointegrate. To avoid the problem of spurious results due to non-stationarity the variables have been written in first difference form. The competition between these <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> has received little attention in the literature. There could be some important substitution effects between the commodities. All the different <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> considered {{come from the same}} raw material, cod. The processing industry has the opportunity to produce all of the different <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> under consideration: fresh, frozen, salt, clip and dried cod. It is important for this industry to enhance its knowledge about the demand for these different <b>product</b> <b>forms.</b> Harmonic variables are included in the model to account for seasonal fluctuations. The result show that almost all of the <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> are substitutes with each other except for fresh and dried cod, which are complements. Papers that investigate the different <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> of cod are either rare or non-existent. Hence, this paper should provide a unique insight into on how the different <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> of cod operate in the European market...|$|R

This is of interest based on the hypothesis that fish processors and importers respond to changes in relative prices, diverting more fish into products or to markets where the price has risen. This can also at least partially explain the strong degree of correlation between prices of different <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> and markets that is observed in many seafood markets. An empirical analysis is carried out for cod for three main producers, Canada, Iceland, and Norway. The supply of cod exhibits substantial variation, and it is processed {{into a number of}} <b>product</b> <b>forms.</b> How the landings are allocated between <b>product</b> <b>forms</b> is then of substantial interest in itself, but also with respect to the influence of new species in the whitefish market, like pollock.
