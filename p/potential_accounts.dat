The authors conducted a waste generation survey and a waste composition survey for 309 stalls/vendors in five markets by 17 business categories for 10 consecutive days. The waste generation rates by stall/vendor and by floor area were assessed in three waste categories: general waste, recyclable, and food residues. The general waste that would be sent to a landfill site was classified into 10 physical categories and 77 sub-categories. For general waste, food waste accounted for the largest part, followed by plastic and grass. By multiplying the waste generation rate by stall/vendor {{by the total number of}} stall/vendors in 23 markets, the authors estimated the total amounts of general waste, recyclable, food residue and total waste by business category.

The <b>potential</b> <b>accounts</b> for explicit, dynamical charge transfer in atoms {{as a function}} of the local chemical environment. As an initial test of the charge-transfer EAM approach for a molecular system, we have constructed a relatively simple version of the potential and examined its ability to model the energetics of small water clusters. The excellent agreement between our results and current experimental and higher-level quantum computational data signifies a successful first step towards developing a unified charge-transfer potential capable of accurately describing the polymorphs, dynamics, and complex thermodynamic behavior of water.

40|$|DNA nanocompartment is {{a typical}} DNA-based machine whose {{function}} is dependent of molecular collective effect. Fundamental properties of the device have been addressed via electrochemical analysis, fluorescent microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Interesting and novel phenomena emerged during the switching of the device. We have found that DNAs in this system exhibit a much steep melting transition compared to ones in bulk solution or conventional DNA array. To achieve an understanding to this discrepancy, we introduced DNA-DNA interaction potential to the conventional Ising-like Zimm-Bragg theory and Peyrard-Bishop model of DNA melting. To avoid unrealistic numerical calculation caused by modification of the Peyrard-Bishop nonlinear Hamiltonian with the DNA-DNA interaction, we established coarse-gained Monte Carlo recursion relations by elucidation of five components of energy change during melting transition. The result suggests that DNA-DNA interaction <b>potential</b> <b>accounts</b> for the observed steep transition. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{externally}} applied force upon dynamics of dissipative solitons is analyzed {{in the framework}} of the one-dimensional cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation supplemented by a linear potential term. The <b>potential</b> <b>accounts</b> for the external force manipulations and consists of three symmetrically arranged potential wells whose depth is considered to be variable along the longitudinal coordinate. It is found out that under an influence of such potential a transition between different soliton waveforms coexisted under the same physical conditions can be achieved. A low-dimensional phase-space analysis is applied in order to demonstrate that by only changing the potential profile, transitions between different soliton waveforms can be performed in a controllable way. In particular, it is shown that by means of a selected potential, propagating stationary dissipative soliton can be transformed into another stationary solitons as well as into periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic spatiotemporal dissipative structures.

Using a Woods-Saxon parametrization of the nuclear potential for these isotopes we study in detail the effect of the vector-isovector ρ and Coulomb potentials in the energy splittings of neutron and proton pseudospin partners in the isotopic chain. We conclude that the realization of nuclear pseudospin symmetry does not change considerably with the mass number, and is always favored for neutrons. We also find that the ρ <b>potential</b> <b>accounts</b> for essentially all the pseudospin isospin asymmetry observed and that the Coulomb potential plays a negligible role in this asymmetry.

40|$|When {{observers}} {{search for}} a target object, they incidentally learn the identities and locations of “background” objects in the same display. This learning can facilitate search performance, eliciting faster reaction times for repeated displays. Despite these findings, visual search has been successfully modeled using architectures that maintain no history of attentional deployments; they are amnesic (e. g., Guided Search Theory). In the current study, we asked two questions: 1) under what conditions does such incidental learning occur? And 2) what does viewing behavior reveal about the efficiency of attentional deployments over time? In two experiments, we tracked eye movements during repeated visual search, and we tested incidental memory for repeated nontarget objects. Across conditions, the consistency of search sets and spatial layouts were manipulated to assess their respective contributions to learning. Using viewing behavior, we contrasted three <b>potential</b> <b>accounts</b> for faster searching with experience.

We studied two different topologies.

Under topology 2 the European theoretical potential reaches 123 TWh when the distance between the existing reservoir and the prospective site is up to 20 km.
