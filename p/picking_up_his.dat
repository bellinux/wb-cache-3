5|$|He {{signed for}} the club {{permanently}} on 5 January 2011 on a one-and-a-half-year contract that would expire {{in the summer of}} 2012. His first appearance after joining permanently came three days later in a 2–0 defeat away to Premier League team Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup third round, which was the first time Smith had faced top-flight opposition in his career. After goalkeeper Michael Ingham's 15th-minute sending off away to Luton Town on 18 January 2011, Smith played in goal until half-time when being replaced by Greg Young, conceding four goals in a 5–0 defeat. He received a two-match suspension after <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> 10th booking of the season in a 2–1 home win over Mansfield on 15 March 2011, meaning he missed York's matches against Cambridge and Histon. He returned in a 1–1 draw away to Kettering on 2 April 2011, before missing York's matches against Darlington and Cambridge in April due to worries involving the birth of his son. He finished 2010–11 with 30 appearances and one goal for York.|$|E
5|$|With Kisnorbo {{only on a}} {{short term}} {{contract}} to prove his fitness, Crystal Palace and Brighton & Hove Albion were linked with signing the player. Manager Simon Grayson then claimed {{that he was looking}} for Kisnorbo to prove his fitness before offering him a longer term contract. After completing his injury rehab in his native Australia, Kisnorbo returned to pre-season training for Leeds United a week later than his team mates. After returning from his long injury lay off, and proving his fitness, Kisnorbo signed a new two-year contract at Leeds on 10 July. Kisnorbo revealed he wouldn't be wearing his iconic head bandage for the 2011–12 season as he wanted it to represent a new start for him. Kisnorbo scored the opening goal in the pre-season friendly victory against Newcastle United. Kisnorbo started for Leeds on the opening day of the season as they suffered a 3–1 defeat against Southampton.

5|$|After {{making a}} mistake that led to York conceding a goal late on in a 1–1 draw away to Forest Green on 26 November 2011, he was {{replaced}} in the line-up by McGurk for the next match at home to Lincoln three days later. This {{was the start of}} a second extended spell out of the team for Smith that season, before returning to play as a defensive midfielder in a 3–5–2 formation for York's FA Trophy first-round replay away to Solihull Moors on 13 December 2011. He scored his first goal of the season in the 11th minute of this match, converting Scott Kerr's cross at the far post, with York going on to win 3–0. However, he returned to the bench for the subsequent league match against Kidderminster on 19 December 2011, with York reverting to their usual 4–3–3 formation. With York reverting to 3–5–2 for a 1–1 draw away to Mansfield on 26 December 2011, Smith returned as a defensive midfielder, but after <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> fifth yellow card of the season was suspended for the reverse fixture at home to Mansfield on 1 January 2012. Smith captained York to victory in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, with Newport County being beaten 2–0. This was the first time York had won a national knockout competition. Eight days later, he captained York to a 2–1 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, meaning the club regained Football League status after eight years with promotion to League Two.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{committed}} {{his future}} {{to the club}} over the summer of 2006 and captained the team during the 2006–07 pre-season. His first appearance of the season came in the opening match, a 1–0 victory away to Barrow on 12 August 2006, before scoring from inside the six-yard box in a 2–0 victory away to Worksop on 22 August. During August 2006, Smith started a spell of playing as a central midfielder after Des Lyttle moved into defence. After receiving his fifth yellow card {{of the season in}} a 3–2 home defeat by Harrogate on 6 October 2006, he was suspended for Worcester's match against Hucknall on 21 October 2006. He signed a new one-and-a-half-year contract with Worcester in December 2006, contracting him to the club until the summer of 2008. Smith received a two-match suspension after <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> 10th booking of the season in a 3–1 home win over Hinckley United on 20 January 2007. This meant he missed matches against Welling United and Scarborough, before scoring on his return in a 3–3 home draw with Vauxhall Motors on 12 February 2007. He missed a match against Alfreton Town on 9 April 2007 to rest an ankle, despite playing through some previous matches with this complaint. Smith returned in the following match, a 2–1 home win over Worksop on 14 April 2007, as a 69th-minute substitute, despite not being fully fit. He completed 2006–07 with 47 appearances and five goals, and was named Worcester's Player of the Year. Throughout the season, he often deputised as captain when Lyttle was absent.|$|E

25|$|In 1926, however, he {{returned}} to the higher level when he was chosen by Worcestershire, and at once he enjoyed the best season of his career, taking 47 wickets in his 27 games at 30.14 including his only five-wicket innings haul, 5-56 against Sussex at Hove. His batting was also much improved, and he made two half-centuries, the higher of which - 73 against his old county of Gloucestershire - was to remain his career best. He also kept wicket occasionally, <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> only stumping when he dismissed Glamorgan's Dai Davies while substituting for named keeper Maurice Foster.|$|E
25|$|Douglas Hart had moonlighted {{with the}} Acid Angels in 1988, {{and left the}} band in 1991, to have a career in film making, before <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> bass again in 2006, playing with the Sian Alice Group, Le Volume Courbe and Cristine. Thomas also quit the band to join Renegade Soundwave. The fluid nature of the Mary Chain's line up {{continued}} throughout their entire career, with a revolving door of drummers, bassists and guitarists being recruited for TV appearances and gigs whenever they were required, the only constants being the Reid brothers. The Reid brothers recruited former Starlings rhythm section Matthew Parkin and Barry Blackler to replace Hart and Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Kaymer {{came close}} to <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> third win {{of the year at}} the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, but he fell to Robert Karlsson in a three-man playoff that also {{included}} Ross Fisher.

At 10:30a.m., tired of waiting at the NMU hiring hall for a job and with $25 his sister had given him, Speck left and walked a mile and a half east on E. 100th St. to check in at the Shipyard Inn at E. 101st St. & S.

25|$|Another notable false {{lead was}} that of Sidney Sherman, a {{recently}} discharged Marine who had served in World War II. Police had found blonde hairs {{in the back of}} the Degnan apartment building, and nearby was a wire that authorities suspected could have been used as a garrote to strangle Suzanne Degnan. Near that was a handkerchief the police suspected might have been used as a gag to keep Suzanne quiet. On the handkerchief was a laundry mark name: S. Sherman. The police hoped that perhaps the killer had erred in leaving it behind. They searched military records and discovered that a Sidney Sherman lived at the Hyde Park YMCA. The police went to question Sherman but discovered that he had vacated the residence without checking out and quit his job without <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> last paycheck.|$|E
25|$|October: The month started poorly as a 2–0 home reverse against Cheltenham Town was {{followed}} days {{later by the}} team's elimination from another cup competition, this time losing 1–0 away to Bristol Rovers in the League Trophy. The Shots picked up in form mid-October and recorded their first back-to-back wins of the season against Oxford and Morecambe, with Morgan again on the scoresheet in both fixtures. The results lifted Aldershot into the League Two playoff places {{for the first and}} only time in the season. The next game - away to Crewe - would be a landmark for Aldershot Town captain Anthony Charles, the defender <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> 200th appearance for the club. The match went poorly for Charles as the team lost 3–1, a result which {{was followed}} a week later by another defeat by the same scorline at home to Bury.
