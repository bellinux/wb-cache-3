An alarm is a <b>persistent</b> <b>indication</b> of a fault that clears only when the triggering condition has been resolved. A current list of problems occurring on the network component is often kept {{in the form of}} an active alarm list such as is defined in RFC 3877, the Alarm MIB. A list of cleared faults is also maintained by most network management systems.|$|E
40|$|Transrectal ultrasound-guided {{systemic}} biopsy is {{the recommended}} method {{in most cases}} with suspicion of prostate cancer. Transrectal periprostatic injection with a local anesthetic may be offered as effective analgesia; periprostatic nerve block with 1 % or 2 % lidocaine is the recommended form of pain control. On initial biopsy, a minimum of 10 systemic, laterally directed cores is recommended, with more cores in larger glands. Extended prostate biopsy schemes, which require cores weighted more laterally at the base (lateral horn) and medially to the apex, show better cancer detection rates without increasing adverse events. Transition zone biopsies are not recommended in {{the first set of}} biopsies, owing to low detection rates. One set of repeat biopsies is warranted in cases with <b>persistent</b> <b>indication.</b> Saturation biopsy (≥ 20 cores) should be reserved for repeat biopsy in patients who have negative results on initial biopsy but who are still strongly suspected to have prostate cancer...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} {{of dark matter}} (DM) and {{the origin of the}} baryon asymmetry are <b>persistent</b> <b>indications</b> that the SM is incomplete. More recently, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have observed an excess of diphoton events with invariant mass of about 750 GeV. One interpretation of this excess is decays of a new spin- 0 particle with a sizable diphoton partial width, e. g. induced by new heavy weakly charged particles. These are also key ingredients in models cogenerating asymmetric DM and baryons via sphaleron interactions and an initial particle asymmetry. We explore what consequences the new scalar may have for models of asymmetric DM that attempt to account for the similarity of the dark and visible matter abundances.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} is provided for the topic of health-related research and power frequency electromagnetic fields. Minimal evidence for concern is present on the basis of animal and plant research. General observation would accord with the implication that there is no single and manifest health effect as the result of exposure to these fields. There are <b>persistent</b> <b>indications,</b> however, that these fields have biologic activity, and consequently, there may be a deleterious component to their action, possibly in the presence of other factors. Power frequency electromagnetic field exposures are essentially ubiquitous in modern society, and their implications in the larger perspective of public health are unclear at this time. Electromagnetic fields represent a methodological obstacle for epidemiologic studies and a quandary for risk assessment; there is need for more data...|$|R
40|$|The tilt {{from open}} to laparoscopic surgery {{seems to be}} {{definite}} in most adrenal disorders. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the current indications for laparoscopy and the <b>persistent</b> <b>indications</b> for open adrenalectomy, as seen in our experience and in the literature data. Between January 1985 and December 1999, 486 patients were operated on for adrenalectomy. Since January 1994, 91 laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed in 84 patients. The Authors retrospectively evaluated the indications for laparoscopy in 55 patients (45. 9 %) and for open adrenalectomy in 65 others (54. 1 %) operated on in the last three years. Exclusion criteria for the laparoscopic approach included clinical suspicion of malignancy and tumour size greater than 6 cm, in the 38. 5 % and in the 23. 0 % of cases respectively. In Authors experience the laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the procedure of the choice for the surgical removal of non-malignant, unilateral or bilateral tumours under 6 or 7 cm. The laparoscopy is not a radical operation for cancer. Open surgery is always indicated for large and malignant tumours. The fascinating feature of laparoscopy has not to change the indications and the surgeon must plan the appropriate approach for every single patien...|$|R
40|$|Background: Indication to implantable cardioverter {{defibrillator}} (ICD) {{for primary}} prevention of sudden death relies on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We measured the proportion of patients in whom indication to ICD persisted {{at the time of}} generator replacement (GR) and searched for predictors of appropriate therapies after GR. Methods: We identified all consecutive patients who had received an ICD at our hospital, for LVEF ≤ 35 % and no previous arrhythmias or unexplained syncope. Then, we included the 166 patients who outlived their first device and underwent GR. Results: At the time of GR (mean follow-up 59  ±  20 months), ICD indication (i. e. LVEF ≤ 35 % or previously treated ventricular arrhythmias) persisted in 114 (69 %) patients. After GR, appropriate ICD therapies were delivered in 30 (26 %) patients with <b>persistent</b> ICD <b>indication</b> and in 12 (23 %) of the remaining patients (p =  0. 656). Nonetheless, the annual rate of therapies was higher in the first group (1. 08 versus 0. 53 events/year; p <  0. 001), as well as the rate of inappropriate therapies (0. 03 versus 0 events/year; p =  0. 031). The only independent predictor of appropriate ICD therapies after GR was the rate of shocks received before replacement (Hazard Ratio: 1. 41; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 01 – 1. 96; p =  0. 041). Conclusion: In heart failure with reduced LVEF, ICD indication persisted at the time of GR in 69 % of patients. However, {{even in the absence of}} <b>persistent</b> ICD <b>indication</b> at GR, the risk of recurrence of arrhythmic events was not null...|$|R
40|$|D. Ed. (Media Science) The use of {{educational}} media {{in education and}} training is a reality. In order to use media optimally two possible sources of information and expertise come to mind, namely own cumulative experience and research. Experience can often be very shallow and unsatisfactory and could necessitate augmentation by the findings of research and a fuller grasp {{of the extent of}} the theoretical base within a particular field of study. As there are <b>persistent</b> <b>indications</b> that the theoretical bases {{of educational}} technology and media science leave much to be desired and that media research does not fulfil expectations, it was deemed prudent to investigate theory formation and explication in the field of media science (a subset of educational technology). The following aims were pursued: * Further theory formation regarding the nature and focus of educational technology and media science and the placement of both fields of study within the discipline of education. * The development of a model for media research. * The development of criteria or the redirection of existing criteria for the assessment of media research. * A discussion of the implications of the above for media utilization. In order to realize these aims, theory formation in the discipline of education was investigated and an overview of educational research (as one form of manifestation of theory formation) undertaken. As media science forms part of educational technology, tho developments in both fields were reviewed. Media research forms a substantial mechanism whereby theory formation can take place, therefore the media research (past and present) is dealt with extensively. Each of these themes are dealt with in terms of its history, current status and future prospects [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on situation awareness (SA) predominantly focused on its explicit, reasoned, conscious features {{rather than on}} the implicit, intuitive, unconscious aspects that are often identified with expert operators. This research investigated implicit levels of SA of train traffic controllers (TTCs) in order to contribute to the body of knowledge on rail human factors research and SA. A novel approach was used to uncover levels of implicit SA through a set of three analyses: (1) fairly low SAGAT values with correlations between SAGAT scores and multiple performance indicators; (2) negative correlations between work experience and SAGAT scores; and (3) structurally lower level- 1 SA (perception) scores in comparison to level- 2 SA (comprehension) scores in accordance with Endsley's three-level model. Two studies were conducted: A pilot study which focused on SA measurements with TTCs in a monitoring mode (N = 9) and the main study, which involved TTCs from another control center (N = 20) and three different disrupted conditions. In the pilot study, SA was measured through the situation-awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT), perceived SA and observed SA, and performance was measured through punctuality and unplanned stops of trains before red signals. In the main study, SA was measured through SAGAT, and perceived SA and multiple performance indicators, such as arrival and departure punctuality and platform consistency, were assessed. In both studies, the set of three analyses showed consistent and <b>persistent</b> <b>indications</b> of the presence of implicit SA. Endsley's three-level model and related SAGAT method can be constrained by the presence of these intuitive, unconscious processes and inconsistent findings on correlations between SAGAT scores and performance. These findings provide insights into the SA of TTCs in the Netherlands and can support the development of training programs and/or the design of a new traffic management system.

40|$|The {{prognostic}} {{value of}} QRS score (Selvester), ST depression, ST elevation, extrasystoles, P terminal force in V 1, and QTc {{derived from the}} predischarge 12 lead electrocardiogram was assessed after myocardial infarction in 474 patients without intraventricular conduction defects, ventricular hypertrophy, or atrial fibrillation. The usefulness of these results in risk assessment was {{compared with that of}} other clinical data. During follow up 45 patients died. Logistic regression analysis showed that QRS score, ST depression, and QTc were independently predictive of cardiac mortality. When multivariate analysis was applied to clinical and electrocardiographic data together, however, the 12 lead electrocardiogram did not provide independent information additional to that provided by other routine clinical findings and laboratory tests such as a history of previous myocardial infarction, clinical signs of <b>persistent</b> heart failure, <b>indication</b> for digitalis or antiarrhythmic drugs at discharge, and enlarged heart on chest x ray. In conclusion, the electrocardiogram has important prognostic value; however, it is not powerful enough to further improve the risk assessment of post-infarction patient...|$|R

(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract: Left uncontrolled, persistent post-kidney transplant hyperparathyroidism (HPT) {{may lead to}} or exacerbate pre-existing bone and cardiovascular disease. Parathyroidectomy {{has long been the}} primary treatment option for long-term uncontrolled HPT in post-kidney transplant patients. However, patients with contraindications for surgery and parathyroidectomy-associated complications, including graft loss, highlight the need for other approaches. Conventional medical therapies have limited impact on serum calcium (Ca) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin, used to spare bone loss, and phosphorus supplementation, to correct hypophosphatemia, do not directly regulate PTH or Ca. Although vitamin D supplementation can reduce PTH, it is often contraindicated because of hypercalcemia. Studies of the calcimimetic cinacalcet in patients with post-kidney transplant HPT suggest that it can rapidly reduce serum PTH and Ca concentrations while increasing serum phosphorus concentrations toward the normal range. Although the clearest application for cinacalcet is the non-surgical treatment of hypercalcemic patients with <b>persistent</b> HPT, current <b>indications</b> for other transplant patients are as yet uncertain. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of cinacalcet in patients with spontaneous resolution of HPT or low bone turnover. This review discusses the pathophysiology of post-kidney transplant HPT, associated complications, and current options for clinical management...|$|R
40|$|Forty-one {{children}} and adolescents had thyroidectomies for Grave's disease during an 8 yr period. Twenty patients became euthyroid within a short period after treatment with antithyroid drugs and had operations with minimal disruption of their lives. Antithyroid drugs were administered to 20 patients {{for a longer period}} of time as a primary form of treatment for Grave's disease. Complications resulting from drug toxicity, poor cooperation by patients, and <b>persistent</b> goiters were <b>indications</b> for thyroidectomies in this group. Permanent remissions, after prolonged antithyroid drug therapy, are rare in children. Because the treatment is associated with significant morbidity, this form of therapy is unacceptable in most cases. Iodine- 131 was given to 30 children or adolescents for Grave's disease during the same time period. Iodine- 131 is primarily indicated for patients who are resistant or allergic to antithyroid drugs, who have serious systemic diseases, or who have had previous thyroid operations. Hypothyroidism is an inevitable result of effective 131 I treatment of Grave's disease in children. Serious consequences from 131 I therapy were not observed during the short period of follow-up. Subtotal thyroidectomy continues to be the preferred primary treatment for most patients with Grave's disease in childhood. Total thyroidectomy may be indicated for patients in the first decade of life. Hypothyroidism, which is easily managed in this age group, is the price paid for the prevention of recurrent Grave's disease. Early detection and treatment of hypothyroidism can be achieved only by a careful follow-up of all patients treated by less than total thyroidectomy for Grave's disease...|$|R
40|$|Masked hypertension, an {{elevated}} daytime ambulatory {{blood pressure in}} the presence of a normal office blood pressure, confers an increased cardiovascular risk to adults. We investigated the prevalence, persistence, and clinical significance of masked hypertension in children and adolescents. We enrolled 592 youths (6 to 18 years old). Youths with masked hypertension (n= 34) and a random sample of the normotensive participants (n= 200) were followed-up. In a nested case-control study, we compared echocardiographic left ventricular mass among cases with persistent masked hypertension and normotensive controls. At baseline, mean age was 10. 2 years; 535 youths were normotensive on office and daytime ambulatory blood pressure measurement (90. 4 %), and 45 had masked hypertension (7. 6 %). Compared with normotensive controls, participants with masked hypertension had a higher ambulatory pulse rate, were more obese, and were 2. 5 -times more likely to have a parental history of hypertension. Among 34 patients with masked hypertension (median follow-up 37 months), 18 became normotensive, 13 had persistent masked hypertension, and 3 had sustained hypertension. Patients with persistent masked hypertension (n= 17) or who progressed from masked to sustained hypertension (n= 3) had a higher left ventricular mass index (34. 9 versus 29. 6 g/m 2. 7; P= 0. 023) and a higher percentage with left ventricular mass index above the 95 th percentile (30 % versus 0 %; P= 0. 014) than normotensive controls. In children and adolescents, masked hypertension is a precursor of sustained hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. This condition warrants follow-up and, once it becomes <b>persistent,</b> is an <b>indication</b> for blood pressure-lowering treatment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The term "arrhythmia" {{refers to}} any {{change from the}} normal {{sequence}} of electrical impulses. The electrical impulses may happen too fast, too slowly or erratically causing the heart to beat too fast, too slowly or erratically. When the heart doesn't beat properly, it can't pump blood effectively. When the heart doesn't pump blood effectively, the lungs, brain and all other organs can't work properly and may shutdown or be damaged. Normally, the heart's most rapidly firing cells are in the sinus (or sino-atrial or SA) node making that area a natural pacemaker. Under some conditions, almost all heart tissue can start an impulse of the type that can generate a heartbeat. Cells in the heart's conduction system can fire automatically and start electrical activity. This activity can interrupt the normal order of the heart's pumping activity. Secondary pacemakers elsewhere in the heart provide a "backup" rhythm when the sinus node doesn't work properly or when impulses are blocked somewhere in the conduction system. An arrhythmia occurs when the heart's natural pacemaker develops an abnormal rate or rhythm. The normal conduction pathway is interrupted. Another part of the heart takes over as pacemaker. The aim {{of the study is}} to observe the prevalence of various electrolyte (Na, K, Cl and Mg) imbalances in complications of arrhythmias. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a prospective study in which the patient admitted with signs and symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias diagnosed clinically, 100 cases were selected over 1 year. RESULTS The serum magnesium, sodium and potassium levels were significantly lower in the AMI patients at baseline and gradually becomes near normal on 4 th day. K and Mg are showing significant difference between pre and post values in males and Mg show significant difference between pre and post values day 1 and day 5 in females with arrhythmia. CONCLUSION <b>Persistent</b> hyponatraemia is <b>indication</b> of worsening cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock. There is also relationship between serum potassium and QTc interval, so estimation of sodium, potassium, chlorine and magnesium levels in arrhythmia patients can help to assess prognosis...|$|R
