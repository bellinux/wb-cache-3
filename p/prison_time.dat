5|$|In 1994, the County Court in Gospić {{tried and}} convicted in {{absentia}} {{a group of}} seven Croatian Serbs for their involvement in the killings of eight civilians (members of the Nikšić and Orešković families, but not the Rakić family) in Široka Kula, handing out prison sentences. Nikola Zagorac, Miroslav Serdar and Dragan Vunjak were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, while Dane Serdar, Dušan Uzelac, Milorad Barać and Dragan Uzelac each received sentences of 15 years in prison. In 1997, the County Court in Gospić also tried Vladimir Korica and Branko Banjeglav in absentia for {{taking part in the}} massacre. Both of them were convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. None of those convicted in absentia served any <b>prison</b> <b>time.</b> Dane Serdar voluntarily returned to Croatia in September 2003 and was granted a retrial as he had been convicted in absentia. Dane Serdar's 1994 conviction was overturned and he was acquitted in September 2004, after prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence against him.|$|E

25|$|File sharing {{researcher}} Daniel Johansson {{called the}} ruling {{the most important}} file sharing related verdict in Europe so far, comparing it to the Napster verdict in the US.

While most legal experts expected the court to find the defendants guilty, they were surprised at the harsh verdict. Sociology of law professor Håkan Hyden criticised the exceptionally harsh sentence on both the <b>prison</b> <b>time</b> and large amount of compensation awarded, and some legal analysts expect the punishments to be radically lowered in higher courts.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "middlemen" [...] {{consist of}} a group of {{entities}} that help funnel animals and their products out of their native countries and into the hands of collectors. They can take the form of exporters, shipping brokers, corrupt government officials and police, and smugglers. Unfortunately, poaching animals still does not carry the same punishments as other black market trades, such as firearms and drugs. Shorter <b>prison</b> <b>times</b> and smaller fines enable the middlemen to pursue this trade with little consequence. Government bribes and connections help countless others evade prosecution.|$|R
