5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E

5|$|Many {{types of}} {{reinforcement}} can increase wall strength, such as plastic or wire mesh and reinforcing rods of steel or fiberglass or bamboo. Earth resists compression well but is weak when twisted. Tensile reinforcement must span <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> points and be well-anchored to increase out-of-plane stability. Bond beams at wall tops are vital {{and must be}} well attached to walls.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{ten years}} after the eastern {{extension}} of Route 37 was canceled, RIDOT began planning studies for a western extension of the freeway. The expressway was included in a proposal to extend I-84 eastward from Hartford, Connecticut to Providence; more northern alignments for the freeway had been rejected due to concerns of <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> to the Scituate Reservoir. The southern routing of I-84, which would have utilized Route 37 and terminated in Warwick, largely bypassed the reservoir's watershed. In 1982, however, I-84 was officially canceled by RIDOT after studies indicated that the southern alignment was not a feasible alternative.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their <b>potential</b> <b>damage.</b> Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E

40|$|Both {{biologists}} and economists {{are concerned about}} invasive species. There are several well-documented instances in which biological invaders have done extensive damage. This has led some economists to conclude that biological invaders {{should be treated as}} a form of "pollution", and that the activity generating the "pollution" international trade should be taxed to the point at which its marginal benefits balance its marginal costs. This prescription presumes a convex objective, however, and this assumption may not hold. If the expected damage done by a biological invader is the damage caused in the event an invasion occurs times the probability of invasion, and the probability of invasion is necessarily bounded by one, there may be situations in which fighting potential invaders is a lost cause and should be abandoned. A simple model illustrates that such results can arise even when <b>potential</b> <b>damages</b> are significant. In general the optimal policy is discontinuous in the magnitude of <b>potential</b> <b>damages.</b> For low-to-medium levels of damage it is best essentially to do nothing to prevent invasion, but at a certain threshold level of <b>potential</b> <b>damages</b> there is a discontinuous policy response from doing nothing to adopting aggressive measures. The dividing line between laissez faire and aggressive responses is associated with the relationship between gains from trade and <b>potential</b> <b>damages.</b> For <b>potential</b> <b>damages</b> in excess of the maximum potential gains from trade aggressive responses are generally warranted, while damages below that threshold often do not merit intervention. These results point to the need to better understand the true costs of biological invasion. It is especially important to distinguish between tangible and intangible values and decide what weight society assigns to the latter. invasive species, nonconvexity, cost-benefit analysis, laissez-faire...|$|R

5|$|On 8 June 1943, Mutsu was moored at Hashirajima {{when the}} {{magazine}} of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12:13, cutting {{the ship in}} half. The forward section capsized almost immediately, but the rear section remained afloat until the early morning of the next day. Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu, meaning that 1,121 men {{were killed in the}} explosion. To avert the <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> to morale from the loss of a battleship, Mutsus loss was declared a state secret. To further prevent rumors from spreading, many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building, with arches, pilasters, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by George Dance the Younger who also designed the decorative sections of the interior. The main fabric of the building was by John Palmer, who supervised the construction. The ceiling was decorated with panels from Fonthill Splendens, a mile from Fonthill Abbey, which were painted by Andrea Casali and donated to the theatre by Paul Cobb Methuen. Because of the <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> from the gas lights, which were installed in 1827, the paintings were moved by William Blathwayt to Dyrham Park.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to <b>potential</b> <b>damage.</b> There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E

5|$|After the explosion, as {{the rescue}} {{operations}} commenced, the fleet was alerted {{and the area}} was searched for Allied submarines, but no traces were found. To avert the <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> to morale {{from the loss of}} a battleship so soon after the string of recent setbacks in the war effort, Mutsus destruction was declared a state secret. Mass cremations of recovered bodies began almost immediately after the sinking. Captain Teruhiko Miyoshi's body was recovered by divers on 17 June, but his wife was not officially notified until 6 January 1944. Both he and his second in command, Captain Ono Koro, were posthumously promoted to rear admiral, as was normal practice. To further prevent rumours from spreading, healthy and recovered survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the Caroline Islands and assigned to the 41st Guard Force. Another 150 were sent to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where most were killed in 1944 during the battle for the island.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} {{for nearly three}} decades to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving a ghost town in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposals}} faced strong {{objections from}} the Metropolitan and District Railways (MR and DR) whose routes on the Inner Circle, {{to the north}} and the south respectively, the CLR route paralleled; and from which the new line was expected to take passengers. The City Corporation also objected, concerned about <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> to buildings close to the route caused by subsidence as was experienced during the construction of the C The Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral objected, concerned about the risks of undermining the cathedral's foundations. Sir Joseph Bazalgette objected that the tunnels would damage the city's sewer system. The bill was approved by the House of Commons, but was rejected by the House of Lords, which recommended that any decision be postponed until after the C had opened and its operation could be assessed.|$|E

5|$|While Lili {{was still}} a {{tropical}} depression, the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch for Isla de la Juventud and the provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana provinces. On October16, a tropical storm warning {{was put in place}} for several provinces, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning the next day for eight provinces, eastward to Camagüey. The threat of the storm caused all flights to and from Cuba to be canceled, and the airport at Havana was closed. Officials set up shelters and ordered about 88,000people in Havana to evacuate from buildings prone to collapsing; however, only 5,000people had evacuated by the day before landfall, due to fears of their houses being robbed. Ultimately, 269,995people evacuated due to the storm, along with over 270,000livestock. Officials also closed classes and sent workers home in areas along the projected path, and two hospitals were completely evacuated. Power lines in Havana were intentionally turned off before the storm to minimize <b>potential</b> <b>damage.</b> Before Lili, the last hurricane to strike Cuba was Hurricane Kate in 1985. The country was already experiencing economic difficulties when the storm struck, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in a crisis known as the Special Period.|$|E

25|$|Coasts and low-lying areas: According to Nicholls et al. (2007, p.336), {{societal}} {{vulnerability to}} climate change is largely dependent on development status. Developing countries lack the necessary financial resources to relocate those living in low-lying coastal zones, making them more vulnerable {{to climate change}} than developed countries. With high confidence, Nicholls et al. (2007, p.317) concluded that on vulnerable coasts, the costs of adapting to climate change are lower than the <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> costs.|$|E
25|$|There may be {{a number}} of side effects {{following}} the surgery. Because certain nerve connections to the lungs are cut during the procedure, transplant recipients cannot feel the urge to cough or feel when their new lungs are becoming congested. They must therefore make conscious efforts to take deep breaths and cough in order to clear secretions from the lungs. Their heart rate responds less quickly to exertion due to the cutting of the vagus nerve that would normally help regulate it. They may also notice a change in their voice due to <b>potential</b> <b>damage</b> to the nerves that coordinate the vocal cords.|$|E
