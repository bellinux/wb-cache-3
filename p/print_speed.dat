It was showed that the phenomena of wet picking and wet repellence occurred in turn on the surface of offset papers with increased <b>printing</b> <b>speed</b> {{and the amount of}} fountain solution. In addition, in contrast with fountain solutions, <b>printing</b> <b>speed</b> had greater influence on the phenomena of wet picking and wet repellence of offset papers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the <b>printing</b> industry, the <b>speed</b> of the inkjet printer has soon become the focus. In view of the high requirements of <b>printing</b> <b>speed,</b> the in-depth analysis of the bottleneck, which restricts the press <b>printing</b> <b>speed,</b> is made. As the computer hard disk access data speed is limited at this stage, the high-speed inkjet printing system software based on distributed processing is developed. This software system based on object-oriented programming theory, by taking VS 2008 as the development platform and using C/S system architecture, realizes multiple servers in parallel processing, data transfer and printing capabilities. The practical application proved that it deed improve the <b>printing</b> <b>speed</b> effectiveness and feasibility...|$|R

In 1984 Canon {{introduced}} the first “small” - 32 kg - [...] laser printers which could {{sit on a}} (sturdy) desktop with a <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> of 8 pages per minute (ppm). Today, even the smallest page printers {{may be able to}} print 15-20 ppm, and the largest may print above 1000 ppm.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of direct to media is drastically reduced waste. This method doesn’t need printing on transfer paper first before calendering (or heat-pressing) {{it onto the}} media. Waste is both an economical and an ecological factor in print production. <b>Print</b> <b>speed</b> doesn’t account for much if a large portion is being thrown away as waste due to incompatibility of media, ink, treatment or lack of know-how.|$|E
50|$|Modern large format {{printers}} {{are capable}} of printing onto canvas rolls measuring 1.5 m or more. Modern examples of inkjet-based printers capable of printing directly onto canvas are the HP Designjet z6100 and the Epson Ultra Chrome 11880. Printers such as these allow artists and photographers to print their works directly onto canvas media, with slow <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> settings available to ensure print quality is not diminished.|$|E

5000|$|Users of {{the initial}} release of the print command commented on the slow <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> and high {{resource}} usage, {{as well as the}} lack of support for the newly introduced subdirectories. [...] The command was among the first RAM-resident programs and was the first to achieve widespread use, with many users disassembling the binary in order to determine how RAM-resident programs should be written.|$|E
50|$|The HP LaserJet 1012 is a low-end, {{monochrome}} {{laser printer}} from Hewlett-Packard that retails for US $199.99 and was designed as an inexpensive laser alternative to Inkjet printers for home and small office use. It is capable of printing a maximum 15 pages per minute (although after many pages, the <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> slows down to prevent overheating, as the printer has no onboard fan) and has a 1200 dpi effective output (optical 600 dpi).|$|E
50|$|The desktop {{impact printer}} was {{gradually}} {{replaced by the}} inkjet printer. When Hewlett-Packard's patents expired on steam-propelled photolithographically produced ink-jet heads, the inkjet mechanism became available to the printer industry. For applications that did not require impact (e.g. carbon-copy printing), the inkjet was superior in nearly all respects: comparatively quiet operation, faster <b>print</b> <b>speed,</b> and output quality {{almost as good as}} a laser printer. By the mid-1990s, inkjet technology had surpassed dot-matrix in the mainstream market.|$|E
5000|$|... 1972: Introduction of the ROLAND 800, {{the first}} sheetfed offset press with an {{integrated}} color control system that permitted a <b>printing</b> <b>speed</b> of 10,000 sheets per hour.|$|R
50|$|Vivid, {{enduring}} HP Vivera inks {{were introduced}} with the HP Deskjet 6540 in 2004, offering breakthrough <b>printing</b> <b>speeds</b> {{of up to}} 30 ppm in black-and-white, and 20 ppm in color.|$|R
50|$|<b>Printing</b> <b>speed</b> {{was about}} 100 lines per minute. When forming totals, {{printing}} was suppressed, and the card reader mechanism read cards at an increased speed of about 150 cards per minute.|$|R
5000|$|The AW3D HDL was the Airwolf 3D {{base model}} 3D printer {{which could be}} {{upgraded}} depending on the user's needs. It was equipped with an un-heated print bed and a single print head capable of sustained temperatures of 260 °C (500 °F). The AW3D had a print resolution of [...]08mm with a maximum <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> of 150mm/s. The AW3D had a build volume of 12" [...] x 8" [...] x 11" [...] (1056in³) and came standard with [...]5mm print nozzle or a [...]35mm nozzle optional.|$|E
50|$|The common serial {{dot matrix}} {{printers}} use a horizontally moving print head. The print head {{can be thought}} of featuring a single vertical column of seven or more pins approximately the height of a character box. In reality, the pins are arranged in up to four vertically or/and horizontally slightly displaced columns in order to increase the dot density and <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> through interleaving without causing the pins to jam. Thereby, up to 48 pins can be used to form the characters of a line while the print head moves horizontally.|$|E
50|$|Intelligent Printer Data Stream (IPDS) is InfoPrint Solution Company's Systems Application Architecture host-to-printer {{data stream}} for Advanced Function Presentation subsystems. It {{provides}} an attachment-independent interface for controlling and managing all points addressable (APA) printers {{that allows the}} presentation of pages containing an architecturally unlimited mixture of different data types, including text, image, graphics, bar code, and object container. It is used {{by a variety of}} InfoPrint and OEM print servers that drive all points addressable (APA) page printers. Generally these printers are at the medium to high end of the <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> and volume spectrum.|$|E
50|$|HP {{all-in-one}} {{inkjet printers}} under the Deskjet brand exist, {{starting with the}} HP Deskjet F380 printer/scanner/copier, introduced in 2006, using HP Vivera inks, and offering <b>print</b> <b>speeds</b> of 20 ppm in black-and-white, and 14 ppm in color.|$|R
50|$|The StyleWriter 1200 was {{the third}} of Apple's line of inkjet serial printers, {{released}} after the StyleWriter II. Based on the same Canon engine, this model had faster <b>printing</b> <b>speed</b> than its predecessor, but used the same ink cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|The StyleWriter II {{replaced}} the original. This model, {{based on a}} Canon engine, had twice the memory of its predecessor and double the <b>printing</b> <b>speed.</b> The enclosure was restyled in Apple's [...] "neoclassical" [...] design language of the time.|$|R

[...] At the same time, M3D also announced a 2017 version of the original Micro 3D Printer, the Micro+, which differs by having an ARM-core processor, enabling double the <b>print</b> <b>speed,</b> and better third party software integration, according to one article.|$|E
50|$|The Silentype's many {{dramatic}} {{advantages over}} other printers at the time, including silent operation, very small size, <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> and reliability, were especially well-suited {{for its use}} in the nascent point-of-sale and hospitality industries. The Silentype was the first printer {{to be used in}} any restaurant as a point-of-sale remote requisition printer to speed service. The broadening use of printers in the hospitality industry subsequently {{played a key role in}} the advancement of efficiency throughout the hospitality industry worldwide. The typical point-of-sale hospitality printer in use today, thirty years later, is a thermal printer that still mimics the way the Silentype was used when it was introduced in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|... 7501 and 7502 used 132-column, dot-matrix {{printers}} with {{a serial}} interface. Different <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> options were {{offered by the}} various models. Most common were the 7574 (Drico), or 7576 models but legacy devices such as the [...] "Termiprinter" [...] could also be attached. In later years, more capable printers such as the Okidata Microline series became available. The 7503 was often connected to a card reader/punch and a medium-speed line printer, but as its popularity declined the 7502 became available with the bought-in PBS [...] "Band Printer" [...] with 360 or 720 lines per minute printing speed. This connectivity was {{a consequence of the}} 7502's implementation on the [...] "Slow X2 Highway" [...] bus system, which was also found in the 2900 Series DCU.|$|E
50|$|The <b>printing</b> <b>speed</b> {{of serial}} dot matrix {{printers}} with moving heads varies from 30 to 1550 cps. In contrast to this, line matrix printers {{are capable of}} printing much more than 1000 cps, resulting in a throughput of up to 800 pages/hour.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Print</b> <b>speeds</b> for large-format piezo {{printers}} using aqueous {{dye sublimation}} ink continue to increase. Speeds range from 18 square meters per hour {{in a smaller}} 44" [...] wide printer to over 3,000 square meters per hour in a high-speed industrial textile printer.|$|R
50|$|Recent designs have {{performed}} complex optimizations in the magnetic circuit, and eliminated unwanted resonances in the spring. The {{result was a}} near-doubling of speed. Other improvements {{include the use of}} electrical discharge machining to produce complex, three-dimensional hammers that trade-off the magnetic circuit, mechanical resonances, and <b>printing</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To {{simplify the}} design of {{peripheral}} devices, these relied on the processor. The card reader had no memory buffers, but instead gave the CPU a level-zero (highest priority) interrupt after each individual column of the card had been read. If the CPU did not respond and store the twelve bits of data before another such interrupt indicated that the next column had been read, data would be lost. Similarly, the 1132 printer relied on software on the 1130. When a letter such as [...] came into position, the CPU had to analyze a buffered line of text and assemble an array of bits that would indicate to the 1132 which print positions should be printed with [...] If the CPU could not respond before the [...] rotated out of position, <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> would be severely degraded.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "on fire" [...] message {{probably}} {{originated in}} the late 1950s, when high speed computerized printing was still a somewhat experimental field. The first documented fire-starting printer was a Stromberg-Carlson 5000 xerographic printer (similar to a modern laser printer, but with a CRT as the light source instead of a laser), installed around 1959 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and modified with an extended fusing oven to achieve a <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> of one page per second. In {{the event of a}} printing stall, and occasionally during normal operation, the fusing oven would heat paper to combustion. This fire risk was aggravated by the fact that if the printer continued to operate, it would essentially stoke the oven with fresh paper at high speed. There is, however, no evidence of the [...] "lp0 on fire" [...] message appearing in any software of the time.|$|E
5000|$|Solvent inks: The main {{ingredient}} of these inks are {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks {{is that they are}} comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high <b>print</b> <b>speed</b> of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a combination of heaters and blowers. The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub-categories: hard solvent ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while Mild or [...] "Eco" [...] solvent inks, while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild solvent inks have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.|$|E
