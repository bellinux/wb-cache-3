5000|$|Psycho Paul Nevin (Ryan Pope): {{originally}} a rival dealer to Moz, Psycho Paul now works with Cartoon Head. He appears in series {{one as a}} more violent and successful dealer. Shortly after PC busts Psycho Paul and gives all his weed to Moz, Psycho Paul finds Moz and threatens him with a <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver</b> until the weed is returned. Throughout the show, Psycho Paul bullies Moz (or [...] "Morris", as he calls him), often slapping him and pressuring him into helping him out with his plots. Paul gives up dealing {{in order to move}} into the shadier and more lucrative worlds of kidnapping, pornography and other gangster activities. Moz doesnt want to get involved in his plans but finds it difficult to refuse Psycho Paul without causing offence and thus risking repercussions. In series five he becomes the leader of a rival gang with Steve and Xavier to the triad and they move into human trafficking, this leads to them helping Nikoli into the country with his helper, believing them to be young Russian girls who they can put to work for them when they turn Steves flat into a brothel. Psycho Paul also always carries his trademark <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver</b> until later into the show when he upgrades to an electric screwdriver.|$|E

25|$|By 1940, Cadillac sales {{had risen}} tenfold {{compared}} to 1934. In 1936, Dreystadt released the Series 60 as Cadillac's {{entry into the}} mid-priced vehicle market. It {{was replaced by the}} Series 61 in 1939, but a popular model that was derived from it, the Sixty Special, continued through 1993. Another factor helped boost Cadillac growth over the next few years: a revolution in assembly line technology. In 1934, Henry F. Phillips introduced the <b>Phillips</b> screw and <b>screwdriver</b> to the market. He entered into talks with General Motors and convinced the Cadillac group that his new screws would speed assembly times and therefore increase profits. Cadillac was the first automaker to use the Phillips technology in 1937, which was widely adopted in 1940. For {{the first time in many}} years all cars built by the company shared the same basic engine and drivetrain in 1941.|$|R

Although the drawing is by chance, the children who draw the higher prizes are applauded. Apart from the prizes drawn from the vessel, some prizes are calculated from the winning numbers (view the table with prizes above).|$|E
5000|$|Phillips {{screwdrivers}} come {{in several}} standard sizes, ranging from tiny [...] "jeweler's" [...] {{to those used}} for automobile frame assembly—or #000 to #4 respectively. This size number is usually stamped onto the shank (shaft) or handle for identification. Each bit size fits a range of screw sizes, more or less well. Each <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver</b> size also has a related shank diameter. The driver has a 57° point and tapered, unsharp (rounded) flutes. The #1 and smaller bits come to a blunt point, but the #2 and above have no point, but rather a nearly squared-off tip, making each size incompatible with the other.|$|E
50|$|GeoTrax {{train set}} layouts come in beginner, intermediate, {{advanced}} and expert levels, and are built around playset Rail, Construction, Rescue, Elevation and Air and Sea focal point toys. GeoTrax's appeal {{is due in}} part to the number of possible track configurations that can be created with interchangeable track and playsets. GeoTrax is known for its Snap-Lock track which can be locked together or taken apart to create a multitude of track configurations. Layouts can be set up flat or using elevated tracks, and can incorporate curves, ramps and bridges. Some adult assembly is needed to build the track layouts. The assembly process sometimes involves using a <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver</b> and snapping tracks together to create multiple play levels. Users can learn to build a number of prescribed layouts by visiting the GeoTrax site which shows pieces and sets used in each layout and printable pictures of the layouts.|$|E
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the knurled adjustment nut. Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 Phillips head screws as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the hose barbs, if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the hose barbs, be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample hose is wrapped with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c.

5000|$|When Lile was {{approached}} with the specifications for the [...] "Rambo" [...] knife, {{he was told}} to design it not as a mere [...] "prop" [...] but as a basic tool to perform a variety of tasks. Lile adapted a basic clip point Bowie knife which could be used to chop wood and slice food while retaining an edge. He employed a waterproof hollow handle design to store matches, needles, thread, and a compass; the hollow-handle allows the knife to be fitted to a pole to make a spear or gig. The handle was wrapped with nylon line {{that could be used for}} fishing or making snares. The tips on the guards were made into a standard and <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver</b> and the spine was serrated. Lile chose to forge the blade of 440C high-carbon steel, which he claimed could cut through the fuselage of an aircraft. There is talk amongst the elders here in Russellville, Arkansas, Pope County from Old Timers that knew Lile and his employees that one of his employees named Louis Evans actually came up with the idea of the RAMBO styled knife but Lile took credit for it since he owned the business.|$|E
40|$|David Peace’s novel Nineteen Seventy-seven {{concludes with}} the hack {{journalist}} Jack Whitehead being granted a terrifying apocalyptic vision, seconds {{before he is}} trepanned with a <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver</b> by the sinister Reverend Martin Laws. Included in this vision is a curious reference to {{the wreck of the}} White Ship, a maritime disaster in 1120 that drowned William Atheling, heir to the English throne, and ultimately doomed England to years of civil war. This article explores Peace’s strange use of the shipwreck in his “Red Riding Quartet,” particularly the way he links it—in the quartet’s final volume, Nineteen Eighty Three—to a revisionist account of the aftermath of the crucifixion that leads a wounded Christ to a tragic death in the cold waters of the English Channel...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Instillation of {{contrast}} medium into stab wounds has shown promising results regarding visibility {{and assessment of}} general stab direction with computed tomography. However, the accuracy of this method [...] and, incidentally also probing of stab wounds [...] has to our knowledge not previously been examined. Also the effect of bluntness of different stabbing objects on the examination of stab wounds was not considered before this study. METHODS Using a pocket-knife, a steak-knife, and a <b>Phillips</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> nine stab wounds each were inflicted to three pork haunches. The depths of the stab wounds were determined by probing and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) after instillation of a contrast medium (CM) and then compared to those observed by dissection, our internal "gold standard". RESULTS In stab wounds inflicted by knives, MSCT-CM and probing provided results which differed by roughly 10 - 11...|$|E

This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|E
