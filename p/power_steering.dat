5|$|Schumacher {{moved up}} a {{position}} as he passed Button for fifth position at turn three on the same lap. On lap twenty-eight, Trulli drove back to his garage to retire with a hydraulics failure that was caused by his <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> becoming heavy during the safety car period. Vettel set a new fastest lap of the race of 1:54.098, extending his lead over Alonso to 3.5 seconds. Button, who was under pressure from Hülkenberg and Kubica, made a pit stop {{at the end of}} lap twenty-eight for intermediate tyres and rejoined in fifteenth place. Kovalainen was sent into a spin by Buemi, having been passed by Petrov two laps later.|$|E
5|$|The {{base engine}} was {{a version of}} the older Simca Type 180 2.0-litre with {{increased}} displacement, as also featured in the Matra Murena. It was unrelated to either the American Chrysler K or PSA Douvrin 2.2-litre engines. Available trim levels were designated GL and GLS. The GL was the only model to feature the four-speed manual transmission, and have <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> as an option as opposed to standard. It was first to be dropped, for the 1983 model year.|$|E
5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the <b>Power</b> <b>Steering</b> Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} equipment includes a <b>powered</b> <b>steering</b> on four wheels at the front, a central tyre-pressure inflation system, an {{anti-lock braking system}} and an NBC defensive/protective system {{but there are also}} many other options for fitted equipment and vehicle gear available.|$|R
50|$|Large steam-powered {{warships}} with {{manual steering}} needed huge crews {{to turn the}} rudder rapidly. The Royal Navy once used 78 men hauling on block and tackle gear to manually turn the rudder on HMS Minotaur, in a test of manual vs. steam <b>powered</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} equipment of the BTR-3U also includes hydraulically amplified <b>powered</b> <b>steering</b> {{on the front}} four road wheels and a central tire-pressure regulation system that allows the driver to adjust the tire-pressure to suit the terrain being crossed. The BTR-3U is fitted with French Michelin tires.|$|R
5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric variable gear ratio <b>power</b> <b>steering,</b> and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E
5|$|Several cars {{suffered}} issues {{during the}} second safety car period. Nicki Thiim brought the No. 95 Aston Martin from the LMGTE Pro lead straight to the team's garage with a leaking <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> system, handing the class lead to its sister No. 99 Aston Martin. Christian Ried in the No. 88 Proton Porsche suffered an engine fire in the second Mulsanne Straight chicane, extending the safety car period as it was tended to. KCMG retained their LMP2 class lead ahead of the TDS Racing car while behind the safety car, while the sole Corvette, No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari, and two circulating Aston Martin vehicles were nose to tail in LMGTE Pro, continuing their battle after the safety car period ended. Oliver Gavin's Corvette eventually {{pulled away from the}} rest of the LMGTE Pro field. The Riley Viper relinquished its lead in LMGTE Am to the No. 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and the SMP Ferrari driven by François Perrodo. As the safety car period ended the No. 17 Porsche of Hartley held the race lead, but Albuquerque was in pursuit in the No. 9 Audi, breaking the Le Mans lap record with a time of three minutes and 17.647 seconds. The No. 9 Audi was able to mount a better challenge to the leading Porsche, and René Rast was able to take the race lead after pit stops.|$|E

25|$|The F30 is {{the first}} {{generation}} of 3 Series to be powered by a range of turbocharged engines exclusively and electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> (replacing the hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> systems used previously). The F30 also marked the 3 Series' first use of a three-cylinder engine in its 2015 facelift. A new plug-in hybrid F30 model was also introduced in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|When the Hydractive system worked, {{the result}} was a big car with a smooth [...] "magic carpet" [...] ride, and better {{handling}} than many smaller, lighter, sports cars. When it didn't work, it was quite harsh and bumpy, although no worse than any contemporary high-performance sports sedan. However, right-hand drive XMs were never fitted with the DIRAVI variable fully <b>powered</b> <b>steering</b> of the CX, having an almost conventional DIRASS power-assisted setup.|$|R

25|$|Taihō had two rudders {{positioned}} {{along the}} longitudinal center-line of the ship: a semi-balanced main rudder (so-called because {{a portion of}} the rudder comes before the hinged axis and therefore requires less force to turn) located astern and an unbalanced auxiliary rudder forward of the main rudder. Both were turned via electro-hydraulically <b>powered</b> <b>steering</b> gears, but the auxiliary rudder could also be turned via a diesel engine in the event the primary steering gear was damaged.|$|R
25|$|Components of the SM {{lived on}} — in the Maserati Merak (engine, transmission) and the Lotus Esprit (transmission (both mirror image)). The {{successful}} Citroën CX carried forward {{most of the}} SM's dynamic qualities, including the trendsetting speed sensitive <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the model year, variable-ratio <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> and power drum brakes were {{optional}} equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.|$|E
25|$|Lamborghini {{recalled}} about 1,500 Gallardo Coupé and Spyder models, from model years 2004 to 2006, {{because of}} the possibility of <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> fluid leaking and the risk of fire. The cars were built from May 2003 through April 2008.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study tracked vehicle {{adopting}} different steering mechanism, we use <b>steering</b> <b>power</b> ratio to evaluate its performance. The influencing factors of <b>steering</b> <b>power</b> ratio have been theoretically studied. And we designed the experimental prototype to test. We find that <b>steering</b> <b>power</b> ratio {{is related to}} vehicle parameters, resistance coefficient, turning radius, skid ratio, slip ratio and steering coefficient not only, but also it is related to soil parameters (including soil cohesion, internal friction angle of soil and shear modulus of soil). On the condition that vehicle parameters and resistance coefficient are determined, the soil shear tests were carried out, which acquired that the average moisture content of soil is 16. 85 %，soil cohesion is 14. 071 Kpa, internal friction angle of soil is 17. 93 °, and shear modulus of soil is 0. 00027 m. Through being researched, <b>steering</b> <b>power</b> ratio is related to turning radius, skid ratio and slip ratio, which has the important significance {{on the study of}} <b>steering</b> <b>power</b> ratio...|$|R
50|$|The First Win {{is powered}} by a Cummins diesel engine (300HP in the {{original}} configuration, 250HP in the E version) coupled with an Allison 3000 SP automatic transmission (Allison 2500 SP in the E version., providing maximum road speed of up to 100 km/h. The vehicle comes standard with <b>powered</b> <b>steering,</b> independent suspensions and run-flat tyres. Ballistic protection is up to STANAG 4569 Level II and mine protection to Level 3b under the hull centre and Level 4a under any station.|$|R
25|$|Differential braking (or braked differential) systems {{remove the}} {{clutches}} {{on the track}} and add a differential on the transmission output. The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining <b>powered.</b> <b>Steering</b> is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|R
25|$|Another handling-related {{improvement}} was optional variable-ratio <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b> Rather than a fixed ratio of 17.5:1, requiring four turns lock-to-lock, {{the new system}} varied its ratio from 14.6:1 to 18.9:1, needing 3.5 turns lock-to-lock. Turning diameter was reduced from 40.9feet (12.5m) to 37.4feet (11.4m).|$|E
25|$|The eight {{wheels are}} located as two sets, with two pairs {{at the front}} of the hull and two pairs at the rear. Split side doors are located between these two sets of wheels. The two forward pairs of wheels are {{utilized}} with <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b>|$|E
25|$|Styling {{changes were}} minimal in 1951 and 1952. <b>Power</b> <b>steering</b> was added {{as an option}} in 1952 and {{horsepower}} climbed to 170 thanks primarily to a new four-barrel carburetor. Sales continued to slide falling to about 66,000 in 1951 and to 51,000 in 1952.|$|E
50|$|All models come {{standard}} with enhanced Vehicle Stability Control which immediately alters electric <b>powering</b> <b>steering</b> assist w/traction control (hybrids come standard with VDIM), anti-lock brakes, brake assist {{and electronic}} brakeforce distribution. Also standard is a tire pressure monitor, a driver's knee airbag, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, side curtain airbags {{for all three}} rows which includes a rollover sensor and active front headrests. Hill Start Assist Control (HAC) is also standard which prevents rolling backwards on slopes, and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) is standard on AWD trims.|$|R
50|$|ATF is {{also used}} as a {{hydraulic}} fluid in some <b>power</b> assisted <b>steering</b> systems, as a lubricant in some 4WD transfer cases, and in some modern manual transmissions.|$|R
