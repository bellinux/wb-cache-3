25|$|Although the {{interrupting}} read {{may be to}} any active bank, a <b>precharge</b> command {{will only}} interrupt the read burst {{if it is to}} the same bank or all banks; a <b>precharge</b> command to a different bank will not interrupt a read burst.|$|E

40|$|In this {{investigation}} a stable high manganese austenitic steel, 0. 45 C- 17 Mn- 2. 8 Al, {{has been studied}} for hydrogen embrittlement using cathodically <b>precharged</b> specimens. Tensile testing of axisymmetric and plane strain specimens <b>precharged</b> with hydrogen show an appreciable loss of 8 - 10 % reduction in area (RA) whereas the loss in % elongation is lesser. The true fracture strain decreased from 0. 88 to 0. 73 for axisymmetric and from 0. 79 to 0. 60 for plane strain specimens. Hydrogen <b>precharging</b> is observed to result in decrease of CTOD at crack initiation by about 0. 07 mm {{and a decrease in}} crack tip fracture strain for crack initiation from 0. 53 to 0. 34. The greater effect of hydrogen <b>precharging</b> thus observed is attributed to existence of higher stress triaxiality in CTOD and plane strain tensile testing in comparison to axisymmetric one. On SEM examination of fracture surfaces the uncharged tensile specimens showed only dimpled fracture, the <b>precharged</b> specimens showed transition from dimpled to quasicleavage and intergranular fracture near the surface. Regions close to the pre-fatigue tip in CTOD specimens depict intergranular fracture. The fractographic changes are attributed to the combined role of stress intensity and hydrogen concentration variation arising out of hydrogen transport inside the specimen...|$|R
25|$|A read, burst terminate, or <b>precharge</b> command may {{be issued}} {{at any time}} after a read command, and will {{interrupt}} the read burst after the configured CAS latency.

[...] A <b>precharge</b> may be commanded explicitly, or it may be performed automatically at the conclusion of a read or write operation.

2500|$|Although {{refreshing}} a row is {{an automatic}} {{side effect of}} activating it, there is a minimum time for this to happen, which requires a minimum row access time tRAS delay between an active command opening a row, and the corresponding <b>precharge</b> command closing it.

40|$|United Technologies Corporation is {{developing}} the ElectroCore technology for multi-pollutant control on coal fired {{power plants and}} other applications.

The modeling has successfully predicted pilot separation efficiency trends and the 98 – 99 % particulate separation efficiency achieved in the latest pilot tests.

2500|$|Although {{normally}} a segment is Restored {{to the same}} memory address as it was Prefetched from, the channel buffers may {{also be used for}} very efficient copying or clearing of large, aligned memory blocks. [...] (The use of quarter-row segments is driven by the fact that DRAM cells are narrower than SRAM cells. [...] The SRAM bits are designed to be 4 DRAM bits wide, and are conveniently connected to one of the 4 DRAM bits they straddle.) [...] Additional commands prefetch a pair of segments to a pair of channels, and an optional command combines prefetch, read, and <b>precharge</b> to reduce the overhead of random reads.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prefetch}} architecture {{takes advantage}} of the specific characteristics of memory accesses to DRAM. Typical DRAM memory operations involve three phases: bitline <b>precharge,</b> row access, column access. Row access is the heart of a read operation, as it involves the careful sensing of the tiny signals in DRAM memory cells; it is the slowest phase of memory operation. However, once a row is read, subsequent column accesses to that same row can be very quick, as the sense amplifiers also act as latches. For reference, a row of a 1 Gbit DDR3 device is 2,048 bits wide, so internally 2,048 bits are read into 2,048 separate sense amplifiers during the row access phase. [...] Row accesses might take 50 ns, depending on the speed of the DRAM, whereas column accesses off an open row are less than 10 ns.|$|E

40|$|As {{technology}} scales {{down into}} deepsubmicron, leakage energy {{is becoming a}} dominant source of energy consumption. Leakage energy is generally proportional {{to the area of}} a circuit and caches constitute {{a large portion of the}} die area. Therefore, there has been much effort to reduce leakage energy in caches. Most techniques have been targeted at cell leakage energy optimization. Bitline leakage energy also is critical. Thus, we propose a predictive <b>precharging</b> scheme to reduce bitline leakage energy. Results show that energy savings are significant with little performance degradation. Also, our predictive <b>precharging</b> is more beneficial in more aggressively scaled technologies...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} tasks of this project is to design and {{fabricate}} an Advanced ElectroCore field prototype system. The system is designed to handle 5, 000 acfm of exhaust gas from a coal-fired power plant. The system consists of the Advanced ElectroCore module, a water-cooled <b>precharger</b> and a dry scrubber. The system is shown in Figure 1. LSR has completed the design drawings for the ElectroCore module and the water-cooled <b>precharger.</b> The design drawings for the dry scrubber are nearly complete.

It now looks like this task will be finished by mid-October thereby putting the project about two months behind schedule. Much of the delay is due to design changes that will make this field prototype easier to transport and erect. These changes will make the unit much more valuable as an ElectroCore system sales tool {{at the end of this}} project...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to refresh a RAM chip by opening and closing (activating and <b>precharging)</b> each row in each bank. However, to simplify the memory controller, SDRAM chips support an [...] "auto refresh" [...] command, which performs these operations to one row in each bank simultaneously. The SDRAM also maintains an internal counter, which iterates over all possible rows. The memory controller must simply issue {{a sufficient number of}} auto refresh commands (one per row, 4096 in the example we have been using) every refresh interval (tREF = 64 ms is a common value). All banks must be idle (closed, <b>precharged)</b> when this command is issued.|$|R

We find that a generator design relying entirely on standard silicon-on-insulator(SOI) micromachining is conceivable and analyze its performance by simulations.

A full electromechanical lumped-model including parasitic capacitances of the switches is built to capture the dynamic of the generator.
