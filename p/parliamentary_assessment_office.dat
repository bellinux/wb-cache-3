40|$|Nowadays {{more than}} ever, dealing with risky {{scientific}} and technological issues requires careful attention and sustained policy-making support. In Western Europe, since the 1980 s onwards, science and technology (S&T) issues are addressed in the institutional arena of <b>Parliamentary</b> Technology <b>Assessment</b> (PTA) <b>offices.</b> The main function of those PTAs {{is to increase the}} democratic accountability of S&T governance by providing the policy-makers and some stakeholders with intelligence on technological innovations and/or by enhancing social debate. Being based on literature research, participatory observation, official document analysis and qualitative data collection (through semi-structured interviews with academics and TA practitioners), we claim that the emergence and development of <b>Parliamentary</b> Technology <b>Assessment</b> <b>offices</b> (PTAs), leading/supposed to lead to an increased democratic accountability, embody a relevant indication of S&T governance becoming more reflexive. We offer case studies of several European PTAs and we are particularly interested in how much reflexivity is visible. After formulating two main dimensions of (reflexive) governance of S&T, openness to plurality and blurring of boundaries, we map the paths of these institutions over time along these two dimensions. Then, we argue than {{there appears to be a}} reflexivity pathway, on which some PTAs have moved farther than others. The empirical evidence for such a pathway to exist reveals the multiple features of democratic accountability fostered by one PTA setting or another, which may range from a managerial outcome (decision-makers are accountable) to a public outcome (citizens are accountable) and a professional outcome (scientists are accountable).

40|$|Ulrich Beck’s {{diagnosis}} of reflexive modernization, undermining high modernity since the 1980 s, {{has been widely}} discussed, {{there have been few}} attempts to map and analyse these complex processes empirically in order to show reflexive modernization in action. Being based on literature research, participatory observation, official document analysis and qualitative data collection (through interviews), we claim that the emergence and developement of <b>Parliamentary</b> Technology <b>Assessment</b> <b>offices</b> (PTAs), to address science and technology (S&T) issues and to provide intelligence on technological innovations, embody a relevant indication of our Western modernity becoming more reflexive. We offer case studies of PTAs and we are particularly interested in how much reflexivity is visible. After formulating two main dimensions of reflexive modernization, openness to plurality and blurring of boundaries, we map the paths of these institutions over time along these two dimensions. There appears to be a reflexivity pathway, on which some PTAs have moved farther than others. This is due to various institutional and external factors like the socio-technical landscape, the power of lobbies, the cultural meanings and traditions, the historical processes or the structure and the state of the innovation regime that can affect the way institutionalised TA may embrace a more or less reflexive approach. More broadly speaking, we will consider that S&T are linked to issues that have global (but unequal) effects, while they are addressed by different local and institutional settings. Our concluding remarks will rely on Eisenstadt’s concept of multiple modernities to test our research’s validity in non European contexts, especially Latin America. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} and evolutions of <b>Parliamentary</b> Technology <b>Assessment</b> <b>offices</b> (PTAs) are {{an indication}} of our Western modernity becoming more reflexive. This perspective sheds light on recent evolution of PTAs, but also contributes to the discussion of reflexive modernization generally. Ulrich Beck’s diagnosis of reflexive modernization, undermining high modernity since the 1980 s, has been widely discussed, {{but there have been}} few attempts to map and analyse these complex processes empirically in order to show reflexive modernization in action (Delvenne and Rip 2009). From that perspective, reflexive modernization is seen as a challenge for the institutions of modernity. PTAs are recent institutions that had to span boundaries from the beginning, and might thus have more incentives to follow reflexive modernization {{while at the same time}} their progression will be bounded by strong modernist institutional patterns or elements of political culture. We offer case studies of European PTAs based on literature research, participatory observation, official document analysis and qualitative data collection (through semi-structured interviews with academics and TA practitioners). We are particularly interested in how much reflexivity is visible in their institutional path. After formulating two main dimensions of reflexive modernization, openness to plurality and blurring of boundaries, we map the paths of these institutions over time along these two dimensions. There appears to be an overall reflexivity pathway, on which some PTAs have moved farther than others, but their progress is fractured by the resilience of modern institutions. This is due to various institutional factors ¬— like the link with a Parliament — and external factors — like the dynamics of institutionalisation, the cultural meanings and traditions, the historical processes or the structure and the state of the innovation regime — all of which affect the way institutionalised TA embraces a more or less reflexive approach. The identification of an overall reflexivity pathway allows us to highlight new trends in (<b>parliamentary)</b> Technology <b>Assessment</b> as not just interesting ad-hoc novel approaches, but as indications of a new and broader generation of TA.

5000|$|The Environmental Assessment Act is {{enforced}} by the provincial government of British Columbia and by the British Columbia Environmental <b>Assessment</b> <b>Office.</b> Under this act, the proposed development is not to occur or progress until an environmental certificate is authorized by the Environmental <b>Assessment</b> <b>Office,</b> when classified as a [...] "reviewable project". [...] If a project is designated to occur on treaty land, even with {{the authority of the}} Environmental <b>Assessment</b> <b>Office</b> no development is to occur until consent is given by the treaty First Nations band, and if authorization is not granted, the project will be stopped from operating on said treaty land. When determining a need for an environmental assessment certificate, the executive director may determine that the project may proceed without an assessment certificate, in the conditions that no adverse environmental, social, or cultural damage would occur. [...] The executive director can also call for the need of an environmental assessment if he or she determines that there would be adverse effects on cultural, social, or other significant environmental factors. The executive director essentially has a lot of control under the determination of environmental assessments, including determining the hazard ratio of reviewable projects under his or her expertise. The executive director also would advise the proponent of their decision and for required documentation for him or her to make their final decision. All environmental assessment agreements with the federal or other provincial governments will be made through the provincial minister of British Columbia and can be approved or denied by the minister. [...] With written notice by the minister, any individual holding consent of the minister may enter a reviewable site and inspect it as guided by the sanctions of the provincial Environmental Assessment Act. [...] If a proponent begins with the operation of their project, the Environmental Assessment Act along with the Environmental <b>Assessment</b> <b>Office</b> has the authority to dismantle, modify, or cease the continuance of this project, as set forth by the laws included with this assessment act. If a said project goes forward without the consent of the Environmental <b>Assessment</b> <b>Office,</b> the minister may apply to the Supreme court to enforce the decision of the Environmental <b>Assessment</b> <b>Office</b> in accordance with the Environmental Assessment Act. [...] If the proponent does not cease their acts that are not in compliance with rule 41, they may be liable to pay $100,000 on their first offence, $200,000 on their subsequent offences if a corporation, $100,000 (plus 6 months of jail time)/$200,000 (plus 12 months of jail time) for subsequent offences for individuals.|$|R
