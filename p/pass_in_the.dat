5|$|Snake Pass is a hill <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Derbyshire {{section of}} the Peak District, {{crossing}} the Pennines between Glossop and the Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton.

5|$|Adamle {{attended}} Ohio State University {{and was on}} the 1942 Ohio State Buckeyes freshman team, {{but left}} school prior to the 1943 season to fight in World War II. After serving in the U.S. Air Force in the Mediterranean Theatre of War, he returned to Ohio State for the team's 1946 season—his only season with the varsity Buckeyes. Playing as a center in a November game against the Northwestern Wildcats, Adamle intercepted a Frank Aschenbrenner <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter and returned it 38 yards. He had another interception {{in the fourth quarter of}} the 39–27 Buckeyes victory. Ohio State finished the season with a 4–3–2 record and Adamle was selected to play in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country.|$|E

Alabama then closed the first half with an 11-play, 93-yard drive capped with a four-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 28–14 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|After the {{terrorist}} attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001, the NDA government passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The aim of the act was to improve the government's {{ability to deal with}} terrorism. It initially failed to <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rajya Sabha; therefore, the NDA took the extraordinary step of convening a joint session of the Parliament, where the numerical superior Lok Sabha allowed the bill to pass. The act was subsequently used to prosecute hundreds of people accused of terrorism. However, it was criticised by opposition parties and scholars for being an infringement upon civil liberties, and the National Human Rights Commission stated that it had been used to target Muslims. It was later repealed by the Congress-led UPA government in 2004.|$|E

5|$|As {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons {{and in particular the}} Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail <b>Pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied the valley and plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E
5|$|At home {{in front}} of 75,321 fans, the Giants played the Washington Redskins in Week 8. Each team totaled 16 first downs, four punts and five penalties, and the {{difference}} in time of possession was less than one minute. However, the Giants committed no turnovers while coercing three from the Redskins. Giants cornerback Everson Walls intercepted two passes—including one that he returned for his first career touchdown—and free safety Greg Jackson intercepted another. Walls' interception set up a Giants touchdown and a 14–0 lead in the second quarter. Jackson then intercepted a <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone {{in the third quarter}} to preserve a 14–10 lead, and Walls returned his second interception 28yards for a touchdown that made the score 21–10 and put the game of reach in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|Besides the budget, another {{measure that}} failed to <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} {{the death penalty for}} juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v. Kentucky, wherein the court ruled that Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} a <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes. Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central America, examples include the Papagayo wind, the Panama wind, and the Tehuano wind. In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral. When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the compulsory {{adoption of the}} metric system after a two-year permissive period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the metric system compulsory in order to enable the British industrial base to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E
5|$|In June 1897 President McKinley {{signed the}} treaty of {{annexation}} for the Republic of Hawaii, but it failed to <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by a commission of Native Hawaiian delegates consisting of James Keauiluna Kaulia, David Kalauokalani, William Auld, and John Richardson. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because they were asking for restoration of the Queen. The petitions were used {{as evidence of the}} strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by a joint resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, {{the most}} {{prominent}} fight was over {{the need for a}} strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent {{in order to reduce the}} federal government's surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House, which was controlled by Democrats.|$|E
5|$|On defense, Virginia Tech's Jayron Hosley {{tied the}} school record for interceptions (9) {{and had the}} most in the nation that season when he caught an Andrew Luck <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half.

5|$|Pinkham Notch (elevation 2032ft. / 619 m) is a {{mountain}} <b>pass</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains of north-central New Hampshire, United States. The notch {{is a result}} of extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age. Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial U-shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah ranges. Due to the volatility of the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the notch.|$|E
