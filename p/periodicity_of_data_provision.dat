40|$|The {{delivery}} <b>of</b> <b>data</b> in pervasive {{systems has}} to deal with end host mobility. One problem is how to create appropriate, applicationlevel <b>data</b> <b>provisioning</b> topologies, termed <b>data</b> brokers, to best match underlying network connectivity, end user locations, and the locales of their network access. Another problem is how to balance workloads in such overlay networks, in response to mobility and to changes in available processing and communication resources. This paper improves the performance <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>provisioning</b> by dynamically changing broker topologies and end users' assignments to brokers. Specifically, using publish /subscribe as a communication paradigm, a new abstraction, termed an opportunistic event channel, enables dynamic broker creation, deletion, and movement. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the ability of opportunistic channels to optimize event delivery and processing when end users move across di#erent network access points. The technique is to `opportunistically' follow network-level hando#s across network access points with application-level hando#s of a user's broker functionality to a new, `closer' broker. The potential load imbalances across brokers caused by such hando#s are also addressed...|$|R

These simulations are illustrative in nature because the process of appropriate database development and model specification for a comprehensive and accurate analysis of climate change policy issues for Scotland, while advanced relative to many regional (and even national) economies, is still in its very early stages. One of the key objectives of this project is to illustrate the potential value-added to Scotland's analytical capacity if further investment is made (by both the policy community, particularly in terms <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>provision,</b> and the research community, with public support, for example by seeking support from the research councils) in developing an appropriate CGE modelling framework...|$|R

40|$|Many {{environmental}} problems are large scale {{in terms of}} geographical units and long-term with regard to time. We therefore find a coincidence of different causes and impacts that qualify the interplay between humans and nature as highly uncertain (“transparency challenge”). In consequence we see a need for innovative analytical methods and modelling approaches to supplement the traditional monitoring-based approach in environmental policy. This should allow capturing different degrees of uncertainty which in general is out of power of any monitoring activity. Moreover, {{with regard to the}} design of monitoring approaches it requires collecting and connecting data from different fields of social activities in regard of a divergence of natural and social systems’ boundaries. This requires the provision of sufficient, frequently huge data sets (“availability challenge”) that need to fit with each other (“compatibility challenge”). Even if these challenges are met data processing remains a very complex and time-consuming task which should be supported by a user-friendly infrastructure. We here see a comparative advantage in using the GIS technology and a nested structure for <b>data</b> <b>provision</b> supporting the up and down scaling of information and the access <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from different perspectives (“connectivity challenge”) - a polluters, a victims and a regulators point of view.

40|$|During {{the last}} five years higher {{education}} research in Germany seems to be in a significant upturn. This is a side effect partly of the obvious boom of empirical educational research in general and partly of the reform movement that has affected the German higher education system since middle of the 1990 s. The demand for data in the field of higher education will increase considerably in future. The available data infrastructure for higher education research in Germany consists of two complementary main sources: on the one hand the official higher education statistics, on the other hand survey-based research. All in all, there are no serious or principle obstacles to access to the available data stock.
