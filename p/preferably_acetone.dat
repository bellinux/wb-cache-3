50|$|After the {{reactants}} {{have been}} weighed {{out in the}} required amounts, they are mixed. For manual mixing of small quantities, usually an agate mortar and pestle are employed. Sufficient amount of some volatile organic liquid - <b>preferably</b> <b>acetone</b> or alcohol - {{is added to the}} mixture to aid homogenization. This forms a paste which is mixed thoroughly. During the process of grinding and mixing, the organic liquid gradually volatilizes and has usually evaporated completely after 10 to 15 minutes. For quantities much larger than ~20g, mechanical mixing is usually adopted using a ball mill and the process may take several hours.|$|E

This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with structure, thermodynamic and kinetic aspects {{of a variety of}} inclusion compounds which contain small organic guests. The host compounds studied are alkaline-earth metal salts of O,O’-dibenzoyl-(2 R, 3 R) -tartraric acid (magnesium, calcium and strontium), 1, 1 ’-bis-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) cyclohexane (DHPC) and 2, 2 ’-dihydroxy- 1, 1 ’-binaphthyl (BINAP). The alkaline-earth metal salts form coordination complexes with 2 -methoxyethanol, water or ethanol and the guests act {{as a part of the}} coordination sphere of the metal ions. The diol host DHPC preferably forms layer type inclusion compounds with the isomers of picoline, lutidine and xylidine, as well as a number of selected solvents including 1, 4 -dioxane, DMSO, morpholine, THF and <b>acetone,</b> <b>preferably</b> in channel type inclusion modes. In the latter two classes of inclusion compounds the inclusion is facilitated by the formation of hydrogen bonds from the host hydroxyl moieties to the guests...|$|R
