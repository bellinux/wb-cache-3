In sexually {{reproducing}} fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, anastomosis, {{is required for the}} initiation of the sexual cycle.

5|$|For {{the first}} few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their <b>parents</b> <b>do.</b> Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E

5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E

Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E

Santana makes a rare apology to Finn in the school hallway, but her so-called apology consists of a series of insults. As she walks away, Finn retaliates by telling her {{to come out of the}} closet, and calls her a coward for constantly tearing others down while not accepting herself and her relationship with Brittany. A couple of days later, Santana is told by Sue and Burt that the niece of one of their opponents in the election overheard the conversation between her and Finn, and said opponent is about to release an attack ad that criticizes Sue for choosing a lesbian as head cheerleader. Santana runs out of the office in tears, saying that her <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not yet know she is gay. The episode concludes with the Troubletones' mash-up of Adele songs. The moment the performance ends, Santana jumps down from the stage, blames Finn for outing her to the world and slaps him in the face.|$|E

5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling has dried out. The <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E

25|$|All other {{approaches}} to homeschooling are subsumed under two basic categories: structured and unstructured homeschooling.

This style attempts {{to imitate the}} structure of the traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. Unstructured homeschooling is any form of home education where <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not construct a curriculum at all. Unschooling, as it is known, attempts to teach through the child's daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} have passed safety standards limiting {{the types of}} toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as choking or fire hazards that could cause injury. Children, especially very small ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials {{used to make a}} toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not always think of all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Janov's primal therapy, {{which has}} been an {{influential}} post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, {{he does not have}} a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not love it. Janov writes in The Primal Scream (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.|$|E
25|$|The chicks of {{swallows}} hatch naked, generally {{with only}} a few tufts of down. The eyes are closed and do not fully open for up to 10 days. The feathers take a few days to begin to sprout, and the chicks are brooded by the parents until they are able to thermoregulate. On the whole they develop slowly compared to other passerine birds. The <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not usually feed the chicks individual insects but instead a bolus of food comprising ten to a hundred insects. Regardless of whether the species has males that incubate or brood the chicks the males of all swallows and martins will help feed the chicks. It is difficult to judge when swallows and martins fledge, as they will be enticed out of the nest after three weeks by parents but frequently return to the nest afterwards in order to roost.|$|E

25|$|Along with Jiangxi, Henan {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{unbalanced}} gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government. Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1–4 age group; this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} with same sex marriage {{is whether or not}} the children of these families will grow up positively and have similar lives compared to children with heterosexual parents. The purpose of this article was to understand how undergraduate students perceived and understood the idea of same-sex families. Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships between family and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual <b>parents</b> <b>do.</b> This study depicts a positive response regarding the concern of the well being of same sex families.|$|E
25|$|It {{is also a}} {{question}} open to debate whether there are genetic influences on the tendency of the co-twins to change, without keeping in mind {{the direction of the}} change. Another factor that can be addressed is biological versus adoptive relatives and can be clearly seen in what is a real-life experiment: adoption. This creates two groups: genetic relatives (biological parents and siblings) and environmental relatives (adoptive parents and siblings). After studying hundreds of adoptive families, researchers discovered that people who grow up together, whether biologically related or not, do not much resemble one another in personality. In characteristics such as extroversion and agreeableness, adoptees are more like their biological parents than their adoptive parents. However, the minute shared-environment effects do not mean that adoptive parenting is ineffective. Even though genetics may limit the family environment's influence on personality, <b>parents</b> <b>do</b> influence their children's attitudes, values, faith, manners, and politics. In adoptive homes, child neglect and abuse and even divorce between the parents is uncommon. This noted it is not surprising, despite a somewhat greater risk of psychological disorder, that most adopted children excel, especially when they are adopted as infants. In fact, seven out of eight have reported feeling a strong connection with one or even both of their adoptive parents.|$|E
