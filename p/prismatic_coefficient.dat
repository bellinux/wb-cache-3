40|$|International audienceTensile {{tests on}} commercially pure alpha-titanium show a three-stage {{behavior}} {{giving rise to}} a well on the strain dependence of the work hardening. An opposite strain rate effect on the well depth is found whether specimens are elongated along the rolling or the transverse direction. Slip lines analysis reveals an initial predominance of prismatic slip, particularly pronounced in specimens strained along the rolling direction. The relative activity of prismatic slip is then observed to decrease with the samples deformation. These results provide grounds for elaboration of an elasto-viscoplastic self-consistent model based on the translated field method and an affine linearization of the viscoplastic flow rule, and capable of explaining such peculiar work hardening behavior. The model considers crystal plasticity and deals separately with mobile dislocation density and dislocation velocity. It assumes lower strain rate sensitivity as well as higher dislocation multiplication rate for prismatic systems. Based on these assumptions, the model reproduces correctly the stress strain curves and gives sound estimates of Lankford <b>coefficients,</b> <b>prismatic</b> slip activity and textures evolution. Most importantly, the opposite effect of strain rate on the well depth {{with regard to the}} orientation of the tensile axis is qualitatively retrieved, which allows putting forward an explanation of the observed phenomena...|$|R
5000|$|The Taylor Series allows {{variation}} of the slenderness ratio, beam to draft ratio, and <b>prismatic</b> <b>coefficient.</b> While these are far from the only parameters that can be varied in a warship's hull design, {{it is possible to}} get a preliminary estimate of ship resistance from the series for essentially all warships, and many merchant ships, built since Taylor's time. Taylor's main contribution was to recognize that these three simple parameters were the critical ones for ship performance. A Taylor series estimate is accurate enough to plan the model test and to develop an idea of how much power will be required to achieve design speed, prior to model testing the actual hull form. Today the Taylor Series has been programmed in electronic form and is used in several ship [...] "synthesis models" [...] to do feasibility studies for new ships.|$|E

40|$|There are few {{numerical}} methods {{available for}} the prediction of resistance of hullforms with fine entrances and broad, flat sterns, typical of tugs, trawlers and offshore supply vessels. The field narrows even further for those hullforms having high displacement/length ratios. Ridgeley-Nevitt’s trawler series data caters for high displacement-length ratios up to 500, but the residuary resistance data are only available {{in the form of}} two-dimensional contour plots at each speed/length ratio, and determination is time consuming. Data were therefore lifted from each of the contour plots and regression analyses completed, resulting in polynomial expressions for the residuary resistance at each of the speed/length ratios. The expressions are in terms of the <b>prismatic</b> <b>coefficient</b> and displacement/length ratio, giving good results compared to the contour plots and providing fast evaluation of the residuary resistance component...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe Overall Motion Sickness Incidence {{is applied}} to the hull form {{optimization}} of a wave piercing high-speed catamaran vessel. Parametric hull modelling {{is applied to}} generate two families of derived hull forms, the former varying the <b>prismatic</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the position of longitudinal centre of buoyancy, the latter instead the demi-hull separation. Several heading angles are analysed in a seaway, considering all combinations of significant wave height and zero-crossing period under two operating scenarios. The optimum hull is generated and vertical accelerations at some critical points on main deck are compared with the parent ones. Finally a comparative analysis with the results obtained for a similarly sized monohull passenger ship is carried out, in order to quantify, by the OMSI, the relative goodness in terms of wellness onboard of monohulls and catamarans, as a function of sea states and operating scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the roll}} damping of ships has {{significant}} effects of viscosity, {{it is difficult}} to calculate it theoretically. Therefore experimental results or some prediction methods are used to get the roll damping in design stage of ships. Among some prediction methods, Ikeda’s one is widely used in many ship motion computer programs. Using the method, the roll damping of various ship hulls with various bilge keels are calculated to investigate its characteristics. Ship hull forms are systematically changed by changing length, beam, draft, midship sectional coefficient and <b>prismatic</b> <b>coefficient.</b> On the basis of these predicted roll damping of various ships, a very simple prediction formula of the roll damping of ships is deduced. It is found, however, that this formula cannot be used for ships that have high position of the center of gravity. A modified method to improve accuracy for such ships is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The Holtrop & Mennen {{method is}} widely used at the initial design stage of ships for {{estimating}} {{the resistance of the}} ship (Holtrop and Mennen, 1982). The Holtrop & Mennen method provide a prediction of the total resistance’s components. In this work we present a neural network model which performs the same task as the Holtrop & Mennem’s method, for two of the total resistance’s components. A multilayer perceptron has been therefore trained to learn the relationship between the input (length-displacement ratio, <b>prismatic</b> <b>coefficient,</b> longitudinal position of the centre of buoyancy, after body form and Froude number) and the target variables (form factor and wave-making and wave-breaking resistance per unit weight of displacement). The network architecture with best generalization properties was obtained through an exhaustive validation analysis (Bishop, 1995). The results of this model have been compared against those provided by the Holtrop & Mennen method, and {{it was found that the}} quality of the prediction is improved over the entire range of data. The neural network provides an accurate estimation of two total resistance’s components with Froude number and hull geometry coefficients as variables. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Around 90 % {{of global}} trade is {{carried by sea}} 1 due to the reason {{that it is the}} most {{economical}} and fuel efficient mode of cargo transportation. The total trade volume is increasing throughout the last century for the same reason. On the other hand according to the Green House Gas study by IMO, International Maritime Organization in 2000, ships engaged in international trade in 1996 contributed about 1. 8 % of the total world’s CO 2 emissions which is approximated as 2. 7 % in 20072. At the present trend, this percentage could go two or three times higher from the present by 20503. In order to control this CO 2 emission from shipping, IMO has developed the first ever global CO 2 reduction index in the world, known as EEDI, Energy Efficiency Design Index. The basic formulation of EEDI is based on the ratio of total CO 2 emission per tonne. mile. As CO 2 depends upon fuel consumption and fuel consumption depends upon the total power requirements, eventually this EEDI formulation has certain impact on ship design parameters and hydrodynamics. At this point SSPA Sweden AB 4 wanted to have an in depth knowledge about the background of EEDI, other indexes (except EEDI) for reducing CO 2 emission developed by other organizations, formulations of different indexes and working method, impact of EEDI on ship design and the hydrodynamics. In order to find the impact on ship design and hydrodynamics, parametric analyses of ship is accomplished for different ship types such as Bulk Carrier, Tanker, Container vessel etc. A simple tool has been developed to calculate resistance and power with Holtrop & Mennen, 1982 method. Using the tool the main engine power is predicted after calculating the resistance and finally EEDI is calculated with the current IMO formulation. Finally, the results are presented as the effect on EEDI and hydrodynamics by changing ship design parameters such as Length, Beam, Draft, <b>Prismatic</b> <b>Coefficient,</b> Block Coefficient and suggestions have been made in order to achieve the required EEDI. An effort was also made to analyse the criticism against the present EEDI formulation, guideline and reference line, as it is quite a heavy debate now, whether this implementation will really reduce the CO 2 emission or not...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a modern 41 feet sailing yacht by comparing the performance values acquired from simulations for different forebody geometry designs on the yacht. The particulars such as length, beam, displacement and <b>prismatic</b> <b>coefficient</b> are kept as similar as possible for all hulls. The resistance of the different designs are tested in flat water and in tests with waves. The {{set up for the}} waves is made with data taken from Svenska Björn; which is a caisson lighthouse in the Baltic Sea. The wave lengths tested in this study includes lengths of 12. 5 m, 25 m and 34. 5 m and the yachts are run in straight head sea. The encounter frequency for the 25 m wave matches the natural pitch frequency of the yachts. To evaluate realistic upwind condition, for cruising and racing, tests with a heel angle of 20 o are additionally performed. All hulls are tested at Froude number 0. 35 in the conditions described in the previous paragraph. This investigation is made with the aid of CFD using Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (U-RANS) equations integrated in the solvers provided in Star CCM+ software. Also, Volume of Fluids method for surface capturing is used. At the start of the study a verification of the software is made with the use of Least Square Root method. Then, a validation of the CFD results from the software is done by a comparison with data from towing tank tests from Delft Systematic Yachts Hull Series hull. In total three hulls are tested with a systematic forebody geometry variation of shape. The main result of this study is {{a better understanding of how}} the forebody design of a sailing yacht affects the performance. The study is done at high Froude number, where the gain from having a sharp and pointed entry angle and then diving into the water is larger than having volumes in the lower part of the bow. Having a tumblehome design that prevents the yacht from diving into waves gives calmer motions but higher resistance. However it is important to conclude that the drag, pitch and heave for all yachts are close and a definite winner hull is difficult to name because some of the three yachts are better than the other in certain conditions. Nevertheless, the best design overall is the hull with sharp entry angle and flare...|$|E
