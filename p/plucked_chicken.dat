In 1961 the firm was contacted to provide material for the White House. American interior decorator Sister Parish performing initial redecoration work primarily on the residential floor of the White House specified several stock fabrics from Scalamandré Silks. As the White House restoration {{began to focus on}} the more public ceremonial rooms of the State Floor, French interior designer Stéphane Boudin of Maison Jansen was given oversight of the redecoration of the Red Room, Blue Room, East Room, and the fabric selection for the Green Room. Boudin was encouraged to use the American manufacture Scalamandré to recreate several of the historic fabric documents from the library of Maison Jansen, and the recreation of a complex silk lampas with an eagle design for the upholstery of a suite of French Empire furniture by cabinetmaker Pierre-Antoine Bellangé originally acquired by James Madison for the Blue Room. This, and the Green Room's complex hand woven watered silk moiré proved most challenging. Samples for the Blue Room's upholstery disappointed First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and Stéphane Boudin. White House Chief Usher J. B.

40|$|Keratin {{derived from}} chicken feather fibres (CFFs) has many {{potential}} applications that are {{constrained by the}} quality and pathogen content after purification treatment. The pathogen activity after purification has not been evaluated elsewhere. <b>Plucked</b> <b>chicken</b> feathers are prone to impose biological hazards due to accommodating blood-borne pathogens; therefore, establishing an efficient purification process is crucial. Bactericidal performance of surfactants (anionic, non-ionic, and cationic), bleach (ozone and chlorine dioxide), ethanol extraction, and a combination method comprising surfactant-bleach-ethanol extraction on chicken feathers was investigated via (A) standard plate count and enumeration of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, coagulase positive Staphylococcus, aerobic and anaerobic spore-formers and (B) Salmonella and Campylobacter detection tests. Among the purification methods, only ethanol extraction and combination methods eliminated Salmonella from the untreated feathers. Although ethanol extraction exhibited superior bactericidal impact compared to the combination method, the feathers treated through the latter method demonstrated superior morphological and mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy was employed to determine the remaining content of selected purifiers on treated CFFs. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful removal of fatty esters from CFFs using nominated purifiers.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to curb {{the environmental impact of}} chicken feathers, a waste from the poultry industry, by value-adding and development of bio-composites with improved biodegradability and thermo-mechanical properties, and to extract keratin from the feathers for inclusion in biomaterials for potential consumer applications. The first step in the application of chicken feathers involved thorough cleaning and disinfection since <b>plucked</b> <b>chicken</b> feathers impose severe microbiological hazards. Therefore, the design of a proper purification method in respect to the final application was necessary. Different surfactants including anionic, non-ionic, and cationic; bleach such as ozone and chlorine dioxide; ethanol extraction; and a combined method comprising surfactant–bleach–ethanol extraction were applied to chicken feathers and their bactericidal performance was investigated via a) Standard Plate Count, b) the enumeration of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas species, coagulase positive Staphylococcus, aerobic and anaerobic spore-formers and c) Salmonella and Campylobacter detection tests. Among all practices, only the ethanol extraction and combined method eliminated Salmonella from the feathers. Although ethanol-extraction showed superior bactericidal decontamination compared with the combined method, the feathers purified with the latter method showed better morphological and mechanical properties. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the presence of sodium lauryl sulphate remnants in the feathers after applying the combined method. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was adopted for the qualitative characterisation of the feathers before and after purification. Chicken feather characterisation including a-helix conformation in the feather wool, and pleated sheet in barbs and rachis, are presented herein. The pH, visual observation, optical microscopy under visible and ultraviolet lights, scanning electron microscopy, micro X-ray diffraction, wide-angle X-ray scattering, infrared spectroscopy, vibrational spectroscopy and thermogravimetry were used to characterise the feathers before and after purification and residues after extraction. The next consideration was to find a use for waste feathers. Two polyurethane based polymers were combined with chicken feather fibres, to form bio-composites. Thermoplastic polyether–polyurethane was used via solvent–casting–evaporation–compression moulding method at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 %·w/w of chicken feather fibres; and thermoplastic polysiloxane–polyurethane was used via solvent–casting–evaporation–compression moulding, and solvent–precipitation–evaporation–compression moulding methods to create new bio-composites incorporating 10 and 20 %·w/w of chicken feather fibres into the polyurethane. Compatibility of polyurethanes with the feather fibres and the thermo-mechanical properties of the resulting bio-composites were determined and using thermogravimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis and stress–strain measurements with hysteresis loops. The uniformity of the feather fibres dispersion in the polyurethane matrix was investigated via macro-photography. Scanning electron microscopy of fractured surfaces of the bio-composites was used to verify that the adhesion between fibre and polymer was effective. Molecular modelling visualisation predicted the existence of hydrogen bonding between fibres and polyurethane molecules and this result was supported by Fourier-transform infrared analysis of the composite. The addition of chicken feather fibres to the polyurethane matrixes was found to decrease the glass transition temperature, recovery strain and thermal mass loss of the composites, but increase the elastic modulus (hardness), storage modulus and char level on thermal decomposition. The thermo-mechanical properties of these polymers were enhanced by addition of keratin feather fibres. The utilization of ecofriendly, bio-based composites has been reported in many areas including, but not limited to, the packaging, insulation, automotive, building and roofing industries, as well as for separation membranes for water treatment. The applications of the produced bio-composites are steps towards more environmentally-friendly and more cost effective products. Keratin was then extracted from different segments of disposable chicken feathers including whole feathers, calamus and rachis (composed mainly of beta-pleated sheet structures), barbs and barbules (composed mainly of alpha-helix), using sodium sulfide or L‑cysteine. The extraction process involved dissolving the chicken feathers by reducing its disulfide links, then separating the protein from the medium by centrifugation. Once the feathers were dissolved, the pH of solution was adjusted to the isoelectric point using hydrochloric acid, to precipitate the proteins, and the yield of extracted keratin with sodium sulfide (88 ± 3 %) was higher than with L-cysteine (66 ± 4 %). The precipitated keratin was washed three times with distilled water. The presence of protein obtained from different methods was confirmed using the biuret test, and the Bradford assay enabled the concentration of keratin to be determined. The precipitated keratin was characterised using gel electrophoresis, which confirmed soluble protein of molar mass 11 kg/mol and estimated its purity to be over 95 %. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry verified the molar mass of the extracted material matched that of chicken keratin. Vibrational and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed the structure of keratin was retained following extraction. Thermogravimetry of original purified chicken feather and keratin extracted via sodium sulfide treatment showed virtually identical decomposition behaviour, proving the purity of the keratin. In contrast, thermogravimetry of keratin extracted with L-cysteine indicated it may contain residual L-cysteine. The structure of keratins extracted from different segments of waste chicken feathers via sodium sulfide and L‑cysteine, have been subjected to further nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and analysed for their antibacterial properties on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli as Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, respectively. The goal of this section was to produce an extract and to characterise several aspects of its behaviour that may have implications for its use as a biomaterial. Hence, the keratin extracted using sodium sulfide was incorporated into hair conditioner and cream, and used in hair and leather treatments to determine their interactions with animal tissues. These experiments confirmed and expanded earlier findings that keratin demonstrated excellent compatibility in biological systems, as the highest keratin concentration experimental cream and conditioner, had the best outcomes. Finally, this study presents suggestions for future fundamental studies and proposals for the development of keratin-based materials for biomedical and consumer product applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Every year billion {{kilograms}} of unused feathers {{result from the}} poultry industry worldwide, which in effect impose a difficult disposal process to the environment. Chicken feathers are considered as a valuable and renewable keratin protein source, {{which could be used}} advantageously in a number of applications as alternatives to feather meal and feather disposal. Although the potential applications of keratin derived from chicken feathers have been investigated, the initial purification phase has not been fully described in the literature. Original chicken feathers contain many biological organisms along with other contaminants after <b>plucking.</b> Unprocessed <b>chicken</b> feathers are considered as potentially hazardous biological materials due to the presence of blood borne pathogens; therefore, the decontamination process is very important. The purpose of this work is to compare the effects of different purification techniques on chicken feathers prior to keratin isolation. These processes include surfactant washing, soxhlet extraction with ethanol, ozone, and sodium chlorite solutions. Thermogravimetric analysis, vibrational spectroscopy, and wide angle X-ray scattering were used to characterise the purified feathers prior to keratin extraction...|$|R

40|$|Chicken {{feathers}} are an abundant, inconvenient and troublesome {{waste product}} from the poultry industry {{that can be}} utilised {{as a source of}} keratin. The keratin exists in α-helix conformation in feather wool, and as pleated sheet in barbs and rachis. In addition to keratin, feathers contain other fatty and waxy substances. Whilst investigations have been conducted exploring potential use of keratin derived from chicken feathers, the initial purification phase is important for isolating the keratin from other materials. An original chicken feather contains many biological organisms together with other dirt from when they were <b>plucked</b> from <b>chickens.</b> Unprocessed chicken feathers are potentially biologically hazardous, due to the presence of blood borne pathogens, so it is imperative that they are decontaminated upon receipt. The aim of this work is conduct a comparative study of different purification methods to decontaminate chicken feathers prior to keratin isolation. These methods were: washing the original chicken feathers using an anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulphate and a non-ionic surfactant, a poly(ethylene glycol). Soxhlett extraction with ethanol was performed, together with bleaching using ozone and sodium chlorite solutions.

Feathers contain some fatty and waxy substances, other than keratin that exists in an α-helix conformation in feather barbs and barbules, and as ß-sheet in calamus and rachis. Although investigations have been conducted exploring potential use of keratin derived from chicken feathers, the initial purification phase is important for isolating the keratin from other materials. An original chicken feather contains many biological organisms together with other extraneous material from the time it was <b>plucked</b> from a <b>chicken.</b> Unprocessed chicken feathers are potentially biologically hazardous, caused by the presence of blood borne pathogens, thus it is important that they are decontaminated upon receipt. The aim of this study is conduct a comparative analysis of different purification techniques to decontaminate chicken feathers prior to keratin isolation. These processes include surfactant washing using an ionic and a non-ionic surfactant, soxhlet extraction with ethanol, ozone and sodium chlorite solution bleaching. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy, pH and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterise the feathers and residues after purification and extraction. FTIR analysis confirmed that there are no significant changes in the chemical structure of fibers after each wash treatment. However the residue from ethanol extraction was characteristic of a long hydrocarbon chain ester, typical of a fat...|$|R

She walked slowly down the passage, running her hand along the wall beside her. She did not think which way she was going, and {{therefore}} walked down a passage which only led to a window and a balcony. She looked down at the kitchen premises, {{the wrong side of the}} hotel life, which was cut off from the right side by a maze of small bushes. The ground was bare, old tins were scattered about, and the bushes wore towels and aprons upon their heads to dry. Every now and then a waiter came out in a white apron and threw rubbish on to a heap. Two large women in cotton dresses were sitting on a bench with blood-smeared tin trays in front of them and yellow bodies across their knees. They were plucking the birds, and talking as they <b>plucked.</b> Suddenly a <b>chicken</b> came floundering, half flying, half running into the space, pursued by a third woman whose age could hardly be under eighty. Although wizened and unsteady on her legs she kept up the chase, egged on by the laughter of the others; her face was expressive of furious rage, and as she ran she swore in Spanish. Frightened by hand-clapping here, a napkin there, the bird ran this way and that in sharp angles, and finally fluttered straight at the old woman, who opened her scanty grey skirts to enclose it, dropped upon it in a bundle, and then holding it out cut its head off with an expression of vindictive energy and triumph combined. The blood and the ugly wriggling fascinated Rachel, so that although she knew that some one had come up behind and was standing beside her, she did not turn round until the old woman had settled down on the bench beside the others. Then she looked up sharply, because of the ugliness of what she had seen. It was Miss Allan who stood beside her.|$|R
