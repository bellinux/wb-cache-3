5|$|As {{with all}} {{games in the}} series, Wipeout 64 was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and was published by Midway Games - marking {{the first and only}} time in the Wipeout series where one of the games were not published by Psygnosis or SCE Studio Liverpool (their future name). The game {{is one of the few}} N64 titles to have noticeable load times, disguised by the request 'Please Wait'. Load times between levels in Wipeout 64 are approximately a few seconds long due to the need for sound decompression, according to Psygnosis in a later interview with IGN. Psygnosis used the Nintendo 64's analogue stick to their benefit; thus rendering the D-Pad obsolete so that ships could respond quickly and more <b>precisely</b> <b>in</b> improvement regarding to the older games.|$|E

Under the agreement, Canada would host the first three events, while the USA had an option to host in 2006 and 2007. However, because USA Rugby became involved in hosting the USA Sevens tournament in the IRB Sevens World Series, it allowed Canada to be the principal host in 2006, although that competition saw matches in the USA for the first time, in San Jose (more <b>precisely,</b> <b>in</b> the Silicon Valley city of Santa Clara), and three Canadian cities hosted matches: Edmonton, Toronto, and Ottawa.|$|E

If the dive boat is anchored and the plan is for the divers to ascend on the anchor line, {{it may be necessary to}} have a tender or chase boat available to follow and pick up divers surfacing off the mark.|$|E
25|$|Acrobatic dance did not {{suddenly}} {{appear in}} vaudeville; rather, it appeared gradually {{over time in}} a variety of forms, and consequently no individual performer has been cited as its originator. Sherman Coates (1872–1912), who performed with the Watermelon Trust from 1900 to 1914, was recalled by fellow dancers as the first acrobatic dancer they had ever seen. Another of the earliest documented acrobatic dance performers was Tommy Woods, who became well known for his slow-motion acrobatic dance in Shuffle Along, in which he would execute acrobatic movements <b>precisely</b> <b>in</b> time with the music. In 1914, acrobat Lulu Coates formed the Crackerjacks, a popular vaudeville troupe that included acrobatic dance in their performance repertoire up until the group disbanded in 1952. Many other popular vaudeville companies combined acrobatics and dance in their shows, including the Gaines Brothers.|$|E
25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for the reason. This is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies <b>precisely</b> <b>in</b> his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the three}} main {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate {{to the position of}} the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed <b>precisely</b> <b>in</b> the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the RRC changed as the {{government}} became increasingly authoritarian. Immediately after its creation, its experienced core of technocrats produced highly regarded analyses of Ethiopian famine and ably carried out famine relief efforts. However, by the 1980s, the Derg had compromised its mission. The RRC began with the innocuous scheme of creating village workforces from the unemployed in state farms, and government agricultural schemes but, as the counter-insurgency intensified, the RRC was given responsibility for a program of forced resettlement and villagization. As the go-between for international aid organizations and foreign donor governments, the RRC redirected food to government militias, in particular in Eritrea and Tigray. It also encouraged international agencies to set up relief programs in regions with surplus grain production, which allowed the AMC to collect the excess food. Finally, the RRC carried out a disinformation campaign during the 1980s famine, in which it portrayed the famine as being solely the result of drought and overpopulation and tried to deny {{the existence of the}} armed conflict that was occurring <b>precisely</b> <b>in</b> the famine-affected regions. The RRC also claimed that the aid being given by it and its international agency partners were reaching all of the famine victims.|$|E
25|$|In Slovenia, {{the ethnic}} German {{population}} {{at the end}} of World War II was concentrated in Slovenian Styria, more <b>precisely</b> <b>in</b> Maribor, Celje, and a few other smaller towns (like Ptuj and Dravograd), and in the rural area around Apače on the Austrian border. The second largest ethnic German community in Slovenia was the predominantly rural Gottschee County around Kočevje in Lower Carniola, south of Ljubljana. Smaller numbers of ethnic Germans also lived in Ljubljana and in some western villages in the Prekmurje region. In 1931, the total number of ethnic Germans in Slovenia was around 28,000: around half of them lived in Styria and in Prekmurje, while the other half lived in the Gottschee County and in Ljubljana. In April 1941, southern Slovenia was occupied by Italian troops. By early 1942, ethnic Germans from Gottschee/Kočevje were forcefully transferred to German-occupied Styria by the new German authorities. Most resettled to the Posavje region (a territory along the Sava river between the towns of Brežice and Litija), from where around 50,000 Slovenes had been expelled. Gottschee Germans were generally unhappy about their forced transfer from their historical home region. One reason was that the agricultural value of their new area of settlement was perceived as much lower than the Gottschee area. As German forces retreated before the Yugoslav Partisans, most ethnic Germans fled with them in fear of reprisals. By May 1945, only few Germans remained, mostly in the Styrian towns of Maribor and Celje. The Liberation Front of the Slovenian People expelled most of the remainder after it seized complete control in the region in May 1945.|$|E
