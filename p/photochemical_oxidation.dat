We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms, and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals OH· with ozone. OH is formed by the reaction of electronically excited oxygen atoms produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapor is produced in situ by the <b>photochemical</b> <b>oxidation</b> of methane (CH4). The HO2 radical produced by the reaction of OH with O3 is recycled to OH by reaction with oxygen atoms or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly effect ozone levels via Radiolysis with the subsequent formation of OH [...] Laughing gas or Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, chlorofluorocarbon molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O2. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole. Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F.

Radiation treatment of solution is carried out by the UF-lamp with a wavelength of 254 nanometers. Methods: Residual concentrations of pesticides were determined by "Lyumakhrom" liquid chromatograph. The infrared spectrum of initial lindane, DDE solutions in the process of <b>photochemical</b> <b>oxidation</b> of pesticides by hydrogen peroxide is observed in ZnSe precision cell by Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy "Infralyum of FT- 02 ". The kinetics of <b>photochemical</b> <b>oxidation</b> process of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane) and 4, 4 '- dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) is studied. Findings: The analysis of obtained results shows that use of the homogeneous catalysts, initiating the process of H 2 O 2 and H 2 O photolysis, reduces the concentration of lindane and DDE in the first hour of treatment. Without catalyst the residual concentration of lindane is 0, 289 × 10 - 6 mol/dm 3, DDE – 0, 235 × 10 - 6 mol/dm 3, while addition of iron (III) to H 2 O 2 leads lindane concentration dilution up to 0, 029 × 10 - 6 mol/dm 3, DDE – to 0, 046 × 10 - 6 mol/dm 3. Addition as the Zn (II) catalyst to hydrogen peroxide decreases the concentration of lindane to 0, 129 × 10 - 6 mol/dm 3, DDE – to 0, 163 × 10 - 6 mol/dm 3 in 2 hours.
