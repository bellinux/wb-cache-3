The screws are mounted on <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> that have gears that mesh so the shafts turn together and everything stays in place. The screws turn on the shafts and drive fluid through the pump. As with other forms of rotary pumps, the clearance between moving parts and the pump's casing is minimal.|$|E
40|$|Most {{turbines}} in {{the market}} today follow a modular configuration comprised of a main shaft, gearbox, high speed shaft, and generator. The gearbox has the important task of increasing the slow rotor speeds to meet the electromechanical requirements of the electromechanical. These gearboxes are commonly composed of a planetary stage and several <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> stages. The planetary, or epicyclical, design of the gearbox is {{a feature of the}} design that has many advantages compared to the traditional <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> arrangement. Among these are that higher gear ratios can be achieved in a single stage, they are capable to carrying higher loads, and they require less space than the traditional <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> arrangement. For this reason, planetary gearboxes they are commonly used in the first stage of the wind turbine gearboxes. However, planetary stages are more complex than the typical <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> arrangement, and can be affected by deflection in the planet carrier, annulus deformations and bearing clearances. Unanticipated levels of these motions can reduce their life expectancy. This paper gives a brief overview of a subset of the experimental efforts, data, and analysis of the GRC project focusing on the planet carrier deformation...|$|R

5000|$|Spur gears or straight-cut gears are the {{simplest}} type of gear. They {{consist of a}} cylinder or disk with teeth projecting radially.

These gears mesh together correctly only if fitted to <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts.</b> [...] No axial thrust is created by the tooth loads. Spur gears are excellent at moderate speeds but tend to be noisy at high speeds.|$|E
50|$|Hamites {{species are}} characterised by a shell {{that began with}} an open, {{sometimes}} helical, regular spiral that either opened into a single large hook http://homepage.mac.com/nmonks/Projects/ammonitereconstr.html, or else formed three <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> that gave the mature shell the approximate appearance of a paper clip http://homepage.mac.com/nmonks/Projects/ammonitereconstr.html. No Hamites had spines or other such ornamentation on the shell, but several species appear to have developed apertural modifications when mature; that is, once the ammonite had grown to its final size, the aperture became constricted and was bounded by one or two thickened ribs, known as collars. These have been observed on other ammonites as well, and {{are assumed to be}} signs of sexual dimorphism.|$|E
50|$|Roll forming is, {{among the}} {{manufacturing}} processes, {{one of the}} simplest. It typically begins with a large coil of sheet metal, between 1 inch cm and 20 inch cm. in width, and 0.004 inch mm and 0.125 inch mm thick, supported on an uncoiler. The strip is fed through an entry guide to properly align the material as it passes through the rolls of the mill, each set of rolls forming a bend until the material reaches its desired shape. Roll sets are typically mounted {{one over the other}} on a pair of horizontal <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> supported by a stand(s). Side rolls and cluster rolls may also be used to provide greater precision and flexibility and to limit stresses on the material. The shaped strips can be cut to length ahead of a roll forming mill, between mills, or {{at the end of the}} roll forming line.|$|E

50|$|RJR's {{dominant}} {{feature is the}} 152 m Storstupet ("Big Shaft"). All of the water falls down a <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> only a few metres away. The Ulvgangen ("Wolf Walk") traverses across the cascades {{at the mouth of}} this wet shaft to the dry Storstupet. A pulldown descent of Storstupet is complicated by its low angle (about 80 degrees), and many teams prefer to detackle this pitch from above. Halfway down Storstupet is a window connecting back with the wet shaft, so descending cavers can enjoy all of the sound and fury of the wet shaft in relative comfort.

50|$|A Sumera is a {{bottomless}} pit, {{and locals}} initially treated Noon's Hole as a supernatural area, viewing it with suspicion and fear. However, in August 1895, the French cave explorer Édouard-Alfred Martel explored the cave {{for the first}} time, descending to 20 m. It was not until 1912 that {{a group called the}} Yorkshire Ramblers reached the bottom. Not discouraged by their equipment not having arrived from England, they made the descent of the complex 78 m shaft using a 35 m long rope ladder built from materials purchased from Fermanagh ships chandlers and timber merchants, hauling it up and down from the surface when the explorers found ledges to stand on. All they found at the bottom was a short passage leading to a sump. During the Easter of 1970, a group from the University of Leeds Speleological Association investigated the <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts,</b> and found that one led into 400 m of passages they named the After-Noon Series.|$|E
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the {{intermediate}} shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|E
5000|$|Long {{after the}} {{original}} Faraday disc had been abandoned as a practical generator, a modified version combining the magnet and disc in a single rotating part (the rotor) was developed. Sometimes the name homopolar generator is reserved for this configuration. One of the earliest patents on the general type of homopolar generators was attained by A. F. Delafield, [...] Other early patents for homopolar generators were awarded to S. Z. De Ferranti and C. Batchelor separately. Nikola Tesla {{was interested in the}} Faraday disc and conducted work with homopolar generators, and eventually patented an improved version of the device in [...] Tesla's [...] "Dynamo Electric Machine" [...] patent describes an arrangement of two parallel discs with separate, <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts,</b> joined like pulleys by a metallic belt. Each disc had a field that was the opposite of the other, so that the flow of current was from the one shaft to the disc edge, across the belt to the other disc edge and to the second shaft. This would have greatly reduced the frictional losses caused by sliding contacts by allowing both electrical pickups to interface with the shafts of the two disks rather than at the shaft and a high-speed rim. Later, patents were awarded to C. P. Steinmetz and E. Thomson for their work with homopolar generators. The Forbes dynamo, developed by the Scottish electrical engineer George Forbes, was in widespread use during the beginning of the 20th century. Much of the development done in homopolar generators was patented by J. E. Noeggerath and R. Eickemeyer.|$|E

50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts</b> {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|E

40|$|A coupled dynamic model, which {{contains}} helical gears-shafts-bearings for a wind turbine gearbox transmission system, was built considering nonlinear factors of the time-varying mesh stiffness, the external varying load, and the dynamic transmission error at first. The model is confirmed {{to be right}} after comparing the theoretical data with the experimental load sharing values, and also {{it is found that}} the static load sharing is conservative to evaluate the non-equilibrium effect of a planetary gear system. Besides, the analyzing results of the influence of average error and amplitude error on the load sharing show that the load sharing could be decreased if the error goes up a little. Then, by means of treating the static tracing point as the dynamic initial values, we analyzed the initial position’s influence on the load sharing of transmission system to provide a theoretical basis of load sharing control. Furthermore, we explored the influence of high-speed shaft position angle on the load sharing and the dynamic load factor of gears fixed on the <b>parallel</b> <b>shafts.</b> The results provide useful theoretical guidelines for the design of parallel shaft gear system in the wind turbines...|$|E
40|$|A conical {{involute}} gear, which resembles {{in shape}} a spur gear-shaper cutter, {{is generated by}} feeding the cutter along any element of the cone. There {{is no question about}} the way of generating a gear with a rack cutter or a spur gear-shaper cutter. 　Now speaking of generating a conical gear, the way of using a hob is practically much commoner and easier than that of using a rack cutter or a gear-shaper cutter. Cutting the gear with a hob comes to the same result with cutting it with a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear, as the hob is shaped into a screw-like form. Asymmetric teeth are obtained by feeding a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear along any element of the cone. 　We show in detail the process of generating a conical gear with a hob and the difference between both the normal pitches of {{the right and the left}} profiles of a gear tooth.

40|$|Abstract: To {{enhance the}} {{mobility}} of combat tracked vehicles, a high-powered compact power pack is crucial. To achieve this goal, it is planned to apply the concept of high-contact-ratio (HCR) gearing to an independent final-drive planetary gear assembly of the tracked vehicle transmission. Before applying the concept to the final-drive, the performances of both normal-contact-ratio (NCR) and HCR conventional <b>parallel</b> <b>shaft</b> spur gearing systems are evaluated and compared. The results show that, for the same torque, HCR gears are subjected to lower loads and endure almost double the life of NCR gears. This reveals that an HCR gear can transmit more power for the same size. Furthermore, the power loss, vibration, and noise level of the HCR gearing are significantly {{lower than those of}} the NCR gearing. The proven results of the case study have encouraged the replacement of the existing NCR gearing with the HCR gearing for the final-drive planetary assembly of the combat tracked vehicle for evaluation...|$|R
