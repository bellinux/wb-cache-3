40|$|The bulk {{chemical}} composition of 257 argillaceous sediments from cores around the Japan Trench which were drilled during Legs 56 and 57 was determined and examined. These samples are generally enriched in SiO 2 and impoverished in MnO, compared with typical <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments.</b> SiO 2 is {{negatively correlated with}} other oxides. Statistical treatment of data shows that pure silica varies inversely with TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3. The silica was derived mainly from planktonic siliceous organisms such as diatoms and radiolarians. Siliceous tests of these organisms disappear during progressive diagenesis, but the resolved silica redeposited in the sediments and the total silica content of the sediments remain constant. Higher SiO 2 in some samples {{may be due to}} increased volcanic glass content. On the west slope of the trench, much ferric iron was deposited but not oxidized. In contrast to iron, manganese originally present in the sediments was apparently reduced and not precipitated in this hemipelagic region. Abundant land-derived organic materials maintain a weakly reducing environment within the sediment, which permits the precipitation of ferric iron but not of manganese. The mutual relationship of conservative elements such as SiO 2, TiO 2, and Al 2 O 3 indicates that sediments of the west slope of the trench were derived mostly from the land area to the west and that the original materials were chemically homogenized and diluted by biogenic silica. In contrast, the chemistry of core from the trench outer slope (Site 436) shows a vertical trend: SiO 2 progressively decreases downhole, whereas MnO and the Fe 2 O 3 /FeO ratio increase significantly. The deeper samples are very similar to the <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> from the Pacific Plate, whereas upper samples resemble the trench inner slope sediments. The vertical trends at this site are plausibly explained by the progressive movement of the ocean plate toward the Japan Trench. When the oceanic plate was in the Central Pacific Ocean, much MnO and Fe 2 O 3 were deposited under an oxidizing environment with slow sedimentation, owing to the paucity of organic materials. As the ocean plate moved westward, nearer to the Japanese Islands, hemipelagic sediment derived from these islands were deposited over the <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments.</b> No <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> were detected geochemically in the deposits of the trench inner slope. If the offscraping of the sediment of the oceanic plate is the dominant process at the plate convergence, significant amounts of deep oceanic <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> that are being scraped off from the oceanic plate should be contained in the trench inner slope. Since the <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> are known to exist on oceanic crust coming into the trench, {{it may be that the}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> are subducted without offscraping against the landward wall of the trench. However, the entire sequence underlying the trench inner slope was not penetrated at any site...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the role of sediment subduction in the magma genesis in the Setouchi volcanic belt, SW Japan, bulk rock compositions of both <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> from the Philippine Sea (GDP 15 - 12) and trench-filled sediments from the Nankai Trough (DSDP site 582) were determined. The analytical result shows that trace element concentrations, particularly Pb, Ba and Th, of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> are much {{higher than those of}} the terrigenous sediments. Mixing calculations using these elements indicate that the terrigenous sediments rather than the <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> {{played a major role in}} producing the Setouchi magmas. To obtain further constraints on the origin of Setouchi magmas, a model of melt-mantle reaction was examined based on the assimilation fractional crystallization formulation (AFC). The result also indicates that the terrigenous sediment is a dominant metasomatic agent. In addition, the model sug-gests that the fractionation of orthopyroxene with minor hornblende would be essential to produce the Setouchi magmas. Taking the hornblende fractionation into account, Pb/K 2 O and Pb/Rb ratios on MgO variation diagrams also indicate similar contributions. Since the breakdown of mica, which is included both in the <b>pelagic</b> and terrigenous <b>sediments,</b> is inferred to induce dehydration melting of the sediments, above geochemical characteristics suggest that both sediments would melt simultaneously beneath the Setouchi area...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} of physical properties, including wet-bulk density, water content (porosity), sonic velocity, thermal conductivity, and shear strength {{were made for}} sediments from the Galapagos mounds area cored by the hydraulic piston corer. Sediments in this area include manganese oxides, granular green clays, nongranular green clays (intermediate be-tween granular green clays and <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments),</b> and <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments.</b> Average values of physical properties appear in Table 1. The difference in sonic velocity and density between hydrothermal materials and <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> may be respon-sible for the complex seismic reflection pattern at mound sites. However, the depth variation of acoustic impedance in holes which are not at mound sites is smooth, {{and there are no}} obvious contrasts to account for regional seismic reflec-tors at 7 and 15 meters depth. The depth gradients of porosity and therefore of density (and thermal conductivity) of <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> in the mounds area are very large and correlate well with surface heat flow. This suggests that the high depth gradients may be attributed to the effect of hydrothermal circulation and that hydrothermal convection cells may be essentially fixed with the moving plate. Based on the porosity-depth relation found in this area, the hydraulic impedance of sediment layers is calculated as a function of their thickness, using the porosity-permeability relation of Bryant et al. (1974). The hydraulic impedance of the sediment layer increases with thickness and at several tens of meters thickness it becomes comparable to that of the basement rock layer, if the basement layer is 2 ~ 3 km thick and has an average permeability of 2 ~ 30 millidarcy...|$|R
50|$|In case {{of marine}} sediments, ooze does {{not refer to}} a sediment's consistency, but to its composition, which {{directly}} reflects its origin.

Oozes can be defined by and classified according to the predominate organism that compose them. For example, there are diatom, coccolith, foraminifera, globigerina, pteropod, and radiolarian oozes.

40|$|The pre-arc {{basement}} complex in southwestern Puerto Rico consists of rocks exposed in the Bermeja complex. The oldest rocks are highly serpentinized peridotites {{that occur in}} three belts (Monte del Estado, Río Guanajibo, and Sierra Bermeja). These serpentinites were emplaced into a sequence of Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous pelagic chert (Mariquita chert) that contains abundant rafts and blocks of N-MORB-type amphibolites (Las Palmas amphibolite) and tholeiite and associated trondhjemite fractionates (Lower Cajul MORB) also of N-MORB affinity. The rocks are apparently overlain by a younger sequence of pre-arc plateau basaltic and andesitic lava flows (Upper Cajul Formation) that occur in two distinct geographic sequences, one having E-MORB and the other OIB geochemical characteristics. Overlying these pre-arc rocks in western Puerto Rico are northwest-trending Late Cretaceous to Eocene (85 to 45 Ma) island arc strata that chronologically overlap later volcanic phases in central Puerto Rico. These western Puerto Rico arc rocks have elevated incompatible element concentrations together with conspicuously shallow negative Nb-anomalies, slightly positive Zr-Hf anomalies, and exceedingly high OIB-like Nb/Zr, all indicative of enriched source compositions. Trace element patterns are reproduced by multiple component mixing models involving highly depleted spinel peridotite (RMM 15 to 20) overprinted by small OIB-type (up to ~ 2 %) and <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediment</b> components.

The subsolidus phase assemblage is phengite mica+garnet+clinopyroxene+coesite+kyanite. With 5 wt. % water added, the liquidus temperatures and primary phases for the calc-alkaline rocks are 1280 °- 1180 °- 1080 °, garnet+clinopyroxene, garnet, and quartz respectively. Garnet and clinopyroxene occur throughout the melting interval of the olivine tholeiite for all water contents.

The subsolidus phase assemblage is garnet+clinopyroxene+coesite+minor kyanite for all the calc-alkaline compositions. We conclude that calc-alkaline andesites and rhyolites are not equilibrium partial melting pruducts of subducted oceanic crust consisting of olivine tholeiite basalt and siliceous sediments.

We present new geochemical data including high-precision Pb isotopic measurements from the 700 km length of this intraoceanic arc. An {{aim of this}} study is to link the along-arc characteristics with variations in the subducting Pacific crust. Chemical variations have been previously recognized along the northern section of the arc as a southward decrease in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and increase in 206 Pb/ 204 Pb. This trend continues into the southern arc as far as 27. 5 °N. An overall correlation between 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and fluid-mobile element enrichment between 35 and 27. 5 °N implies a contribution of a slab-derived fluid, mainly from altered oceanic crust and <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediment.</b> However, the observation that volcanoes plot systematically closer to the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line (NHRL) with increasing 206 Pb/ 204 Pb indicates that a component other than <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediment</b> and ocean crust plays a key role toward the south. South of 27. 5 °N, the along-arc isotopic trend changes dramatically, with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr increasing southward from 27. 5 °N and the 206 Pb/ 204 Pb becoming highly radiogenic (? 19. 6). This isotopic signature requires involvement of a component with high 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and low ? 8 / 4. Volcaniclastic sediments originating from HIMU oceanic islands on the subducting Pacific Plate are possible candidates to introduce such a component into the mantle wedge. This is consistent with the sedimentary section of ODP Site 801, located outboard of the Mariana arc which has > 40 % mass of HIMU volcaniclastics. An aqueous fluid, not melt, has played a major role in the source magma compositions in the 27. 5 – 25 °N segment. South of 25 °N the isotopic characteristics again change significantly. 143 Nd/ 144 Nd decreases down to 0. 51280, but the high 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and low ? 8 / 4 signatures are retained. The remarkable Th enrichment associated with low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, ? 8 / 4, and ? 7 / 4 suggests that melting a mixture of HIMU volcaniclastics and <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediment</b> is responsible for the geochemical characteristics of this most southerly section. <br/...|$|E

Microstratigraphic examination of the hardgrounds reveals a complex Cretaceous and Paleogene history of bioerosion, <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediment</b> accumulation, manganese encrustation, and phosphatization. Fourteen distinct episodes of <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediment</b> accumulation occurred, with five in the Cretaceous, three in the Paleocene, and seven in the Eocene.

REE composition varies symmetrically relative to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) emphasizing weak hydrothermal influence on sediments of the ridge axis, although the well-known criteria for hydrothermal contribution, such as Al/(Al+Mn+Fe) and (Fe+Mn) /Ti, do not reach critical values. Variations in REE content and composition allowed to distinguish the following five sediment zones in the transect: (I) terrigenous sediments of the Nares abyssal plain; (II) <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> of the North American Basin; (III) carbonate ooze of the MAR axis; (IV) <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> of the Canary Basin; and (V) terrigenous clay and calcareous mud of the African continental slope and slope base. Ferromanganese nodules of the hydrogenous type with extremely high Ce (up to 1801 ppm) and Th (up to 138 ppm) contents occur in <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments.</b> It is ascertained that P, REE, and Th contents depend on Fe content in Atlantic sediments. Therefore, one can suggest that only minor amount of phosphorus is bound with bone debris. Low concentration of bone debris phosphorus is a result of relatively high sedimentation rates in the Atlantic Ocean, as compared with those in pelagic regions of the Pacific Ocean...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{extent of}} pelagic deposits, {{covering}} about 70 per {{cent of the}} ocean floor, thus {{about half of the}} earth, makes them of obvious importance to all Earth Science. All the <b>pelagic</b> (eupelagic) <b>sediments,</b> whether largely of plankton remains or fine inorganic particles, have certain distinctive characteristics to reflect their environment of accumulation. The great segregation of manganese in <b>pelagic</b> <b>sediments</b> presents many problems. It is hypothesized that in the formation of present day nodules a relatively slow accumulation in order to permit deposition of more of the manganese as large nodules, rather than as the disseminated micronodules that are in larger proportion in the Tertiary...|$|R
