5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a <b>proportionality</b> analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three-tiered scrutiny approach. The third limb of the <b>proportionality</b> test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} unit {{of force}} in a different foot-pound-second system, the absolute fps system, is the poundal, defined as the force required to accelerate a one-pound mass {{at a rate of}} one foot per second squared. The units of slug and poundal are designed to avoid a constant of <b>proportionality</b> in Newton's Second Law.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} <b>proportionality</b> of {{acceleration}} to {{force and the}} inverse <b>proportionality</b> of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E
5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of <b>proportionality</b> be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedural}} {{dimension of}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been recognized by Singapore courts and, since 2013, the substantive form of the doctrine as well. However, whether the courts will adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring legitimate expectation with the ruler of <b>proportionality</b> remains an open question.|$|E
5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a <b>proportionality</b> analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of <b>proportionality</b> is 1.|$|E
5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of <b>proportionality</b> to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which is to avoid examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize <b>proportionality</b> as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the <b>proportionality</b> of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|As regards <b>proportionality,</b> the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that <b>proportionality</b> meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of <b>proportionality</b> is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (<b>proportionality).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing <b>proportionality</b> approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} of <b>proportionality,</b> , is {{the gravitational}} constant.|$|E
25|$|The {{constants}} of <b>proportionality</b> are 2 and , respectively.|$|E
25|$|The <b>proportionality</b> {{constant}} is {{the volume}} of the unit ball.|$|E
25|$|Justice Thomas {{believed}} that the Eighth Amendment contained no <b>proportionality</b> principle at all, and concurred in the judgment.|$|E
25|$|The UNHRC {{fact-finding mission}} report in September 2009 criticized {{the choice of}} weapons for the counterstrike and said the IDF had {{violated}} the law of <b>proportionality.</b>|$|E
25|$|By advocating <b>proportionality</b> in the court's {{approach}} towards protecting substantive legitimate expectations, Lord Justice Laws effectively paralleled {{the approach}} {{used by the}} UK courts when considering whether an interference with a right subject to qualifications protected by the European Convention on Human Rights is lawful. Drawing guidance from the Convention, the <b>proportionality</b> test requires (1) that {{the objective of the}} action must be sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right; (2) that the action designed to meet the objective must be rationally connected to that objective, and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations; and (3) the means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate objective, and the more severe the deleterious effects of an action, the more important the objective must be if the action is to be justified. As the European Convention was given effect in the domestic law of the UK by the Human Rights Act 1998, the <b>proportionality</b> approach resonated with the courts which were familiar in applying the test in cases involving qualified Convention rights across a wide spectrum of factual and policy contexts. For instance, the <b>proportionality</b> approach was applied by Justice Stephen Silber in R. (X) v. Head Teacher and Governors of Y School (2007).|$|E
25|$|Until Kennedy v. Louisiana, {{some states}} were testing {{the limit of}} this {{restriction}} by enacting death penalty statutes for repeat child rapists. In terms of the Court's capital punishment jurisprudence, Coker signaled the Court's commitment to employing a robust <b>proportionality</b> test for deciding when the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment. The Court would later use this same <b>proportionality</b> test to evaluate the propriety {{of the death penalty}} for felony murder (except for the actual killer), mentally retarded offenders, juvenile offenders, and eventually all crimes except murder and crimes against the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{rational}} volumetric quantation or constant <b>proportionality</b> of the octahedron, the cube, the rhombic triacontahedron, and the rhombic dodecahedron when {{referenced to}} the tetrahedron as volumetric unity.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{inventory}} <b>proportionality</b> in the United States {{is thought to}} have been inspired by Japanese just-in-time parts inventory management made famous by Toyota Motors in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Other {{aspects of}} PR can {{influence}} <b>proportionality</b> {{such as the}} size of the elected body, the choice of open or closed lists, ballot design, and vote counting methods.|$|E
25|$|Louis de Broglie in {{his later}} years {{proposed}} a real valued wave function connected to the complex wave function by a <b>proportionality</b> constant and developed the De Broglie–Bohm theory.|$|E
25|$|The channel {{capacity}} {{is proportional to}} the analog bandwidth in hertz. This <b>proportionality</b> is called Hartley's law. Consequently, the net bit rate is sometimes called digital bandwidth capacity in bit/s.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} of <b>proportionality</b> {{is universal}} and {{independent of the}} system and in 1845 and 1847 was measured by James Joule, who described it as the mechanical equivalent of heat.|$|E
25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} <b>proportionality</b> {{used in a}} retail application in the United States was for motor fuel. Motor fuel (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists {{do not know whether}} they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory <b>proportionality</b> is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel, each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory <b>proportionality</b> minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for motor fuel was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} goal {{of inventory}} <b>proportionality</b> is inventory minimization. By integrating accurate demand forecasting with inventory management, rather than only looking at past averages, {{a much more}} accurate and optimal outcome is expected.|$|E
25|$|In England, Ayres and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell {{is noted}} for his {{reaction}} to them, and warnings of restraint and <b>proportionality.</b> Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.|$|E
25|$|In non-ideal gas {{behavior}} regimen, {{for which}} the van der Waals gas equation would be used, the <b>proportionality</b> is not exact, {{and there is a}} slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{throwing}} is {{not considered}} a deadly force in most countries: in the West firearms are generally not used in crowd or riot dispersals and <b>proportionality</b> of force is the norm, except where immediate danger to life exists.|$|E
25|$|Like Newton, Leonhard Euler presupposed in 1760 {{that the}} {{gravitational}} aether loses density {{in accordance with}} the inverse square law. Similarly to others, Euler also assumed that to maintain mass <b>proportionality,</b> matter consists mostly of empty space.|$|E
25|$|Poiseuille's law {{on blood}} {{circulation}} {{in the body}} is dependent on laminar flow. In turbulent flow the flow rate {{is proportional to the}} square root of the pressure gradient, as opposed to its direct <b>proportionality</b> to pressure gradient in laminar flow.|$|E
25|$|The point-slope form {{expresses the}} fact that the {{difference}} in the y coordinate between two points on a line (that is, y'y1) is proportional to the difference in the x coordinate (that is, x'x1). The <b>proportionality</b> constant is m (the slope of the line).|$|E
