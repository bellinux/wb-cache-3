These organisations include the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission. Below them is the state level, which includes state sporting organisations, state institute of sport and state departments of sport. The last level is district/regional associations and local clubs and community sports along with local government. At the national level, the national sport organisations govern most sports in Australia, with over 120 different national sports organisation overseeing sport in Australia. The role of government in this structure is important as government funding for most sport in Australia comes from the national government, state and territory governments, and local governments. In the late 1990s, government support for sport was double that of <b>public</b> <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} imminent reclassification of credit rating on the decision-making regarding capital structure of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> listed in Latin America. Despite the importance attributed by the market agents {{and the existence of}} empirical evidence of the effect caused by rating in the capital structure of companies in developed countries, this issue is still incipient in Latin-American countries. For this purpose, all the <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporation</b> owners of, at least one corporate rating issued by an international rating agency were taken into account, with the requirement of being listed on a stock exchange in at least one Latin-American country. Through a data panel analysis comprising the period between 2001 and 2010 and by making use of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), the main results that were achieved did not indicate that <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> listed in Latin America, with imminent reclassification of ratings, adopt less debts than those without an imminent reclassification of their ratings.

40|$|Distinguishing pure supply {{effects from}} other {{determinants}} of price and quantity {{in the market}} for loans is a notoriously difficult problem. Using German data, we employ Bayesian vector autoregressive models with sign restrictions on the impulse response functions in order to enquire the role of loan supply and monetary policy shocks for the dynamics of loans to <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations.</b> For the three quarters following the Lehman collapse, we find very strong negative loan supply shocks, while monetary policy was essentially neutral. Nevertheless, the historical decomposition shows a cumulated negative impact of loan supply shocks and monetary policy shocks on loans to <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations,</b> due to the lagged effects of past loan supply and monetary policy shocks. However, these negative effects on loans to <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> are overcompensated by positive other shocks, which implies that loans developed more favorably than implied by the model, over the past few quarters.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} examine the {{aggregate}} national balance-sheets of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in Australia and the G 7 countries {{with a view}} to assessing both their financial structure and their financial position. More importantly, the authors investigate whether the financial position of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> (i. e., debt-to-equity ratio) is material to the economy's investment prospects and whether the importance of this channel differs depending on the structure of corporate financing i. e., bank-based or market-oriented financing structures. Based on a dynamic business investment error-correction model that controls for the opportunity cost of capital and output growth, the authors test the above hypotheses using a quarterly panel dataset of eight developed economies over the 1992 - 2005 period. Their empirical results suggest that the financial position of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> has a statistically significant impact on aggregate business investment growth, although the effect is quantitatively modest. Thus, their findings are consistent with the prediction of models that feature credit market imperfections such as costly information and asymmetric information.
