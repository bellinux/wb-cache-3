40|$|At {{the heart}} of gaining {{stakeholder}} acceptance for any project, but especial socially controversial projects, {{is the need to}} build relationships and maintain a belief among stakeholders that the project's success {{is in the best interest}} of the group. In the nuclear enterprise, previous attempts to engage stakeholders and foster <b>project</b> <b>acceptance</b> have been well designed physically (i. e., technologically sound), but have struggled because they were tone-deaf to the complex, social, political, cognitive and technological factors that play a significant role in the formation of a stakeholder's acceptance of a project. To mitigate societal and cognitive influences on the outcome of socially controversial projects, there is a need to rethink the way project implementers approach complex stakeholder relationships in order to align stakeholder interests, ultimately building a coalition of stakeholders committed to the project's success. Building on system dynamics models of stakeholder acceptance, the work reported here used case study and interview data to identify the fundamental elements of stakeholder relationships that are essential to building mutually beneficial relationships that ultimately lead to project success. These essential elements of stakeholder relationships combined with the physical structure of stakeholder acceptance identified by system dynamics models were used to develop a framework with which to effectively engage stakeholders to build and maintain <b>project</b> <b>acceptance</b> over the life of the project. by David M.

Hence, the method provides values under the assumption of a static and certain world (McSweeney 2006). McCloskey (1991) raises caveat over the seeming sureness and precision of economic models. The article suggests that the inevitability with which such models determine economic values do not account for shocks exogenous to the model constructs, these are influences of genuine and Newtonian uncertainty (McCloskey 1991). As the NPV technique bases decision on a binary rule set, either accept or reject, the method does not address issues such as strategies for waiting or learning. Jensen (1993) highlights the multiple points of failure in corporate internal control mechanisms from {{the selection of the}} Board of Directors, to valuation practices. The article indicates that despite the simplicity of the rule for <b>project</b> <b>acceptance</b> or rejection by the NPV technique, many American Chief Officers accept negative NPV projects (Jensen 1993). This brings into question if the NPV reflects value as practitioners rationally assess a project, or if hubris plays a more significant role in <b>project</b> <b>acceptance.</b> In examining the banking industry, Nordal (2009) uses a Real Options Model to assess the required level of reserve capital for banks. The study forwards that valuation of assets from the NPV method requires banks to provide higher levels of reserve capital. With a Real Options Valuation Model, the paper shows the presence of a waiting value affects asset assessments, in turn requiring a lower reserve capital level (Nordal 2009). Supporting the position that deterministic methods of valuation may improperly value a strategy or resource, Thompson and Barr (2014) compare values from a Real Options model to those from traditional methods of valuation in an ore mining operation. The use of a Real Options model indicates that using traditional valuation methods may create more wasted ore than is optimal (Thompson and Barr 2014).|$|E

The theory suggests that an integrated firm better controls agency problems through manager competition for <b>project</b> <b>acceptance.</b> However, this incorporation mode reduces the ability to receive division-specific project information from the market. Based on this tradeoff, we show that divisions within a conglomerate have different characteristics than stand-alone firms.

Learn how this approach has not only resulted in increased <b>project</b> <b>acceptance</b> and perception, but also in valuable knowledge that can minimize conflicts, avoid costly design rework, and expedite schedules. Longer Abstract: Property impacts are unavoidable with most road construction. Worse, most property owner’s first personal experience with a project is {{when they see a}} person in a safety vest carrying survey equipment across their front yard, or a geotechnical drilling rig pull in their driveway. Imagine instead, sitting down with someone at their kitchen table in the “safety and comfort” of their home, first to discuss the type and timing of activities that will occur during design, property acquisition and construction— reducing the “unknown” in this multi-year process that happens too fast for some and too slowly for others. Not only has this personal approach been shown to reduce property owner anxiety, but it has also helped project teams gain valuable knowledge that can minimize conflicts, avoid costly design rework, and expedite schedules—resulting in increased <b>project</b> <b>acceptance</b> and perception at a comparable overall project cost. This session will provide details on how and when to implement the kitchen table meetings and lessons learned through the development and use of the process on recent major projects. Learning Objectives: After attending this workshop, participants will be better able to: » Alleviate unnecessary property owner anxiety associated with the unknown » Understand how extending a common courtesy can help reduce project conflicts » Recognize the individual differences between each and every affected property owner » Identify potential project challenges early enough to avoid redundancy in work tasks » Implement a customized kitchen table meeting approach that meets the scale of your transportation improvement projec...|$|E
40|$|Underground mine {{projects}} are {{often associated with}} diverse sources of uncertainties. Having the ability to plan for these uncertainties {{plays a key role}} in the process of project evaluation and is increasingly recognized as critical to mining project success. To make the best decision, based on the information available, it is necessary to develop an adequate model incorporating the uncertainty of the input parameters. The model is developed on the basis of full discounted cash flow analysis of an underground zinc mine project. The relationships between input variables and economic outcomes are complex and often nonlinear. Fuzzy-interval grey system theory is used to forecast zinc metal prices while geometric Brownian motion is used to forecast operating costs over the time frame of the project. To quantify the uncertainty in the parameters within a project, such as capital investment, ore grade, mill recovery, metal content of concentrate, and discount rate, we have applied the concept of interval numbers. The final decision related to <b>project</b> <b>acceptance</b> is based on the net present value of the cash flows generated by the simulation over the time project horizon...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{importance}} of urban renewal processes, building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems can potentially provide a crucial response to the energy turnaround challenges. Functioning both as envelope material and electricity generator, they can simultaneously reduce the use of fossil fuels and greenhouse gases emissions while providing savings in materials and electricity costs. However, despite continuous technological and economic progress, the assets of BIPV remain undervalued in the current practice. Various obstacles (technology choice, small volumes, lack of information and good examples) tend to increase the costs and reduce the <b>project</b> <b>acceptance.</b> To overcome these barriers, an interdisciplinary research project developed an approach based on four main phases: 1) selection of archetypal residential buildings, 2) detailed analysis of the buildings, 3) development of renewal design scenarios and 4) multi-criteria assessment of each scenario. Focusing on the architectural-scale, this paper presents design strategies with BIPV solutions of a representative case study realized in Neuchâtel (Switzerland). A multi-criteria assessment of the proposed design scenarios allows comparing the different strategies. It highlights the influence of the design decisions on the final performances, helping us to move towards an optimization of the BIPV surfaces in order to maximize self-consumption regarding the building consumption profile.

Only one of the four projects, the Ketzin project, was successful in proceeding to CO 2 injection and did not elicit local protest. The comparison of the four cases points to differences in project scale and scope, in the perceived risks and benefits and in the communication processes, all of which have possibly influenced <b>project</b> <b>acceptance.</b> The second study investigated and compared the public perception of CO 2 offshore storage, CO 2 onshore storage and CO 2 transport via pipeline based on a national and two regional surveys.

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{model of the}} Subjective Emotional Aspect of Valuation (SEAV) develops guidelines for the measurement, control, and prediction of the emotional response to projects. The SEAV {{is defined as a}} valuation done by the end-user, and is expressed along a desirability scale ranging from “completely unacceptable” to “improvement beyond this point has no additional value”. The essence of this paper is the application of decision-making theories to <b>project</b> <b>acceptance</b> problems; it presents a {{conceptual model}}, or a “box for thinking”. The theoretical framework of this document includes theories and findings from various fields of knowledge. The main difference of the SEAV model from alternative findings is that the Reference Point measures are included in the list of parameters. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the overwhelming majority of problems involving the emotional acceptance of a project revolve not around its implementation, but the product or service design. The research described in this paper suggests an additional parameter that substantially affects a project’s vitality, {{especially in the case of}} projects with a wide stakeholder base: it is the stakeholders’ SEAV of the project that is important. The conceptual model of SEAV provides tools to measure, to predict and to evaluate the stakeholders’ emotional valuation in the early stages of the project, beginning at product or service design. Although this research should be developed further, it already provides useful tools for use in project management practice, and appears applicable to different areas of management...|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study examine the discursive and pedagogical practices {{of a group}} of immigrant Latina mothers in Los Angeles who teach a workshop series that engages Latina/o parents and community members in conversations about queer Latina/o issues. The LGBT <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Project</b> is an LGBT curriculum designed and taught by the Promotoras of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles. For the dissertation study, I was interested in how the Promotoras engaged parents and community members in conversations about gender, race and sexuality within a Latina/o context. I was also interested in the identities of the Promotoras as women who work for Planned Parenthood and their roles as advocates and allies for queer communities. Two research questions guided this study: 1) What are the pedagogical and discursive practices that inform the Promotoras teaching of the LGBT <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Project?</b> 2) How do the Promotoras understand their ally identity and how does this inform their teaching and daily lives as heterosexual Latina allies engaged in queer activism? Interviews and observations were the two sources of data collection used in the study. I conducted three interviews with each of the Promotoras who teach the LGBT <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Project.</b> The interviews focused on their life histories, their pedagogical approaches to their teaching of the LGBT <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Project</b> and their identities as advocates and allies for queer communities. I also collected observation data from seven workshop series. Adapting the work of Kumashiro (2000) on anti-oppressive teaching strategies, I documented four types of exchanges within the workshop series I argue lead to new understandings about power and oppression, within a Latina/o context. 	The first chapter in the dissertation that describes my findings addresses the Promotoras identities as allies and advocates for queer youth. I begin the chapter with introductory portraits of each of the Promotoras. The portraits are followed by narratives of three Promotoras that offered distinct experiences of how they understand their identities as allies and advocates for queer communities. 	The second chapter describes my findings where I discuss the different ways Maria Felix engaged parents in conversations about queer communities. Within the workshop space, several tools and techniques are used by Maria Felix that create different opportunities for parents to engage in conversations about queer communities. Three themes within the teaching emerged from my observations. The first is the LGBTQ Experience and Becoming Allies, which addressed how parents came to understand the experiences of queer youth and how they saw their roles as advocates and allies. The second theme is Relational and Intersectional Understanding of the Queer Latina/o Experience, focused on how Maria Felix gets parents to understand the intersectional forms of oppression queer Latina/o youth experience. The final theme, Humanizing Queer Latina/o Youth, demonstrates the different ways Maria Felix tries to evoke feelings of empathy and compassion from parents for queer communities. 		In the final chapter of the dissertation, I discuss several of the challenges and tensions in doing queer Latina/o advocacy work and offer some approaches the Promotoras can take to create more critical spaces when engaging in conversations about race, gender and sexuality. I conclude the dissertation with conversation on what I am calling a “community-based model for queer of color praxis work in education” and how I believe the Promotoras work and teaching of the LGBT <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Project</b> provides one example of how we approach a community-based model to queer of color praxis work in education...|$|R
