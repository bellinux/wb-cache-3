50|$|A {{widespread}} {{misuse of}} scratchcards is the free-of-charge distribution of cards offering {{a range of}} prizes, ranging from extremely low-value to very desirable; for example from time-limited discount vouchers redeemable only through a specified agent to cars. Cards always reveal that a prize has been won, but the nature and value of the prize can only be determined by phoning a <b>premium</b> <b>rate</b> <b>telephone</b> claim line costing a significant sum per minute. Calls to this number are designed by the promoter always to take several minutes, and the prize won is, in reality, always of far less value {{than the cost of}} the call, and usually not worth claiming. Regulatory authorities for <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> have been taking action against such schemes, issuing warnings and large fines.|$|R

40|$|<b>Premium</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>rates,</b> {{population}} density, and {{the grade}} of <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> that rural customers choose all vary with {{distance from the}} nearest urban center. A survey of 3800 rural subscribers determined their choice of service for alternative prices given {{the addition of a}} new service. A two-stage probit model was used to estimate the new market shares {{for a wide range of}} conditions. The model was applied, as part of a large-scale revenue/cost simulation system, to the current and forecasted distribution of customers to evaluate the economic impact of numerous pricing and provisioning possibilities. ...|$|R
40|$|The USA has steadfastly {{held to a}} flat <b>rate</b> {{for local}} <b>telephone</b> <b>service,</b> whereas most other {{countries}} are characterized by a user-sensitive (measured service) system of pricing. Economic theory suggests some method of measured service pricing more accurately reflects the true costs of local service. This article seeks {{to determine how many}} US consumers could be induced to switch to measured service pricing, and using ordinary least squares, derives a model of the demand for measured service. The factors are identified that will induce the US population to move towards a measured service rate structure. The findings indicate that consumers are quite responsive to both relative price (between a local flat rate and a measured <b>service</b> <b>rate)</b> and advertising. <b>Telephone</b> <b>service</b> + USA Service pricing Ordinary least squares method...|$|R
50|$|Georgia's Telecommunication and Competition Development Act of 1995 and the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{have greatly}} {{affected}} {{the telecommunications industry}} in Georgia. Both statutes sought to turn the traditional regulated monopoly service into a competitive market. Thus the commission no longer sets <b>rates</b> for <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> but establishes and administers a universal access fund, which ensures reasonable access to services for customers; monitors rates and service quality; and mediates disputes between competitors. By the end of 2003 the number of certificated local competitive telephone exchange providers had grown to 221.|$|R
50|$|During the New Deal, {{attempts}} were made to stop cutthroat competition. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) was a short-lived program in 1933-35 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business, the New Deal policymakers federal and state regulation—controlling the <b>rates</b> and <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> provided by American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T), for example—and by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions.|$|R
40|$|Recent FCC {{decisions}} {{constitute a}} threat to the traditional principles of US telecommunications policy. Having outlined those principles, the author considers the issue of competition, stresses the need for a unified system, and describes the economic effects of a continuation of FCC policies. Division of responsibility, duplication of facilities, and increases in <b>rates</b> for basic <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> are seen as consequences which will militate against the efficiency and availability of US telecommunications. ...|$|R
