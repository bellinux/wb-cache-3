40|$|Age-dependent leaf {{senescence}} {{and cell}} death in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) requires {{activation of the}} transcription factor ORESARA 1 (ORE 1) and is not initiated prior to a leaf age of 28 d. Here, we investigate the conditional execution of events that regulate early senescence and cell death in senescence-associated ubiquitin ligase 1 (saul 1) mutants, deficient in the PLANT U-BOX-ARMADILLO E 3 ubiquitin ligase SAUL 1. In saul 1 mutants challenged with low light, the switch of age-dependent cell death was turned on prematurely, {{as indicated by the}} accumulation of ORE 1 transcripts, induction of the senescence marker gene SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE 12, and cell death. However, ORE 1 accumulation by itself was not sufficient to cause saul 1 phenotypes, as demonstrated by double mutant analysis. Exposure of saul 1 mutants to low light for only 24 h did not result in visible symptoms of senescence; however, the senescence-promoting transcription factor genes WRKY 53, WRKY 6, and NAC-LIKE ACTIVATED BY AP 3 /PI were up-regulated, indicating that senescence in saul 1 seedlings was already initiated. To resolve the time course of gene expression, microarray experiments were performed at narrow intervals. Differential expression of the genes involved in salicylic acid and defense mechanisms were the earliest events detected, suggesting a central role for salicylic acid in saul 1 senescence and cell death. The salicylic acid content increased in low-light-treated saul 1 mutants, and application of exogenous salicylic acid was indeed sufficient to trigger saul 1 senescence in <b>permissive</b> <b>light</b> conditions. Double mutant analyses showed that PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD 4) but not NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES 1 (NPR 1) is essential for saul 1 phenotypes. Our results indicate that saul 1 senescence depends on the PAD 4 -dependent salicylic acid pathway but does not require NPR 1 signaling...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{populations of}} Chlamydomonas were {{selected}} in Light (photoautotrophic) or Dark (heterotrophic) environments. Each population was a clone, {{founded by a}} single spore and propagated vegetatively thereafter. A heterogeneous environment was simulated by mixing Light and Dark lines in each growth cycle and redistributing them between the two environ-ments in the next cycle. Some lines maintained permanently in the Dark evolved greatly increased growth within fewer than 300 generations, {{at the expense of}} reduced growth in the Light. Lines maintained in both Light and Dark environments evolved a negative genetic correlation between Light and Dark growth, and displayed more genetic variance of fitness than lines maintained in either environment exclusively. It is possible that genetic variance near mutationâ€“selection balance is greater in heterogeneous environments because selection is weaker. However, the evolution of distinctly specialized lineages in these experiments suggests that in the conditions of batch culture a cost of adaptation creates negative frequency-depend-ent selection that maintains genetic variance. Genetic variance was greater in the more <b>permissive</b> environment (<b>Light)</b> than in the more restrictive environment (Dark) ...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{accounts}} for nearly 1 {{out of every}} 4 deaths in the United States, and because conventional treatments are limited by morbidity and off-target toxicities, improvements in cancer management are needed. This thesis further develops nanoparticle-assisted photothermal therapy (NAPT) as a viable treatment option for cancer patients. NAPT enables localized ablation of disease because heat generation only occurs where tissue <b>permissive</b> near-infrared (NIR) <b>light</b> and absorbing nanoparticles are combined, leaving surrounding normal tissue unharmed. Two principle approaches were investigated to improve the specificity of this technique: multimodal imaging and molecular targeting. Multimodal imaging affords the ability to guide NIR laser application for site-specific NAPT and more holistic characterization of disease by combining the advantages of several diagnostic technologies. Towards the goal of image-guided NAPT, gadolinium-conjugated gold-silica nanoshells were engineered and demonstrated to enhance imaging contrast {{across a range of}} diagnostic modes, including T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging, X-Ray, optical coherence tomography, reflective confocal microscopy, and two-photon luminescence in vitro as well as within an animal tumor model. Additionally, the nanoparticle conjugates were shown to effectively convert NIR light to heat for applications in photothermal therapy. Therefore, the broad utility of gadolinium-nanoshells for anatomic localization of tissue lesions, molecular characterization of malignancy, and mediators of ablation was established. Molecular targeting strategies may also improve NAPT by promoting nanoparticle uptake and retention within tumors and enhancing specificity when malignant and normal tissue interdigitate. Here, ephrinA 1 protein ligands were conjugated to nanoshell surfaces for particle homing to overexpressed EphA 2 receptors on prostate cancer cells. In vitro, successful targeting and subsequent photothermal ablation of prostate cancer cells was achieved with negligible nanoshell binding to normal cells. In vivo however, ephrinA 1 -nanoshells did not promote enhanced therapeutic outcomes in mice bearing subcutaneous prostate cancer tumors treated with NAPT compared to nontargeted particles. Nonetheless, both treatment groups demonstrated effective ablation of prostate tumors, as evidenced by tumor tissue regression. Further investigation is warranted to overcome probable protein immunogenicity that offsets ephrinA 1 targeting in vivo. With future study, photothermal therapy with multimodal gadolinium-conjugated and molecularly targeted nanoshells may offer a viable treatment option for cancer patients in the clinic...|$|R
