2500|$|In {{the last}} years of World War II, {{aircraft}} engines that exceeded a specific horsepower of greater than 1.0, were equipped first with distributed fuel injection and later with direct injection, which became the fuel system of choice. Using the same principles as the pressure carburetor to measure air flow into the engine, the distributed fuel injection system used individual fuel lines to each cylinder, injecting the fuel at the intake port. [...] The direct-injection systems differed only in that it injected the fuel directly into the cylinder head, much like a diesel engine fuel system. These fuel control devices were individually sized and calibrated to fit almost all piston aircraft engines used by both civil and allied military aircraft made in the post war era.

50|$|For {{several decades}} from the 1970s to early 2000s, the focus in {{designing}} high <b>performance</b> <b>general</b> purpose CPUs was largely on achieving high ILP through {{technologies such as}} pipelining, caches, superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, etc. This trend culminated in large, power-hungry CPUs such as the Intel Pentium 4. By the early 2000s, CPU designers were thwarted from achieving higher performance from ILP techniques due to the growing disparity between CPU operating frequencies and main memory operating frequencies as well as escalating CPU power dissipation owing to more esoteric ILP techniques.|$|E

5000|$|Irish stepdance is a {{style of}} {{performance}} dance with its roots in traditional Irish dance. It is generally characterized by a stiff upper body and quick and precise movements of the feet. It can be performed solo or in groups. Aside from public dance performances, there are also stepdance competitions all over the world. These competitions are often called [...] "Feis'" [...] which is short for Feiseanna. In Irish dance culture, Feisenna is a traditional Gaelic arts and culture festival. Costumes are considered important for stage presence in competition and performance Irish stepdance. In many cases, costumes are sold at high prices and can even be custom made. Males and females can both perform Irish stepdance {{but for the most}} part in today's society, the dance remains predominantly female. This means that the costumes are mainly dresses. Each dress is different, with varying colors and patterns, designed to attract the judge's eye in competitions and the audience's eye in <b>performance.</b> <b>General</b> appearance besides the costume is also equally important. Many dancers invest in curled wigs that match their hair color but add to the effect of a traditional Irish dancer. Poodle Socks are worn with the dresses and shoes. These are white socks that stretch to mid calf with ribs in them to keep the strings of the shoes tied up on the leg.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects that}} work has on {{individuals}} are not unknown. The importance {{of work in}} terms of the subjective well-being and growth of individuals through their work, however, is not as extensively discussed and documented. Risk factors and unhealthy factors have long been discussed at the expense of positive conditions for well-being and personal growth. We like to call work with that type of potential regenerative work. Hence, that is the type of work that we have chosen to focus on in this study. The following research objectives have guided us through the study: Which everyday work processes may contribute to sustainable prerequisites for the subjective well-being and growth of individuals? The study takes an explorative approach to two workplaces - a care unit at a hospital and a manufacturing company. Our aim is to increase the understanding of prerequisites for the well-being and growth of individuals through their work. Three themes emerged in this type of regenerative work: <b>performance,</b> <b>general</b> overview and participation, and dialogue. These themes are problemised by looking at their potential in relation to the organisation of the work. Prerequisites for <b>performance,</b> <b>general</b> overview and participation, and finally dialogue prove to be more efficient in contexts where the complexity of the work and organisation is acknowledged and where there is room for inter-subjective sense-making and self-organising...|$|E
