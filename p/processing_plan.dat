40|$|We {{review the}} {{literature}} on crop-related agri-chains. Contrary to existing reviews, {{we focus on the}} integration, or lack thereof, of harvesting and <b>processing</b> <b>planning</b> and related inventory control issues. Since crops are particularly prone to deterioration after harvesting and before <b>processing,</b> integrated <b>planning</b> is essential to minimize food waste and maximize food quality. Our study reveals that most authors have focused on either harvesting or <b>processing</b> <b>planning</b> and less on their integration. If integration is considered, typically not all parts of a chain are incorporated. Planning of harvesting and processing is studied from operations, and from agricultural economics, but these fields hardly relate. Moreover, although relevant aspects of both harvesting and <b>processing</b> <b>planning</b> have been discussed, (integrated) models reflect reality to a limited extend and {{there is a lack of}} empirical testing. Further research should develop more comprehensive, realistic models. In order to apply such models empirically, heuristic solution approaches should also be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|We study {{reachability}} and deadlock detection {{questions in}} multi-stage scheduling systems. The jobs have partially ordered <b>processing</b> <b>plans</b> that dictate {{the order in}} which the job passes through the machines. Our results draw a sharp borderline between tractable and intractable cases of these questions: certain types of <b>processing</b> <b>plans</b> (that we call unconstrained and source-constrained) lead to algorithmically tractable problems, whereas all remaining <b>processing</b> <b>plans</b> lead to NP-hard problems. We give conditions under which safe system states can be recognized in polynomial time, and we prove that without these conditions the recognition of safe system states is NP-hard. We show that deciding reachability of a given state is essentially equivalent to deciding safety. Finally, we establish NP-hardness of deciding whether the system can ever fall into a deadlock state...|$|R

50|$|The central {{challenge}} around MobiCon {{is simultaneously}} supporting numerous applications using very limited resources. Furthermore, these available resources dynamically change {{due to their}} wearable forms and the user’s mobility. Also, resource usage by running applications or environmental factors such as interference continuously affects the resource availability.These challenges require system level support. Each application must efficiently share the limited resources. Without system-level support, however, each individual application has an extremely limited view of the existence or resource uses of other applications, and further cannot negotiate with the concurrent applications for coordinated and efficient resource utilization. MobiCon helps applications share resources and processing by seamlessly adapting the applications to dynamic resource availability by resolving resource contention between applications or selecting the best <b>processing</b> <b>plan</b> according to the resource availability at that time. The MobiCon Middleware Computing Platform can seamlessly adapt the resources committed to each application so that all system resources can be used the most efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{there are}} two {{segments}} of the highway that run more east and west and one that runs north and south. The southern terminus of SH 112 is at exit 343 of Interstate 20 within the city limits of Eastland. Continuing east from the frontage road is Farm to Market Road 570. SH 112 travels west along East Main Street through a commercialized area surrounding the interchange. After crossing the Leon River, it enters downtown Eastland and intersects SH 6 at Seaman Street. SH 6 travels south and west from this point, while SH 112 continues north along North Seaman Street. It crosses the Leon River again and passes the entrance to Eastland Municipal Airport and exits the city limits. SH 112 continues north through the barren lands of Eastland County before curving to the west northwest in the unincorporated community of Morton Valley. In Morton Valley, SH 112 intersects the western terminus of Farm to Market Road 101. After passing a radio tower and a gas <b>processing</b> <b>plan,</b> the highway ends at a stop-controlled intersection with U.S. Route 183.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{integrated}} approach {{for the formation}} of parts and machine families in group technology is developed. The integrated approach is used to solve cell formation, process planning, and production planning simultaneously. The given information is part processing sequence, part production volume, part alternative <b>processing</b> <b>plans,</b> and part <b>processing</b> times. The approach is used to determine the machine-part cells and part <b>processing</b> <b>plans,</b> while the total intercell part flow is minimized. Also, the convergence of the algorithm is investigated. The approach goes across and beyond the group technology methods by considering sequencing, production planning, process planning, and part-machine cellular information simultaneously. Two methods are investigated: exact (optimal) and heuristic. The approach first solves an integer programming problem to find <b>processing</b> <b>plans</b> and then uses a procedure to form the machine-part cells. The proposed approach solves the problem iteratively until a set of plans for machinepart cell formations is obtained with minimal intercell part flow or interflow cost. An example is presented to explain the developed approach. Experimental results are also provided. An extension of the approach for solving the operations planning of an emergency room is also covered. In this extension of the approach, the application of cell formation provides a solution to efficiently managing patients and utilizing resources. By grouping patients by their needed medical procedures, time and resource efficiency is accomplished. An application to ER of University Hospitals of Case Western Reserve University is given...|$|R
