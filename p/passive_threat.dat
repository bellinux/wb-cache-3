5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from <b>passive</b> <b>threat</b> displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

40|$|The Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is {{ubiquitous}} emerging {{broadband wireless}} network. However, the open wireless medium, multi-hop multi-radio architecture and ad-hoc connectivity amongst end-users are such characteristics {{which increases the}} vulnerabilities of WMN towards many passive and active attacks. A secure network ensures the confidentiality, integrity and availability of wireless network. Integrity and availability is compromised by active attacks, while the confidentiality of end-users traffic is compromised by passive attacks. Passive attacks are silent in nature and do not harm the network traffic or normal network operations, therefore very difficult to detect. However, passive attacks lay down a foundation for later launching an active attack. In this article, we discuss the vulnerable features and possible <b>passive</b> <b>threats</b> in WMN along with current security mechanisms as well as future research directions.

40|$|Passive Internet {{monitoring}} is {{a powerful}} tool for measuring and characterizing interesting network activity like worms or distributed denial of service attacks. By employing statistical analysis on the captured network traffic, Internet threat monitors gain valuable insight into the nature of Internet threats. In the past, these monitors have been successfully used not only to detect DoS attacks or worm outbreaks but also to monitor worm propagation trends and other malicious activities on the Internet. Today, <b>passive</b> Internet <b>threat</b> monitors are widely recognized as an important technology for detecting and understanding anomalies on the Internet in a macroscopic way. Unfortunately, monitors that publish their results on the Internet provide a feedback loop that can be used by adversaries to deduce a monitor’s sensor locations. Knowledge of a monitor’s sensor location can severely reduce its functionality as the captured data may have been tampered with and can no longer be trusted. This paper describes algorithms for detecting which address spaces an Internet threat monitor listens to and presents empirical evidences that they are successful in locating the sensor positions of monitors deployed on the Internet. We also present solutions to make <b>passive</b> Internet <b>threat</b> monitors "harder to detect". ...|$|R
40|$|Mobility changes anonymity: new <b>passive</b> <b>threats</b> {{in mobile}} ad hoc {{networks}} Privacy in mobile ad hoc networks has new semantics {{in addition to}} the conventional notions for infrastructure networks. Mobility enabled by wireless communication has significantly changed privacy issues and anonymity research in many ways. In particular, mobility requires ad hoc routing schemes to transmit messages frequently in an open wireless medium. The routing traffic facilitates adversaries in conducting various attacks threatening the network security and privacy. In this work, we focus on passive routing attacks. We present an extensive study on new anonymity threats and classify the corresponding security demands into three new categories: (1) venue anonymity; (2) privacy of ad hoc network topology; and (3) privacy of motion pattern. These new aspects are all introduced by mobility and left unaddressed in fixed infrastructure. This leads us to investigate new design principles. Our study suggests that on-demand routing, identity-free routing, and neighborhood traffic mixing are better design choices to defend against the new anonymity threats in mobile networks. The paper also demonstrates through examples on the visualization of the mobile anonymity attacks and on the quantification of th...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive {{behaviour}} between {{females of}} the same species is not widely documented, particularly in marine vertebrates. During a 3 yr in-water survey at the temperate loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta breeding area of Zakynthos, Greece, female–female interactions comprised 4 % of all female loggerhead sighting events (n = 60 out of 1449 events). Male–female interactions comprised an additional 4 % of sighting events, while 92 % were of solitary females. The structure of interactions was analysed for 58 of these sighting events, each lasting an average of 3. 4 min (SD ± 1) and comprising a total of 3. 1 h observation time. We found that interactions involved ritualized escalation in behaviour from <b>passive</b> <b>threat</b> displays (e. g. head–tail circling) to aggressive combat (e. g. sparring). We suggest that circling individuals evaluate opponent size, sparring individuals test opponent strength, and that the positioning of the prehensile tail signals motivational intent to either escalate or abort. The presence of intruder females triggered a passive response in 100 % of events involving basking and swimming turtles (n = 19); although residents resting on the seabed only responded on 69 % of occasions (n = 27), their response was almost 4 times more likely to escalate to one of aggression. Our results suggest that certain sites may be preferentially sought after and defended by sea turtles...|$|E
40|$|Human {{judgment}} and decision-making (JDM) requires {{an assessment of}} different choice options. While traditional theories of choice argue that cognitive processes are the main driver to reach a decision, growing evidence {{highlights the importance of}} emotion in decision-making. Following these findings, it appears relevant to understand how individuals asses the attractiveness or riskiness of a situation in terms of emotional processes. The following study aims at {{a better understanding of the}} psychophysiological mechanisms underlying threat sensitivity by measuring skin conductance responses (SCRs) in <b>passive</b> <b>threat</b> situations. While previous studies demonstrate the role of magnitude on emotional body reactions preceding an outcome, this study focuses on probability. In order to analyze emotional body reactions preceding negative events with varying probability of occurrence, we have our participants play a two-stage card game. The first stage of the card game reveals the probability of receiving an unpleasant electric shock. The second stage applies the electric shock with the previously announced probability. For the analysis, we focus on the time interval between the first and second stage. We observe a linear relation between SCRs in anticipation of receiving an electric shock and shock probability. This finding indicates that SCRs are able to code the likelihood of negative events. We outline how this coding function of SCRs during the anticipation of negative events might add to an understanding of human JDM...|$|E
40|$|In current warfare {{scenario}} stealth and <b>passive</b> <b>threat</b> detection {{capabilities are}} considered as prime requirements to accomplish desired mission by the fighter aircrafts. To improve the stealth of an aircraft, {{the trend is}} towards detecting threats {{with the help of}} passive sensors (Electro Optic or Infrared). Current situation caters for systems like Infra-red Search and Track (IRST) and Passive Missile Warning Systems (PMWS). IRST system is a passive target detection system, used for detecting aerial & ground targets. PMWS is a threat detection system used for detecting missiles approaching towards aircraft. Both of these systems detect targets of interest by processing IR images acquired in mid-IR region. The prime challenge in IRST system or PMWS is detecting a moving target of size typically 1 ~ 2 pixels in acquired image sequences. The temporal change caused by moving target in consecutive frames can be considered as one important factor to detect them. The temporal change caused by moving target is identified through absolute frame differencing of successive frames. This principle has limitation in application to IRST & PMWS as the imaging sensor with the aircraft is moving. This motion also imparts temporal change in the acquired images. In this paper authors are proposing a method for removing the temporal change caused by the platform motion in two consequently acquired frames using registration process.   The proposed method uses the platform attitude information at frame sampling times. Authors have analyzed the sensitivity of registration process to noisy platform attitude information. Defence Science Journal, 2014,  64 (2), pp. 130 - 135.   DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Mobile {{wireless}} networks, such as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), {{are vulnerable}} to <b>passive</b> attacks that <b>threat</b> the privacy of communications. Moreover, threats can now be launched from mobile platforms and with new techniques for eavesdropping, locating and fingerprinting wireless transmis-sions. Recently many wireless anonymous schemes have been studied, and mobility often {{plays an important role}} in regards to the effectiveness of wireless anonymity. In this paper, we focus on the impact of node motion behaviors. We first illustrate the emerging anonymity threat of “venue privacy attacks ” to trace mobile wireless nodes. We then propose “motion-MIX ” as the countermeasure to defend against the threat. Motion-MIX calls for protection at all the layers of the protocol stack. We further use a new asymptotic security model to verify motion-MIX’s effectiveness against venue privacy attacks. In a scalable ad hoc network, we prove that the probability of security breach is negligible with respect to the number of network nodes. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} two interrelated {{aspects of}} banking crises: {{the choices that}} banks make between actively pursuing satisfaction of their claims in default versus passively rolling over loans; and choices by regulators to "punish" passive and insolvent banks versus rescuing them. Because a bank's actions may signal its poor financial condition or because a bank may wish to gamble for resurrection, a bank with financial problems may choose to passively roll over its bad loans rather than to initiate bankruptcy against a defaulter. Regulators can {{play a crucial role}} in preventing creditor passivity, through their ex ante choice of monitoring capability and through their ex post choice of policy for insolvent or passive banks. Increasing the degree of monitoring, together with the threat of ex post punishment for passive behavior, can lower the level of passivity. Yet, if too many banks are discovered to be passive or insolvent, a situation labeled "too many-to-fail" (TMTF) may arise, whereby it is less costly to rescue banks than to close large numbers of banks or to fire the bank managers. Banks may implicitly collude through their choice of actions in order to trigger TMTF. One result of the analysis is that attempts by the regulator to offer rescue in order to induce insolvent banks to use bankruptcy against their defaulters and to reveal their insolvency may fail if ex ante monitoring capability is too weak or if the recapitalization accompanying rescue is not sufficiently generous. Rescue and recapitalization may thus need to be repeated in the future. Another principal result is that the regulator may react to the possibility of banks' triggering TNTFF by "softening," either ex ante by lowering monitoring capacity or, ex post by rescuing insolvent and <b>passive</b> banks. The <b>threat</b> of TMTF may thus make it impossible for the regulator to implement tough banking regulation. ...|$|R

Secondly, the study considers initiatives to be undertaken by the construction industry to enhance the environment so as to promote sustainable development. The research mixed methods was used as the form of collecting required data. The collection of data comprised of the design and administration of open-ended and closed-ended questionnaires among a non-random selected population of building contractor, public works officials and practising Architectural firms within the City of Cape Town. The data obtained from open-ended questionnaire on building contractors and public works officials was analysed qualitatively and data from the closed-ended questionnaires through practising Architectural firms was analysed quantitatively. Research results showed that biodiversity in the City of Cape Town is under <b>threat.</b> <b>Passive</b> design has a significant role in protecting the biodiversity and should be encouraged by the construction industry and the City of Cape Town.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionToday, with {{advances in}} the technology of weapons and military equipment, urban areas are most at risk of invasion. Among {{the most important factors}} in enhancing human casualties in military attacks on urban areas, one can point to the unrealistic architecture of houses which does not conform to principles such as optimal site selection and layout of the structure of human settlements, proper distribution, principles of concealment, camouflage and deception, the high degree of vulnerability of buildings and interior architecture of buildings with regard to passive defense. Structural arrangement of spaces and their connection with surrounding areas has created great opportunities for saving lives And improves system performance and reduces its vulnerability. This study with a descriptive-qualitative approach, investigates the role of passive defense in urban housing planning and the conclusions are used to create safe city, strong city and deterrent city. Results show that determining the geometric design of house, pop location, availability and predictability of secure spaces are regarded as multi-functional space for each building in times of peace and war are among the optimal components of building architecture and vernacular architecture {{from the perspective of a}} <b>passive</b> defense. Crises, <b>threats</b> and disasters are classified into two main categories: natural, including earthquakes, floods, landslides, droughts and human category such as war, accidents and diseases which are more than 50 types. The main objective of this study is investigating crisis caused by war in residential areas. In the full-scale military conflicts, one of the ultimate goals of the parties involved is making an effort to bring the breadth and scope of the battlefield to civilian centers especially to urban centers, which is usually accompanied by heavy air strikes. This act is one of the most effective strategies in the fate of wars. Dragging wars to residential areas is usually accompanied by extensive damage and high human casualties and if there is no planning at macro measures in peacetime, during the war casualties would be double and it would bring terrible psychological burden for politicians and top military commanders. Among the main factors increasing the number of people killed and injured in the military attacks we can point to security attacks and natural and unexpected disasters occurring in urban areas and the high vulnerability of buildings which are resulted from the improper planning of housing, inadequate spatial layout and structured problems, construction engineering problems (unsafe structures and fortifications), inappropriate architecture (not anticipating the shelter, open spaces, etc.), non-standard communication networks and etc. Thus, regarding key principles underlying passive defense in buildings can be considered as bedrock for the development of sustainable security in urban areas. Another major cause of casualties in urban warfare is the population growth in urban areas due to excessive migration and unplanned growth of non-standard and unsafe human settlements in the margin of urban areas (e. g. Tehran metropolitan). So that in 1900, 29 % of the world population lived in urban areas and in 1950, this rate increased to 49 % and according to UN statistics; in 2010 this percentage was more than 75 % (Vautravers, 2010, p. 438). 2 - Theoretical basesThe main objective of this study was to investigate and analyze structural and architectural factors affecting patterns of planning and design of housing in urban areas in order to deal with the effects of enemy invasion to residential areas and based on this, the hypothesis of the study has been developed which seems that the optimal pattern of planning of urban settlements and giving priority to housing planning based on defensive architecture and passive defense principles are among the major factors in reducing casualties and financial losses in residential areas during the crisis. The research method was descriptive - analytical. Data were gathered and analyzed through sources and documents available in libraries. 3 – DiscussionUrban housingHousing is one of the affective indicators in the mortality caused by military invasion to the cities. Since housing is known as the basic of urban fabric. The housing issue is broad and complex and has various dimensions. Housing has a physical location and is regarded as a shelter, basic and primary need of individuals. In this shelter, some of the family or individual's primary needs such as food, rest, and protection against environmental conditions are met (Pourmohammadi, 2009, 3). Housing planning is part of the urban planning in which residential units are considered as part of the deformed and adopted spaces which will be considered with regard to their subjects in the housing planning framework. Based on this, housing planning deals with allocating habitable spaces to needs of residential housing and paying attention to the limitation of resources and the use of special techniques, theories with social, cultural, political and economic frameworks. Passive defense principles in the design and construction of urban human settlementsDefensive architecture of the building is presented in order to get ready for more attacks against military and other natural disasters. Passive defense considerations in housing are crystallized in three categories of architecture, structural strength and installations. In architecture, attending principles such as optimal site selection and layout of buildings, the proper dispersion, observing such principles as camouflage, concealment and deception principles and high-grade restoration of interior architecture of buildings is important (Faraji Mollaei and Azimi, 2011, 998). The structural arrangement and connection with surrounding areas has provided great resources to save lives and has improved the system performance and reduced its vulnerability. Determining the geometric design, pop location, availability and predicting secure spaces as multiple performance spaces for each building in peacetime and war are the responsibility of architects. Architects should design the space to suit the needs of the user so that in addition to the defensive performance in the time of war, it has appropriate use in time of peace (21 st issue of the National Building Regulations, 2009, 3 - 4). The structural aspect of buildings deals with how to design the building to resist the explosive loads. This work is the responsibility of Structural Engineers. In order to have the right structural system and choosing the appropriate section of the building for secure space, architectural plans must be coordinated with the structural issue. In the facility sector, it is to prevent the damage caused by the blast effects, such as gas leaks, flooding, electrical hazards, fire and installing alarm system. Limited utilization capacity or variability of building facility systems consistent with the desired performance is considered by facilities engineers. 4 - Conclusion Urban housing planning must be designed and implemented under this title. In addition to attending the social, economic and security issues, it should seek to achieve the goal of increasing the nation's capacity to deal with threats and potential harms and to promote empowerment and national tolerance for dealing with emergency situations. From the discussed issue, we can conclude that it is possible to decrease the severity and extent of damage caused by enemy attacks during crises cassette through applying appropriate architecture measures with a defensive approach, considering the 16 principles of passive defense consistent with the physical and special properties of cities and especially in urban residential areas, while creating beautiful spaces without compromising space and their functionality and without spending too much cost. This work involves the national resolute determination of relevant organizations which is possible with the cooperation and synergy of organizations. 5 - Suggestions In order to reach housing programs with an appropriate level of safety based on passive defense principles the following suggestions are offered: Comprehensive housing plan for the development of quality of buildings along its quantitative development. Considering the safety of the buildings. Preparation of passive defense guidelines based on safe housing planning. Compilation of architectural document requirements in the design of buildings with passive defense approach. Planning for reducing physical instability of residential buildings in the historic fabric and marginal areas. Paying special attention to textures and old residential areas in central cities, and granting support from government facilities for strengthening, upgrading and refurbishment of old buildings.
