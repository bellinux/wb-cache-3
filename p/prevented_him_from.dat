5|$|Though {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the leading}} goalkeepers of his era, he never played for his native country. Trautmann met with the German national coach, Sepp Herberger, in 1953, who explained that travel and political implications <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he were playing in a German league. Consequently, Trautmann's international isolation <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> playing in the 1954 World Cup, in which his countrymen were victorious. Trautmann's only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players in the Football League representative team for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.|$|E
5|$|Under the new constitution, each of Kentucky's {{legislative}} districts chose an elector, {{and these}} electors voted {{to choose the}} governor. Both Logan and Garrard were chosen as electors from their respective counties. On the first ballot, Logan received the votes of 21 electors, Garrard received 17, and Todd received 14. A lone elector cast his vote for John Brown, a Frankfort attorney who would soon be elected to the U.S. Senate. Some speculated that Garrard's moral character <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> voting for himself, but his political acumen <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> voting for a rival, so he voted for Brown, who had not declared his candidacy. No proof exists {{that this was the}} case, however.|$|E

5|$|However, Balfour's need {{to liaise}} with the 2nd Duke of Westminster, {{who had just}} {{inherited}} the Grosvenor Estate, <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> joining his force when they travelled to South Africa {{at the end of}} 1899.

5|$|William Hickling Prescott (May 4, 1796â€“ January 28, 1859) was an American {{historian}} and Hispanist, who is widely recognized by historiographers {{to have been}} the first American scientific historian.

5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{remaining}} empty, the castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it to be used for public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
5|$|After basic {{training}} in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, Flanagan auditioned as a pianist for an army show. He got the role, which <b>prevented</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> {{being sent to}} the Korean War at that time; approximately a year later, however, he was sent to Kunsan, with the war ongoing. There, he worked as a motion-picture-projector operator. After two years' service he was discharged and returned to Detroit, where he soon became pianist at the Blue Bird again. He again worked with Burrell, as well as Donald Byrd and Yusef Lateef, among others.|$|E
