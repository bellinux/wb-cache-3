5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping symptoms that can make the classification difficult in individual cases. All types have partial forms.

5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of <b>people</b> <b>experience</b> a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E

Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many <b>people</b> <b>experience</b> fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} culture has been {{important}} for centuries, as <b>people</b> <b>experience</b> the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to the sea {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nationalist}} tensions {{arise in}} the 19th century, with {{the outbreak of the}} First Serbian Uprising in present-day central Serbia. The Turks construct a blockhouse on the bridge, decorating it with stakes on which they pin the heads of suspected rebels. One evening, the blockhouse burns down. In the ensuing decades, as the Ottoman Empire continues to decline, Bosnia is ravaged by plague. After the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Serbia and Montenegro become fully independent countries. Austria-Hungary receives a right to occupy Bosnia-Herzegovina and turns it into a protectorate. The occupation comes as a shock to the residents of the town, which has remained largely unchanged since the time of the bridge's completion, and the local <b>people</b> <b>experience</b> difficulties accepting the numerous changes and reforms that accompany Austro-Hungarian rule. A barrack is built {{at the site of the}} caravanserai and the town experiences a substantial influx of foreigners. People from all parts of Austria-Hungary arrive, opening new businesses and bringing the customs of their native regions with them. A narrow gauge railway line is built to Sarajevo and the bridge loses much of its strategic importance. Local children begin to be educated in Sarajevo, and some go on to continue their studies in Vienna. They bring home new social and cultural ideas from abroad, among them the concepts of trade unions and socialism, while newly established newspapers acquaint the town's inhabitants with nationalism. Tensions flare following the assassination of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1898. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexes Bosnia-Herzegovina, sparking tensions with Serbia, which the Austro-Hungarians come to regard as a serious obstacle to their further conquest of the eastern Balkans. The Balkan Wars of 1912–13 see the Ottomans almost completely forced from the region, and relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia deteriorate further. The significance of the middle portion of the bridge also becomes undermined, as residents of different ethnicities become suspicious and wary of one another.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency.

Subsequent research, however, found that <b>people</b> <b>experience</b> dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that <b>people</b> <b>experience</b> dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E

40|$|Background: The NICE ADHD Guideline Group found {{a lack of}} {{research}} evidence on young <b>people's</b> <b>experiences</b> with stimulant medications. The present study was commissioned to help fill this gap in the evidence base and to inform the Guideline. Method: Focus groups and 1 : 1 interviews with 16 UK young people with ADHD. Results: Young people were positive about taking medication, feeling that it reduced their disruptive behaviour and improved their peer relationships. Young <b>people</b> <b>experienced</b> stigma but this was related more to their symptomatic behaviours than to stimulant drug medication. Conclusions: The study's findings helped to inform the NICE guideline on ADHD by providing evidence that young <b>people's</b> <b>experiences</b> of medication were in general more positive than negative. All NICE Guidelines involving recommendations {{for the treatment of}} young people should draw on research evidence of young <b>people's</b> <b>experiences</b> of treatments...|$|R
40|$|Situations {{involving}} people who, due to {{a mental}} illness, are unable to care for themselves or {{pose a threat to}} others are typically handled by the police. Dealing with <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness who are in crisis is inherently challenging work and police officers are often considered to be unprepared and unsupported. When resolving such encounters, police officers have a number of options, including formal dispositions, such as arrest or involuntary hospitalisation, and informal dispositions, such as calming the person down or ignoring the situation. Given that there is no single framework which can be applied to all encounters between law enforcement personnel and <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness, police officers are necessarily afforded some discretion when resolving these situations. Much research has been conducted regarding the factors which influence outcomes following police encounters with <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness. Among these are the policies and procedures which operate in different police organisations, the availability of community mental health resources, whether the encounter was invoked by the police or the public, and the characteristics of the offender and the police officers involved. The broad aims of this thesis were to (i) describe police officers’ perceptions regarding their <b>experiences</b> dealing with <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness in Victoria, Australia, (ii) describe police officers’ attitudes toward working with <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness, and (iii) investigate the predictive capacity of police officers’ attitudes regarding mental illness related to their preferred means for handling cases involving <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness. Three main studies are reported. The first is an investigation of the current interface between police officers in Victoria and <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness. Based on survey data, findings related to the frequency of police contacts, the types of encounters, the signs and symptoms associated with mental illness and the challenges faced by police officers when performing these duties are reported. The second study is an examination of police officers’ attitudes toward <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness. Participants completed a survey measuring their attitudes and the results were then analysed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Analyses revealed four distinct themes underlying the attitudes of surveyed police officers. Broadly speaking, the officers held positive attitudes toward <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness, but negative attitudes about the system that cared for them. Multivariate analyses revealed that the measured attitudes were not associated with demographic characteristics. The third study explored factors which are related to police officers’ preferred means for resolving encounters with <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness. Participants watched one of three vignettes depicting an encounter with a man who might be mentally ill, and were asked to speculate on how they would “likely” and “ideally” resolve the encounter. Each of the vignettes differed according to the apparent severity of the man’s psychiatric symptoms. Discriminant function analysis revealed that the outcomes chosen by officers were related to both the severity of the man’s psychiatric symptoms and the officers’ attitudes toward <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness. These findings highlight the important role played by police officers in managing people in the community who experience mental illness. Some police officers surveyed felt unprepared for this role and many perceived that there was inadequate cooperation from mental health services. Given these challenges, it was important to begin to understand police officers’ attitudes to their work involving <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness. Following quasi-experimental analysis, these attitudes, among with other situational variables, were found to relate to outcomes chosen by police officers following their encounters with <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> mental illness...|$|R

40|$|Published version. Source at [URL] Background: A {{study of}} {{disability}} among the indigenous Sami people in Norway presented {{a number of}} ethical and methodological challenges rarely addressed in the literature. Objectives: The main {{study was designed to}} examine and understand the everyday life, transitions between life stages and democratic participation of Norwegian Sami <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> disability. Hence, {{the purpose of this article}} is to increase the understanding of possible ethical and methodological issues in research within this field. The article describes and discusses ethical and methodological issues that arose when conducting our study and identifies some strategies for addressing issues like these. Methods: The ethical and methodological issues addressed in the article are based on a qualitative study among indigenous Norwegian Sami <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> disability. The data in this study were collected through 31 semi-structured in-depth interviews with altogether 24 Sami <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> disability and 13 next of kin of Sami <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> disability (8 mothers, 2 fathers, 2 sister and 1 guardian). Findings and discussion: The researchers identified 4 main areas of ethical and methodological issues. We present these issues chronologically as they emerged in the research process: 1) concept of knowledge when designing the study, 2) gaining access, 3) data collection and 4) analysis and accountability. Conclusion: The knowledge generated from this study has the potential to benefit future health research, specifically of Norwegian Sami <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> disability, as well as health research concerning indigenous people in general, providing scientific-based insight into important ethical and methodological issues in research with indigenous <b>people</b> <b>experiencing</b> disability...|$|R
