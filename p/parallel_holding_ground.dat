50|$|The {{remaining}} Slovene units {{continued to}} retreat back into lower Styria, while {{almost all of}} the Carinthian area that was gained during the winter clashes was lost to the advancing Austrian units. The last to fall was Dravograd before the Royal Yugoslav Army's 36th infantry regiment under control of Lt.Col. Vladimir Uzorinac managed to <b>hold</b> <b>ground</b> in Guštanj (Gutenstein in Kärnten) and therefore stop the counter-offensive. General Maister sent two units of his Maribor infantry regiment to aid the troops <b>holding</b> <b>ground</b> near Slovenj Gradec. Officer Malgaj was killed on 6 May, one of the key leaders of the Slovene fighters in Carinthia.|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} local farmers {{was carried out}} to {{identify}} the current curfew practices on cattle at farms and <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> in West Timor prior to transport to Java. The survey was also aimed to recognise the potential stressors contributing to body weight loss {{and a lack of}} feed intake in the newly received cattle. There is little known about the current practices on Bali cattle at farms and <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> in West Timor before transportation. An interview and observation survey of 150 Bali cattle farmers and 9 traders was conducted in three different regencies throughout West Timor. There was no period of feed and water deprivation practiced by farmers prior to land transportation especially for cattle sold in traditional markets. The deprivation was only held for feedlot cattle for about 18 to 24 hours but then the animals were allowed to access feed and water for approximate 4 to 6 hours before weighing for sale and transportation. The animals were branded with hot iron after being sold. Duration of land transportation was depended on the distance from original farms or <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> to ports. As at farms, there were no deprivation practices in <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> prior to transport. All of the respondents reported that there was no written rule or protocols provided by government relating to transportation guidelines. In conclusion, the practices of feed and water deprivation, long duration of transportation, branded with hot iron, handling activities, mixing and different types of feeds in some stage of transportation might be potensial stressors contributing to the animals...|$|R

5000|$|The bay was {{originally}} named [...] "Port Townshend" [...] by Captain George Vancouver (for his friend the Marquis of Townshend) in 1792.

50|$|In December 1941 it {{was engaged}} in heavy {{fighting}} in the Kerch Peninsula in December when two Soviet Armies attacked its positions. Despite being instructed to <b>hold</b> its <b>ground,</b> the XXXXII Corps commander, General von Sponeck, gave the order to pull back. This order was countermanded by the 11th Army commander, Erich von Manstein, but since von Sponeck had already disassembled his wireless set, the order to <b>hold</b> <b>ground</b> was not received. The division avoided encirclement and eventually helped {{stem the tide of}} the Red Army landings at Feodosiya.|$|R

50|$|In 1948 the RHAF was {{upgraded}} with US assistance. At {{the same}} time the communists decided to abandon guerilla tactics and try to <b>hold</b> <b>ground</b> like regular army.

25|$|As the paras {{tried to}} <b>hold</b> their <b>ground,</b> {{waiting for the}} rest of the detail to reinforce, however, they came under sniper fire.

50|$|The basic {{anchoring}} {{consists of}} determining the location, dropping the anchor, laying out the scope, setting the hook, and assessing where the vessel ends up.

30|$|Western Mukugodo is {{isolated}} from Dol Dol, the administrative centre, {{in the north}} and Nanyuki, the district centre, in the south. In the south, the Division is bounded in by large-scale private ranches, most of which maintain closed electric fences along their perimeter and patrols on both public and private access roads (Herren 1989; Huho et al. 2011; Muthiani et al. 2011; Ngugi and Conant 2008). On the northern side of the Division, there is a livestock <b>holding</b> <b>ground,</b> which is now settled by Samburu pastoralists, and a second livestock <b>holding</b> <b>ground</b> in the southwest, which is now privately owned (Dan Rubenstein, personal communication, 2012). The Ewaso Nyiro River also creates an impassable boundary during wet periods (or when the flower farms downstream unload their dirty water onto pastoralists upstream), making the Ilmotiok group ranch in particular an island for part of the year.|$|R
