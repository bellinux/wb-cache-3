500|$|The three cannot {{return to}} the <b>present</b> <b>right</b> away since the [...] "return pad" [...] to Stewie's time machine fails to activate. [...] They decide to go to England where Mort, who is Jewish, will be safe from the Nazis. While {{attempting}} to cross the border, German officers find out that Mort is Jewish (while doing a poor impersonation of a Catholic priest), resulting in their being chased by the Nazis. [...] Mort, Stewie and Brian make a getaway on a motorbike, followed by an elaborate undersea pursuit in a hijacked U-boat. The chase scene on the motorbike re-enacts the skateboard chase scene in Back To The Future. [...] Like Biff, the Nazi officers' car ends up slamming into a manure truck ("Das Poop!"). [...] The three make it to England safely, and see Winston Churchill. Stewie examines the return pad and discovers it has run out uranium fuel. [...] Brian states that the only place they can find the needed uranium in this time is at a [...] "secret" [...] nuclear testing facility in Berlin, Nazi Germany. The three join the Royal Air Force and fly a Lancaster bomber as they participate in a dogfight against a squadron of Luftwaffe Me-109 fighters, eventually reaching Berlin. After finding the nuclear research lab, Stewie disguises himself as Adolf Hitler, while the other two disguise themselves as Nazi Officers, and obtains the needed uranium. They then run into the real Hitler, who orders their execution, but they escape on the return pad back to their time (Hitler offered to spare them if they performed a charming musical number, but Mort cuts the eager Stewie and Brian off at the first line).|$|E
2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a <b>present</b> <b>right</b> to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E

As to the crown reversions or titles upon the property of the people there, it is proposed to convert them from a snare to their independence into a relief from their burdens. I propose, therefore, to unite all the five principalities to the crown, and to its ordinary jurisdiction,--to abolish all those offices that produce an useless and chargeable separation from the body of the people,--to compensate those who do not hold their offices (if any such there are) at the pleasure of the crown,--to extinguish vexatious titles by an act of short limitation,--to sell those unprofitable estates which support useless jurisdictions,--and to turn the tenant-right into a fee, on such moderate terms as will be better for the state than its <b>present</b> <b>right,</b> and which it is impossible for any rational tenant to refuse.|$|E

Hence, decisions made by existing human beings are capable of dramaticaIly affecting the welfare of future generations. Current controversy about environmental protection involves the question of whether our present obligations to future generations can be grounded in their <b>present</b> <b>rights.</b> Many philosophers would question the very intelligibility of the idea that future individuals might have <b>present</b> <b>rights.</b> They do not see how a non-existing object could be said to have anything, let alone rights.

What is the proper method for resolving conflicts on this “deeper” level? This essay has two inter-dependent goals: to suggest and assess a testing procedure for ontological claims, through the use of an example of conflicting ontological theses; and to illuminate the concept of a right, through a discussion of the most general features of the requirements for the possible possession of rights...|$|R

40|$|A monoid S {{is right}} {{coherent}} if every finitely generated subact of every finitely <b>presented</b> <b>right</b> S-act is finitely presented. The corresponding notion for a ring R states that every finitely generated submodule of every finitely <b>presented</b> <b>right</b> R-module is finitely presented. For monoids (and rings) right coherency is a finitary property which determines {{the existence of}} a model companion of the class of right S-acts (right R-modules) and hence that the class of existentially closed right S-acts (right R-modules) is axiomatisable. Choo, Lam and Luft have shown that free rings are right (and left) coherent; the authors, together with Ruskuc, have shown that groups, and free monoids, have the same properties. We demonstrate that free inverse monoids do not. Any free inverse monoid contains as a submonoid the free left ample monoid, and indeed the free monoid, on the same set of generators. The main objective of the paper is to show that the free left ample monoid is right coherent. Furthermore, by making use of the same techniques we show that both free inverse and free left ample monoids satisfy (R), (r), (L) and (l), conditions arising from the axiomatisability of classes of right S-acts and of left S-acts...|$|R
