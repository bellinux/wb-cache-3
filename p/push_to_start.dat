Missouri transportation officials proposed to privatize the bridge, which would have allowed a private company to charge tolls in return for building, operating and maintaining it for up to 99 years. But Illinois officials and several St. Louis congressman demanded a toll-free crossing, and this was ratified by an agreement signed February 28, 2008, by Missouri governor Matt Blunt and Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich.|$|R

5000|$|Brooklyn Bicycle Company, is {{a bicycle}} {{manufacturing}} {{company based in}} Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, that was founded by Ryan Zagata in 2011, as Brooklyn Cruiser. Zagata, who had previously worked in the software industry, was inspired to design the bicycles after his move to Brooklyn and subsequent infatuation with the borough left him wanting to explore more of the neighborhood. The final <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the company occurred {{during a trip to}} Vietnam where he saw utility bicycles being used to transport vast amounts of goods. His first design, the Brooklyn Cruiser, was offered for sale in August 2011, and was deliberately designed to function as a city bicycle for urban everyday use, unlike the off-road mountain bike or the road bicycle. In 2012, CNN named the Brooklyn Cruiser one of [...] "the coolest commutes on two wheels".The company proved very successful, with one million dollar plus revenue projected for 2013. In 2013, two new models were launched titled Franklin and Bedford. Brooklyn Bicycle Co. moved into more versatile models in 2016 with the release of their Lorimer women’s hybrid bike and Roebling men’s hybrid bike. As of 2017, there are eight different collections to choose from.|$|E

Depending on the mechanical setup (engine, gearing, shocks, etc.) and the track layout these cars achieve speeds in excess of 160 mph. A lower budget and very popular class of sprint cars uses 360 cubic inch (5.9L) engines that produce approximately [...] Sprint cars do not utilize a transmission, they have an in or out gear box and quick change rear differentials for occasional gearing changes. As a result, {{they do not have}} electric starters (or even electrical systems other than magneto / ignition) and require a <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> them.

5000|$|The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) {{will begin}} the Readmissions Reduction Program, which {{requires}} CMS to reduce payments to IPPS hospitals with excess readmissions, effective for discharges beginning on October 1, 2012. The regulations that implement this provision are in subpart I of 42 CFR part 412 (§412.150 through §412.154). Starting in October, an estimated total of 2,217 hospitals {{across the nation}} will be penalized; however, only 307 of these hospitals will receive this year's maximum penalty, i.e., 1 percent off their base Medicare reimbursements. The penalty will be deducted from reimbursements each time a hospital submits a claim starting Oct. 1. The maximum penalty will increase after this year, to 2 percent of regular payments starting in October 2013 and then to 3 percent the following year. As an example, if a hospital received the maximum penalty of 1 percent and it submitted a claim for $20,000 for a stay, Medicare would reimburse it $19,800. Together, these 2,217 hospitals will forfeit more than $280 million in Medicare funds over the next year, i.e., until October 2013, as Medicare and Medicaid begin a wide-ranging <b>push</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> paying health care providers based {{on the quality of}} care they provide.

Rogers, one of Canada’s largest communication companies, made the move in 2009 to create its version of Hulu.com, a popular on-demand streaming video service from the US.

It has also been noted {{as a way to}} secure Canada’s future in broadcasting, as major cable companies were already losing customers to service cancellations in the United States.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm {{to modify the}} Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol {{in order to improve}} the routing performance in motorway surveillance systems. The proposed protocol has all the characteristics of the original AODV routing protocol since it follows all the steps of the route discovery and route maintenance mechanism of the original AODV routing protocol. The Modified AODV (MAODV) is different from the original AODV protocol in that it modifies the original AODV to reduce the length of the path of routing messages (RERR and RREQ) when link breakage occurs. In the new protocol, one of the cameras (stationary nodes) which belong to the old route is <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the process of rediscovering a new path to the unreachable destination instead of the source node. The modification of AODV reduces the protocol overhead, packet losses, and packet transmission time delays.

2500|$|The Munich Agreement {{defined a}} three-month period to resolve Hungarian demands, and the Hungarian {{government}} <b>pushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> negotiations immediately. The pressure was increased on the Hungarian side by border conflicts and by diversion {{actions on the}} Czechoslovak territory. The first conflict occurred {{in the early morning}} of October 5, 1938, when troops of the Royal Hungarian Army (Magyar Királyi Honvédség) crossed the border and attacked Czechoslovak positions near Jesenské with the goal of capturing Rimavská Sobota. Hungarian troops withdrew after the arrival of Czechoslovak reinforcements, who killed nine Hungarians and captured prisoners. Two days later, Hungarian troops tried to cross the Danube near Štúrovo (Párkány), but failed again. Their situation was worse in Carpathian Ruthenia with its lower density of fortifications, where paramilitary units of Rongyos Gárda infiltrated Czechoslovak territory. The first two units of the Rongyos Gárda crossed the border on October 6, 1938, and two days later they blew up the bridge over the Borozhava River. [...] Such actions continued during the negotiations and after the First Vienna Award. During the second day of bilateral negotiations (October 10, 1938) Hungarian troops murdered a railway officer in Borozhava and damaged railway facilities.|$|R
