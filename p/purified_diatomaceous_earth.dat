Samples containing 10 kg of wheat grains were treated with 0. 0, 2. 0 and 4. 0 g kg- 1 of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> and then conventionally stored. Analyses of grain hectoliter mass and ash content, as well as flour gluten content, flour color, alveography and farinography were performed at 0, 60, 120 and 180 days of storage. The experiment was carried out in a totally randomized design. The grain ash content and intensity of color component L* of wheat flour increase proportionally to the application of increasing doses of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> and longer storage periods. The grain hectoliter mass and values of +b* chromaticity coordinate, wet gluten content and gluten content in wheat flour diminish with the application of increasing doses of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> and longer storage periods.

40|$|Population {{regulation}} {{results from}} an interplay of numerous intrinsic and external factors, {{and for many}} insects cannibalism is such a factor. This study confirms a previously-reported observation that sublethal exposure to the fossilized remains of diatoms (i. e. <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth)</b> increases net fecundity (eggs produced minus eggs destroyed/day) of flour beetles, Tribolium confusum. The aim was to experimentally test two non-mutually-exclusive ecological mechanisms potentially responsible for the increased net fecundity: higher egg production and lower egg cannibalism. Adult T. confusum were maintained at low or high density in medium containing sublethal (0 - 4 %) <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth.</b> Net fecundity increased up to 2. 1 × control values during <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> exposure, and returned to control levels following removal from <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth.</b> Cannibalism assays on adults showed that <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> {{reduced the number of}} eggs produced to 0. 7 × control values at low density and to 0. 8 × controls at high density, and also reduced egg cannibalism rates of adults to as little as 0. 4 × control values, but at high density only. <b>Diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> also reduced cannibalism by larvae on eggs to 0. 3 × control values. So, while the presence of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> reduced egg production, net fecundity increased as a result of strong suppression of the normal egg cannibalism by adults and larvae that occurs at high beetle density. Undisturbed cultures containing sublethal <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> concentrations reached higher population densities than diatomaceous earth-free controls. Cohort studies on survival from egg to adult indicated that this population increase was due largely to decreased egg cannibalism by adult females. This is the first report of inhibition of egg cannibalism by <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> on larval or adult insects. The ability of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> to alter cannibalism behavior without causing mortality makes it an ideal investigative tool for cannibalism studies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> {{is formed}} by the {{deposition}} of biological matter and as such {{has a number of}} unique engineering properties. Unique <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth?s</b> characteristics include high specific surface area, low dry density, high water storage ability, high friction angle, high compressibility, and unstable response under dynamic loads. These properties came from its biological origin and structure. Due to these peculiar characteristics, <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> could be detrimental in some engineering application while it could find application in in the cover of landfills, hydraulic barriers, ionic barriers, low-weight fills, and etc. However to assess potential beneficial properties, engineers and researchers much first completely characterize the material. This characterization must include an estimation of the percentage of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> in the soil and how the diatomite content controls the physical behavior of soils. In this study, the pure <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> mixed with kaolinite and silica flour in several proportion was used to assess how parameters such as Atterberg limits, compression tests, and electrical properties change with <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> content and how these changes may affect the sue use on diatomic soils in engineering applications. Experimental results show that <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> have high liquid and plastic limits. The higher fraction volume of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> allows higher water storage and that is represented on the results of liquid limit and electrical property test results. The permittivity of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth,</b> kaolinite, and silica flour are governed by the availability of volume of free water in the soil specimens. The higher volumetric water content determines the higher real and imaginary permittivity. In compression tests, as pore fluid drains out with void ratio and volumetric fluid content decrease, the measured permittivity decreased as well. Unbroken microfossil diatom particles with compression load allow higher permittivity than kaolinite and silica flour. Overall, it is shown that the fraction of <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> influenced to the physical, mechanical, and electrical properties of soil mixtures. <b>Diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> shows different characteristic with silica flour even has same chemical formula and also distinct behavior with clay. It can be told that diatoms should be different classified material with silt and clay. The application of this unique <b>diatomaceous</b> <b>earth</b> should show potential benefit in engineering sight...|$|R
