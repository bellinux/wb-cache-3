25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a television receiver designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the intermediate frequency stage of a superheterodyne system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this should be just as easily adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts <b>pulse-to-pulse,</b> and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency step-down like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After trying a variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E

50|$|Both {{the pump}} power and input noise level are {{influential}} in the supercontinuum generation process, determining, e.g., the broadening factor and the onset of soliton-fission. Below the threshold for soliton fission, the soliton number generated from an average output pulse is below one, and well above threshold, it can be quite large. In the case of large pump power, soliton fission often {{has been compared to}} onset of boiling in a superheated liquid in that the transition begins rather suddenly and explosively. In short, supercontinuum generation amplifies the input noise, transferring its properties to macroscopic characteristics of the broadened pulse train. Many of the commercially-available supercontinuum sources are pumped by long pulses and, therefore, tend to have relatively significant <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> spectral fluctuations.|$|E
5000|$|Three common {{methods are}} used to {{calculate}} the Doppler shift and thus the water velocity along the acoustic beams. The first method uses a monochromatic transmit pulse and is referred to as [...] "incoherent" [...] or [...] "narrowband".

When the transmit pulse consists of coded elements that are repeated, the method is referred to as [...] "repeat sequence coding" [...] or [...] "broadband". This method improves the space-time resolution by a factor of 5 (typical). Commercially, this method was protected by US patent 5615173 until 2011. The <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> coherent method relies on a sequence of transmit pulses where the echo from subsequent pulses are assumed not to interfere with each other.

50|$|Giraffe Agile Multi Beam is {{a passive}} {{electronically}} scanned array radar, providing multi-beam 3-Dimensional air coverage at 5.4 to 5.9 GHz with instrumented ranges of 30 km, 60 km and 100 km, the altitude coverage is extended from ground-level to 20,000 m with 70-degree elevation coverage. Data rate is 1-scan per-second. Its maintained pulse density suppresses high cluttering in adverse weather conditions. Ultra-low antenna side-lobes combined with <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> and burst-to-burst frequency agility provides some resistance to jamming.

50|$|Most of the {{existing}} pulse cloud radars operate in the LDR-mode. In this mode, a radar transmits a horizontally polarized radiation and receives horizontal and vertical components of the scattered radiation in co-polarized and cross-polarized channels, respectively. The ratio of the power in the cross-polarized channel over the power in the co-polarized channel, named as linear depolarization ratio, is the polarimetric variable obtained by cloud radars of this type. Often cloud radars have two receiving units, which allows simultaneous measurements of the orthogonal components of the received signal. Some cloud radars have only one receiving unit and measure the orthogonal components consequently, with <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> switching of the receiving channel. Many of operational cloud radars with LDR-mode are pointed vertically together with other remote sensing instruments in order to retrieve microphysical properties of cloud particles. LDR, measured by vertically pointed cloud radar, {{is used for the}} detection of the melting layer (also denominated as bright band) and clutter filtering. The application of LDR-mode for the shape classification in scanning cloud radars is limited by its high sensitivity to the orientation of scatterers.|$|E
5000|$|Staggered PRF is a {{transmission}} process where {{the time between}} interrogations from radar changes slightly, in a patterned and readily-discernible repeating manner. The change of repetition frequency allows the radar, on a <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> basis, to differentiate between returns from its own transmissions and returns from other radar systems with the same PRF and a similar radio frequency. Consider a radar with a constant interval between pulses; target reflections appear at a relatively constant range related to the flight-time of the pulse. In today's very crowded radio spectrum, there may be many other pulses detected by the receiver, either directly from the transmitter or as reflections from elsewhere. Because their apparent [...] "distance" [...] is defined by measuring their time relative to the last pulse transmitted by [...] "our" [...] radar, these [...] "jamming" [...] pulses could appear at any apparent distance. When the PRF of the [...] "jamming" [...] radar {{is very similar to}} [...] "our" [...] radar, those apparent distances may be very slow-changing, just like real targets. By using stagger, a radar designer can force the [...] "jamming" [...] to jump around erratically in apparent range, inhibiting integration and reducing or even suppressing its impact on true target detection.|$|E
50|$|Supercontinuum {{generation}} is generally unstable when pumped by long pulses. The occurrence of optical rogue waves are an extreme manifestation of this instability and arise {{due to a}} sensitivity to a particular component of input noise. This sensitivity can be exploited to stabilize and increase the generation efficiency of the spectral broadening process by actively seeding the instability with a controlled signal instead of allowing it to begin from noise. The seeding can be accomplished with an extraordinarily weak, tailored optical seed pulse, which stabilizes supercontinuum radiation by actively controlling or stimulating modulation instability. Whereas noise-induced (i.e., spontaneously generated) supercontinuum radiation usually has significant intensity noise and little to no <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> coherence, controlled stimulation results in a supercontinuum pulse train with greatly improved phase and amplitude stability. Additionally, the stimulus {{can also be used}} to actuate the broadband output, i.e., to switch the supercontinuum on and off by applying or blocking the seed. The seed may be derived from the pump pulse by broadening a portion of it slightly and then carving out a stable portion of the broadened tail. The relative delay between the pump and seed pulses is then adjusted accordingly, and the two pulses are combined in the nonlinear fiber. Alternatively, the extremely stable stimulated supercontinuum can be generated by deriving both pump and seed radiation from a parametric process, e.g., the two-color output (signal and idler) of an optical parametric oscillator. Added input modulations have also been studied for changing the frequency of rare events and optical feedback can be employed to speed up the spectral broadening process. Stimulated supercontinuum radiation can also be generated using an independent continuous-wave seed, which avoids the need to control the timing but the seed must instead must have higher average power. A continuous-wave-seeded supercontinuum source has been employed in time stretch microscopy, yielding improved images compared with those obtained using unseeded sources. Stimulated supercontinuum generation can be slowed or frustrated by applying a second seed pulse with the proper frequency and timing to the mix. Thus, applying one seed pulse can accelerate the spectral broadening process, and the application of a second seed pulse can once again delay spectral broadening. This frustration effect occurs because the two seeds effectively compete for gain within the pump envelope, and it is a controlled version of the rare narrowband events known to occur stochastically in certain supercontinuum pulse trains (see above).|$|E

40|$|SummaryOne of {{the most}} notable {{characteristics}} of synaptic transmission is the wide variation in synaptic strength in response to identical stimulation. In hippocampal neurons, approximately one-third of axonal mitochondria are highly motile, and some dynamically pass through presynaptic boutons. This raises a fundamental question: can motile mitochondria contribute to the <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> variability of presynaptic strength? Recently, we identified syntaphilin as an axonal mitochondrial-docking protein. Using hippocampal neurons and slices of syntaphilin knockout mice, we demonstrate that the motility of axonal mitochondria correlates with presynaptic variability. Enhancing mitochondrial motility increases the <b>pulse-to-pulse</b> variability, whereas immobilizing mitochondria reduces the variability. By dual-color live imaging at single-bouton levels, we further show that motile mitochondria passing through boutons dynamically influence synaptic vesicle release, mainly by altering ATP homeostasis in axons.
