50|$|Before the {{unveiling}} of the memorial, 52 memorial trees were also planted. Bunya <b>pines</b> and <b>cotton</b> trees were set in a single row along Plumridge Street and Appel Street (then called Graceville Parade) to commemorate the dead. Today, 29 bunya <b>pines</b> and 11 <b>cotton</b> trees remain. Some locals claim that there were memorial plaques on these trees, but that the plaques had gone by the 1950s. In addition to the memorial trees on the western and northern edges of the park, an avenue of bauhinias, cabbage tree palms and Chinese elms was planted {{either side of a}} drive from Oxley Road to the memorial. A single line of figs and camphor laurels continued west from the memorial towards Appel Street. The eastern section of the drive had a bitumen surface by 1961, but the western section of the memorial drive, from the memorial to Appel Street, has reverted to grass. A trophy field gun captured by the Australian Imperial Force near Abancourt, France, in August 1918 was also sited near the memorial from the early 1920s, but it was removed before 1952.|$|R
5000|$|Trichothecium roseum is a {{saprophyte}} [...] and {{is found}} worldwide.

40|$|Sugar cane bagasse, wheat straw, <b>pine</b> and <b>cotton</b> wood {{pyrolysis}} was studied by TGA in argon at heating rates of 5 and 20 °C/min. The DTG (dm/dt) peaks {{associated with the}} components of an untreated plant material are relatively wide and strongly overlap each other. A reduction {{in the amount of}} inorganic ions in the samples by simple water or dilute acid washing procedures resulted in sharper peaks with a better separation. The thermal decomposition of the major biomass components was described, more or less formally, by first order reactions and the DTG curves of the biomass samples were approximated by a linear combination of first order reactions. Good fits between the calculated and the experimental data and good reproducibility of the model parameters were achieved. The kinetic model applied here may serve as a starting point to build more complex models capable of describing the thermal behavior of plant materials during a thermal or thermochemical processing or burning. Theoretically, there is also a possibility to utilize this sort of calculation in the quantitative analysis of the cellulose and hemicellulose content of the lignocellulosic materials...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{conditions}} required to initiate movement of unanchored residue materials are {{identified in the}} present study. Selected amounts of corn, <b>cotton,</b> <b>pine</b> needles, sorghum, soybean, sunflower, and wheat residue are placed in a flume on a sand surface, and flow is then introduced {{at the top of}} the flume in progressive increments. The discharge rate and flow velocity necessary to cause residue movement are determined. The ratio of critical flow depth to residue diameter, critical Reynolds number, critical shear stress, dimensionless shear stress, and boundary Reynolds number are calculated from hydraulic measurements. Regression equations are developed to relate dimensionless shear stress to boundary Reynolds number and residue diameter. Boundary Reynolds number, in turn, is related to residue diameter and cover. Close agreement is found between predicted and actual parameter values obtained from the regression relations. The regression equations can be used to estimate the beginning of motion for other residue materials if residue diameter and cover are known...|$|R
50|$|The Arkansas Delta {{is known}} for its rich musical heritage. While defined {{primarily}} by its deep blues/gospel roots, it is distinguished somewhat from its Mississippi Delta counterpart by more intricately interwoven country music and R&B elements. Arkansas blues musicians have defined every genre of blues from its inception, including ragtime, hokum, country blues, Delta blues, boogie-woogie, jump blues, Chicago blues, and blues-rock. Eastern Arkansas' predominantly African American population in cities like Helena, West Memphis, <b>Pine</b> Bluff, Brinkley, <b>Cotton</b> Plant, Forrest City and others has provided a fertile backdrop of juke joints, clubs and dance halls which have so completely nurtured this music. Many of the nation's blues pioneers were either born in the Arkansas Delta or lived in the region highlighting their craft. As a result, the region hosts several blues events throughout the year culminating in the Arkansas Blues and Heritage Fest. The festival averages about 85,000 people per day over its three-day run and is rated in the top 10 music events in the nation by festivals.com.|$|R

40|$|Biosorption of dyes by lignocelluloses {{may be an}} {{effective}} method for removing dyes from textile effluents. However, the resulting dye-adsorbed lignocellulosic materials may constitute another pollution problem. An integrated method can solve this problem. Here, various lignocelluloses were tested for their Astrazon Black and Astrazon Blue dyes removal activities. The dye adsorbed after 30 min contact time was 90 % (45 mg/L), 70 % (35 mg/L), and 98 % (49 mg/L) for wheat bran, <b>pine</b> cone, and <b>cotton</b> stalk, respectively. These dye-adsorbed lignocellulosic wastes then were used as solid substrates to produce laccase enzyme with Funalia trogii and Trametes versicolor under solid state fermentation (SSF). Among the lignocellulosic substrates, the dye-adsorbed wheat bran served as the best solid substrate for laccase production under SSF. Therefore, it was also tested as a solid source for laccase production under submerged fermentation. During solid state fermentation, these two fungi were able to highly decolorize these dyes. While F. trogii decolorized 80 % of Astrazon Black dye adsorbed onto wheat bran, T. versicolor decolorized 86 %. On the other hand, the decolorization values for Astrazon Blue dye were 69 % and 84 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand’s endemic longhorned beetle (Prionoplus reticularis) larvae, huhu grub, are {{xylophagous}} {{and feed}} {{on a broad}} range of dead trees. Since insects are not believed {{to have the ability to}} fully degrade lignocellulose, it is likely that microbes present in the gut assist in degrading lignocellulose to release energy rich sugars. This process is considered the rate limiting step in the utilisation of woody material in biofuel production. To better understand the gut consortium present while feeding on the lignocellulose and cellulose components, huhu grubs were initially collected and reared on non-degraded pine blocks (lignocellulose) or cotton (cellulose). The gut fungal and bacterial community of huhu grubs was investigated using high-throughput sequencing and analysis techniques. Furthermore, the effects of a dietary switch on both fungal and bacterial communities was explored by switching huhu grubs initially reared on <b>pine</b> to <b>cotton,</b> and vice versa. Cellulose- and lignocellulose-reared huhu grubs were expected to host a wide range of bacteria and fungi in their gut, some of which produce lignocellulose degrading enzymes. Assessment of the gut fungal community composition confirmed that cellulose-reared huhu grubs were significantly distinct from lignocellulose-reared grubs. The fungal community of lignocellulose-fed huhu grubs was more functionally diverse, with several yeasts, soft-rot fungi and potential hemicellulose and cellulose degraders present. Whereas, the fungal community of cellulose-reared grubs was mostly abundant in yeasts and potential cellulose degraders. When cotton-reared grubs where switched to pine (lignocellulose), lignocellulose was observed to have a ‘bottleneck effect’ or selective pressure on the fungal gut community. The gut bacterial community of huhu grubs reared on cellulose or lignocellulose diets seemed to be unaffected by the selective pressure of the diet, and no significant change in the bacterial community was observed following dietary switch. Therefore it was concluded that the bacterial community while still important is playing a secondary role to the fungi. Finally, bioprospecting studies conducted using the frass (excretia) of these huhu grubs resulted in the isolation of a bacterium, Acinetobacter H 23, capable of producing an extracellular laccase. Overall, the increased understanding of structure and composition of the gut microbiome of huhu grubs reared on cellulose or lignocellulose diets, along with isolation of novel lignocellulolytic isolates could prove to be significant for the biofuel industry...|$|R
40|$|Deposited {{on behalf}} of the author. © 2011 Muliyana ArifudinThe {{utilization}} of bark from Eucalyptus globulus Labill and Pinus radiata D. Don as adsorbents for Cu(II) and Zn(II) in solution was investigated in this study. Analysis of the chemical composition of the two bark species enabled a determination of their potential end use application for heavy metal removal. The higher lignin (49. 4 %) and extractive (20. 5 %) content of pine bark as well as the higher hemicellulose (35. 7 %) content of eucalypt facilitated the use of these barks as suitable adsorbents for heavy metal cations. The release of water soluble extractives (phenolic compounds), however, may impede the use of the barks as metal chelating agents because the leachates may under some circumstances be detrimental to aquatic ecosystems. In order to fix the extractives within the bark and prevent them from leaching, the eucalypt and pine barks were ground, air dried and then heated for 60 seconds using three different microwave power levels to obtain three determined bark temperatures (100, 150 and 200 °C). UV spectroscopy showed that the absorbance value of untreated bark at 280 nm was not significantly {{different from that of the}} corresponding bark treated with microwave. This was observed for both bark species. This indicates that microwave heating for 1 minute using the three microwave energies examined did not result in any fixation of phenolic compounds within the bark. FTIR spectroscopy, however, indicated the occurrence of chemical bond transformations in various functional groups in bark hemicelluloses and lignin as a result of microwaving. Eucalypt and pine barks were evaluated in a Cu(II) and Zn(II) adsorption study with the following initial treatments: (1) 	Microwaving to various pre-determined temperatures (100, 150 and 200 °C), (2) 	extracting with water (to remove leachable compounds) and (3) 	combined processing, incorporating both microwaving and extraction with water. Pressure steamed pine bark, ground <b>pine</b> wood and <b>cotton</b> were examined for comparison. All the samples were analyzed using UV spectroscopy to measure the absorbance value at 280 nm in order to elucidate the leachability of phenolic compounds from the absorbents. Batches of each sample were then soaked in heavy metals solutions (10, 20, 40 mg/L of a single metal element - Cu(II) and Zn(II)). After an hour of shaking, the adsorbent was filtered from the suspension and the solute was analyzed for residual copper using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to determine the efficiency of each material in binding the metal cations from the solution. The results showed that pressure steamed pine bark and water extracted eucalypt bark exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for Cu(II) and Zn(II) at lower concentrations (10, 20 and 40 mg/L). As observed for eucalypt and pine bark, microwave treated bark generally showed lower uptake capacity compared to the corresponding untreated bark due to their lower reactivity. Microwave treated bark also removed lower amounts of Cu(II) and Zn(II) than those exposed to the combined treatment. Cotton adsorbed the lowest amounts of Cu(II) and Zn(II). This performance was also observed for the bark when in contact with a mixed Cu(II) -Zn(II) solution. At higher Cu(II) concentration (3000 mg/L), there was a change in the performance of the absorbents examined. Untreated eucalypt bark exhibited the highest Cu(II) adsorption (11. 1 mg/g), followed by pressure steamed pine bark (10. 4 mg/g) and water extracted eucalypt bark (9. 2 mg/g). Microwave treated eucalypt bark chelated more Cu(II) compared to the bark subjected to the combined treatment of microwave and water extraction, but this was not observed for microwave treated pine bark. Adsorption equilibrium parameters were generated using the graphical interpretation of the equations of the Freundlich and Langmuir models. On the basis of these models, Cu(II) and Zn(II) adsorption by both bark species were monolayer. The Freundlich isotherm model provided a better fit to the experimental data in describing both Cu(II) and Zn(II) adsorption by both eucalypt and pine barks. The type of metal species did not significantly affect the metal adsorption in the single cation solutions, but in a binary-metal solution, Cu(II) was adsorbed more than Zn(II). Initial concentration of the metal cations in solution influenced adsorption ability of the absorbent examined, in either single or multi metal solutions. Increasing metal concentration in solution increased the uptake capacity and decreased the uptake efficiency of adsorbents. In relation to bark species, eucalypt bark had a higher adsorption capacity than pine bark. Adsorbent particle size did not appear to affect the adsorption process, while adsorbent dosage did. An hour of reaction time was sufficient to reach adsorption equilibrium between the adsorbents and the metal solution. Pressure steam treatment on bark may have resulted in the insolubilisation of leachable compounds of the material, potentially rendering the bark to be more reactive with metal cations. Another possible reason for the improved capture of cations is the absence of leachable extractives. A proportion of leachable extractives had been removed during pressure steaming. The removal of soluble extractives may increase the number of adsorption sites available to heavy metals. Alternatively, steaming may result in the swelling of the bark material, leaving more accessible adsorption sites, thereby improving the adsorption ability of the bark. Water extraction treatment of bark is found to be beneficial for metal adsorption. In addition to the generation of an effective adsorbent for metal cations, water soluble extracts can be isolated for a range of purposes, including tannin adsorbents for heavy metals, proteins and oils, natural additives and a chemical source. This study has shown that eucalypt and pine bark have potential for binding heavy metals. The plentiful availability of eucalypt and pine bark in Australia allows their viable utilization for enhancing water quality in a variety of applications.
