The gas is usually krypton or xenon at a few atmospheres pressure. They are applied usually to wavelengths in the 0.15–0.6nm range.

25|$|John Alexander Simpson {{is known}} for inventions such as the gas flow α-particle <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> for {{measuring}} plutonium yields {{in the presence of}} high intensity fission products, and a neutron monitor. His obituary in The Guardian noted {{that he was one of}} the most prolific inventors of scientific instruments for space exploration. In 1958 his first created instrument was launched into space, and the last two were launched in 1999. One on board the Stardust, met up with Comet Wild-2, a frozen snowball one and a half miles in diameter in 2004.|$|E
25|$|This {{same year}} Simpson began {{his tenure as}} {{a faculty member at}} the University of Chicago as a physics instructor, and {{remained}} there throughout his career partaking in research as well until shortly before his death in August 2000. In 1945 also he was able to work as an unofficial adviser to Connecticut Senator Brien McMahon after taking a leave of absence from the university. As part of the university faculty, Simpson was able to invent and patent a gas flow a-particle <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> for measuring plutonium yields in the presence of high intensity fission products. He had come up with the idea to pipe the plutonium-bearing gas through the counter itself.|$|E

500|$|The ART-P X-ray {{telescope}} was {{the responsibility of}} the IKI in Moscow. The instrument covered the energy range 4 to 60keV for imaging and 4 to 100keV for spectroscopy and timing. There were four identical modules of the ART-P telescope, each consisting of a position sensitive multi-wire <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> (MWPC) together with a URA coded mask. Each module had an effective area of approximately 600cm², producing a field of view of 1.8° by 1.8°. The angular resolution was 5 arcmin; temporal and energy resolutions were 3.9ms and 22% at 6keV, respectively. The instrument achieved a sensitivity of 0.001 of the Crab nebula source (= 1 [...] "mCrab") in an eight-hour exposure. The maximum time resolution was 4ms.|$|E
500|$|For {{both the}} gas <b>proportional</b> <b>counter</b> and liquid {{scintillation}} counter, what is measured {{is the number}} of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or becquerels per kg (Bq/kg C, in SI units). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample– a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's [...] In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.|$|E
