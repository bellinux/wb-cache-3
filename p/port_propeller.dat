5|$|Waldeck-Rousseau, {{named for}} the {{recently}} deceased Prime Minister of France, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, was ordered on 31 July 1905 and was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 16 June 1906. She was launched on 4 March 1908, and fitting out work was completed in time to begin sea trials in January 1911. While on her acceptance trials on 2 February, she struck a submerged object that bent her <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft and damaged the screw. Waldeck-Rousseau was completed in August; the ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France, but she entered service {{two years after the}} British battlecruiser , which rendered the armored cruiser obsolescent as a warship type. Her lengthy construction interfered with the scheduled keel-laying for the new predreadnought battleship Mirabeau, which could not be started until Waldeck-Rousseau was launched. After entering service the new cruiser was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Eckoldt was {{allocated}} to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment (138. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) to seize Trondheim together with Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Eckoldts <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft began to overheat shortly after passing {{the mouth of the}} Elbe River and she had to slow down. The ship managed to repair the problem and joined the main body later in the day. The ship escorted Admiral Hipper as they entered Trondheim Fjord and both ships disembarked their troops once they reached Trondheim harbor. All of the German ships proved to be very low on fuel after their journey and fuel oil was transferred to Eckoldt from Theodor Riedel and Heinemann. Admiral Hipper and Eckoldt attempted to leave on the night of 10 April, but the smaller ship proved to be unable to match Admiral Hippers speed in the heavy seas encountered and was forced to turn back. After some fuel was discovered in Trondheim on 12 April, the ship and Heinemann sailed for Germany two days later.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives <b>port</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|E

5000|$|For the 2001 summer season, Galaxy was {{replaced}} by the brand-new [...] in the Alaskan service. As a result, Galaxy was relocated into European waters, cruising the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. On 2 June 2001, while departing Amsterdam in the Netherlands for a two-week cruise the Galaxy touched bottom on an outskirt of Forteiland at IJmuiden due to heavy northwesterly squalls, resulting in major damage to the <b>port</b> side <b>propeller.</b> The ship returned to the Port of Amsterdam for inspection and disembarkation of the passengers. The cruise had to be cancelled as the Galaxy went into drydock at Blohm + Voss in Hamburg, Germany. There it was discovered that all four blades of the <b>port</b> side <b>propeller</b> would have to be replaced; however the ship only carried two spare blades on board. To solve the problem two extra propeller blades carried on board Galaxys sister ship MV Mercury were flown from the Caribbean to Hamburg and installed on the Galaxy. Following repairs the ship re-entered service on 16 June 2001.|$|R
50|$|On 19 June 1973 Rangatira damaged her <b>port</b> rudder and <b>propeller</b> while {{berthing}} at Lyttelton. She {{was taken}} out of service for repairs, drydocked at Wellington on 20 June and returned to service on 2 July.|$|R

25|$|The Rs.I was {{completed}} by October 1915 and rolled out at Seemos for trials. On 23 October, during a taxi test, the <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> and/or gearbox parted company with the aircraft, causing damage to the gearbox mountings and the upper wing. The opportunity was taken to move the outboard engines into nacelles identical to that of centre engine, and mount them between the wings on an independent structure with catwalks to enable engineers to attend to engines in flight. This gave much better clearance from spray for the propellers, which was probably {{the cause of the}} port gearbox/propeller failure. Taxiing trials recommenced, but with little success. On 21 December 1915 a Foehn wind blew up during trials. Unable to beach the giant flying boat, attempts were made to ride out the storm on the lake, but the moorings gave and the Rs.I was dashed to pieces on the lakeside rocks.|$|E
500|$|On 6 September 1918, South Carolina escorted a fast convoy partway {{across the}} Atlantic, {{becoming}} one of the first American battleships (alongside [...] and [...] ) to do so. When returning to the United States, South Carolina lost its starboard propeller. When continuing with the <b>port</b> <b>propeller,</b> a valve in its engine malfunctioned; continuing with an auxiliary valve caused a large amount of vibration, so the ship was stopped just hours later for temporary repairs on the main valve before continuing to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs. Michigan had the same problem when escorting a convoy in the next month; the ship lost its <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> on 8 October, but managed to return home on 11 October without further incident. After the war's end on 11 November 1918, both South Carolina-class battleships were used to repatriate American soldiers that had been fighting in the war.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers {{there are many}} specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with transverse thrusters for maneuvring at <b>ports.</b> The <b>propeller</b> {{is connected to the}} main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a diesel-electric powertrain in which the propeller is turned by an electric motor powered by the ship's generators.|$|R
60|$|Cliffe and his {{daughter}} were landed at Kingston, and three weeks later Grahame put into a Central-American <b>port.</b> The <b>propeller</b> was not running well, and Macallister, suspecting it was working loose on the shaft, declared that he must put the vessel on a beach where she would dry at low-water. Grahame had {{a few days to}} spare, for he could not land his cargo before the time Don Martin had fixed; but as the arms were on board he would have preferred to wait at sea, outside the regular steamers' track.|$|R
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of Britannic remained {{quite similar to}} those of her sister ships: she was 28.7 m wide and 275.8 m long (both exceeding those of her sisters by 5 m). With her gross tonnage of 48,158, she largely surpassed her sisters in terms of size (volume), but that did not make her the largest passenger ship in service at that time; the German SS Vaterland was significantly bigger than her. The ship was propelled by a mixed system already tested on her sisters: two triple expansion steam engines powering the three-bladed starboard and <b>port</b> wing <b>propellers</b> while a steam turbine recovered and used the surplus steam from the two engines to power the central four-bladed propeller. She could reach a speed of 23 knots.|$|R
500|$|Though {{unable to}} submerge, von Falkhausen {{attempted}} to flee on the surface, but the <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft became fouled. Realizing {{that he was}} stuck, and with Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II beginning to shell his boat, U-6s captain ordered code books and confidential material thrown overboard and the submarine scuttled.

500|$|Another Malta convoy (Operation Substance) was {{conducted}} in mid-July, heavily escorted by Force H and elements of the Home Fleet. Fearless was torpedoed by an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber at 09:45 on 23 July. The detonation killed 27 and wounded 11 of her crew, set the aft oil tank on fire, and knocked out all power and the <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft. Forester closed to render assistance, but the ship could not be saved under the circumstances. Her crew were taken off by her sister-ship, which then sank the wrecked and burning ship with torpedoes at 10:57, about [...] north-north-east of Bône, Algeria, in position [...]|$|E
500|$|Both of Tritons {{reactors}} {{share the}} same compartment, with its number one reactor located forward and its number two reactor located aft within that compartment. [...] The number one reactor supplied steam to the forward engine room and the starboard propeller shaft. The number two reactor supplied steam to the after engine room and the <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft. Each reactor could individually supply steam for the entire ship, or the reactors could be cross-connected as required. [...] It is this enhanced reliability, redundancy, and dependability of its dual-reactor plant that was {{a key factor in}} the selection of Triton to undertake the first submerged circumnavigation of the world.|$|E
50|$|After {{spending}} most of September at the Navy Yard, the steamer operated in the Chesapeake Bay area until ordered to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in late October. Sailing on the 29th, she participated in the capture of Fort Walker and Fort Beauregard at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 7 November, then remained in the area until December. Following damage to her <b>port</b> shaft and <b>propeller,</b> she was towed to New York by the steamer Atlantic, arriving on 20 December.|$|R
5000|$|Naquin {{also was}} a {{survivor}} {{of the attack on}} Pearl Harbor while aboard the battleship , which sank in shallow water after being struck a bomb and two torpedoes in the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. During World War II, he served as navigator of the heavy cruiser [...] in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. At the Battle of Tassafaronga on November 30, 1942 the cruiser was struck by a Japanese torpedo, which detonated the ships forward magazines and gasoline tanks and the ensuing explosion severed 150 ft of her bow forward of turret #2. The severed bow, including turret #1, swung around the port side and crushed several holes in the New Orleans hull before it sank at the stern and damaged the <b>port</b> inboard <b>propeller.</b> Naquin guided the ship to Tulagi Harbor, which was reached near daybreak on December 1, 1942 for repairs and was awarded a Bronze Star for his role in saving the vessel.|$|R

There, they operated with {{units of the}} Far East Fleet, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy. In April 1963 she collided with a wharf when docking in Brisbane, damaging her ASDIC sonar equipment. On 8 May, Tabard {{was involved in a}} further minor collision with Royal Australian Navy frigate , following a week of anti-submarine training exercises. Tabard was at periscope depth when Queenborough passed above her, bending the submarine's fin and the frigate's keel and <b>port</b> <b>propeller.</b> Both vessels were able to safely return to Sydney, where they docked at naval base HMAS Kuttabul for repairs.|$|E

Three other destroyers refuelled and completed their repairs on 11 April, but Bey decided against another breakout attempt despite the fog and poor visibility that night. While at anchor, Wolfgang Zenker briefly grounded during the night and damaged her <b>port</b> <b>propeller,</b> which limited her speed to [...] Bey made no attempt to breakout during the night of 12/13 April.|$|E
500|$|Kroonland resumed her {{civilian}} {{career in}} April 1920, sailing {{once again for}} the Red Star Line on the New York – Antwerp route.

50|$|The ship's {{drivetrain}} is {{the more}} efficient diesel/electric, powered by five Wärtsilä diesel engines. The engines produce low NOx emissions, using low-sulphur fuel. The engines turn alternators producing electricity. Propulsion is by two GE Energy Power Conversion electric motors with each giving 21,850 kW at 138 rpm. Redundancy is provided, with the two fully independent electric motors each turning a fixed propeller on conventional propeller shafts. The two propellers are fully independent ensuring propulsion if one fails. The same approach {{was applied to the}} two fully independent steering systems. Further advantage of using electric motors to turn the propellers is in small sunshine <b>ports.</b> Each <b>propeller</b> is controlled individually, and quickly, for ease of ship manoeuvrability along with the four bow thrusters. The need for tugs while in the many ports of call is greatly reduced. Two of the five engines have 16 cylinders each with an output of 16,800 kW, and the remaining three engines have 12 cylinders each producing 12,600 kW. Total power generated is 71,400 kW at 514 rpm.|$|R
500|$|She {{arrived at}} Wilhelmshaven on 10 May {{and spent the}} next month under repair. Paul Jacobi {{returned}} to Trondheim on 30 June and helped to screen the crippled battleship [...] as she returned to Kiel on 25 July. The ship laid a minefield in the North Sea before she was transferred to the Atlantic Coast of France in mid-September. Now based at Brest the ship helped to lay a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28/29 September. Five ships totalling only 2,026 GRT were sunk by this minefield. Paul Jacobi arrived back at Wilhelmshaven to begin a lengthy refit that lasted until October 1941. While departing Aarhus, Denmark for Norway, she fouled a buoy that damaged her <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> and had to return to Kiel for repairs that took until 24 November. After loading mines at Aarhus, she had a boiler breakdown and had to return to Germany. While docked at Wilhelmshaven on 29 December, Paul Jacobi was slightly damaged by bomb splinters that also killed three crewmen.|$|E

Joined by , , and West Virginia, the fleet of battleships began its bombardment of Okinawa on 27 March. Providing shore bombardment, and later naval artillery support for ground forces, New York was on station for 76 consecutive days, during which she expended 4,159 rounds of 14-inch ammunition and 7,001 rounds of 5-inch ammunition. She was subjected to a kamikaze attack on 14 April which destroyed one spotting plane on its catapult, but the Japanese aircraft crashed [...] from the ship and New York received only superficial damage, suffering two men injured. She was detached on 11 June, her gun barrels having been worn out by fire, and proceeded to Pearl Harbor to have her guns relined {{in preparation for the}} invasion of mainland Japan. She stopped by Leyte on 14 June and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 July. She was in the harbor on 15 August, the end of the war.|$|E
500|$|Some {{equipment}} {{had been}} removed when Australia was decommissioned for use in other ships, but after the November 1923 decision by the Cabinet confirming the scuttling, RAN personnel and private contractors began to remove piping and other small fittings. Between November 1923 and January 1924, £68,000 of equipment was reclaimed; over half was donated to tertiary education centres (some of which was still in use in the 1970s), while the rest was either marked for use in future warships, or sold as souvenirs. Some consideration was given to reusing Australias 12-inch guns in coastal fortifications, but this did not occur as ammunition for these weapons was no longer being manufactured by the British, {{and the cost of}} building suitable structures was excessive. It was instead decided to sink the gun turrets and spare barrels {{with the rest of the}} ship. There was also a proposal to remove Australias conning tower and install it on the Sydney Harbour foreshore; although this did not go ahead, the idea was later used when the foremast of [...] was erected as a monument at Bradleys Head.

500|$|During {{this period}} of the battle, torpedo bombers from the carrier [...] arrived on the scene, and their attack forced Vittorio Veneto to break off the {{engagement}} with the British cruisers to take evasive action. She evaded the torpedoes, but the attack convinced Iachino that the Mediterranean Fleet was at sea, which prompted him to end the operation and return to port. The British launched several air attacks against the Italian fleet {{in an attempt to}} slow down Vittorio Veneto, including land-based Blenheim bombers from Greece and Crete. Later in the afternoon Formidable launched a second strike, and at 15:10 one of her Swordfish hit Vittorio Veneto on her port side, aft.

5000|$|Bismarck was {{propelled}} {{by a set}} of quadruple screws driven by four direct drive Parsons turbines. The <b>port</b> centre <b>propeller</b> shaft was driven by a high-pressure turbine, which exhausted to an intermediate pressure turbine that drove the starboard centre shaft. These two turbines were located in the forward watertight compartment. Exhaust from the intermediate turbine was divided equally and fed into two low-pressure turbines on the outer shafts located in a separate compartment aft. The steam turbines generated approximately [...] when running at 180 rpm. Each one of the low-pressure turbines weighed 375 tons. Steam was supplied to the turbines at 260 psi by 48 Yarrow & Normand water-tube boilers located in four watertight compartments. The boilers had a heating surface of [...] and there was a total of 240 oil burners fitted to them. Three funnels were fitted to the vessel but only the forward two were used to carry boiler exhaust. As with many large liners, the third funnel was used to ventilate the engines rooms. Bismarck was originally designed to burn coal but was converted to oil while being completed at Blohm & Voss.|$|R
25|$|The {{electric}} power {{produced by the}} main engines and generators was transformed into propeller thrust by three large DC motors coupled to the propeller shafts. The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the <b>port</b> and starboard <b>propellers.</b> The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|R
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1906 Suffrens above-water torpedo tubes were removed. She was drydocked {{adjacent}} to Iéna on 12 March 1907 at Toulon when the latter ship's magazine exploded. Burning fragments started a small fire aboard Suffren, {{but she was not}} otherwise damaged by the explosion. In early 1908 a [...] Barr and Stroud rangefinder was mounted on the navigation bridge. During manoeuvres off Golfe-Juan on 13 August 1908 the ship's <b>port</b> <b>propeller</b> shaft broke and the propeller fell off in water [...] deep. While a new shaft was ordered from Indret, Iénas corresponding shaft was used with such success that the ship's engineers requested to keep it in place and save the new shaft as a spare. This proposal was rejected by the Naval Ministry and the offending shaft was exchanged. The opportunity was also taken to successfully rework the centre propeller shaft's mounting so that it would overheat less often. In November 1910 the starboard propeller shaft broke and the propeller was lost in deep water. No shaft was immediately available so Suffren had to wait three months for repairs. In the meantime, however, her boilers were overhauled. On 14 February 1911 the port anchor chain broke, killing one sailor and injuring two others. During another fleet exercise on 28 May 1914 Suffren suddenly lost power and was struck by the battleship [...] She was only lightly damaged with her port anchor and hawsepipe carried away.|$|E
