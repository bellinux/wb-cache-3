Traditionally the INS data are injected into the loops once every loop update interval, which limits the levels of dynamics accommodated. This paper presents a sample-wise aiding method, which interpolates the aiding Doppler into each digital sample of the local signal to further eliminate the dynamic errors. The relationship between the tracking error and the <b>aiding</b> <b>rate</b> is derived analytically. Moreover, the effects of sample-wise aiding using linear and spline interpolations are simulated and compared with traditional aiding under different INS data update rates. Finally, extensive tests based on a digital IF (intermediate frequency) signal simulator and a software receiver validate the theoretical equations and demonstrate that the dynamic stress error can be significantly reduced by sample-wise aiding...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{application}} effect of montelukast in combined with extended care {{in children with}} bronchial asthma. Methods: A total of 80 children with bronchial asthma who were admitted in our hospital from May, 2014 to May, 2015 {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the observation group and the control group with 40 cases in each group. The patients in the two groups were given routine treatments and pidotimod granules. On this basis, the patients in the observation group were given additional montelukast and extended care after discharge. The fasting peripheral venous blood before treatment and 3 months after treatment in the two groups was collected. The immunoturbidimetry was used to detect the serum IgA, IgG, and IgM. The pulmonary function detector was used to detect FEV 1, FVC, and PEF. Follow-up visits were paid to record the asthma attack times, readmission <b>rate,</b> re-first <b>aid</b> <b>rate,</b> and first <b>aid</b> times after discharge within 1 year. Results: IgA and IgG after treatment in the two groups were significantly elevated (P 0. 05). The elevated degree of IgA and IgG in the observation group was significantly greater than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). FEV 1 (L), FVC (L), and PEF (L/min) after treatment in the two groups were significantly elevated when compared with before treatment (P< 0. 05). The elevated degree of FEV 1, FVC, and PEF in the observation group was significantly greater than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). The asthma attack times, readmission <b>rate,</b> re-first <b>aid</b> <b>rate,</b> and first <b>aid</b> times after discharge within 1 year in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The routine treatment in combined with montelukast can better effectively control the symptoms in children with asthma, and improve the pulmonary function. After discharge, the extended care can be more beneficial to control the asthma attack, and enhance the living quality...|$|R
40|$|Electric rate design {{relies on}} cost incurrance for pricing and pricing structures. However, as {{utilities}} {{move into a}} marketing mode, rate design needs to respond more to customer reactions to pricing changes. Intraclass price elasticities <b>aid</b> <b>rate</b> designers by estimating customer behavior to change. Intraclass price elasticities vary with customer usage. The more energy used by a customer, the greater the amount of elasticity. For an industrial customer, this means that all energy consumed up to the amount necessary for base operations is relatively inelastic. All energy consumption beyond this becomes more elastic as usage increases. In the book "Innovative Electric Rates," John Chamberlin and Charles Dickson utilize an economic model to test conservation programs. This model utilizes intraclass price elasticities and has a direct use in current electric rate design. The model is a strong indicator of how best a company's electric prices and pricing structures manage demand-side growth, increase energy sales consumption, and aide in non-discriminatory economic development...|$|R

By {{the year}} 2030, America may have {{over one million}} centenarians. The issue of {{delivering}} quality nursing home care to the elderly population is becoming critical and greatly dependent on the frontline nursing staff. Since 1997, {{there has been a}} national ???culture change??? movement that has identified consistent assignment as a cornerstone practice of its advocacy. The review of the literature examines staff assignment and its correlation for improving quality indicators in nursing home care. Regulatory bodies require nursing homes to report certain objectively measurable data to <b>aid</b> <b>rating</b> the quality of care. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine a nursing home that uses consistent assignment compared with a rotating assignment nursing home and its effect on staff turnover, resident restraint use and frequency of pressure ulcers. Data obtained from the Medicare and OSHPD websites were used for examining the two nursing homes selected. The data presented lower percentages overall for the nursing home using consistent assignment protocols, which can translate into improved Medicare quality rating. This study, due to the small sample size and with the absence of raw data could not draw any statistical correlation between consistent assignment and improved nursing home care among the three quality indicators examined.
