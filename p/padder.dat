Not a ruffler or a wench was in the streets after dark, nor any one save staid citizens upon their business, or the halberdiers of the watch. The second visit which I made was over this business of the levelling of the ramparts, when I and neighbour Foster, the glover, were sent at the head of a deputation from this town to the Privy Council of Charles. Who could have credited that a few years would have made such a change? Every evil thing that had been stamped underground had spawned and festered until its vermin brood flooded the streets, and the godly wore themselves driven to shun the light of day.

The <b>Padder</b> area produces world class Pine nuts called chilgoza {{which is a}} delicacy and costly dry fruit. In Marwah, Chatroo, Mughalmaidan and Bounjwah Tehsils wall nut production of best quality walnuts in thousands of tons is recorded but due to absence of any fruit Mandi the exact figures are not available. Besides walnut, Marwah Tehsil produces {{thousands of tons of}} kidney beans which is the cash crop of the area. Villages of Pochhal, Matta and Hidyal produce saffron of good quality. The rural households are also abundantly gifted by nature through cash crops of eatable mushrooms and morchella called guchhi in local language. Some families have been reported to earn more than Rs1,00,000 per year by just selling the dried morchella in local markets. The eatable ferns are also a natural cash crop of the area. The apples are produced in some areas however the quality of Kishtwar apple is not of world class. Due to dry nature of the climate the village peasant population usually grow wheat and barley in Rabi season and kidney bean and maize in Kharif season.The rivers are rich source of electricity and the site of the hydroelectric power projects of Dul Hasti 390 MW, Ratle 850 MW, Kirthai 1400 MW, Pakal Dool 1,000 MW, Lower Kalnai 48 MW and Chaudhary 15MW, Keeru HEPP and Kwar HEPP with the highest per capita wattage production in world for such a small area.These projects have been the largest source of employment and have immensely contributed to the prosperity of the area.

30|$|CICT probes {{the value}} of CI periodically. The {{periodicity}} can be after every operation or periodically after some time gap. We chose a time gap of 5  s. If the observed CI {{is less than the}} desired value of CI, we trigger the time gap <b>padder.</b> The <b>padder</b> inputs the threshold value for the given database design (t 0) from threshold predictor and then pads the input workload with t 0 so that the read follows the update with t 0 delay to ensure the correctness of the read operation. Time gap padding is operationally implemented by delaying the read operation by t 0. Thus the reads are refrained from the unsafe period and outputted as correct reads. This results in improvement in {{the value of}} CI. If the CI is above the desired value, the time gap <b>padder</b> is bypassed and the workload is directed to the replica allocator. Thus the performance is maintained. Thus we get a stable desired value of CI with minimal compromise on performance.|$|E
30|$|The {{threshold}} {{predictor of}} the CICT for stock data object was {{then used to}} find the minimum time gap (to) that must be inserted between a read and the latest preceding update to assure a correct read (1) on the stock domain. The threshold predictor of CICT of stock domain in TPCC uses Equation 2 to calculate the t 0 for given value of Rp of stock data object. The threshold value (t 0) is then used by the time gap <b>padder</b> to introduce a minimum time gap, which will guarantee the correctness in the read by minimally affecting the performance.|$|E
40|$|Glass fibers (GF) {{are widely}} used as a {{reinforcing}} material for many polymer products; to form very strong and light weight materials. Surface flaw generated by contact makes the glass fiber highly sensitive. Defects or cracks in the surface of glass fiber threaten the mechanical strength of the fiber that deteriorates the durability of glass fiber. Coating can play crucial role by forming single or multiple molecular layers on the glass fiber in rectifying the surface flaws and modify surface properties of glass fiber either online or offline. In this experiment, coating was introduced on the fiber surface by continuous impregnation of fiber with a solution of polymer in a <b>padder</b> {{in order to improve}} the mechanical strength of glass fibers. The tensile properties of GF roving after coating were studied. The experimental results showed that the tensile properties of coated GF roving were improved significantly compared to uncoated GF roving. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
30|$|The input {{workload}} to a CICT is {{a series}} of read and update operations. In case of a real time web application, this input is a random sequence of read and update operations separated with random time gap. As we had to control the input workload, the sub transactions on a data object are modelled using a multithreaded, randomly generated sequence of read and updates. Thus the workload was randomized with respect to the number of reads and updates and their occurrence. The database design in terms of number of replicas was statically fed to the tuner and varied for observations. The desired value of CI (CIdesired) was fed and varied for different observation sequence. The threshold–time predictor uses the statistical linear regression between the time gap and number of replicas as discussed in 7.2. 4. The time gap <b>padder</b> then pads the minimum time gap between an update and a succeeding read so that it results in correct read. This results in increase in the value of CI at the cost of response time. When CI reaches the user defined value, the time delay is not introduced until the next poll.|$|E
40|$|Enzymatic {{polymerization}} of aniline {{was first}} performed in lignosulfonate (LGS) template system. High-redox-potential catalyst laccase, isolated from Aspergillus, {{was used as}} a biocatalyst in the synthesis of conducting polyaniline/lignosulfonate (PANI-ES-LGS) complex using atmospheric oxygen as the oxidizing agent. The linear templates (LGS), also serving as the dopants, could facilitate the directional alignment of the monomer and improve the solubility of the conducting polymer. The process of the polymerization was monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy, by which the conditions for laccase-catalyzed synthesis of PANI-ES-LGS complex were also optimized. The structure characterizations and solubility of the complex were carried out using corresponding characterization techniques respectively. The PANI-ES-LGS suspensions obtained was used as coating for cotton with a conventional <b>padder</b> to explore the applications of the complex. The variable optoelectronic properties of the coated cotton were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and color strength test.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the project was to alter and {{optimize}} the water repellant textile coating formulations to reach enhanced durability. For this purpose, the project was approached with three methods. Firstly, bio-based components were implemented in the mother emulsion to act as surfactant and crosslinking agent and to provide hydrophobic properties. Secondly different binders were added to crosslink and increase the coating resistance towards washes. Lastly additives at nano-scale were added to increase surface roughness in order to obtain higher hydrophobicity and improved of crosslinking capacity due to the presence of more functional groups.   The stability of all emulsions was controlled using different techniques such as optical microscopy to determine particle size, distribution and any observable instability (flocculation etc.), normal aging at room temperature and accelerated aging using higher temperature. All coatings were applied using a laboratory <b>padder</b> on standard PA and PES pieces of textiles and hydrophobic performance was evaluated through ISO 4920 spray test. By standard washing and repeating spray test, durability could be assessed. Further structure and property studies have been run using other tests such as: contact angle measurement, breathability of the coating and SEM observations. Based on the obtained results the incorporation of low HLB, bio-based surfactants in low amount (~ 0, 25 %) resulted in an increase in the hydrophobic performance of the tested textiles. However, a decrease in shelf life could be observed with these surfactants at room temperature. Sonication was successfully used to increase both stability and shelf life significantly. Some binders and nanoparticles proved to be successful in increasing the coating quality and thus the durability. Overall many of the developed formulations could enhance performance on PA compared to the already present commercial product. On PES textile, however, the developed strategies yielded hydrophobic effect close to the commercial product...|$|E
