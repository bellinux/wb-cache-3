Dreyfus argues for the acceptance of non-conceptual embodied coping as a necessary "ground floor" for conceptual knowledge, illustrated by his argument about expertise.

McDowell makes clear that his argumentation for the pervasiveness of rational mindedness in experience and agency, as a transcendental argument, cannot be affected by the results of phenomenologic analysis. The epistemological characteristics of the method of existential phenomenology and of the method of transcendental argumentation are discussed and their role in the course of the debate is analyzed.

The analysis focuses on those who, according to the data gathered through participant observation, are identified as “real bodybuilders” namely: those who put their “ideal body” reference as a totalizing element of their identity. The aim of the research is to show how such individuals, once they have chosen an ideal body model – a model which is not hegemonic within society as whole – use it as a frame for almost all their cognitive representations and social interactions (gender, leadership, rituals, world classification and so on). It is mainly the body to provide a means of identification to this competitive subculture which is quite cohesive in terms of lifestyles and it also provides a means of individuation through its particular construction as well as <b>presumed</b> <b>authority</b> in terms of expertise readable as a form of power/knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Chinua Achebe (1930 - 2013) {{published}} his major novel, Things Fall Apart (1958), in postcolonial Nigeria. In it he presents a colonial narrative using English as its primary mode of communication. However, {{his use of}} native Igbo words and the world they invoke problematizes a eurocentric assumption of the totality and universality of a given language, in this case, English. He employs acts of translation and introduces hybrid languages in order to engender dialogue that subverts the dominance of any one language and the world that it creates for its speakers. In a parallel fashion, this thesis uses two different theoretical approaches that have not typically been placed in dialogue with each other — postcolonial theory and hermeneutics — to view and interpret the nuances present in Achebe’s text that neither could illuminate on its own. This dialogical approach reveals insufficiencies in the independent theories and allows them to mutually supplement each other. Together these theories show how the novel subverts the <b>presumed</b> <b>authority</b> of the English language and universalizing discourses {{in order to identify}} the confrontation of lived linguistic worlds and horizons in the postcolonial context. The novel reorients those structures of understanding and interpretation around a subject that has historically been denied a voice...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{translation}} {{is central to}} the formation of post-colonial identities. While its literal purpose, to convert and explain one language into another, has often served as a means of subjugation, it also works figuratively to mediate cultural messages, practices and beliefs, and to help reconcile differences. A translation can rupture insular notions of identity that may be held by both oppressed and oppressor, and which are anchored in their binary opposition towards the Other. Initially through analysis of Chinua Achebe's novel Things Fall Apart, this paper explores the use of language in post-colonial literature, placing this notion of translation as central to its production. In the fifty years since its first publication, much of the acclaim for Achebe's novel has attested precisely to his presentation of Igbo culture and concerns through the lens of English, and his use of the dominant language {{in such a way as}} to undermine and oppose its <b>presumed</b> <b>authority.</b> In turning attention to Myal, by Jamaican novelist Erna Brodber, the paper contrasts the demands facing Achebe with those experienced by a post-colonial writer working from a different geographic and cultural perspective, and one specifically informed by the legacy of Diaspora. As well as offering a critique of the pedagogical interpellation of the colonial subject, Myal portrays the adaptations of language that have occurred in order to resist the exercise of such authority and to assert an independent explanation of history and identity. The paper concludes by acknowledging the limitations of translations, but suggests that an awareness of the shortcomings of language should encourage a greater investment in the art of listening; especially when confronted with cultural difference...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Social Values in Medical Research track. Here again we are back at the basic difference of attitude adopted by sociologists and anthropologists toward their raw material. The statistical sociologist takes it for granted that the truth which he is seeking is contained in his questionnaire answers and that the mathematical technique is capable of revealing that truth [...] . it is in the very nature of questionnaire investigation that the “results” tend to err in the direction of ideal stereotypes. Hence any attempt to investigate, by questionnaire research, the degree of fit between an ideal stereotype and actual practice is a waste of time. (Leach, 1967) Questioning claims to objectivity, both in terms of its plausibility and presumed value, have become canonical activities within feminist philosophy of science. The continued relevance of the citation from Leach suggests both the historicity and the contemporary pull of this critique; it also hints at the possibility of understanding the ontological and epistemological problematization of an objectivist stance as being intimately connected to an ethical one. Drawing from a range of philosophical literature, including that of Charles Taylor, Bruno Latour and Michel Foucault, as well as fifteen months of qualitative research within an inner city community, I argue that the objectivist models of human activities employed within epidemiology presuppose a clear distinction between description and evaluation, contributing to an understanding of social reality as consisting of brute data. This ultimately misconstrues modes of social relations as individual actions or behaviours, and in so doing contributing to the persistence of harmful social identities, stereotypes and tropes. By focusing on factors that influence the health of populations, epidemiology provides the foundation of public health and preventive medicine practices. Alan Peterson explains the relationship between epidemiological risk analysis and health services, saying, “epidemiology has become so central to the public health endeavor of identifying, reducing exposure to, or eliminating ‘risks’ that it has become almost synonymous with the public health enterprise itself” (Peterson 1997, p. 197). Social epidemiology, a subfield of analytic epidemiology, examines the relationships between broadly defined socio-behavioural and socioeconomic factors and poor health, and is thus a particularly important source of data for surveillance and public health interventions, including those related to HIV/AIDS. Given this fundamental relationship between epidemiology and the public health enterprise, I consider how, within the context of HIV, this relationship between may assist in perpetuating problematic and harmful social identities. Due to an explosive HIV epidemic in the mid-nineties, the inner city of Vancouver, British Columbia (commonly referred to as the Downtown Eastside) is a highly studied space. The plethora of research surrounding access and adherence to HIV care provides an opportunity to examine the processes by which <b>presumed</b> <b>authority</b> and objectivity within the production of scientific knowledge may confer inadvertent consequences and latent effects. Employing categorizations of barriers to care and risks for non-adherence that are amenable to survey format, studies examine self-regulatory efficacy, medication beliefs, as well as the ability to make certain kinds of projections to the future, i. e. outcome and efficacy expectations. As I examine in this paper, the emphasis on so-called “life skills” can be read as part of the neo-liberal rationality (Peterson, p. 197 - 198), given the emphasis on self-management; the “unhealthy” body thereby designating an individual who lacks control, responsibility and autonomy. Surveillance measures justify a “will to empower,” and are at once totalizing and individualizing— risk group abbreviations (FSWs, IDUs) cement these subjectivities as a given. The failure of those in the inner city to adequately perform self-managing activities {{in the course of their}} HIV care is construed as transgression and deviance, while the resultant pathologies mark them as belonging to a uniform population of similar “kinds” of at-risk caricatures. Although it has become commonplace in the research community to examine so-called environmental factors in access and adherence studies, more often than not these simply reinforce the notion of the community as itself pathological, leading to an additional source of stigma for residents. Moreover, merely reciting a litany of “structural” barriers, in terms of housing shortages and challenges, quantity of time spent interfacing with the correctional system etc., without engaging in methodologies that move away from individual behaviour and causal explanations, does little to examine the multifarious ways in which different institutions are interconnected, how they must simultaneously be negotiated, or the relationship between daily interpersonal interactions and the norms and ideologies of larger structures—a viewpoint that prioritizes the presumed rationality of a biomedical perspective. While I don’t deny that one’s mental life, living arrangements, and the effects of on-going substance use play a role in antiretroviral adherence, I argue here that the emphasis on individual cognitive components of adherence and proxy measures of “structure” detach the act of ingesting medicines from meanings attached to the act, as well as from the relationships individuals have within the health care system. The rationalizing language employed in the analyses imply a cause-effect relationship between the variables under study—while this may be useful for program and policy advocacy, the analyses nonetheless fail to capture the complexity of adherence as a social phenomena; phenomena that cannot be entirely or even adequately understood through cross-sectional data. In the context of HIV, an ethical problem emerges. Describing individual actions as “data,” or “fact,” constructs and entrenches transgressive social identities. As Michel de Certeau suggests, with respect to realism and historical analysis, claiming to represent reality camouflages the practices that determine the representation presented (de Certeau, in Scott 1991, p. 777). The oft-cited limitations of cross-sectional study fail to address the rhetorical implications of causal-type explanation and claims to representativeness, particularly when studies suggest that the lack of direction of observation ought to be addressed by creating new prospective cohorts. Given that stigmatization is itself thought to be part of part of the risk environment for HIV and adverse health outcomes, the reliance of public health on methods that unreflexively interpret human action is not only epistemological suspect, it is ethically problematic as well...|$|E

Similarly, a man should not be so self-indulgent as to exploit a female slave sexually; however, her right not to be used is not a motive for his restraint.

But the Legion of Frontiersmen is equipped for war, oh!--in Arizona in 1890, and so far as I am able to judge the most modern sections of the army extant are organised for a colonial war in (say) 1899 or 1900. There is, of course, a considerable amount of vague energy demanding conscription and urging our youth towards a familiarity with arms and the backwoodsman's life, but of any thought-out purpose in our arming widely understood, of any realisation of what would have to be done and where it would have to be done, and of any attempts to create an instrument for that novel unprecedented undertaking, I discover no trace.|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{an asset}} {{value-based}} approach for the valuation of credit portfolio risk including the estimation and the backtesting of the model’s forecasting ability. On {{the basis of}} the credit valuation model proposed by Black and Cox (1976) an asset value-based factor model for the forecasting of credit portfolio risk is suggested. The model includes credit losses from the default of obligors as well as negative changes of credits’ mark-to-model values. Using market prices of defaultable corporate bonds a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of the state-space models of systematic factors and asset values of risk classes is performed. The backtesting procedure assesses the forecasting ability of the credit portfolio model using three zones of credit portfolio loss that are defined analogously to the regulatory backtesting of internal market risk models. Probability distributions of credit portfolio loss are simulated and the backtesting zones of portfolio loss are compared for different credit portfolios and different variations of the backtesting procedure, the model structure and the parameters. The results show that for typical levels of confidence and typical time horizons the Credit-VaR exceeds banks’ capital considerably. Furthermore, backtesting zones of credit portfolio loss that fit to banks’ capital levels result in a level of test significance that is distinctly lower than in the backtesting of market risk models. It is concluded that the revised capital requirements set by the Basel Committee do not prevent credit portfolio losses exceeding banks’ capital with the statistical confidence <b>presumed</b> by supervisory <b>authorities...</b>|$|R

This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it civil <b>authority</b> <b>presumes</b> to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups religious communities have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community".|$|R
40|$|Field {{research}} conducted in Papua New Guinea (PNG) has recorded Gyrinops ledermannii Domke (Thymelaeaceae) as an agarwood-producing species {{for the first}} time. Aquilaria malaccensis Lam. (incl. A. agallocha Roxb.; Thymelaeaceae) or agarwood (also known as aloeswood, eaglewood, gaharu, and incensewood, and many other vernacular names) after infection by certain fungi develops a fragrant substance called agar in its wood. This has been traded since biblical times for its use in religious, medicinal, and aromatic preparations (see also Chadha, 1985). Agarwood-producing species in the Thymelaeaceae [Aetoxylon sympetalum (Steen. & Domke) Airy Shaw, Aquilaria beccariana Tiegh., A. filaria (Oken) Merr., A. hirta Ridl., A. malaccensis, A. microcarpa Baill., and Gonostylus bancanus (Miq.) Kurz] are found from India eastwards to Hainan, S China, and New Guinea. Agarwood is found naturally in {{only a small percentage}} of trees – with the highestgrade ‘product’ usually harvested from certain species of Aquilaria and despite the high levels of harvest and trade, only A. malaccensis is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). Over 1000 tonnes of agarwood were reported in international trade under the name A. malaccensis in 1998. The island of New Guinea is the eastern border of the agarwood-producing species’ range, and could also be the world’s last frontier for substantial wild agarwood stocks. But even New Guinea’s agarwood faces the threat of unprecedented levels of harvest and trade that have expanded over the past five years. On the PNG side of the border, harvesting has been prevalent since 1997 (O. Gideon, pers. comm. to TRAFFIC Oceania, 1999). At that time, PNG government <b>authorities</b> <b>presumed</b> that the species harvested for agarwood was A. filaria (Oken) Merr., which has been recorded from several locations in Irian Jaya (Ding Hou, 1960). The catalyst for this ‘sudden’ discovery of agarwood in PNG is most likely associated with Asian traders visiting the Sepik provinces bordering Irian Jaya, but could also involve Melanesian clan groups whose traditional lands traverse both sides of the border. Prior to the past five years, most indigenous PNGeans had never heard of the agarwood tree, nor used it for any traditional applications. It was widely regarded as just another forest tree unsuitable for making canoes or houses...|$|R
6000|$|XVII. That {{the first}} of his three instituted projects, namely, the depriving the Rajah of his territories, was by himself {{considered}} as a measure likely to be productive of much odium to the British government: he having declared, whatever opinions he might entertain of its justice, [...] "that it would have an appearance of severity, and might furnish grounds unfavorable to the credit of our government, and to his own reputation, from the natural influence which every act of rigor, exercised in the persons of men in elevated situations, is apt to impress on those who are too remote from the scene of action to judge, by any evidence of the facts themselves, of their motives or propriety." [...] And the second attempt, the sum of money which he aimed at by attacking the fortresses of the Rajah, and plundering them of the treasure supposed to be there secured, besides the obvious uncertainty of acquiring what was thus sought, would be liable to the same imputations with the former. And with regard to the third project, namely, the sale of the Company's sovereignty to the Nabob of Oude, and his having actually received proposals for the same, it was an high offence to the Company, as <b>presuming,</b> without their <b>authority</b> or consent, to put up to sale their sovereign rights, and particularly to put them up to sale to that very person against whom the independence of the said province had been declared by the Governor-General and Council to be necessary, as a barrier for the security of the other provinces, in case of a future rupture with him.[59] It was an heinous injury to the said Rajah to attempt to change his relation without his consent, especially on account of the person to whom he was to be made over for money, by reason of the known enmity subsisting between his family and that of the Nabob, who was to be the purchaser; and it was a grievous outrage on the innocent inhabitants of the zemindary of Benares to propose putting them under a person long before described by himself to the Court of Directors [...] "to want the qualities of the head and heart requisite for his station"; and a letter from the British Resident at Oude, transmitted to the said Court, represents him [...] "to have wholly lost, by his oppressions, the confidence and affections of his own subjects"; and whose distresses, and the known disorders in his government, he, the said Hastings, did attribute solely to his own bad conduct and evil character; admitting also, in a letter written to Edward Wheler, Esquire, and transmitted to the Court of Directors, [...] "that many circumstances did favor suspicion of his [the said Nabob's] fidelity to the English interest, the Nabob being surrounded by men base in their characters and improvident in their understandings, his favorites, and his companions of his looser hours. These had every cause to dread the effect of my influence on theirs; and both these, and the relations of the family, whose views of consequence and power were intercepted by our participation in the administration of his affairs, entertained a mortal hatred to our nation, and openly avowed it." [...] And the said Hastings was well aware, that, in case the Nabob, by him described in the manner aforesaid, on making such purchase, should continue to observe the terms of his father's original covenants and engagements with the Rajah, and should pay the Company the only tribute which he could lawfully exact from the said Rajah, it was impossible that he could, for the mere naked and unprofitable rights of a sovereignty paramount, afford to offer so great a sum as the Rajah did offer to the said Hastings for his redemption from oppression; such an acquisition to the Nabob (while he kept his faith) could not possibly be of any advantage whatever to him; and that therefore, if a great sum was to be paid by the Nabob of Oude, it must be for the purpose of oppression and violation of public faith, to be perpetrated in the person of the said Nabob, to an extent and in a manner which the said Hastings was then apprehensive he could not justify to the Court of Directors as his own personal act.|$|R
