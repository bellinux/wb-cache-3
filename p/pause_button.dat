500|$|In January 2015, a {{new image}} was {{uploaded}} to Cawthon's website, teasing a third entry in the series. [...] Various teaser images followed, before a trailer was released on January 26, 2015. On February 15, 2015, Cawthon made a post on Steam stating that Five Nights at Freddy's 3 had been cancelled after a hacker supposedly leaked the game. This was later discovered to be a joke, as the [...] "leaked" [...] download link lead to a humorous clone of Scott's previous game, There is No <b>Pause</b> <b>Button!.</b> Five Nights at Freddy's 3 was legitimately released for Microsoft Windows on March 3, 2015, with Android and iOS ports following on March 7, 2015 and March 12, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from the novel. He titled his script Angel Heart {{as he wanted}} to {{distance}} his film adaptation from the source material. While Falling Angel is set entirely in New York City, Parker had {{the second half of}} his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to voodoo and the occult. He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision and said that he had considered setting his novel in New Orleans. Angel Heart is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. Parker explained, [...] "1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s—and, because of the historical <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> of World War II, conceivably the 1930s—so quite simply, setting it in this year allowed me to give an older look to the film." ...|$|E
5000|$|The game pad is a USB-only pad with 10 [...] "panels": up, down, {{left and}} right arrows, along with a circle in the up-left position, an X in the up-right position, a square in the bottom-left position, and a {{triangle}} in the bottom-right position. It also has Escape (ESC) and <b>pause</b> <b>buttons</b> that when pressed simultaneously exit the game.|$|R

50|$|The {{handheld}} has an 8-way thumbstick for directional control, {{menu and}} start buttons, four face buttons and four shoulder buttons: L1, L2, R1, R2. The shoulder buttons {{are used for}} changing screen aspect ratio and <b>pausing</b> games. <b>Buttons</b> to adjust volume and brightness are located under the handheld.|$|R
500|$|In the game, {{the player}} uses the {{directional}} pad to move Wonder Boy left or right, crouch down (only possible as Hu-Man or Lizard-Man), or to enter doors. The {{buttons on the}} controller are used to attack enemies and to jump. Wonder Boy can attack with his main weapon or with secondary weapons by holding down on the directional pad and pressing the attack button. Pressing the <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> brings up the Status Screen (and pauses the game if Wonder Boy is fighting a dragon). Wonder Boy has a life meter shown {{on the top of}} the gameplay area by a series of hearts. When all hearts turn black, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends, but if he has a life potion ("medicine vial" [...] in Dragon's Curse) remaining, he will revive with some of the hearts refilled. After the game ends, the player is taken to a [...] "continue screen"; there the player has an opportunity to win a free life potion before restarting the game at the town. Players can visit the town's church to receive a password in order to continue the game at a later time. The password saves the current player's form, equipment, and amount of gold; but it does not save any secondary weapons or life potions in stock. Dragon's Curse has a [...] "file cabinet" [...] which allows players to store passwords into the game's memory.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the years}} Tyler has kept files of note cards in which ideas and {{observations}} have been recorded. [...] Characters, descriptions, and scenes often emerge from these notes. [...] She says {{the act of}} putting words to paper for her is a “very mechanical process,” involving a number of steps: (1) writing first in long hand on unlined paper, (2) revising long hand versions, (3) typing the entire manuscript, (4) re-writing in long hand, (5) reading into a tape-recorder while listening for “false notes,” (6) playing back into a stenographer’s machine using the <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> to enter changes. [...] She can be quite organized, {{going so far as}} to map out floor plans of houses and to outline the chronology of all the characters in a given novel.|$|E
50|$|In most {{computer}} games, {{the escape}} key {{is used as a}} <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> and/or as a way to bring up the in-game menu, usually containing ways to exit the program.|$|E
25|$|Many {{electronic}} {{dance music}} and hip hop releases today are still preferred on vinyl; however, digital copies are still widely available. This is because for disc jockeys ("DJs"), vinyl has {{an advantage over}} the CD: direct manipulation of the medium. DJ techniques such as slip-cueing, beatmatching, and scratching originated on turntables. With CDs or compact audio cassettes one normally has only indirect manipulation options, e.g., the play, stop, and <b>pause</b> <b>buttons.</b> With a record one can place the stylus a few grooves farther in or out, accelerate or decelerate the turntable, or even reverse its direction, provided the stylus, record player, and record itself are built to withstand it. However, many CDJ and DJ advances, such as DJ software and time-encoded vinyl, now have these capabilities and more.|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} pad is used {{to direct}} the character on screen. Pressing the pad twice in one direction causes the character to sprint. Though the character can walk diagonally, he can not run diagonally. The character can jump {{with the use of}} the B button and can kick in jammed doors with the X button. The Y and A buttons are used to initiate the actions of the primary equipment and the secondary equipment that are equipped respectively. The use of the Start <b>button</b> <b>pauses</b> the game and brings up the inventory screen while the select <b>button</b> <b>pauses</b> the game and brings up the map screen.|$|R
40|$|Our {{students}} come from diverse backgrounds. They need flexibility in their learning. First year {{students tend to}} worry when they miss lectures or part of lectures. Having the lecture as an on line resource allows students to miss a lecture without stressing about it and to be more relaxed in the lecture, knowing that anything they may miss will be available later. The resource: The Windows based program from Blueberry Software (not Blackberry!) - BB Flashback - allows the simultaneous recording of the computer screen together with the audio, as well as Webcam recording. Editing capabilities include adding <b>pause</b> <b>buttons,</b> graphics and text to the file before exporting it in a flash file. Any diagrams drawn on the board or shown via visualiser can be photographed and easily incorporated. The audio from the file can be extracted if required to be posted as podcast. Exporting modes other than Flash are also available, allowing vodcasting if you wish. What you will need: - the recording software: it can be installed on the lecture hall computer just prior to lecture if needed - a computer: either the ones in lecture halls, especially if fitted with audio recording, or a laptop (I have used audio recording via Bluetooth for mobility). Feedback from students has been positive and will be presented on the poster. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} one of six Master System titles {{developed}} for use with Sega's stereoscopic 3-D glasses, but it also features a standard 2-D mode which may be accessed by pressing the <b>Pause</b> <b>button</b> when the title screen appears.|$|E

50|$|The GX4000 {{controller}} {{is similar}} to popular 8-bit gamepads of the time such as those for the Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System, {{as well as that}} for the TurboGrafx-16. It contains only two buttons on the actual pad with the <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> located on the console itself, and uses the prevailing de facto standard Atari-style 9-pin connector.|$|E
50|$|The 5200's {{internal}} hardware {{is almost}} identical to that of Atari's 8-bit computers, although software is not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers have an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start, <b>pause</b> and reset <b>buttons.</b> The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight-way joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{proliferation}} of devices that use media symbols in order to represent the Run/Stop/Pause functions. Likewise, user interface programing pertaining to these functions has also been influenced by that of media players. For example, some washers and dryers with a common illuminated play/pause button are programed so that when the appliance is off, the play/pause light stays off. When the device is running the light stays on, and when the washer/dryer is in a <b>paused</b> state, the <b>button</b> flashes. This type of programing {{is similar to that of}} earlier CD players, which are also set to flash in this manner in the pause state.|$|R
50|$|Many ads {{could be}} skipped. However, some cannot and many disable all buttons, forcing the {{listener}} {{to hear the}} ad before any music is played. Ads which can be skipped have no label or video. However, skipping ads accounts toward the hourly skip limit. Ads disabling all buttons are, as of March 2009, advertising hair products. Such ads often play upon the player's launch, {{and some of them}} have a video, which can cause problems do to increased memory usage. An occasional Nesquik ad disables the <b>pause</b> and skip <b>buttons,</b> but the channel can be changed. Refreshing the web page will generally work to skip adds.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, {{the term}} 'data burst' {{was used for}} a {{technique}} used by some United Kingdom and South African TV programmes to transmit large amounts of primarily textual information: they would display multiple pages of text in rapid succession, usually {{at the end of}} the programme; viewers would videotape it and then read it later by playing it back using the <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> after each page.|$|E
50|$|Scott Cawthon (born July 26, 1971) is an American {{independent}} {{video game}} designer, developer, animator and writer, and {{is best known}} for creating the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Cawthon has also created other games, such as Chipper & Son's Lumber Co., The Desolate Hope, and There is No <b>Pause</b> <b>Button!,</b> along with Christian-based animations such as A Christmas Journey and The Pilgrim's Progress. Scott used Autodesk 3ds Max and Clickteam Fusion 2.5 to develop Five Nights at Freddy's and most of his other games.|$|E

She praised the 'elegant' sound brought by the jazz pianist Song Young-joo [...] "which slowly fills the {{emptiness}} around until there's just no more room... and yet, we don't feel suffocated..." [...] Hong went on to praise the 'beautiful' visuals of the music video and the members for [...] "pushing the <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> {{in some of the}} busiest cities in the US." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gwydion's {{movements}} {{are controlled by}} the player using cursor buttons. In the original release version 1.01 (1986-11-08), using the AGI engine, the escape <b>button</b> <b>pauses</b> the game {{and there are no}} menus. Commands are accessed through the F keys, [...] "Ctrl-", or manually typing; F1 displays a Help file listing all the commands. It has disk-based copy protection. The version 2.14 (1988-3-15) was included in many of the King's Quest collections over the years, with the disk based self-booting copy-protection removed. Pushing escape brings up a menu (arrow keys can be used to choose options), and the speed controls are included in the menu.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{total of}} 80 girl 8 th-grade {{students}} viewed a short computer-based multimedia presentation consisting of 16 slides explaining lightening formation. They studied instructions set up interactivity level with system either low (<b>pause</b> and play <b>buttons)</b> or high (with 2 more buttons of backward and forward) and using either on-screen text or narration accompanying animations and took on cognitive load and performance. The {{results showed that}} narrative group spend less time and more mental effort than onscreen text group, while the low interactivity group outperformed the high interactivity group on tests of retention and transfer with spend less time. On findings performance is higher when behavioral activity during learning is lower and the interactivity level is not interacting with text modality...|$|R
40|$|Paired {{listening}} {{was originally}} {{developed as a}} research tool with the aim to understand the strategies used by L 2 learners when listening to recorded speech in the target language. It offers researchers a useful combination of direct observation and verbal data, whilst avoiding the common drawbacks of subjective introspection. This paper examines the potential of paired listening as a learning tool in the foreign language classroom. The principle is illustrated {{by means of a}} study that was conducted at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where 19 dyads of undergraduate students were observed as they tried to understand Spanish recordings in pairs. The study examined two sets of data: the way in which each pair played back the recording (using the play, <b>pause</b> and rewind <b>buttons</b> on their machine); and the participants' conversations throughout the task. A number of strategies were identified, comprising cognitive strategies (such as decoding and inferencing), metacognitive strategies (such as playback decisions) and social-affective strategies (such as pair co-operation and affective reactions to the input). The discussion of typical playback patterns and their related strategies forms the basis of a series of recommendations for the teaching of listening skills. Paired listening can assist listening instructors to assess and adjust the relative difficulty of a particular recording for their leamers, to encourage effective playback strategies (such as the optimum pace of progression through a recording), to evaluate and induce pair cooperation, and to channel affective reactions productively during the listening task. It is recommended as a complement to (rather than a replacement of) individual listening practice...|$|R

5000|$|Learner control principle: [...] Deeper {{learning}} {{occurs when}} learners {{can control the}} rate at which they move forward through segmented content.

Some research suggests not overwhelming the learner with too many control options, however. Giving just pause and play buttons may work better than giving pause, play, fast forward, reverse buttons. Also, high prior-knowledge learners may learn better when the lesson moves forward automatically, but they have a <b>pause</b> <b>button</b> that allows them to stop when they choose to do so.|$|E
