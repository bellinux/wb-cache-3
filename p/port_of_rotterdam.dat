50|$|The plan {{consisted}} of blocking the estuary mouths of the Oosterschelde, the Haringvliet and the Grevelingen. This reduced {{the length of}} the dikes exposed to the sea by 700 km. The mouths of the Nieuwe Waterweg and the Westerschelde were to remain open because of the important shipping routes to the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> and Antwerp. The dikes along these waterways were to be heightened and strengthened. The works would be combined with road and waterway infrastructure to stimulate the economy of the province of Zeeland and improve the connection between the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> and Antwerp.|$|R
50|$|For a long time, Hansweert was an {{important}} stop on the shortest shipping route between the busy <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> and Antwerp, but all that changed when the Scheldt-Rhine Canal opened up and became the quicker route. Hansweert's economy collapsed, {{and so did the}} village. The eastern part of the village was torn down {{to make way for a}} harbor; further renovation moved the canal farther from the village.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the port}} {{facilities}} {{needed to support}} containerization changed. One effect was the decline of some ports {{and the rise of}} others. At the Port of San Francisco, the former piers used for loading and unloading were no longer required, but there was little room to build the vast holding lots needed for container transport. As a result, the Port of San Francisco virtually ceased to function as a major commercial port, but the neighboring port of Oakland emerged as the second largest on the US West Coast. A similar fate met the relation between the ports of Manhattan and New Jersey. In the United Kingdom, the Port of London and Port of Liverpool declined in importance. Meanwhile, Britain's Port of Felixstowe and <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> in the Netherlands emerged as major ports. In general, inland ports on waterways incapable of deep-draft ship traffic also declined from containerization in favor of seaports. With intermodal containers, the job of sorting and packing containers could be performed far from the point of embarking.|$|E
25|$|The German war plan (the Schlieffen Plan) of 1905 was {{modified}} in 1908 to invade Belgium {{on the way}} to Paris but not the Netherlands. It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on. There were other factors that made it expedient for both the Allies and the Central Powers for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the Scheldt, the Rhine and the Meuse Rivers. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the Ruhr and connected it with the Dutch <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam.</b> Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It was too big a risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.|$|E

2500|$|The Government of the Commonwealth {{soon began}} researching the {{viability}} of a megaport in Puerto Rico by conducting land studies throughout the island, economic studies both in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and visiting existing megaports, such as the Port of Singapore and the <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam,</b> in order obtain an idea of a megaport’s operations and impact on local economies. These studies revealed {{the need for a}} large transshipment port in the Caribbean region to facilitate distribution from the emerging markets in Asia and the US west coast to the eastern coasts of North, Central and South America. The government also found that Puerto Rico had several advantages over its Caribbean competitors, which included first-class infrastructure (such as highways and several airports), strong economic and political ties with the United States, and the island’s close proximity to the Mona Passage (a large and deep channel between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic through which most ships sail when traveling between the Panama Canal and the US eastern coast). During this research stage, three potential locations were considered for the megaport ...|$|E

50|$|The {{end of the}} Golden age saw Amsterdam {{reaching}} {{the same level of}} economic importance as Antwerp; which had barely been able to establish itself as the Southern Netherlands' main center; continually pressured by the much larger cities of Paris and London; Western Europe's new powerhouses. It wasn't until after the Second World War that either city would again experience substantial growth; with the exception <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> and (to a far lesser extent) Antwerp, whose sea ports fueled the industries of the newly formed German Empire in the Ruhr. The post war Netherlands saw the formation of the Randstad; whereas in Flanders the Flemish diamond emerged. Today both regions; powered by the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> and Antwerp are agglomerating.|$|R
50|$|The {{storm surge}} barrier closes {{only when the}} sea-level is {{expected}} to rise 3 metres above mean sea level. Under normal conditions, the estuary's mouth is open, and salt water flows in and out with the tide. As a result of the change, the weak dikes along the Oosterschelde needed to be strengthened. Over 200 km of the dike needed new revetments. The connections between the Eastern Scheldt and the neighboring Haringvliet had to be dammed to limit the effect of the salt water. Extra dams and locks were needed at the east part of the Oosterschelde to create a shipping route between the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> and Antwerp.|$|R
2500|$|The Netherlands ( [...] ; [...] Frisian: Nederlân), {{also known}} informally as Holland, {{is a country}} in Western Europe with a {{population}} of seventeen million. It is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, alongside with three island territories in the Caribbean (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba). The European portion of the Netherlands exists out of twelve provinces and borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders in the North Sea with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The five largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht (forming the Randstad megalopolis) and Eindhoven (leading the Brabantse Stedenrij). Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of parliament and government. The <b>Port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam</b> is the largest port in Europe and the world's largest outside East Asia. Utrecht is a central node for road and railway communications, commerce and cultural events, while Eindhoven is an innovative city known for its economic attractiveness.|$|E
60|$|The galliot is rigged {{with square}} sails on her mainmast, a {{fore and aft}} main-sail, a gaff mizzen and mizzen gaff top-sails, and a high bowsprit.

If the reader has ever chanced to enter the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam,</b> he will have encountered plenty of examples of the craft we are describing; {{and if he did}} not altogether approve or admire their shape, he must at least have been struck by their remarkable cleanness and brightness. A Dutch galliot may be fifty, eighty, or even a hundred and fifty tons burden. When the Dutch build vessels of a larger size than this, they do so on very similar lines to English merchantmen, though usually somewhat broader and bluffer.|$|E
60|$|Presently a boat, {{that was}} backed like a partan-crab, came gingerly alongside, and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch. Thence Captain Sang turned, very troubled like, to Catriona; {{and the rest}} of us {{crowding}} about, the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all. The Rose was bound to the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rotterdam,</b> whither the other passengers were in a great impatience to arrive, in view of a conveyance due to leave that very evening in the direction of the Upper Germany. This, with the present half-gale of wind, the captain (if no time were lost) declared himself still capable to save. Now James More had trysted in Helvoet with his daughter, and the captain had engaged to call before the port and place her (according to the custom) in a shore boat. There was the boat, to be sure, and there was Catriona ready: but both our master and the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk, and the first was in no humour to delay.|$|E
