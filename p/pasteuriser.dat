40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{physical}} modelling of an industrial <b>pasteuriser</b> plant from a control-oriented point of view. The investigated <b>pasteuriser</b> {{is based on}} plate heat exchangers (PHE) of type Clip 10 -RM and brazed heat exchangers (BHE) of type CB 76 from Alfa Laval. The traditionally highly complex and over parameterised models established for design, dimensioning, and scientific purposes are not suitable for use within a control strategy in their present form. In this paper, a simplified first order first principles (FP) model of the PHE sections {{as well as the}} BHE heaters constructing the <b>pasteuriser</b> are developed. An integrated model of the entire <b>pasteuriser</b> is then constructed combining the first principles model obtained for different <b>pasteuriser</b> components. The <b>pasteuriser</b> model parameters are identified, and the model is validated using data obtained during five test protocol sessions performed on an industrial process. Finally an example of a model predictive control (MPC) strategy, using the developed model, is briefly introduced, results are shown and conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|Continuous thermal {{pasteurisation}} {{of various}} bulk liquid media {{is an important}} step in the food and allied industries. The design of a continuous flow <b>pasteuriser</b> is typically predicated on mathematical models developed from experimental data - usually batch, bench - scale, ethods. Of particular interest is the effect of combined <b>pasteuriser</b> temperature (T) and liquid pH on inactivation and survivor of contaminants. However, bench - scale thermal survivor data may not adequately mirror those in a continuous flow <b>pasteuriser.</b> This research presents the development and experimental validation of rigorous models for thermal pasteurisation of bacteria as affected by combined process T - pH in both batch, bench - scale capillary studies (static) and in a pilot continuous flow <b>pasteuriser</b> (dynamic), within a defined liquid and range of exposure time, temperature and pH (t - T - pH). Five integrated stages in synthesis and model analysis were undertaken using stringent criteria for goodness of fit of an adequate model established. First, four published predictive models were assessed against published static data (n [subscript T] = 248) for the thermal inactivation of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) in a Carbopol ® 941 liquid food simulant in batch capillaries over a range of t - T - pH. The models tested were the Classical Arrhenius, Davey Linear - Arrhenius (D - LA), Square - Root (Belehradek) and a third - order Polynomial model (nOP). Analysis showed the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for model selection and explained 96. 0 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. Second, the D - LA model was assessed against limited, published dynamic data (n [subscript T] = 109) for the same E. coli strain in identical food simulant. The model explained 60 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. On average, model predictions of survivor numbers from the dynamic data were less than that predicted from the static data, i. e. for a given (t - T - pH) more bacterial cells were apparently inactivated in the continuous flow <b>pasteuriser</b> than in bench - scale, batch capillary studies. Overall, however it was not clear from extensive analyses of available data whether there is a statistically significant difference in survivor numbers of viable E. coli between batch static and continuous flow dynamic data. Third, although the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for goodness of fit of a model, it failed to accurately predict the observed tails in the static survivor data. New models (KDT and a modified KDT) were synthesised to predict tails and shoulders in survivor data. The modified KDT (MKDT) form gave improved predictive capability over the KDT model when assessed against published static survivor data for E. coli and L. monocytogenes (n [subscript T] = 355) in the Carbopol food simulant. This model, however, could not be readily integrated with equations describing the performance of a continuous flow <b>pasteuriser.</b> Analyses indicated that a greater density of dynamic survivor data for E. coli was needed. Fourth, a pilot continuous flow <b>pasteuriser</b> was constructed and used to generate a greater density of dynamic survivor data of E. coli (ATCC 25922) in a Carbopol ® 941 carrier liquid for rigorous comparison with predictions from the Lin (1976) isothermal continuous laminar flow process model. Direct steam injection heating was used. Extensive dye and digital - video studies, in a section of glass holding tube confirmed the practical implementation of the assumptions of laminar flow and rapid condensation of steam. Extensive practical experiments highlighted a non - isothermal condition along the holding tube. A highly linear dependence (R ² > 0. 90) of exposure temperature with holding tube length, i. e. exposure time, was demonstrated. This was accounted for using mathematical approaches and quantitatively incorporated into a D - LA model for the rate coefficient in an extended Lin process model. A block experimental design of 4 T (54, 56, 58, 60 ° C) x 4 pH (4. 5, 5. 5, 6. 5, 7. 5) x 3 replicates with a total of (n [subscript T] = 834) exposure times (16 - 198 s) was carried out in the pilot continuous flow <b>pasteuriser.</b> Findings highlighted that greater numbers of E. coli were thermally inactivated in the flow <b>pasteuriser</b> than predicted. From a practical operating view, the predictions from the extended Lin model were therefore conservative - with reduced risk to public health. Highly significant differences in the rates of heat - up of bacteria in the pilot <b>pasteuriser</b> (dynamic) (0. 0104 s) compared with that in the batch (static) capillary tubes (1. 6 s) and, mode of heat transfer, together with partial effects of dispersion with increasing length of <b>pasteuriser</b> holding tube, are postulated to be the controlling process influences for the difference between the experimental survivor data and the extended Lin model predictions. The lack of agreement between the continuous <b>pasteuriser</b> data and predictions from the extended Lin model indicated that this model cannot be practically applied. A direct comparison of the experimentally derived dynamic survivor data from the pilot <b>pasteuriser</b> (as ln N / N [subscript 0]) was also made with both the published static and dynamic data at a number of defined t - T - pH. This comparison revealed that overall, more E. coli were inactivated in the pilot continuous flow <b>pasteuriser</b> than described by published batch static capillary and dynamic data. Importantly, these comparisons showed that batch thermal survivor data for E. coli do not adequately mirror those obtained in continuous flow systems. Fifth, in a search for an improved model for the inactivation data, the newly derived MKDT model was assessed against the experimental pilot <b>pasteuriser</b> data. This model was rejected, however, because it could not account satisfactorily for all tails in survivor curves. A Weibull form model with two coefficients (a scale factor (α) and a shape factor (β)) also did not adequately predict tailing and could not be reliably extrapolated with holding time. However, a modified Weibull form, also with two model coefficients (β [subscript 0], β [subscript 1]), did give an improved fit to available experimental data. This research highlighted statistically significant differences between the dynamic thermal survivor data for E. coli and standard bench - scale static capillary data for a defined liquid and range of t - T - pH. It is likely that findings from this study can be generalised. However, validation should be carried out for a range of common indicator micro - organisms in a range of liquid foods. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{container}} medium differing in composition were either artificially infested with Phytophthora cinnamomi and Fusarium oxysporum, or left un-infested. Infested and un-infested media were fumigated with methyl bromide at 200 g m 3, or exposed to aerated steam at 75 °C {{in the laboratory}} and in a commercial steam <b>pasteuriser</b> for periods of 30, 60 and 120 min. Steam treatment for 30 min in the commercial <b>pasteuriser</b> was sufficient for eliminating P. cinnamomi and F. oxysporum from pre-infested medium, and therefore comparable with methyl bromide regarding disinfective properties. Laboratory results nevertheless indicated a pasteurisation time of one hour for optimal efficiency. Light container medium (1 sand: 1 peat: 3 compost) appeared more conducive to recolonisation by fungi than heavy medium (1 composted sugar-cane fibre: 1 river sand) after pasteurisation, whereas the opposite was true for bacteria. However, heavy medium was colonised more readily by an antagonistic Trichoderma hamatum after artificial augmentation with the organism. Methyl bromide fumigated medium supported establishment of T. hamatum better than medium pasteurised with steam...|$|E

40|$|In {{the cheese}} industry, most {{contamination}} {{is caused by}} microbial biofilms. Bacteria can be present on wet surfaces and in other difficult-to-clean environments, such as floors, steps, drains, conveyor belts, walls, the regenerative sections of <b>pasteurisers,</b> ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, wood, milking systems and refrigerated tanks. Wood, which is often used in utensils, packaging or the ripening support used {{in the production of}} cheeses, has been shown to support microbial biofilm growth in some cases. The main concern related to environmental biofilms in cheese plants is the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Other microbial risks include thermoduric bacteria (e. g., Streptococcus thermophilus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria. The use of chemicals and enzymes is the most common approach toward removing and killing an established biofilm. Biological strategies, {{such as the use of}} bacteriocins, bacteriophages and their enzymes, can also be used to eliminate biofilms.

A milk sample of these heifers was taken at first milking to compare udder health of both groups. ResultsThermisation of milk led to an effective reduction of S. aureus in the feeding milk. 78 % of the analysed pools were free of S. aureus, a reduction of at least one log was obtained in the other pools. Quarter milk samples revealed that two heifers had a S. aureus intramammary infection, but caused by a genotype different from genotype B. During the suckling period, the UMG had a significantly higher incidence rate of 1. 09 diarrhoea cases per 100 calf days at risk compared to 0. 26 cases per 100 calf days in the HMG (p¿<¿ 0. 05). ConclusionsUnder the conditions of this study, no effects of feeding milk containing SAGTB on udder health after first calving were observed. But a power analysis indicated that the sample size in the current setup is insufficient to allow for assessment on mastitis risk after SAGTB exposition, as a minimal number of 4 calves infected (vs. 0 in the HMG) would have shown significant effects. High bacterial load, however, was associated with an increased incidence rate of diarrhoea. Thus, thermisation as a minimal preventive measure before feeding mastitis milk to calves might be beneficial for maintaining calf health...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of fouling deposits in heat treatment {{equipment such as}} <b>pasteurisers</b> and evaporators used in milk processing plants reduces heat transfer and {{is a source of}} economic loss as a result of more frequent shut-down of the equipment for cleaning. Measurement of the kinetics and mechanisms of such fouling will enable an improved understanding of the design and operation of heat treatment equipment and allow improved control of fouling. The present study was carried out to investigate the fouling behaviour of heated whole milk on to non-heated stainless steel surfaces and {{to determine the effects of}} mass flow rate and flow disturbance on the fouling of these surfaces. A pilot-scale fouling rig was designed and built to mimic the heat treatment methods and conditions that are currently used in large-scale processing plants. Whole milk was first heated from about 6 to 75 oc in a plate heat exchanger and then heat treated to 9 5 o C via a direct steam injection (DSI) heater. Custom built tubular and sudden expansion fouling test sections of different sizes were placed at different locations downstream of the D SI heater. These test sections were easily disassembled to access the fouling layers. Milk flow in these test sections was in the range of 80 - 120 kg/h and Reynolds numbers ranged between 2500 and 3800. A system to monitor fouling at different locations on the internal surfaces of the fouling test sections was developed. This included the use of a calibrated sensor to measure the local heat flux and temperature at the outer surfaces of the test section. The fouling rate was calculated and expressed as the rate of decrease of the internal heat transfer coefficient during the deposit growth, normalised using the internal heat transfer coefficient determined at the start of a run. A plot of the fouling rate versus run time exhibited a delay period during which the normalised internal heat transfer coefficient was either constant (i. e. the ratio = 1) or slightly increased (i. e. the ratio> 1) fol lowed by a decrease period during which it gradually decreased (i. e. the ratio 1 05, and the processing run time of up to 24 hrs was considerably longer than in the pilot-plant runs. The rate and extent of fouling in large-scale plant were found to vary with the types of milk product, such as skim milk, whole milk, modified skim milk and modified whole milk, and with treatment temperatures. Local equipment geometry in the section downstream of the DSI, such as flow disturbed by an orifice, was also found to have a strong effect on local fouling. Recommendations for improving the design and operation of the D SI heater to reduce fouling of unheated surfaces by whole milk heated 95 o C are suggeste...|$|R
40|$|It is {{desirable}} to out find more {{out about the}} content of thermoresistant bacteria in the milk, that is milk that has been heat treated. In this study milk from 2 dairies was studied over a period of two months (August and September). It was desirable to find out how two different heat treatment temperatures for milk: pasteurization (72 ° C for 15 sec or 63 ° C for 30 min) and high temperature (100 ° C for 30 min), affects the microbiological composition of milk. It was of interest to determine which bacteria that were present in milk after incubation of the seeded samples at 30 ° C and 55 ° C, and if there was another bacterial flora after 13 days of storage, and whether there were any differences between dairy A and dairy B. For analyzes carried out on mesophilic thermoresistant bacterial count, it was confirmed that milk from both dairies was within the EU’s regulations regarding the levels of bacteria in fresh pasteurized milk, this was also shown in pasteurized milk stored at 4 ° C for 13 days. As expected, no milk stored at 8 ° C within the EU’s regulations. From heat-treatet milk in this study, a total of 8 different bacterial genera and 16 different species (8 species belonging to the genus Bacillus) was isolated. The 3 dominant genera were: Bacillus (72 %), Aneurinibacillus (10 %), and Kocuria (9 %), whereas the other genera present represented ≤ 2 % of isolates (Staphylococcus, Brevibacillus, Microbacterium, Brachybacterium and Streptococcus). As noted, the Bacillus genus represented several species throughout the experiment, in which Bacillus licheniformis was the most dominant at both outlets, also in milk stored for 13 days. There was hardly found B. cereus throughout the experiment. Regarding the bacterial genus Aneurinibacillus, only Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus found, while for thr genus Kocuria, Kocuria rhizophila isolated from heat-treated milk. Det er ønskelig å finne mer ut om innhold av termoresistente bakterier i melken, altså melk som har vært varmebehandlet. For denne oppgaven ble melk fra 2 meierier undersøkt over en tidsperiode på 2 måneder (august og september). Det var ønskelig å finne ut hvordan to forskjellige varmebehandlingstemperaturer for melk: <b>pasteurisering</b> (72 °C i 15 sek eller 63 °C i 30 min) og høytemperaturbehandling (100 °C i 30 min), påvirker melkens mikrobiologiske sammensetning. Det var av interesse å finne ut hvilke bakterier som var til stede i melk etter inkubering av utsådde prøver ved 30 °C og 55 °C, og om der var en annen bakterieflora etter 13 dager lagring, samt om der var noen forskjeller mellom meieri A og B. For analyser utført på mesofilt termoresistent bakterietall ble det bekreftet at melken fra begge meieriene var innenfor EUs reglement for innhold av bakterier i fersk pasteurisert melk, dette ble også vist i pasteurisert melk lagret ved 4 °C i 13 dager. Som forventet var ikke melk lagret ved 8 °C innenfor EUs reglement. Totalt ble det isolert bakterier fra 8 forskjellige bakterieslekter og 16 forskjellige arter (8 av artene tilhørende slekten Bacillus) fra varmebehandlet melk i denne studien. De 3 dominerende slektene var: Bacillus (72 %), Aneurinibacillus (10 %), og Kocuria (9 %), mens de øvrige slektene som var tilstede representerte ≤ 2 % av isolatene (Staphylococcus, Brevibacillus, Microbacterium, Brachybacterium og Streptococcus). Som nevnt representerte Bacillus slekten flere arter gjennom hele forsøket, der Bacillus licheniformis var den mest dominerende ved begge uttakene, også i melk lagret i 13 dager. Det ble omtrent ikke ble funnet B. cereus gjennom hele forsøket. For bakterieslekten Aneurinibacillus var det kun Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus som ble funnet, mens for slekten Kocuria var det Kocuria rhizophila som ble isolert fra varmebehandlet melk.

Collecting milk in hypochlorite-sterilised vessels resulted in a significantly lower bacterial count of both pathogens and species of unlikely pathogenicity before pasteurisation and significantly increased the chance of pasteurisation giving a sterile product. Potentially pathogenic organisms grown in untreated milk were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci. Seven species of organisms of unlikely pathogenicity were also identified. Pasteurisation eliminated all potential pathogens from milk but did not reliably remove any of the species of unlikely pathogens.

Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the filling procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the filling machines, were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the filling machine contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of pasteurised milk. Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on the filling nozzles, in waste-water {{at the bottom of the}} filling machine, and in air surrounding the filling machine. Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside the filling machine over long periods, especially at the bottom of the filling machine. The effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around the filling machine was studied. A clear link between the usage of water inside the machine and the frequency of consumer packages contaminated by GNP was found. B. cereus were involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, the spoilage of pasteurised milk. The B. cereus infection can originate from heat-resistant spores present in the raw milk, but B. cereus can also enter the milk at the dairy plant.

The study was also focus on the analyse of {{the efficiency of the}} pasteurizer, and its cleaning steps. The study was conducted analysing 4 batches for each of the two days of production, Monday and Friday. Between batch 16 and 17 there was a quick cleaning, and between batch 32 and batch 1, of the following day, there was a complete cleaning. For each batch samples of raw milk, pasteurized milk, starter, milk before rennet, cheese after pressing, cheese after brine were collected to understand the microbial development during the cheese making-process. Plate count was conducted with selective media, M 17, for lactococci; MRSV, (MRS with vancomycin), to select Leuconostoc; LBS, for lactobacilli. The PCR-DGGE was conducted both with universal primer for V 1 and V 3 of 16 S DNA, and with specific primer for lactobacilli, Leuconostoc/Pediococci, and selective for Lactococci/Enterococci and Streptococci. The gradient 35 - 55 % of urea-formamide was used during DGGE (100 % denaturant corresponding to 7 M urea and 40 % [v/v] formamide was used). Identification of the DGGE bands was possible by the comparison among different migration distance of pure strains, loaded in the gel, like a marker and by the sequencing of the band. The monitoring of total lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), from the dairy samples and starter cultures the presence of Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, as the dominant species of LAB was shown, while Lc. Raffinolactis, Lactobacillus (Lb.) casei and Lb. paracasei could be considered NSLAB. Studying the pasteurization step, Anoxybacillus flavithermus, Aeribacillus pallidus/ Geobacillus Pallidus were identified, which may produce, heat resistant spores and these may also create biofilm on the steel <b>pasteuriser</b> surface.
