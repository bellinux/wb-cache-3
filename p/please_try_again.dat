5000|$|The {{hospital}} {{closed its}} Internal Medicine Residency {{at the end}} of the 2007-2008 academic year and finished transferring patients to Mercy Hospital and Medical Center before the end of 2008; the 48-acre campus was then vacated. In July 2009, the streets through the campus were closed, and calls to the main number were greeted by: [...] "We're sorry. All circuits are busy now. <b>Please</b> <b>try</b> your call <b>again</b> later." [...] Demolition began in late fall 2009.|$|R
5000|$|AT&T has an {{intercept}} {{message that}} is heard due to network congestion: [...] "All circuits are busy now, <b>please</b> <b>try</b> your call <b>again</b> 914-2T". The number and digits {{at the end}} identify the network edge or Tandem switch the caller's local exchange company routed the call to. There is also a network message heard when an attempt {{to route a call}} to a nodal or ISDN T1 on the terminating end fails due to no call set-up signal from the PBX being received by the far-end Tandem or edge switch [...] "Your call did not go through, 9142T".|$|R
5000|$|Although {{only one}} {{telephone}} number is usually announced, major stations typically have line hunting, {{with the same}} number being directed to any available one of several lines within the hunt group. If there are no open lines, the calling party may receive a busy signal as with an ordinary telephone call, or sometimes the special information tones followed by a recorded announcement that [...] "all circuits are busy, <b>please</b> <b>try</b> your call <b>again</b> later". In this case, the line often first gives that caller a ringback tone as if the call were being completed, misleading callers to think they may have actually gotten through the swarm of other calls that sometimes flood these lines.|$|R

The disappearance of Tor Mail {{has been linked to}} the arrest on child pornography charges of the alleged operator of Freedom Hosting, which hosted a large number of [...]onion sites.

5000|$|Diablo III was {{released}} on May 15, 2012. Players had the options to buy one of two retail boxed versions, a standard edition and collector's edition, or could also pre-order directly from Battle.net and download the installer in advance. On May 14, 2012, players who bought the downloadable version from Battle.net could install {{the rest of the}} game including patches. On May 15, 2012, the retail version could be bought from stores doing midnight launches such as GameStop. The Diablo III Battle.net servers went live at this time and people who downloaded the game could begin playing. Initially the launches were hindered by heavy server load with many users getting various errors, including the error 37 which reads; [...] "The servers are busy at this time. <b>Please</b> <b>try</b> <b>again</b> later". These issues made the game unplayable for those affected, while some others experienced in-game bugs. Despite assurances from Blizzard that the problems leading to the connection errors during Diablo IIIs launch had been resolved, Eurogamer reported on May 31, 2012, that these errors were still ongoing, and had reappeared after patch 1.0.2 {{was released}} for the game. Many fans complained that the ongoing problems had caused them to lose their hardcore (permanent death) characters.|$|E
