Furthermore, <b>phosphates</b> protect aroma and accelerate the formation of cured meat color as well as having antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. Many research about using <b>phosphates</b> in meat products showed that increasing chain length of <b>phosphates</b> improves antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.

30|$|<b>Phosphates</b> are {{transformed}} to {{other forms of}} <b>phosphates</b> by hydrolysis and dehydration reactions at elevated temperatures [6, 7]. Polyphosphate is included in the group of condensed <b>phosphates.</b> Polyphosphate has a chain structure in which the PO 4 unit shares two oxygen atoms. Formation of these condensed <b>phosphates</b> is affected by the phosphorus/cation ratio, heating temperature, time, atmosphere, and so on [8, 9, 10]. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a high yield of condensed <b>phosphates.</b> The properties of condensed <b>phosphates</b> differ from those of orthophosphates, and condensed <b>phosphates</b> can therefore be used as novel functional materials [11].|$|R

5|$|Nauru {{and nearby}} Ocean Island were {{important}} sources of <b>phosphate</b> for Australian and New Zealand fertilizer production and {{played an important}} role on both countries agriculture industries at the time of World War II. The Melbourne-based British <b>Phosphate</b> Commission (BPC) managed the extraction and export of <b>phosphate</b> from the islands and dominated all aspects of Nauruan life. During the year ending 30June 1940, the BPC shipped almost a million tons of <b>phosphate</b> from Nauru and about half that amount from Ocean Island using its fleet of four vessels (Triadic, Triaster, Triona and Trienza) and chartered merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Nauru became self-governing in January 1966, and {{following}} a two-year constitutional convention it became independent in 1968 under founding president Hammer DeRoburt. In 1967, {{the people of}} Nauru purchased {{the assets of the}} British <b>Phosphate</b> Commissioners, and in June 1970 control passed to the locally owned Nauru <b>Phosphate</b> Corporation. Income from the mines gave Nauruans one of the highest standards of living in the Pacific. In 1989, Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's administration of the island, in particular Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by <b>phosphate</b> mining. Certain <b>Phosphate</b> Lands: Nauru v.Australia led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru.|$|E

5|$|<b>Phosphate</b> was {{discovered}} on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Fuller Ellis. The Pacific <b>Phosphate</b> Company began {{to exploit the}} reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany, exporting its first shipment in 1907. In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Nauru was captured by Australian troops. In 1919 it was agreed by the Allied and Associated Powers that His Britannic Majesty should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate. The Nauru Island Agreement made in 1919 between {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and for working of the <b>phosphate</b> deposits by an inter-governmental British <b>Phosphate</b> Commission (BPC). The terms of the League of Nations Mandate were drawn up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The Nauruan economy {{peaked in}} the early 1980s, as it was {{dependent}} almost entirely on the <b>phosphate</b> deposits that originate from the droppings of sea birds. There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported. Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, {{formerly known as the}} Nauru <b>Phosphate</b> Corporation. The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru <b>Phosphate</b> Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens once the <b>phosphate</b> reserves were exhausted.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} use for phosphoryl chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as triphenyl <b>phosphate</b> and tricresyl <b>phosphate.</b> These esters have been used for many years as flame retardants and plasticisers for PVC.

50|$|<b>Phosphates</b> in {{detergent}} {{refers to}} the use of <b>phosphates</b> as an ingredient in a detergent product. The advantage of using <b>phosphates</b> in a consumer laundry detergent or dishwashing detergent is that they make detergents more efficient by chelating calcium and magnesium ions. The disadvantage of using <b>phosphates</b> is that they remain in wastewater and eventually make their way to a natural body of water. While <b>phosphates</b> are low toxicity, they instead cause nutrient pollution and feed the algae. This leads to eutrophication and harmful algal bloom.|$|R
50|$|Zinc <b>phosphating</b> {{results in}} a non-reflective, light- to medium-gray finish. Manganese <b>phosphating</b> {{produces}} a medium- to dark-gray or black finish.

Some parkerized guns, particularly of WWII vintage, have almost OD green color. This was caused by contaminants in the acid solution and not cosmoline as is commonly believed.|$|R

5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium <b>phosphate</b> is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium <b>phosphate</b> with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> at 100µM.|$|E
40|$|Nd-Fe-B magnets {{are highly}} {{susceptible}} to corrosion and need protection against environment attack. The use of organic coatings {{is one of}} the main methods of corrosion protection of these materials. Data related to the effect of conversion coatings, such as <b>phosphating,</b> on corrosion performance of these magnets is still scarce. Studies about the effect of <b>phosphating</b> on the corrosion resistance of a commercial Nd-Fe-B sintered magnet indicated that it increases the corrosion resistance of these magnets, compared to non-phosphated magnets. In this study, the solution chemistry of a <b>phosphating</b> bath was altered with the addition of molybdate and its effect on the corrosion resistance of magnets investigated. Sintered magnet specimens were <b>phosphated</b> in solutions of 10 g/L NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 3. 8), either with or without molybdate [10 - 3 M MoO 4 (2 -) ], to improve their corrosion resistance. The effect of <b>phosphating</b> time was also evaluated, and specimens were <b>phosphated</b> for 4 and 18 hours. To evaluate the corrosion performance of <b>phosphated</b> and unphosphated specimens, a corrosion test based on monitoring hydrogen evolution on the surface of the magnets was used. This technique revealed that the addition of molybdate to the <b>phosphating</b> solution improved the corrosion resistance of the magnets <b>phosphated</b> by immersion for short periods but had no beneficial effect if <b>phosphated</b> by immersion for longer periods...|$|R

5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from <b>phosphate</b> rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. <b>Phosphate</b> rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the <b>phosphate</b> rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH.

A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl <b>phosphate</b> species from alkaline solutions.
