25|$|<b>Prosecutors</b> <b>say</b> {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E

500|$|Martin {{pleaded guilty}} to running an illegal lottery at the Ford Motors plant he worked at to provide {{proceeds}} for the players. Martin testified that he paid Webber $280,000 in cash and gifts, but as of January 2003 Webber denied receipt of money from Martin and maintained that he had testified truthfully {{to a grand jury}} in 2000 on such matters. [...] Martin stated that there was always an understanding that the money would be repaid after the players became professionals. [...] In the 2000 grand jury investigation, Webber had been asked about whether his off-campus apartment rent had been paid by Martin and whether he had received spending money, jewelry, clothing or a stereo. Webber generally responded by saying either that he could not recall or that he did not think he had received such gifts. [...] However, <b>prosecutors</b> <b>say</b> that Webber, after turning professional, gave Martin a significant sum of money, in cash, as a partial repayment. In December 2002, Webber's father admitted he had accepted gifts and a small loan from Martin, which contradicted earlier statements. Prosecutors also accused Webber's aunt of lying about a meeting she had with Martin in the updated filing.|$|E
