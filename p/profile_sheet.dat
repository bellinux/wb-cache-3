40|$|Este trabalho investigou o instrumento de perfil de humor psicológico BRAMS e traçou o perfil humoral de uma população de jovens fisicamente ativos. Analisou também as respostas das amostras da alfa-amilase salivar e verificou a possível correlação entre os dois marcadores de estresse. Na primeira parte do trabalho foi verificado se a Escala de Humor Brasileira (BRAMS) pode ser utilizada para aferir alterações de humor em resposta a diferentes cargas de treinamento e elaborada a folha de perfil de humor para a população em questão. Realizamos, inicialmente, a análise da concordância do instrumento BRAMS frente aos seis perfis de humor que ele pretende definir. Observamos ótima concordância estatística com os fatores vigor, raiva, fadiga, tensão e confusão mental. Já o fator depressão não apresentou concordância para a população estudada. Construímos, então, uma folha de perfil de humor, oriunda de 228 testes respondidos por 123 indivíduos com idade de 18 ± 1 anos (média ± desvio padrão), praticantes de 3 horas de exercício físico diário periodizado. As respostas de um subgrupo de sujeitos (n= 105) foram avaliadas em dois momentos: após quatro meses de treinamento físico sistematizado diário, e após quatro dias do término de um treino intensificado de uma semana, quando foi aplicada uma sobrecarga maior em termos físicos e psíquicos. Os dados apresentados mostraram que o instrumento BRAMS foi capaz de discriminar perfis de humor alterados em função da intensificação do treino e a construção da folha de perfil de humor para uma população fisicamente ativa permite monitoramento mais acurado das variações do estado de humor em resposta ao treinamento. Na segunda parte, foram também analisadas as respostas da alfa-amilase salivar nos dois momentos e verificado se existe correlação entre o instrumento de humor e a enzima salivar. Observou-se que os fatores dos testes de humor BRAMS apresentaram na primeira aplicação, valores para os aspectos humorais considerados negativos mais baixos e apenas o fator vigor, único estado de humor considerado positivo, foi mais elevado. Nos resultados da segunda aplicação, todos os fatores negativos foram mais elevados, e apenas o fator vigor manteve-se mais baixo que na primeira aplicação. A enzima salivar alfa-amilase também teve seus valores aumentados na segunda coleta em relação à primeira, mas foi constatado que esses valores estavam dentro do valor de referência para o horário de coleta. Baseado nos resultados deste estudo foi verificado que tanto o teste psicológico, quanto a concentração da enzima salivar alfa-amilase reproduziram variações sofridas nos dois momentos, mas não possuem correlação entre si. This study {{investigated}} the instrument profile of psychological mood BRAMS and traced the profile of mood state of a population of physically active young. Also examined the responses of samples of salivary alpha-amylase and investigated a possible correlation between the two markers of stress. In {{the first part of}} this work it was verified that the Brazilian Mood Scale (BRAMS) can be used to assess mood changes in response to different training loads and a <b>profile</b> <b>sheet</b> of humor was constructed to the population of this study. We have initially performed the analysis of the agreement of the instrument BRAMS front of six profiles of humor that it intends to set. We observed excellent agreement with the statistical factors vigor, anger, fatigue, tension and mental confusion. But the depression factor had no correlation to the population studied. Then, We built a <b>profile</b> <b>sheet</b> of humor, coming from 228 tests administered to 123 subjects aged 18 ± 1 years (mean ± standard deviation), practicing three hours of daily physical exercise periodized. The responses of a subgroup of subjects (n = 105) were evaluated in two moments: after four months of systematic daily physical training, and after four days of the end of an intensified workout a week, when it was applied to a larger overhead in terms of physical and psychic. Our data showed that the instrument was able to discriminate BRAMS profiles altered mood due to the intensification of training and construction of the <b>profile</b> <b>sheet</b> mood for a physically active population allows more accurate monitoring of changes in mood in response to training. In the second part, we also analyzed the responses of salivary alpha-amylase in two times and checked if there is a correlation between the instrument of humor and salivary enzyme. It was observed that the humoral factors of BRAMS showed at the first application, values for the humoral aspects considered negatives lower and only the factor force, the single mood considered positive was higher. The results of the second application showed that all the negative factors were higher, and only the factor force remained lower than the first application. The enzyme salivary alpha-amylase also had its values increased in the second collection from the first one, but it was found that these values were within the reference value for the time of the collection. Based on the results of this study, it was found that both the psychological test and the concentration of salivary alpha-amylase enzyme reproduced variations suffered on both occasions, but have no correlation...|$|E

The study also assessed the comparability of community college students' mean scores to the normed means for four-year college students on the instrument used to measure vocational identity.

The possibility of reusing building elements makes steel construction even more sustainable than the already significant contribution of today’s simple material recycling. Steel can be repeatedly recycled {{because it does not}} lose any of its inherent physical properties {{as a result of the}} recycling process. Stainless steel fasteners have excellent corrosion resistance and durability, as well as being a sustainable material. Custom fasteners in this material make for the utmost of sustainability with high recyclability.|$|R
