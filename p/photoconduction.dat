40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments to both determine the origins of charge transport and enhanced <b>photoconduction</b> in metal nanoparticle arrays linked with zinc-porphyrin complexes, but to also determine the nucleation and growth mechanisms related to Ferroelectric Nanolithography (FNL) as a platform for hybrid devices. The development of test structures on glass substrates was undertaken to not only allow {{the study of the}} mechanisms controlling charge transport but the <b>photoconduction</b> of zinc-porphyrin linked gold nanoparticle (AuNP) arrays. In this study, the dominate charge transport mechanism was determined to be thermally assisted tunneling and the origins of enhanced <b>photoconduction</b> in these systems was attributed to three mechanisms: direct exciton formation in the molecules, hot electrons and a field effect (optical antenna) due to the excitation of surface plasmons. In the hope of developing a platform for hybrid devices, FNL was utilized to systematically vary the parameters that effect the deposition of metal nanoparticles through domain directed deposition on ferroelectric surfaces. The nucleation and growth mechanisms were determined through this work, where the integrated photon flux controlled the particle density and the interface between the particle and the ferroelectric surface determined the particles size. Finally, with the ability to control the deposition of AuNPs on a ferroelectric surface, hybrid devices of zinc-porphyrin linked AuNPs were realized with FNL. ...|$|E

40|$|Photocurrent in photodetectors {{incorporating}} van der Waals {{materials is}} typically {{produced by a}} combination of photocurrent generation mechanisms that occur simultaneously during operation. Because of this, response times in these devices often yield to slower, high gain processes which cannot be turned off. Here we report on photodetectors incorporating the layered material In 2 Se 3, which allow complete modulation of a high gain, photogating mechanism in the ON state in favor of fast <b>photoconduction</b> in the OFF state. While <b>photoconduction</b> is largely gate independent, photocurrent from the photogating effect is strongly modulated through application of a back gate voltage. By varying the back gate, we demonstrate control over the dominant mechanism responsible for photocurrent generation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{uniaxial}} {{strain on the}} <b>photoconduction</b> δ G and low-temperature Ohmic conduction G of Peierls conductor o-TaS_ 3 have been studied. Four-contact structure {{on the base of}} high-quality o-TaS_ 3 crystal, containing a segment with a strain (1 %) and one without it, separated by a buffer part, has been prepared for the study. Notable changes both G(T) and δ G(T) have been observed below T < 60 K under uniaxial strain, namely: a plateau of G(T) in the region of activation-law-change becomes wider under the strain, and an additional low-temperature maximum of δ G(T) appears, its value being even bigger than one of the main maximum of δ G(T), which is mainly due to single particle excitations. As a result the values of G(T) and δ G(T) become one order bigger than the ones without strain. The relative changes of G(T) and δ G(T) under the strain exhibit a sharp step-like growth upon cooling at slightly different temperatures (≈ 10 K).

40|$|The {{linearity}} {{of image}} transfer is analyzed {{for a high}} resolution electrophotographic film and electrodeveloper combination. The extent of nonlinearities introduced upon transfer through the <b>photoconduction</b> and electrodevelopment stages is conceptualized in terms of inherent physical mechanisms. A spectral shift in narrow band exposing radiation is used to test significance of exponential absorption on linearity of <b>photoconduction</b> transfer. Variations in development electrode spacing and development time test for nonlinearity induced by temporal and spatial frequency dependent depletion of electrodeveloper particles. As the electrophotographic film employed in the test exhibited low absorption coefficients in all spectral bands, exponential absorption of exposing radiation did not significantly alter linearity of edge image transfer. Results for edge and sinusoidal image transfer indicated nonlinear depletion effects shortly after development initiation. Increased development times reduced adjacency effects for edge distributions and lower harmonic distortions for sinusoidal image distributions. Initial adjacency effects and time rate of change toward linear edge responses are altered by electrode spacing for one electrodevelopment apparatus tested. Reasonable approximations to linear image transfer are obtained as electrodevelopment approaches completion, regardless of electrode spacing or electrodevelopment apparatus employed...|$|E
