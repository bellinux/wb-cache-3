5000|$|But now, the {{interaction}} energy {{is supposed to}} be at a minimum when atoms sit on the vertices of a regular pentagon. Trying to propagate in the long range a packing of these pentagons sharing edges (atomic bonds) and vertices (atoms) is impossible. This is due to the impossibility of tiling a plane with regular pentagons, simply because the pentagon vertex angle does not divide 2. Three such pentagons can easily fit at a common vertex, but a gap remains between two edges. It is this kind of discrepancy which is called [...] "geometric frustration". There is one way to overcome this difficulty. Let the surface to be tiled be free of any presupposed topology, and let us build the tiling with a strict application of the local interaction rule. In this simple example, we observe that the surface inherits the topology of a sphere and so receives a curvature. The final structure, here a <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron,</b> allows for a perfect propagation of the pentagonal order. It is called an [...] "ideal" [...] (defect-free) model for the considered structure.|$|E

The evidence for these structures has been indirect, however, because the experimental spectra in the critical H-bonding region of the OH stretching vibrations have been too diffuse to provide band patterns that distinguish between candidate structures predicted theoretically. Here we exploit the slow cooling afforded by cryogenic ion trapping, alongwith isotopic substitution, to quench water clusters attached to the H 3 O + and Cs + ions into structures that yield well-resolved vibrational bands over the entire 215 - to 3, 800 -cm − 1 range.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns the}} comparison of two- and three-dimensional data obtained on a cellular material. By quantitative micrography techniques and spatial measurements, he cellular structure corresponds most closely with the shape of pen-tagonal dodecahedra, twelve-faced cells having five edges per face. The cell volumes have a normal distribution. The areal distributions of planar sections for various shapes of polyhedra were taken from existing literature. The measured volume distributions from this study were then applied by numerical computer calculations to create a transformation which carried the distribution of volumes (three-dimensional) to the expected istribution of planar areas (two-dimensional). The results of the expected and measured areal data agreed well for assumed complex polyhedral symmetry such as pentagonal dodecahedra, nd un-satisfactorily for spherical symmetry. These results demonstrate that the <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron</b> is a measurable prototype of cell in grain shapes.

They {{have been studied}} extensively, greatly facilitated by the gastropod acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBP) which represent soluble structural and functional homologues of the ligand-binding domain of nAChR. All these proteins are ring-like pentamers. Here we report that AChBP exists in the hemolymph of the planorbid snail Biomphalaria glabrata (vector of the schistosomiasis parasite) as a regular <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron,</b> 22 nm in diameter (12 pentamers, 60 active sites).

Recombinant BgAChBP 1 formed pentamers and dodecahedra, recombinant BgAChBP 2 formed pentamers and probably disulfide-bridged di-pentamers, but not dodecahedra. Three-dimensional electron cryo-microscopy (3 D-EM) yielded a 3 D reconstruction of the dodecahedron with a resolution of 6 Å. Homology models of the pentamers docked to the 6 Å structure revealed opportunities for chemical bonding at the inter-pentamer interfaces.

The as-cast microstructure consisted of a quasicrystalline icosahedral phase (i-phase), Be 4 AlMn phase and, occasionally, a hexagonal phase. Al-rich solid solution represented the dominant phase. The chemical compositions of phases were determined using AES. The composition of the Be 4 AlMn slightly deviated from the stoichiometric composition, whereas {{the composition of the}} i-phase was approximately Al 52 Mn 18 Be 30, containing an appreciable amount of Be. The average composition of the hexagonal phase was Al 66 Mn 21 Be 13.

The i-phase was present predominantly in the form of dendrites and a rodlike eutectic phase. The hexagonal phase was primarily in the form of hexagonal platelets, whereas Be 4 AlMn was rather irregular in shape.

The complete HA sedimented relatively rapidly. It was composed of 12 pentons (vertex capsomers plus projections) aggregated into {{the form of a}} <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron.</b> The length of the projections was about 12 to 13 mμ. Thus they appeared longer than the corresponding structures of types 3 and 11, but shorter than those of types 4 and 5. The rate of sedimentation of complete HA of type 9 was intermediate to those of the complete HA of types 3 and 11. The incomplete HA sedimented together with components carrying group-specific CF antigen, but could be separated from those by anion-exchange chromatography. Two different antigens were present in incomplete HA. One could absorb a group-specific hemagglutination-enhancing antibody, and was sensitive to treatment with trypsin. The other antigen could absorb the type-specific HI antibody and was not destroyed by trypsin. In addition to the incomplete HA, a separate population of more slowly sedimenting components showed a capacity to absorb HI antibody. These components could also be identified in CF tests when an antiserum against complete HA was applied.

40|$|An isohedron is a 3 -dimensional {{polyhedron}} all {{faces of}} which are equivalent under symmetries of the polyhedron. Many well known polyhedra are isohedra; among them are the Platonic solids, the polars of Archimedean polyhedra, {{and a variety of}} polyhedra important in crystallography. Less well known are isohedra with nonconvex faces. We establish that such polyhedra must be starshaped and hence of genus 0, that their faces must be star-shaped pentagons with one concave vertex, and that they are combinatorially equivalent to either the <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron,</b> or to the polar of the snub cube or snub dodecahedron. We shall use the word polyhedron in an elementary and familiar sense: a polyhedron P is a bounded three-dimensional solid in ordinary Euclidean space, whose boundary is the union of a finite number of (flat) polygonal regions called faces. The interiors of the faces are assumed to be disjoint, but their boundaries meet in pairs in line segments called edges or in a single point, or not at all. The endpoints of the edges are the vertices of P, and the faces meeting at a vertex V form a single circuit; hence the boundary of P is what is usually known as a manifold. The number of faces that meet at V (which is equal to the number of edges of which V is an endpoint) is called the valence of V, and the valence of any vertex is at least three. We note that our interpretation of the word "polyhedron " does not include certain figures which are sometimes called polyhedra in the literature. For example, we exclude the four well-known Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra (see CUNDY & ROLLET [5], or WENNINGER [18] Photos 23 to 26; three are shown in Figure 6 below) since these either have faces with selfintersections, or faces that meet at interior points.

40|$|The kinetic {{behavior}} of pig heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) containing bound endogenous thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) {{was affected by}} exogenous TPP. In the absence of exogenous TPP, a lag phase of the PDC reaction was observed. TPP added to the PDC reaction medium containing Mg 2 � led to a disappearance of the lag phase, inducing strong reduction of the Km value for pyruvate (from 76. 7 to 19. 0 �M) but a more moderate decrease of Km for CoA (from 12. 2 to 4. 3 �M) and Km for NAD � (from 70. 2 to 33. 6 �M), with no considerable change in the maximum reaction rate. Likewise, thiamin monophosphate (TMP) decreased the Km value of PDC for pyruvate, but {{to a lesser extent}} (from 76. 7 to 57. 9 �M) than TPP. At the unsaturating level of pyruvate, the A 50 values for TPP and TMP were 0. 2 �M and 0. 3 mM, respectively. This could mean that the effect of TPP on PDC was more specific. In addition, exogenous TPP changed the UV spectrum and lowered the fluorescence emission of the PDC containing bound endogenous TPP in its active sites. The data obtained suggest that TPP plays, in addition to its catalytic function, the important role of positive regulatory effector of pig heart PDC. © 1999 Academic Press The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is a multicomponent enzyme system that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate, CoA and NAD � into acetyl-CoA, NADH and CO 2 [1].

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} two theoretical {{studies which}} may {{shed light on}} the problem of structural determination in quasicrystals. In order to reconstruct the atomic structure of a quasicrystal using the tiling description, one must determine the symmetry, the atomic decoration of the unit cells, and the unit-cell packing. There is an uncountably infinite number of distinguishable, perfect quasicrystal packings for any given symmetry. A key difficulty is that no method is known for separately determining the correct packing and decoration of the unit cells from diffraction data. ^ It is proposed that any physically realizable unit-cell packing should satisfy three simple criteria: it should be uniquely described by 2 ̆ 2 matching rules 2 ̆ 2 which fix the allowed unit-cell clusters smaller than some finite bound; there should exist local growth rules which permit the aggregation of unit cells to form a perfect packing; and the growth should be sufficiently fast that macroscopic quasicrystals can be obtained on laboratory time scales. These criteria are applied to a continuum of 2 D pentagonal quasicrystal tilings, only one of which [...] the Penrose tiling [...] was previously known to meet the criteria. A countably infinite subset of these tilings is shown to satisfy all three criteria. The subset can be ordered according to the range of the matching rules and growth rules. This range is physically plausible in only a handful of cases. If this result were to extend to 3 D, it would greatly simplify the determination of atomic structure. ^ The second study concerns the external morphology of quasicrystals grown under conditions close to thermodynamic equilibrium. On slow cooling from the melt, stable icosahedral quasicrystals have been observed to form large, faceted grains. The allowed zero-temperature equilibrium shapes for icosahedrally symmetric materials are catalogued, and specific examples are calculated for a simple model of quasicrystal faceting. It is proved that one of the experimentally observed shapes, the <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron,</b> may be an equilibrium shape only if significant repulsive interactions are present within the material. This result may yield clues about the interactions within real quasicrystals, and thereby help to distinguish among atomic models of the icosahedral phase. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{catalogue}} is more-or-less confined to the most symmetrical polyhedra exemplified by the socalled Platonic solids (the five convex forms each of which consists ofaset of identical regular polygon faces) and their symmetry associates including the Archimedean polyhedra. The five solids are the tetrahedron, the hexahedron (cube), the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. These fall into three symmetry groups: tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral. The seven members {{of the last two}} groups, together with a combination of all, are given on page iv. Because of its relatively low symmetry the tetrahedral group receives somewhat cursory attention. The symmetrical polyhedra described are by no means exhaustive - even with the constraint of considering only the most symmetrical ones there are, in fact infinite possibilities. However, examples produced using several techniques are presented here and these processes (especially producing successive generations) can be employed to produce ever more obscure but highly symmetrical polyhedra. The first contributor to this catalogue had been trained as a draughtsman and had studied crystallography and, having encountered a regular <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron</b> for the first time managed, without prior knowledge of them, to produce drawings, applying basic crystallographic principles, of all the Archimedean solids (except the two "snub" forms). The seven forms ofthe icosahedral symmetry group were also produced. Many other symmetrical polyhedra were also "discovered" before being introduced to the Cundy and Rollett classic "Mathematical Models". The logo on the cover of this catalogue was produced by using a stereogram and following Penfield's description but manual draughting of the more complex forms is hugely problematic and the second contributor's role in producing these by computer became indispensable. The computerised portion of the material ofthis catalogue was implemented by Sven Ponelat between October 1993 and April 1997 with the use of an Autocad programme. It largely involved techniques that at the time, had not been used before and, as far as can be established, are little known at present. Fundamentally, it involved utilising the symmetry of a given polyhedron to generate further positions of the polyhedron which can be unioned together. Provided all the components of a given symmetry element are utilised, the resulting compound retains the full symmetry of the starting polyhedron. Thus, partial utilisation of a symmetry element which produces lower symmetry forms is largely omitted. The analysis of the intersections of the compounds generated in terms of their combined convex forms is a new technique apparently. The first author has continued to produce forms up to the present (2007) such as the duals of some forms which have been executed, largely manually, and to systematise the study. Besides utilising a fixed orientation, all combinations and compounds have been rendered in colour to simplify interpretation and comparisons. The analysing of intersections in terms of the components of the combinations so produced apparently has notbeen attempted before...|$|E
40|$|The human {{mitochondrial}} pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) {{is a vital}} metabolic assembly {{that controls}} the key committed step in aerobic carbohydrate utilisation and energy production and as such is responsible for overall glucose homeostasis in man. PDC, particularly from prokaryotic sources, has been widely studied as a model system for investigating the molecular basis of cooperativity between physically and functionally linked enzymes in a metabolic pathway and the catalytic and regulatory advantages conferred by their organisation into precisely-engineered ‘molecular-machines’. Defects in human PDC have been implicated {{in a wide variety}} of genetic, metabolic and autoimmune disorders. Over 200 PDC-linked mutations have been reported to date in the human population leading to clinical symptoms of various magnitudes and manifestations, mostly in the X-linked gene for the α subunit of the E 1 component. PDC is a vast molecular machine (Mr, 9 - 10 MDa) composed of multiple copies of 3 distinct enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E 1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E 2), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E 3) and an additional structural protein known as E 3 -binding protein (E 3 BP). Central to its structural, morphological and mechanistic framework is its large oligomeric ‘core’ comprising 60 E 2 and 12 E 3 BP polypeptide chains, arranged as <b>pentagonal</b> <b>dodecahedron,</b> to which up to 30 α 2 β 2 E 1 enzymes and 6 - 12 homodimeric E 3 enzymes are tethered tightly, but non-covalently, at maximal occupancy. More recently a substitutional model of PDC has been proposed where the core is formed by 48 E 2 and 12 E 3 BP with the 12 E 3 BP polypeptides replacing an equivalent number of E 2 s. The N-termini of the E 2 enzyme(s) each contain two peripherally-extended lipoyl domains that exhibit great mobility and in effect, act as ‘swinging arms’ since their attached lipoic acid cofactors must visit the active sites of all the three enzymes in strict rotation during the catalytic cycle. Similarly, E 3 BP is a distinct E 2 -related polypeptide that is primarily involved in E 3 integration but also displays overlapping functions with E 2 as it contains a single, highly-flexible lipoyl domain that can participate in catalysis. In this study, a model recombinant human PDC has been reconstituted from its E 1, E 2 :E 3 BP and E 3 components that were all overexpressed in and purified from E. coli in high yield prior to assembling spontaneously into fully-active complex in vitro. The wild-type recombinant PDC displayed similar enzymatic activity to the native complex purified from human heart. As a prelude to examining 3 novel naturally- occurring, E 2 -linked mutations, the recombinant PDC model was validated initially by examining the effects of alterations in its lipoylation status on its activity and overall properties and secondly by assessing the characteristics of recombinant PDC lacking the E 3 BP subunit. A possible enzymatic role for E 3 BP in promoting formation of an S 6, S 8 -diacetylated dihydrolipoamide intermediate on E 2 and E 3 BP was also investigated. In the first analysis a series of mutant E 2 :E 3 BP cores were created containing all possible combinations of active and inactive lipoyl domains. These possible combinations were ++/+, -+/+, +-/+, [...] /+, ++/ -, -+/-, +-/- and [...] /-, where ‘+’ is a lipoylated and ‘-’ is a non lipoylated outer, inner or E 3 BP domain in the E 2 :E 3 BP cores. Eight recombinant PDC models were successfully reconstituted from these cores and analysed for their effects on PDC activity compared to wild-type complex. The data indicate that mutation of the outer or inner lipoyl domain of E 2 by replacing the lipoylatable lysine by glutamine leads to a 25 - 35 % decrease in activity; moreover the presence of an active or inactive lipoyl domain on E 3 BP had no detectable influence on PDC function. However, PDC, in which only active E 3 BP lipoyl domains were present, retained 15 % of wild-type activity. These data confirm previous reports on the functional redundancy of lipoyl domains observed in bacterial, yeast and mammalian PDCs and suggest that the E 2 lipoyl domains and the lipoyl domain of E 3 BP can act independently as effective substrates for E 1, E 2 and E 3. A parallel study on recombinant PDC lacking E 3 BP, was also consistent with previous studies in showing that it retained partial activity in the complete absence of this subunit. E 3 BP-deficient patients retain relatively high levels of PDC activity (15 - 20 %) as compared to the 3 - 8 % observed using stoichiometric amounts of E 3 in our in vitro assay. However, our data also suggested that 40 - 50 % PDC activity could be achieved in the presence of a 100 - 200 fold excess of E 3 that may account for slightly higher activity in the patients. Interestingly, wild-type PDC activity declined by 10 - 30 % in the presence of a large E 3 excess in agreement with the idea that the E 1 binding site on E 2 retains a residual affinity for E 3 and is able to partially displace the rate-limiting E 1 enzyme when present in high amounts. The main objective of the thesis was to apply our recombinant PDC model to conduct a detailed investigation of the molecular defects underlying three novel E 2 mutations/ deletions identified at the genetic level by Dr. Garry Brown, University of Oxford in PDC-deficient patients under his care. These were two separate ‘in frame’ 3 -bp deletions encoding glutamate- 35 and valine- 455 in the mature E 2 protein and a phenylalanine- 490 to leucine (F 490 L) substitution located near the active site of the enzyme. Full length copies of these mutant enzymes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as well an outer lipoyl domain-GST construct housing the  35 E deletion. In the case of  35 E mutant, our data from lipoylation assays, circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography and cross-linking analyses indicate that the mutant lipoyl domain is misfolded and displays a pronounced tendency to form dimers or higher order aggregates, presumably via inappropriate exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. As a result, the bulk of the E 2 :E 3 BP core does not assemble properly as evidenced by its unusual subunit composition and the presence of several abnormal species including non-specific aggregates detected by analytical ultracentrifugation. Mutant E 2, E 2 :E 3 BP core and reconstituted PDC showed low activity (10 - 20 %) as compared to wild-type controls, indicating a small proportion of active core can still form under these conditions. In this study, replacement of glu- 35 by aspartate or glutamine had only minor/negligible effects on E 2 :E 3 BP core assembly and reconstituted PDC activity indicating that the size or charge of amino acid at this position is not critical for normal folding and assembly. In the valine- 455 deletion study, the patient was reported to contain no immunologically-detectable E 3 BP, despite the apparent absence of any mutation in the PDX 1 gene. Therefore, in this study, it was hypothesised that this E 2 -based mutation might be responsible for preventing integration of E 3 BP into the E 2 core assembly, thereby promoting its rapid degradation. Although, this deletion resulted in reduced E 2 and PDC activity (50 %), it was not found to prevent E 3 BP integration when the mutant core was produced at either 30 C or 37 C. As this patient has no detectable levels of E 3 BP protein despite the presence of mRNA for this component as detected by RT-PCR studies in Oxford, the precise molecular basis for this defect remains unclear at present. The patient is currently undergoing a complete medical and clinical re-evaluation. Recombinant mutant PDC containing the F 490 L mutation also loses about 50 % enzymatic activity as compared to the normal or wild-type PDC confirming the role of this mutation in PDC deficiency in this patient. This phenylalanine located near to the catalytic site of E 2 has been found to be responsible for substrate specificity and its substitution could be directly responsible for decreased enzymatic activity in this case. No major structural changes were observed in this mutant core. In summary, our recombinant PDC model has proved to be of considerable benefit in enabling us to gain a more informed insight into the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying these rare E 2 -linked mutations, particularly in the case of the E 35 -E 2 mutant. In the absence of the recombinant model, such detailed investigations would have proved impossible owing to the lack of access to human tissue from individual patients. As a corollary to the main aim of the thesis, a preliminary attempt was made to create an equivalent recombinant OGDC model. OGDC is also a mitochondrial assembly that is involved in the TCA cycle and is increasingly implicated in the aetiology of various neurodegenerative diseases linked to oxidative stress including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The basic organisation of the OGDC is directed by the self-assembly of 24 copies of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (E 2 o) to form a cubic core, to which multiple copies of 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E 1 o) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E 3) bind non-covalently. The mammalian E 2 o is unusual in lacking any obvious E 3 or E 1 o binding domain. In this study, E 2 o and E 3 were successfully overexpressed and purified. Initially it was confirmed that E 2 o and E 3 do not interact with each other on gel filtration although stable association of all 3 constituent enzymes occurs in the native complex. Full-length E 1 o was also cloned successfully although it proved impossible to achieve detectable expression in our E. coli BL 21 host system. Previous studies employing subunit-specific proteolysis have identified the extreme N-terminal segment of E 1 o as a key region involved in the maintenance of complex stability and integrity and is required for E 2 and E 3 binding. To investigate this region in more detail, three N-terminal E 1 o fragments of decreasing size were overexpressed, one in His-tag form (193 amino acids) and two as E 1 o-GST fusion proteins (166 and 83 amino acids). In co-expression, purification and gel filtration studies, it was found that all these N-terminal truncates of E 1 o appeared capable of interacting with E 2 o although problems were encountered with rapid degradation and unambiguous identification in some cases. However, Western blotting revealed conclusively that even the shortest N-terminal E 1 o fragment (83 amino acids) was able to enter into a stable association with E 2 o. Owing to time constraints and difficulties with rapid degradation and/or solubility of the E 1 o truncates, it remains to be determined whether this N-terminal region of E 1 o can also interact with E 2 o in a post-translational fashion and whether it is directly involved in mediating E 3 binding. However, this type of approach should continue to provide additional insights in the unique subunit organisation of OGDC and is an important step towards creating a recombinant model of OGDC. This will be invaluable for future studies on an important metabolic assembly that has been increasingly implicated in disorders linked to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration...|$|E
