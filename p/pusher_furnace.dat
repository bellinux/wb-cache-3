40|$|A three {{dimensional}} {{numerical model}} of the heat exchange during a charge heating process in a <b>pusher</b> <b>furnace,</b> using the finite element method, {{was used in this}} study. The radiative heat exchange in the furnace chamber was carried out based on two methods: the zone method and the method of basing on the average configuration ratio. In the zone method the flux of radiation energy reaching the surface of the heated charge was determined by performing calculations of brightness in a multi-surface closed system which is the <b>pusher</b> <b>furnace</b> chamber filled with an emitting-absorbing medium. In the second case an average configuration ratio was used by setting the radiation energy flux through linking the walls temperature with the furnace atmosphere temperature...|$|E

40|$|This Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) report {{deals with}} the {{development}} of nickel aluminide alloy for improved longer life heat-resistant fixture assemblies for batch and continuous pusher carburizing furnaces. The nickel aluminide development was compared in both coupon and component testing with the currently used Fe-Ni-Cr heat-resisting alloy known as HU. The specific goals of the CRADA were: (1) casting process development, (2) characterization and possible modification of the alloy composition to optimize its manufacturing ability and performance under typical furnace operating conditions, and (3) testing and evaluation of specimens and prototype fixtures. In support of the CRADA objectives, coupons of nickel aluminide and the HU alloy were installed in both batch and pusher furnaces. The coupons were taken from two silicon levels and contained welds made with two different filler compositions (IC- 221 LA and IC- 221 W). Both nickel-aluminide and HU coupons were removed from the batch and pusher carburizing furnace at time intervals ranging from one month to one year. The exposed coupons were cut and mounted for metallographic, hardness, and microprobe analysis. The results of the microstructural analysis have been transmitted to General Motors Corporation, Saginaw Division (Delphi Saginaw) through reports that were presented at periodic CRADA review meetings. Based on coupon testing and verification of the coupon results with the testing of trays, Delphi Saginaw moved forward with the use of six additional trays in a batch furnace and two assemblies in a <b>pusher</b> <b>furnace.</b> Fifty percent of the trays and fixtures are in the as-cast condition and the remaining trays and fixtures are in the preoxidized condition. The successful operating experience of two assemblies in the <b>pusher</b> <b>furnace</b> for nearly a year formed the basis for a production run of 63 more assemblies. The production run required melting of 94 heats weighing 500 lb. each. Twenty-six of the 94 heats were from virgin stock, and 68 were from the revert that used 50 % virgin and 50 % revert. Detailed chemical analysis of the 94 heats reflected that the nickel aluminide can be cast into heat-treat fixtures under production conditions. In addition to the chemical analysis, the castings showed excellent dimensional reproducibility. A total of six batch furnace trays and 65 <b>pusher</b> <b>furnace</b> assemblies of nickel aluminide alloy IC- 221 M are currently operating in production furnaces at Delphi Saginaw. Two of the <b>pusher</b> <b>furnace</b> assemblies have completed two years of service without any failure. The CRADA has accomplished the goal of demonstrating that the nickel aluminide can be produced under commercial production conditions and it has superior performance over the currently used HU alloy in both batch and pusher furnaces...|$|E

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of guide grates in <b>pusher</b> <b>furnaces</b> for heat treatment could be increased {{by raising the}} flexibility of their structure through, for example, the replacement of straight ribs, parallel to the direction of grate movement, with more flexible segments. The deformability of grates with flexible segments arranged in two orientations, i. e. crosswise (perpendicular to the direction of compression) and lengthwise (parallel to the direction of compression), was examined. The compression process was simulated using SolidWorks Simulation program. Relevant regression equations were also derived describing the dependence of force inducing the grate deformation by 0. 25 mm ‒ modulus of grate elasticity ‒ {{on the number of}} flexible segments in established orientations. These calculations were made in Statistica and Scilab programs. It has been demonstrated that, with the same number of segments, the crosswise orientation of flexible segments increases the grate structure flexibility in a more efficient way than the lengthwise orientation. It has also been proved that a crucial effect on the grate flexibility has only the quantity and orientation of segments (crosswise / lengthwise), while the exact position of segments changes the grate flexibility by less than 1 %...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational model for heat transfer in direct fired <b>pusher</b> type reheat <b>furnaces</b> for heating steel billets prior to plastic working. Radiation, {{which is the}} dominant mode of heat transfer in the furnace chamber, is modelled in a detailed manner. The model incorporates several features of radiation heat transfer that are typical of reheat furnaces, such as non-grey participating gas in the chamber and specular/diffuse reflection off the furnace surfaces. Radiation heat transfer in the furnace chamber and conduction within the billets are modelled using the finite volume method (FVM). Convection heat flux on the billets is calculated using correlations from the literature. Overall, the model is capable of predicting the radiative heat flux distribution within the furnace, {{as well as the}} resulting temperature distribution within the billets as they pass through various zones in the furnace.

40|$|Abstract. The {{method of}} {{calculation}} of heating of metal in the thermal furnace taking into account pulse system of heating is presented in article. The experimental dataobtained on the <b>pusher</b> <b>furnace,</b> heated by high-speed recuperative torches with pulse system of burning of fuel are submitted. The current state of computer facilities and means of software allows receiving sufficiently exact and extensive information about various thermal processes, and reduces terms and costs of development of the rational thermal modes. In turn, the complexity of calculations of heating of metal in furnaces with pulse system of heating takes place. It is connected with that that the conditions of radiant heat exchange included in the basis of many mathematical models about constancy of temperature in all considered volume (furnaces, zones) doesn't reflect the specific situation, in particular, at an initial site of heating. At the same time, the surface perceiving thermal radiation will lead to consideration of objects of this type {{from the point of}} view of the radiating system with a large number of sources of radiation to that that such engineering calculation procedure will gain undesirable bulkiness and lose its efficiency.
