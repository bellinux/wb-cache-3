25|$|The amount, {{structure}} and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants, within a plant over time, and {{in various parts}} of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and <b>pectinesterase,</b> in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other.

Among genomic resources available, introgression lines represent a valuable tool to mine the genetic diversity present in wild species. One introgression line, IL 12 - 4, was previously selected for high ascorbic acid (AsA) content, and a transcriptomic analysis indicated the involvement of genes controlling pectin degradation in AsA accumulation. In this study the integration of data from different “omics” platforms has been exploited to identify candidate genes that increase AsA belonging to the wild region 12 - 4.

An holistic approach to study this transition has been undertaken using the first peach microarray (µpeach 1. 0) containing 4800 oligos corresponding to {{an equal number of}} genes expressed at preclimacteric and climacteric stages. Microarray hybridization indicated that 260 and 98 genes are up- and down-regulated, respectively. According to the TAIR Gene Ontology, genes have been classified into three main ontologies named cellular localization, molecular function and biological process. Considering the cellular localization the most significant up-and down-regulated gene products belong to cell wall and chloroplast. As far as cell wall is concerned major up-regulated genes encode <b>pectinesterases</b> and expansins, while down-regulation regards genes involved in cell wall growth and lignification. Among genes localized at chloroplast level a dramatic up-regulation of those controlling isoprenoids biosynthesis has been observed. Considering ontologies concerning molecular functions and biological process, a dramatic up-regulation has been detected for genes encoding transcription factors and enzymes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and action.

Secretomics is a proteomics sub-discipline which study the secreted proteins and their secretion mechanisms, so-called secretome. By using proteomics as experimental approach, many secreted proteins by B. cinerea have been identified from in vitro experiments, and belonging to different functional categories: i) cell wall-degrading enzymes such as <b>pectinesterases,</b> and endo-polygalacturonases; ii) proteases involved in host protein degradation such as an aspartic protease; iii) proteins related to the oxidative burst such as glyoxal oxidase; iv) proteins which may induce the plant hypersensitive response such as a cerato-platanin domain-containing protein; and v) proteins related to production and secretion of toxins such as malate dehydrogenase.

The genome of 26. 09 Mb encodes for 8, 024 proteins, of which 576 are putative-secreted effector proteins (PSEPs). Orthology analysis revealed 30 ortholog PSEPs among six Ustilaginomycotina genomes, the largest groups of which are lytic enzymes, such as aspartic peptidase and glycoside hydrolase.

50|$|Pectin is the soluble {{polymeric}} {{material in the}} pulp of oranges, which contains 75% of carboxyl of arabinose and galactose. Pectic compounds are complex heteropolysaccharides in that their chemical composition includes a chain structure of axial-axial α-1.4-linked d-galacturonic acid unit along with blocks of L-rhamnose regions that have side chains of arabinose, galactose, and xylose. Pectin methyl-esterase is the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing carboxymethyl esters and liberating free carboxyl groups and methyl alcohols. The free carboxyl groups interact with cations to form insoluble pectic acid divalent metal ion complexes. These metal ion complexes precipitate in the juice and carry all the colloids in orange juice with it. The enzyme would flocculate the cloud and clarify the orange juice.

30|$|The {{location}} {{of fat in}} cells of the olives {{has been the subject}} of numerous works: according to B. Rangel, the fat accumulates in the cytoplasm of cells of oil-bearing mesocarp, endocarp, and epicarp [22]. According Ranalli, this fat is localized in the cytoplasm in bound form but also in the vacuoles in free form [23]. In any case, the extraction of the oil is in close relation with the state of cellular maturity, itself linked to the degree of brittleness of cell membranes and walls which constitute a physical barrier to its flow. The brittleness of plant cells is estimated by the contents of protopectins that ensure the rigidity of the cell walls. In our case, regardless of the treatment performed, these protopectins decrease during ripening of olives but in a very intense and quickly in olives treated at fruit set and less than those treated at veraison. This promotes the softening of the parietal and membrane structures of the fruit thus facilitating the flow of the fat. These results are in disagreement with the work of Isabel Mínguez-Mosquera on olives cv. Hojiblanca who observed that the protopectins content remains stable during the ripening of olives [24]. Furthermore, pectin degradation is related to the contents of olives of endogenous pectolytic activities. These enzymes convert the protopectins to soluble substances firstly by demethylation using <b>pectinesterases</b> activities, then hydrolysis leading to small chains of galacturonic acids using polygalacturonase. These physiological events that are influenced by the period of the application of ABA, result in more or less intense embrittlement of the parietal structures and release of cell contents causing a flow of fat that exceeds 83 % at full maturity of olives when they are treated by the ABA at fruit set. At that stage, control drupes have not reached yet their maturity and they present a flowing percentage estimated at 70 %. When olives are treated at veraison, a similar but less important phenomenon is observed, leading to a slight acceleration of ripening and diffusion of fat.|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and efficient electrophoretic technique for {{the examination of}} fungal pectic enzymes was developed. This involved electrophoresis of culture fluids in polyacrylamide slab gels containing pectin. Gels were soaked in malic acid solution which gradually reduced the gel pH from 8. 7 to 3. 0 and allowed the enzymes {{to act on the}} incorporated pectin when the pH was suitable. Ruthenium red treatment stained the unaltered pectin revealing unstained zones due to polygalacturonase activity and zones with intensified staining where <b>pectinesterases</b> had converted the pectin to pectic acid. Results were recorded as photograms. Other enzyme systems were investigated. Zymogram clarity was improved by reduction of gel thickness from 3. 5 to 2. 0 mm and sample wells from 15 to 4. 5 ul. Curvature of buffer fronts was eliminated by efficient gel cooling. Tailing was reduced and isozyme band clarity was improved by loading samples as a slurry with Sephadex G 150 —superfine. Thorough gel polymerization before gel moulds were opened was found to be essential for migration characteristics to be uniform through the depth of the gels. The technique was applied to the enzymes of Botrytis and Penicillium species and the Rhizoctonia complex. The influences of culture medium composition were examined for each genus and media suitable for pectic enzyme production were developed. Potent yields of polygalacturonase were obtained from Botrytis species in the absence of pectin. Zymograms from these differed from those produced from pectin media and both were used to advantage. Distinctive and characteristic zymograms were obtained from Botrytis species and provided an accurate means for their identification, and indications of synonymy. An extensive study of B. cinerea detected nine pectic enzyme genotypes. One of these was principally associated with Vitis and may constitute B. fuckeliana. The use of zymograms as taxonomic criteria in Penicillium provided a means for the accurate identification of species in this notoriously difficult genus. The extensive synonymy in subgenus Penicillium was examined by zymograms and 80 taxa were assigned to 21 species, with significant changes in assignments to P. aurantiogriseum and P. commune. The latter was shown to be the previously unknown ancestor of the domesticated P. camembertii. Zymogram studies revealed the presence of five zymogram groups in Thanatephorus, five in Ceratobasidium and one in Waitea, from Rhizoctonia isolates provided from the grain belt of Western Australia. A similar result was obtained from isolates provided from South Australia and a link was shown between grouping of isolates by anastomosis behaviour and by zymograms in the case of four anastomosis groups available from that State. Other anastomosis groups and species in the Ceratobasidiaceae were examined and the correlations found between zymogram patterns and anastomosis groups and subgroups gave promise of aiding the practical recognition of species in the complex...|$|R
30|$|The extractability {{of the fat}} {{during the}} {{ripening}} is to bind with their location in the cell and with {{the condition of the}} fragility of fruit tissue. The location of the oils in fruits {{has been the subject of}} several studies: the oils accumulate in the cytoplasm of olives cell (Rangel et al. 1997) primarily in the mesocarp, but also in the endocarp and epicarp. These oils a rein particular localized in the vacuoles of the cells in free form and in the cytoplasm in bound form (Ranalli et al. 2001). Therefore, the cell walls, the cell membranes and the vacuolar membranes play a role like a physical barrier preventing the extraction of the cell contents, and their degradation can improve the extractability of the fat. Moreover, the state of cell fragility is estimated by the protopectines contents that decrease on a regular basis during the ripening to very low values at maturity. The work of Mínguez-Mosquera Isabel et al. (2002) on the olives cv. Hojiblanca disagree with that study; for these olives, protopectins rate remains almost stable during the ripening while the soluble pectin rates decrease. However, these results confirm those found by Amrani Joutei et al. (1994) on grapes. The degradation of pectins is itself related to the contents of pectolytic enzyme activities in the fruit. These latter act on the protopectins (soluble fractions NaOH and HCl) to degrade into soluble substances in water. This solubilization can be completed by other activities such as cellulases and hemicellulases activities. This water-soluble fraction has many methyl esters will be hydrolysed by the <b>pectinestérases</b> giving soluble substances oxalate there fore relatively poor in methyl esters. In these conditions, polygalacturonase are involved and degrade these molecules into smaller chains of galacturonic acids. The result is a significant release of cell contents from about 25  % at veraison to 84  % at maturity. Nevertheless, the evolution of the cell fragility in olives tissues do not get a oils rich of polyphenols, since we find that the contents of these molecules decrease in a very significant way to maturity. During fruit ripening, there is the modification of the phenolic profile. In the early stages of growth, oleuropein is the major phenolic compound of the fruit; its concentration can reach up to 14  % of net weight (Amiot et al. 1986). Then, its concentration decreases very significantly from veraison due to the presence of anthocyanins (Bianco et al. 1999; Servili et al. 2004; Gόmez-Rico et al. 2009). This steady decline in content oleuropein present in the fruit is due to the β-glucosidase activity, released into the paste during grinding cause degradation of phenolic groups, leading to their transformation into oleuropein aglycone and 3, 4 -DHPEA-EDA. This reduction may also be due to activation of the polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and Peroxidase (POD) during the formation of the olive paste subjected to mixing (Bianco et al. 2001; Gόmez-Rico et al. 2009).|$|R

In cultures of E. coli clones up to 30 % of total <b>pectinesterase</b> activity was transported into the medium. However, no significant <b>pectinesterase</b> activity could be detected in the periplasm. In trodnction Pectic enzymes are of great importance as pathogenicity factors in a broad range of plant diseases caused by micro-organisms (Basham & Bateman, 1975; Stephens &...|$|E
40|$|Durian fruit (Durio zibethinus Murr. cv Chanee) were ripened at 12, 27 and 34 °C (85 ± 5 H). When held at 27 °C, the aril of durians {{softened}} rapidly, concomitant with {{a decrease}} in alkali-soluble pectin, a marked increase in water-soluble pectin and a large increase in polygalacturonase (EC 3. 2. 1. 15) activity. <b>Pectinesterase</b> (EC 3. 1. 2. 11) activity was high at harvest and changed little. Fruit stored at 34 °C showed the same rate of softening as fruit held at 27 °C, whereas polygalacturonase activity (and the amount of water-soluble pectin) was considerably lower. Durians stored at 12 °C showed virtually no softening and had low polygalacturonase and <b>pectinesterase</b> activities and small changes in water-soluble pectin. It is concluded {{that there is a}} positive correlation between softening and pectin degradation. No correlation was found between softening and <b>pectinesterase</b> activity, while the softening is correlated with polygalacturonase activity...|$|E
