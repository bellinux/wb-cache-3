In the working process of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick,</b> pick cylinder under different loading easily lead to early obsolescence. In order to improve the impact resistance performance to pick picks, prolong the service life of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick,</b> based on the digital design method for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick</b> pick cylinder is modeled, {{and based on the}} simulated stress analysis, for the process improvement, improve its mechanical performance, reduce the waste of raw materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{front end}} (F E) control was {{recently}} reported {{as an alternative}} solution to a class of set-point control problems. Initial experiments with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick</b> and place robot arm showed that F E control has a distinct advantage over conventional set-point control in achieving a high quality of system response {{in terms of time}} domain specifications. This has motivated further applications and analysis of F E control systems. This paper presents an adaptive F E control scheme for a class of time-delayed systems having unknown gains. The proposed scheme, when employed in controlling a repetitively operated thermal process, exhibits appreciable improvements in the quality of response compared with the conventional onloff adaptive control scheme. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{protective}} layer (PL) is commonly reserved above foundation surface {{to protect the}} underlying rock mass during dam foundation excavation. In China, the PL of dam foundation is conventionally subdivided into two or three thin layers and excavated with the shallow-hole blasting method, even by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick</b> method in case of soft rock mass. The aforementioned layered excavation of the PL delays {{the construction of the}} whole project. After nearly 30 -year practices, several safe and efficient methods for the PL excavation of dam foundation are gradually developed. They include shallow-hole bench blasting with cushion material (SBC) {{at the bottom of the}} hole, and horizontal smooth blasting (HSB). The PL is even cancelled on the condition that horizontal pre-split technique is employed during dam foundation excavation. This paper introduces the aforementioned two PL excavation methods (shallow-hole blasting and bench blasting) and horizontal pre-split technique of dam foundation without {{protective layer}} (HPP). The basic principles of blasting method, blasting geometry, charge structure, drill-and-blast parameters of typical projects are examined. Meanwhile, the merits and limitations of each method are compared. Engineering practices in China show that HSB is basically the optimal method for dam foundation PL excavation in terms of foundation damage control and rapid construction. Some new problems for dam foundation PL excavation arising, such as strong unloading and relaxation phenomenon that encountered in the gorge region of southwest China, are needed to be addressed; and the corresponding countermeasures are discussed as well...|$|E
5000|$|According to Dick Reavis, [...] "The mine's {{operator}} had failed, as laws require, to map {{the tunnels}} that his men made. Their <b>pneumatic</b> <b>picks</b> struck into the flooded tunnel of an abandoned mine, and they were helpless as the water rose because the motor on the pocito's only winch - the winch that raises and lowers the bote - wouldn't come to life." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1958 Lewis Merthyr Colliery and the {{neighbouring}} Ty Mawr Colliery merged and all coal winding ceased at Lewis Merthyr, with coaling continuing via Ty Mawr {{and men and}} supplies only at Lewis Merthyr. By 1969 the Colliery had become the Ty Mawr/Lewis Merthyr Colliery. As many as thirteen seams have been worked at the Lewis Merthyr using the advanced long wall method of working {{with most of the}} coal being won with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>picks</b> and hand loaded onto conveyors.|$|R
2500|$|Large mining machines, such as steam shovels, {{appeared}} in the mid-nineteenth century, but were restricted to rails until the widespread introduction of continuous track and pneumatic tires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] Until then much mining work was mostly done with <b>pneumatic</b> drills, jackhammers, <b>picks</b> and shovels.|$|R
40|$|A {{quick change}} end {{effector}} (QCEE) system {{was developed and}} tested on a GMF model A-l robot. The QCEE allows for the automatic interconnection of up to three independent pneumatic channels for gripper actuation. The QCEE was designed for a maximum payload of 15 lb. and weighs approximately 5. 4 lbs. The system was tested using <b>pneumatic</b> grippers for <b>pick</b> and place operations, and functioned well in a simulated manufacturing environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for rescue task in bore well environment has been proposed. India {{is facing a}} distressed cruel situation where in the previous years a number of child deaths have been reported falling in the bore well. As {{the diameter of the}} bore well is quiet narrow for any adult person and the lights goes dark inside it, the rescue task in those situations is a challenging task. Here we are proposing a robotic system which will attach a harness to the child using <b>pneumatic</b> arms for <b>picking</b> up. A teleconferencing system will also be attached to the robot for communicating with the child...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ As feed {{response}} from academia and industry, the University of Khartoum had successfully designed and developed an educational pneumatic circuit bench. The bench included various basic pneumatic system components such as filters, lubricators, regulators, pressure gages, valves, actuators, switches, magnetic sensors, fittings, tubes and relays. The developed workbench had overall dimensions of 2400 mm length, 400 mm width and 1800 mm height. The bench had four laboratory activity exercises namely {{control of a}} double acting cylinder, pushing device, <b>pneumatic</b> press, and <b>picking</b> device. Various exercises had been designed and developed to operate pneumatically and electrically. The electrically operated picking device consisted of a commercial air compressor, 1 unit of FRL unit, 4 units o...|$|R
