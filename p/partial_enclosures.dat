These encapsulations form <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures</b> yielding exterior problems that may be solve by using the intensity potential approach. The intensity potential approach is briefly presented and the boundary element method to solve the resulting Poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions is discussed in detail. The boundary element method is a suitable solution strategy since only surfaces of objects has to be discretised and the boundary condition at infinity is exactly fulfilled. Results in 1 / 3 -octave bands show that the method is very applicable for estimation of the global radiated sound power in one-third-octave bands in the high-frequency range, but that the directivity of the radiation pattern is underestimated...|$|E

The result is a Poisson equation for a scalar intensity potential. The intensity potential formulation and {{the boundary}} element method are both suitable for exterior problems. The governing equations of the intensity potential and the boundary element method for solving this problem are presented. Results from the proposed method are compared with experimental results, for the case of radiated sound power in one-third-octave bands from sources in a partial enclosure.

Previous results have showed that the insertion loss by the barrier declines for the occurrence of reflection. In this paper, some remedial measures have been studied using the theoretical prediction by Macdonald's and the image receiver theory. The theoretical model results were verified by the scale models tests. By designing an absorptive top screen using the theoretical models, an insertion loss of 17 dB at a frequency of 500 Hz, 20 dB, at a frequency of 1000 Hz and 25 dB and at frequency of 2000 Hz could be obtained. Such performances are higher than the previous windows screens and are comparable with tall barriers or <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures</b> on the roadside.

40|$|Thermal buoyancy-driven natural {{convection}} in <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures</b> with multiple free openings is investigated regarding the coupling {{of the pressure}} correction algorithm with inner-loop iterations of the pressure correction equation. Unexpected steady flow phenomena, i. e., nonunique steady flow states, are observed when different inner-loop iterations m and relaxation factors α of the pressure correction equation are implemented, after the appropriate assumptions on the free opening boundary conditions are made. Numerical experiments and benchmark exercises confirm that definitions on the free openings could be too weak to ensure global similarity {{to the results of}} extended domain methodology. Furthermore, inner-loop iteration m and relaxation factor α could have similar effects on the nonunique steady flow results. As thermal Rayleigh number is relatively low, a linear relationship could be established among inner-loop iteration m, relaxation factor α, and mass exchange rate, MER. In addition, harmonic arrangements on the iteration residuals of the momentum equation and the pressure correction equation could accelerate convergence of the whole pressure correction algorithm.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the growth and spread of fires in ceiling vented enclosures. The transport phenomena due to fire have been modeled as buoyancy-induced turbulent flow in <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures.</b> The governing equations comprises the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with turbulence model in stream function-vorticity formulation approach. The governing equations are solved by high accuracy compact finite difference schemes with four stage Runge-Kutta method for time integration. Results are reported for Grashof numbers varied from The effects of multiple heat sources in rectangular enclosure and ceiling vent aspect ratio in square enclosure are investigated. The thermal plume growth rate, ambient entrainment flow rate and the oscillatory nature at the vent opening are reported. As the Grashof number increases the effect of entrained ambient air is significant with higher volume flow rates through ceiling vent. A bidirectional flow is visualized at the ceiling opening. The distance between two heat sources governs the unified and independent behavior of thermal plumes. Present results are matching very well with the numerical and experimental results available in literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensity}} potential {{approach is}} developed for prediction of sound power flow through <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures.</b> A typical application is the prediction of radiated noise from an engine bay with respect to geometry, position and acoustical properties of screens and absorbers. The approach {{is based on the}} Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field of the time-averaged sound intensity into its irrotational and rotational components. The local power balance in a lossless medium and the Helmholtz decomposition gives a Poisson equation for the scalar intensity potential of the irrotational component only. The paper presents the approach and evaluates it by canonical examples and by comparison to measured data. It is demonstrated that the prediction of sound power through any closed surface is exact provided that the geometry and boundary conditions are correct. The comparison to experimental data shows that the method is useful in practical applications. The approach has its strength for cases with complex geometry and multiple broadband sources, but {{it has the potential to}} become more general by further development of boundary conditions.

The geometry represents a simplified version of a new generation trapped vortex combustor and consisted of a rectangular cavity connected to a neck of smaller size. Wall pressure fluctuations have been measured through wall mounted microphones providing single and multi-variate pressure statistics both in the physical space and in the Fourier domain. In order to interpret the pressure signals, aerodynamic and acoustic investigations have been carried out as well for several cavity-neck ratios. The analysis of the acoustic response of the cavity has been conducted both numerically and experimentally and a simple theoretical model has been proposed to predict the frequency of the acoustic resonances. The aerodynamic study has been carried out through PIV measurements that provided characterization in terms of the geometrical parameters of both the large-scale vortex generated within the cavity and the recirculation zone formed upstream of the neck. The use of the POD decomposition permitted us to correlate the dynamics of the recirculation with the observed pressure statistics.

The system is made of a single-leaf clay masonry wall, with three horizontal deformable joints within the clay unit rows, to be employed in RC frame buildings in regions prone to medium/high intensity earthquakes. To understand the behaviour of this system, an experimental campaign on four real-scale, one-bay, one- storey RC frames infilled with both partial and full enclosure walls, was performed.

40|$|Wall {{pressure}} fluctuations {{generated by}} interaction of turbulent jets with {{the wall of}} rectangular <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures</b> (RPEs) are studied experimentally over {{a broad range of}} parameters. The scope of the present work is to characterize the propagation of the pressure perturbations in the RPEs by means of wall pressure auto-spectra, cross-spectra and cross-correlations measured through microphones located along the wall. In order to interpret the pressure measurement, the acoustic and fluid dynamic behaviours are investigated analytically, numerically and experimentally for several cavityneck section ratios. The flow structures as the vortex formed in the cavity and the recirculation zone in the neck are studied in details. The acoustic behaviour of this geometry is investigated with particular emphasis on the first dominant mode analysis. It is pointed out that the first mode frequency scales as an Helmholtz resonator frequency. Taking into account this scaling a reduced form of the Strouhal number, that leads the spectra to collapse, is proposed. Furthermore it is found that the mechanism characterizing the pressure propagation at high frequency close to the bottom wall is strongly affected by the adverse pressure gradient that modifies the jet-wall interaction. The fluid dynamic contribution of the pressure fluctuations at high frequency is accompanied by a relevant acoustic effect characterized by a convection velocity close to the speed of sound at low frequency. The dynamic of the recirculation zone, characterized using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition technique, plays an important role from the aeroacoustic viewpoint that produces in some conditions an increase of the wall pressure fluctuations at low frequency...|$|E

Thus, a numerical tool to predict the noise radiated from a vehicle in an early design stage is needed. Due to the large frequency range {{to be taken into}} account [100 Hz- 2. 5 kHz], the complexity of the domain to be simulated (<b>partial</b> <b>enclosures,</b> exterior field) and the number of DOFs to be considered, {{exterior noise}} simulation reaches the limits of standard deterministic method like FEM or BEM. In the frame of the European project VISPeR, a benchmark of several numerical methodologies aiming at exterior noise simulation has been conducted by the partners Centro Ricerche Fiat (CRF), INSA Lyon, Ecole Centrale de Lyon (ECL) and Rieter. Simple test cases with different treatment configurations, the mock-up of an engine comprtment as well as a real engine compartment have been considered.

40|$|If all {{architectural}} form could be simplistically grouped into only two categories, these might be "object" and "partial enclosure," where objects are {{in dialogue with}} the space around them while <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures</b> articulate the space within them. In contemporary architectural discourse, "object" is in disfavor. Particularly {{in the sphere of}} urban planning, and in reaction to city-hating International-style buildings, architectural objects are to be avoided in favor of continuing the weave of existing urban fabric. Such objection is based on a figure-ground understanding of urbanism that values the figure of public space over th at of architectural element. This white-and-black construct has been used in architectural theory to sometimes prefer space and sometimes object, but this paper takes the position that hierarchy is not necessarily the appropriate relationship. This paper describes an object-space dialogue that is not based on figure-ground. It starts from the assumption that space is potential movement. By studying existing masterworks, the relationship between object and movement space that was discovered is interesting because it is paradoxic: objects articulate space to suggest movement often while simultaneously acting as obstructions.

40|$|Encapsulation of fans, {{engines and}} {{machinery}} {{is a standard}} noise-control treatment. The encapsulations have generally large apertures to allow for airflow cooling. They form <b>partial</b> <b>enclosures</b> with coupling between the complex interior wave field and exterior radiation in an unbounded domain. A typical encapsulation is an engine bay where geometry, position and acoustical properties of screens and absorbers are used to control the radiated noise. The mid- and high-frequency range is often of interest, i. e. ~frequencies for which the wavelength is {{on the order of}} or smaller than geometrical details. A method suitable for this kind of problem is the intensity potential appraoch. The intensity potential approach is based on the Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field of time-averaged sound intensity into its irrotational and rotational components. The local power balance in a lossless medium is expressed in terms of the irrotational component only, and results in the Poisson equation for a scalar intensity potential of this component only. It captures the power flow from sources to the surroundings by considering the part of the intensity field that is related to flow of energy. A strength of the method is that no additional assumptions have to be made apart from what is behind the local power balance; it follows directly from the Helmholtz decomposition of the active intensity. Further, it does not violate the geometrical divergence of energy in free-field as the classical equation of acoustical diffusion. It is therefore suitable for cases where a partial enclosed volume has strong coupling to an exterior unbounded domain. The physical and theoretical background of the method is presented together with evaluations by comparison to experimental data. The comparison to experimental data shows that the method is useful in practical applications. The approach provides a robust prediction tool that has its strength at high frequencies for cases with complex geometry and multiple broadband sources...|$|E
