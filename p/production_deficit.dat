We consider the diversification effect of wind power {{to reduce the}} risk of water inflow shortages, an important energy security concern for hydropower-based economic zones (e. g. Québec and Norway). Our risk measure is based on the probability of a <b>production</b> <b>deficit,</b> in a manner akin to the value-at-risk, simulation analysis of financial portfolios. We examine whether the risk level of a mixed hydro-and-wind portfolio of generating assets improves on the risk of an all-hydro portfolio, by relaxing the dependence on water inflows and attenuating the impact of droughts. Copulas are used to model the dependence between the two sources of energy. The data considered, over the period 1958 - 2003, are for the province of Québec, which possesses large hydro and wind resources. Our results indicate that for all scenarios considered, any proportion of wind up to 30 % improves the <b>production</b> <b>deficit</b> risk profile of an all-hydro system.

40|$|Background: Although the {{efficacy}} of treatments for spoken verb and sentence <b>production</b> <b>deficits</b> in aphasia has been documented widely, less is known about interventions for written verb and written sentence <b>production</b> <b>deficits.</b> Aims: This study documents a treatment aiming to improve production of (a) written subject-verb sentences (involving intransitive verbs) and (b) written subject-verb-object sentences (involving transitive verbs). Methods & Procedures: The participant, a 63 -year-old female aphasic speaker, had a marked language comprehension deficit, apraxia of speech, relatively good spelling abilities, and no hemiplegia. The treatment involved intransitive verbs producing subject-verb active sentences and transitive verbs producing subject-verb-object active non-reversible sentences.

In this paper, we review some of these researches and provide a set of recommendations designed to improve communicative outcomes when interacting with people who have PD. A variety of comprehension deficits have been documented in PD, including syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic deficits, as well as an impaired ability to recognize emotions. People with PD are also impaired in terms of language production, possibly in part because of their comprehension <b>deficits.</b> Major <b>production</b> <b>deficits</b> include reduced informational content, longer and more frequent pauses and associated turn-taking disruption, inappropriate levels of politeness, and deficits in various nonverbal accompaniments.

Ten sets of three words of increasing length (e. g. “sleep,” “sleepy,” sleepiness”) were elicited from four non-fluent aphasic subjects.

This general pattern was consistent with that for normal subjects reported in the literature (Lehiste 1972). However, the aphasic patients exhibited anomalous results for root word durations in the three-syllable condition.

We concentrated on two aspects of the haptic perception of vertical, horizontal and oblique orientations: first, the global level of performances compared with normal subjects and, second, the occurrence of the oblique effect (i. e. lower performances in oblique orientations than in vertical-horizontal orientations). Subjects were asked to position a rod, presented in the fronto-parallel plane, to one of four orientations: vertical, horizontal, left 45 degrees oblique and right 45 degrees oblique.

40|$|Poor {{households}} in sub-Saharan Africa are of necessity adjusting to a bewildering array of radical {{changes in the}} policy environment within which they struggle to construct viable livelihoods. In Malawi these changes include the removal of fertiliser subsidies and massive currency devaluations, which have contributed to increasing food <b>production</b> <b>deficits</b> at both household and national levels and to rapidly rising prices for food, agricultural inputs and consumer goods. Poor households adjust to these production and income shocks in various ways, some of which involve searching for additional cash or food (from informal employment, borrowing, or gifts from relatives and friends), while others involve austerity measures (rationing food consumption, withdrawing children from school) that have negative implications for wellbeing. This paper examines the role of informal safety nets in providing protection against recent livelihood shocks in Malawi, drawing on secondary sources and a survey undertaken in rural and urban communities {{in the south of}} the country. A key finding is that informal transfers, either between rich and poor or among the poor themselves, appear to be declining over time, partly as a general consequence of commercialisation and partly because deepening poverty means that the economic basis for redistribution is contracting. This was particularly true in our rural survey, where people complained that in the absence of income-generating opportunities and with limited formal or informal support there is no alternative to severe austerity measures: 'making less last longer'. The paper concludes by arguing that policymakers concerned with providing assistance to Malawi's poor should consider 'productivity-enhancing safety nets', such as inputs-for-work to boost agricultural production, rather than food-for-work to compensate for <b>production</b> <b>deficits...</b>|$|R
40|$|When grain {{production}} {{falls short}} of consumption expectations in self-provisioning households, a range of responses is possible. How each household selects from and manages these responses provides the theoretical and empirical focus of this thesis. Several problematic issues in the 'coping strategies' literature are addressed, including questions of response sequencing and 'discrete stages', the timing of asset sales for food, {{and the relationship between}} consumption protecting and consumption modifying strategies. Among other theoretical advances, criteria for response sequencing are identified which explain decisions about which assets to sell for food, and when, in terms of each asset's expected return rather than its immediate 'entitlement' value. This thesis is grounded in fieldwork conducted in the West African semi-arid tropics, a region characterised by seasonally, agricultural risk and market imperfections. Drought and armyworms undermined crop production in the fieldwork village in 1987 / 8. The community is highly stratified economically, and striking cross-sectional contrasts in household behaviour and nutritional outcomes were observed. Food secure households practice demographic, agronomic and economic diversification, which provide access to sources of food and income that are not correlated to local economic fluctuations. Consumption insecure households have narrower options and respond to <b>production</b> <b>deficits</b> by wealth depletion (asset monetisation, debt acquisition) and severe food rationing. Responses to <b>production</b> <b>deficits</b> are not confined to strategies for acquiring food. Multiple objectives - economic, nutritional and social - are retained. Nutritional adjustments are motivated by intertemporal economic priorities. The poorest households protected their assets and rationed consumption most severely: the cost of consuming resources rises as the number and value of assets owned falls. Within households, nutritional surveillance revealed that adults rationed their food consumption earlier and more severely than their children. Adult anthropometric status may therefore be a more robust predictor of food insecurity and economic stress than child anthropometry. </p...|$|R
