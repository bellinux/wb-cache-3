The Los Angeles-based organising committee, led by Peter Ueberroth, {{was able to}} generate a surplus of US$225million, which was an unprecedented amount at that time. The organising committee {{had been able to}} create such a surplus in part by selling exclusive sponsorship rights to select companies. The IOC sought to gain control of these sponsorship rights. Samaranch helped to establish The Olympic Programme (TOP) in 1985, in order to create an Olympic brand. Membership in TOP was, and is, very exclusive and expensive. Fees cost US$50million for a four-year membership. Members of TOP received exclusive global advertising rights for their <b>product</b> <b>category,</b> and use of the Olympic symbol, the interlocking rings, in their publications and advertisements.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{studies in}} Marketing have {{typically}} characterized a household’s purchase incidence decision, i. e. the household’s decision {{of whether or}} not to buy a product on a given shopping visit, as being independent of the household’s purchase incidence decisions in other <b>product</b> <b>categories.</b> These decisions, however, tend to be related both because <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> serve as complements (e. g. bacon and eggs) or substitutes (e. g. colas and orange juices) in addressing the household’s consumption needs, and because <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> vie with each other in attracting the household’s limited shopping budget. Existing empirical studies have either ignored such inter-relationships altogether or have accounted for them in a limited way by modeling household purchases in pairs of complementary <b>product</b> <b>categories.</b> Given the recent availability of IRI market basket data, which tracks purchases of panelists in several <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> over time, and the new computational Bayesian methods developed in Albert and Chib (1993) and Chib and Greenberg (1998), estimating high-dimensional multi-category models is now possible.

However, it is unclear whether the differences of the two visiting behavior between purchase outcome or <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> are significant. The present study hopes to fill the void. An analysis of 27, 528 visit sessions extracted from ComScore verifies that (1) the difference of page views between purchase outcomes and that between <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> were significant and (2) only the difference of visit duration between the <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> was significant but that between purchase outcomes was insignificant.

The aim of this research was to know how consumer makes the selection in between the different <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> and how premier shelf space affects their decision making process. No doubt, there are so many factors, which can influence the consumer’s decision- making process for grocery shopping. In this research we studied the importance of seven factors on the sale of 12 <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> in ICA Alidhem stores. A social survey was conducted and 96 filled questionnaires were collected from the different people who were living near to the ICA Alidhem store. Spss tool was used to analyze the data.

This result could be helpful for ICA Alidhem store for defining the planogram and for manufacturers of these 12 <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> as well.

2500|$|Research {{shows that}} consumers' broad general {{perceptions}} of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country. For example, a global survey carried out by Nielsen, reported that [...] Country of origin image has a significant influence on consumer perceptions and behaviours, and in situations in which additional information is unavailable or difficult to get can be the sole determinant {{of whether or not}} someone buys a product. Its effect is strongest on consumers who don't know much about the product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by <b>product</b> <b>category.</b> It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goods and weakest for [...] "low involvement" [...] product categories such as shampoo and candy. In various studies it has also been proven that the Country-of-Origin Effect also applies to services.|$|E

The ASA ruled that in {{the context in which}} it appeared, it was ambiguous in that it could be interpreted either as referring to price reductions that had taken place within Asda or to price comparisons with the named competitors. In addition, because the ad did not explain that the price reductions had not necessarily taken place in the week that immediately preceded the ad, they concluded that the headings which stated the number of price reductions that had taken place in each <b>product</b> <b>category</b> were misleading.

40|$|Because {{consumers}} are limited information processors seeking to conserve cognitive energy, {{it is likely}} that at least some use identical decision heuristics across <b>product</b> <b>categories.</b> This study develops a finite mixture logit model that identifies segments of households with identical behaviors across <b>product</b> <b>categories.</b> The proposed model is shown to fit in-sample choices and forecast out-of-sample choices at least as well as an unrestricted model in which all choice behaviors are independent across <b>product</b> <b>categories.</b> The results show that about 32 % of the sample households have choice behaviors that are identical across {{at least two of the}} three <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> studied, while the remaining households have choice behaviors that are independent across all three categories. The empirical results show that the segment with identical behaviors is quite price sensitive, not at all sensitive to store feature advertising, and not very brand- or size-loyal. These households are more likely to have larger families and marginally lower incomes and to shop less frequently and spend less per shopping trip. They are also lighter users in two of the three <b>product</b> <b>categories</b> investigated. Implications of the model for manufacturers and retailers are discussed.
