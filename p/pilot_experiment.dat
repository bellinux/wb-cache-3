25|$|On June 16, 2013, Google began a <b>pilot</b> <b>experiment</b> in New Zealand {{where about}} 30 {{balloons}} were launched {{in coordination with}} the Civil Aviation Authority from the Tekapo area in the South Island. About 50 local users in and around Christchurch and the Canterbury Region tested connections to the aerial network using special antennas. After this initial trial, Google plans on sending up 300 balloons around {{the world at the}} 40th parallel south that would provide coverage to New Zealand, Australia, Chile, and Argentina. Google hopes to eventually have thousands of balloons flying in the stratosphere.|$|E

The device had a minimal design and was all black, completely unbranded although it was made by Inventec, and had a rubberized coating. The device was named after Chromium-48, an unstable isotope of the metallic element Chromium, and the participants were named Cr-48 Test Pilots. Google distributed about 60,000 Cr-48 Chrome Notebooks between December 2010 and March 2011 for free to participants and in return asked for feedback such as suggestions and bug reports. The Cr-48 was intended for testing only, not retail sales.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the force}} feeding process, the EU {{committee}} examined several experiments {{carried out by}} INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) to detect pain or distress by looking at blood hormones, and found that no definite conclusions {{can be drawn from}} these studies. Other studies looked at behavioral aversion to the feeding process and found that force fed ducks avoided the feeding pen when given a choice, whereas a majority of the control group not being force fed would enter the feeding pen voluntarily. Daily hand-feeding of ducks and geese is normally associated with a positive response by the animals towards the person feeding them. In contrast, the working group observed that ducks and geese in a pen kept away from their force feeder when he entered the room. In an unpublished <b>pilot</b> <b>experiment</b> by INRA, ducks in cages reportedly displayed less avoidance behaviour to the force feeder’s visit than to the visit of a neutral person coming along the cages later. However, in the working group's own observations, [...] "Ducks in cages had little opportunity to show avoidance but sometimes moved their heads away from the person who was about to force feed them." ...|$|E

The practice to evaluate the prior knowledge, the experience a person has gained in different environment: at work, different courses, training, etc. is used in many countries in the world.

The parameters of the behavioral part of our scanning study (i. e., the quadrupling of the transfer of player A and the punishment technology in the intentional and costly condition) were calibrated in the <b>pilot</b> <b>experiments</b> to generate defection rates between 50 and 60 %. We asked the subjects of the <b>pilot</b> <b>experiments</b> whether we can “use ” their decisions in other sessions of this experiment. Thus, the scanned subjects in the role of player A faced those decisions that were made by the subjects in the role of player B in the behavioral <b>pilot</b> <b>experiments.</b> This means that the scanned subjects faced the decisions of real human opponents and if they punished player B (in the effective punishment conditions IC, IF or NC) the monetary payoff of the subject in the role of player B was indeed reduced. Both subjects in the role of player A and player B were paid real money according to the rules of the behavioral experiment. In the scanning study player A played the behavioral experiment 7 times – each time with a different human opponent. In 3 of the 7 games player A faced a cooperating player B and in the...|$|R

The demonstration consisted in showing the effectiveness of the new system of care per its ability to make a gradual and ultimate closure of psychiatric hospitals possible, while the new services, which can appropriately be called “alternative” instead of “complementary” to the psychiatric hospitals, were being created. These services include unstaffed apartments, supervised hostels, group homes, day centers, and cooperatives managed by patients.|$|R

In spite of this, Microsoft distributed optical media and a single subscription to authorized U.S. retail partners who attended teamMicrosoft Live! events. As part of a <b>pilot</b> <b>experiment,</b> consumers in Australia, France, and New Zealand could purchase a subscription for Office XP starting in May 2001; the worldwide release of the activation model was contingent on the success of the <b>pilot</b> <b>experiment,</b> but Microsoft terminated support for subscriptions in 2002 based on feedback and research that demonstrated it was not well understood by consumers.
