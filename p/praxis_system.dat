5000|$|The {{prevailing}} hypothesis for the pathophysiology of {{ideomotor apraxia}} {{is that the}} various brain lesions associated with the disorder somehow disrupt portions of the <b>praxis</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>praxis</b> <b>system</b> is the brain regions {{that are involved in}} taking processed sensory input, accessing of stored information about tools and gestures, and translating these into a motor output. Buxbaum et al. have proposed that the <b>praxis</b> <b>system</b> involves three distinct parts: stored gesture representations, stored tool knowledge, and a [...] "dynamic body schema." [...] The first two store information about the representation of gestures in the brain and the characteristic movements of tools. The body schema is a brain model of the body and its position in space. The <b>praxis</b> <b>system</b> relates the stored information about a movement type to how the dynamic, i.e. changing, body representation varies as the movement progresses. It is still not clear how this system maps out onto the brain itself, although some research has given indications to possible locations for certain portions. The dynamic body schema has been suggested to be localized in the superior posterior parietal cortex. There is also evidence that the inferior parietal lobule may be the locus for storage of the characteristic movements of a tool. This area showed inverse activation to the cerebellum in a study of tool use and tool mime. If the connections between these areas become severed, the <b>praxis</b> <b>system</b> would be disrupted, possibly resulting in the symptoms observed in ideomotor apraxia.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{complexity}} of the medical problems facing ideomotor apraxia patients, as they are usually suffering from a multitude of other problems, it is difficult to ascertain the impact that it has on their ability to function independently. Deficits due to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease could very well be sufficient to mask or make irrelevant difficulties arising from the apraxia. Some studies have shown ideomotor apraxia to independently diminish the patient's ability to function on their own. [...] The general consensus seems to be that ideomotor apraxia does {{have a negative impact on}} independence in that it can reduce an individual's ability to manipulate objects, as well as diminishing the capacity for mechanical problem solving, owing to the inability to access information about how familiar parts of the unfamiliar system function. A small subset of patients has been known to spontaneously recover from apraxia; this is rare, however. One possible hope is the phenomenon of hemispheric shift, where functions normally performed by one hemisphere can shift to the other in the event that the first is damaged. This seems to necessitate, however, that some portion of the function is associated with the other hemisphere to begin with. There is dispute over whether the right hemisphere of the cortex is involved at all in the <b>praxis</b> <b>system,</b> as some evidence from patients with severed corpus callosums indicates it may not be.|$|E

Following suggestions of a female advantage on learned movements (Chipman and Hampson in Neuropsychologia 44 (12) : 2315 – 2329, 2006), we investigated how males and females acquire skilled movements.

Our results demonstrate a female advantage in the acquisition of hand movement sequences and show that this sex difference is accounted for by a female advantage in planning, rather than an advantage in execution or online control. Further, the female advantage is specific to the production of items within a sequence and does not affect the proper ordering of items.

The authors performed voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping with data from 71 left brain-damaged patients. Three types of actions were examined: (i) pantomime to sight of tools (GestTool); (ii) pantomime on imitation (ImTool); and (iii) imitation of meaningless gestures (ImNov).

Moreover, tool-related actions (both GestTool and ImTool) were dependent on left middle and inferior temporal lobe, whereas imitation of meaningless gestures (ImNov) was dependent on left inferior parietal regions. From these findings, the authors drew two conclusions.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the neural and cognitive bases of upper limb apraxia in corticobasal degeneration (CBD). METHODS: Eighteen patients with CBD underwent a cognitive neuropsychological assessment of apraxia and resting [(18) F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scanning. Two complementary measures of apraxia {{were computed for}} each modality of gesture production. First, a performance score measured error frequency during gesture execution. Second, as a more stringent test of {{the integrity of the}} <b>praxis</b> <b>system,</b> the correction score measured the patient's ability to correct his or her errors on a second attempt. For each measure type, a cut-off score for the presence of apraxia was defined with regard to healthy controls. Using each cut-off score, the regional cerebral glucose metabolism of patients with CBD with apraxia (i. e., performing below cut-off score) was compared with that of patients with CBD without apraxia. RESULTS: Mean performance scores were below normal values in all modalities. Anterior cingulate hypometabolism predominated in patients with CBD who performed below the cut-off performance score. At variance, mean correction scores were below normal values for gesture imitation only. Hypometabolism in superior parietal lobule and supplementary motor area characterized patients with CBD who were unable to correct their errors {{at the same rate as}} control subjects did. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct neural networks underlie distinct aspects of the upper limb apraxic deficits in CBD. Extending previous findings of gesture production deficits in CBD, the use of complementary measures of apraxic behavior discloses a visuoimitative upper limb apraxia in CBD, underlain by a metabolic decrease in a parietofrontal neural network.

40|$|Comparison between {{real and}} pantomimed actions {{is used in}} {{neuroscience}} to dissociate stimulus-driven (real) as compared to internally driven (pantomimed) visuomotor transformations, {{with the goal of}} testing models of vision (Milner & Goodale, 1995) and diagnosing neuropsychological deficits (apraxia syndrome). Real actions refer to an overt movement directed toward a visible target whereas pantomimed actions refer to an overt movement directed either toward an object that is no longer available. Although similar, real and pantomimed actions differ in their kinematic parameters and in their neural substrates. Pantomimed-reach-to-grasp-actions show reduced reaching velocities, higher wrist movements, and reduced grip apertures. In addition, seminal neuropsychological studies and recent neuroimaging findings confirmed that real and pantomimed actions are underpinned by separate brain networks. Although previous literature suggests differences in the <b>praxis</b> <b>system</b> between males and females, no research to date has investigated whether or not gender differences exist in the context of real versus pantomimed reach-to-grasp actions. We asked ten male and ten female participants to perform real and pantomimed reach-to-grasp actions toward objects of different sizes, either with or without visual feedback. During pantomimed actions participants were required to pick up an imaginary object slightly offset relative to the location of the real one (which was in turn the target of the real reach-to-grasp actions). Results demonstrate {{a significant difference between the}} kinematic parameters recorded in male and female participants performing pantomimed, but not real reach-to-grasp tasks, depending on the availability of visual feedback. With no feedback both males and females showed smaller grip aperture, slower movement velocity and lower reach height. Crucially, these same differences were abolished when visual feedback was available in male, but not in female participants. Our results suggest that male and female participants should be evaluated separately in the clinical environment and in future research in the field...|$|E

40|$|Through {{the use of}} a multiserver capability-based ar-chitecture, the GNU Hurd has {{attempted}} to increase security and flexibility relative to traditional Unix-like operating systems. This shift away from a monolithic design requires a reevaluation of conventional operat-ing <b>system</b> <b>praxis</b> to determine its degree of continued applicability. Resource scheduling appears particularly defunct in this regard: to make smarter scheduling deci-sions, monolithic systems cross component boundaries to gain insight into application behavior. This introspec-tion is incompatible with a multiserver architecture and its elimination, as observed in Mach, the current micro-kernel used by the GNU Hurd, results in noticeable per-formance degradation. To this end, I propose that rather than have the operating system provide virtualized re-sources, i. e. schedule the contents of resources on be-half of applications, it offer near raw access to the prin-cipals which they must multiplex as required thereby relieving e. g. the memory manager of paging decisions. The resource managers must still partition the physi-cal resources among the competing principals. For this, I suggest a market based solution in which principals have a periodically renewed credit allowance and lease the required resources.
