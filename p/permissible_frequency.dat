40|$|The {{frequency}} {{structure of}} large aspect ratio jet impingement tones is analyzed. Feedback loops consisting of downstream propagating instability {{waves of the}} jet flow and upstream propagating acoustic waves from the wall to the nozzle lip produce as many as 20 or more tones when a supersonic rectangular jet of large aspect ratio is directed normal on a wall. It is seen {{that there are only}} two basic tones. The basic tone of the lower frequency is associated with a symmetric instability feedback mode of the jet, while that of the higher frequency is associated with an antisymmetric instability feedback mode. The remaining tones are combination tones of the two basic frequencies and their harmonics. It is determined that the measured basic impingement tone frequencies fall in the theoretical <b>permissible</b> <b>frequency</b> bands over a wide range of jet Mach number...|$|E
40|$|Background: Approximately 10 % of {{attempted}} blood donations {{are not allowed}} because of low hemoglobin (Hb) deferral. Study design and methods: Low Hb deferrals were tracked in more 715, 000 whole blood donors at six blood centers across the United States. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to comprehensively assess demographic correlates for low Hb deferral. Results: Demographic factors significantly associated with low Hb deferral include female sex (11 times greater odds than males), increasing age in men (men over 80 have 29 times greater odds than men under 20), African American race (2 - 2. 5 times greater odds than Caucasians), Hispanic ethnicity in women (1. 29 times greater odds than Caucasian women), and weight in men (men under 124 pounds have 2. 5 times greater odds than men over 200 pounds). Interestingly, increasing donation frequency is associated with decreased odds for low Hb deferral (women with one donation in the previous 12 months have two times greater odds than those with six donations). ConclusionS: Low Hb deferral is associated with female sex, older age, African American race/ethnicity, and lower body weight in men. An inverse association with donation frequency suggests a selection bias in favor of donors able to give more frequently. These data provide useful {{information that can be}} utilized to manage blood donors to limit low Hb deferrals and assist in policy decisions such as changing the Hb cutoff or <b>permissible</b> <b>frequency</b> of donation. They also generate hypotheses for new research of the causes of anemia in defined groups of donors. © 2010 American Association of Blood Banks...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Total mileage of Ukrainian {{electric}} railways {{is distributed}} approximately equally between {{the areas of}} direct and alternating current. A double system of electric rolling stock is used to pass jointing places of different current kinds without train’s stop. Therefore introduction of such rolling stock of a new concept that is using an asynchronous traction drive is prospective for Ukrainian railways. Apart from advantages a rolling stock of similar concept has significant disadvantages, it is pulse energy consumption from the power supply, and it can affect the reliability of track automatic devices, and consequently, the train traffic safety. In addition the specific power of traction transformer is considerably inferior to the power density of other traction elements. The promising schemes using an intermediary link of increased frequency, which consist of a transformer and inverter, have been proposed for disadvantages amendments. The main task for the further introduction of prospective circuit {{is to determine the}} operating frequency for high frequency link. Methodology. The method of thermal parameters calculation of semiconductor devices has been used for determination switching transistors of maximum operating frequency. To obtain analytical expressions curves of energy, released during the IGBT (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) switching from its current load approximation method is used. Findings. The <b>permissible</b> <b>frequency</b> of low-frequency link is determinated by load current of intermediate transformer. Operating frequency range of a link depending on load current has been determined. A comparative analysis of the switching characteristics of 65 class IGBT production by companies Infineon and ABB has been performed. Originality. The further determination method of the maximum operating frequency of intermediate link for circuit with high-frequency transformer has been developed. Practical value. The established operating frequency range of the high-level link will develop further research of tractive circuit with high-frequency transformer use for double feed electric rolling stock with asynchronous tractive drive. It will evaluate the introduction effectiveness of similar configuration circuits...|$|E

The design parameters are consistent with PEP-II. Present studies reveal that coupled bunch and two stream instabilities are important issues and we need feedback system. The Medium Energy Electron Ion Collider (MEIC) at Jefferson Lab has been envisioned as future high energy particle accelerator beyond the 12 GeV upgrade of CEBAF. The MEIC will consist of the existing polarized electron source complex with 12 GeV upgrade and a new ion complex with polarized and unpolarized light to medium ions.

40|$|Traditional design methodologies of {{a digital}} system assumes {{the worst case}} {{operating}} conditions to tolerate the physical and environmental variations, which ensure the system operates correctly and conservatively. The clock frequency of the processor is generally set to operate below the maximum <b>permissible</b> operating <b>frequency</b> which achieves less than the maximum performance gains. However, in-fact higher performance gain {{can be achieved by}} dynamic overclocking mechanism, which tunes the clock rate beyond the worst case assumptions. Dynamic overclocking mechanism may eventually lead to rise in temperature if it is adopted for a longer duration of time hence this problem is circumvented by using throttling mechanism at appropriate instances. Further, the throttling technique can be used to conserve energy when the system is with low work load. The aim of the work is to exploit the techniques of overclocking and throttling to enhance the performance, also to achieve optimal utilization of processor resources {{and at the same time}} maintaining the system reliability. The goal is hence achieved by employing an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System to self-tune its frequency based on work load characteristics and also adapting itself to environmental variations...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to synchronous generators, {{due to their}} asynchronous operation, the speed variation of Type 3 WTGs is {{much larger than the}} <b>permissible</b> system <b>frequency</b> variation. Their rotor speed can be controlled between 0.7 and 1.2 using modern power converters [62]. Their emulated inertial constant can be set as large as several times their inherent inertial constant in an auxiliary control loop. The partial-scale power converter (20 %– 30 % of full rating) in the rotor circuit of Type 3 WTGs imposes limitations on the deloaded operating level, maximum inertial response and rotational speed range (within ± 20 %–± 30 % of synchronous speed) [55]. Compared to Type 3 WTGs with the identical rated power capability and inertial constant, Type 4 WTGs are capable of providing stronger inertial response due to the wider operating range of their rotor speeds (0.5 – 1.2 p.u.) [34]. Moreover, the full-scale power converter allows Type 4 WTGs to possess a higher overloading capability, so that more temporary inertial power can be injected into grid for a short period [78]. In addition, Type 4 WTGs might utilize a larger amount of energy stored in the DC-link capacitor to enhance the emulated inertial response and compensate for the temporary power deficit during the rotor speed recovery [37].|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{the number}} of tests on {{vehicles}} {{is one of the}} most important requirements for increasing cost efficiency in the calibration process of engine control units (ECU). Here, employing virtual vehicles for a model-based calibration of ECUs is essential. Modelling components for virtual vehicles can be a tedious and time-consuming task. In this context, data-based modelling techniques can be an attractive alternative to physical models to increase efficiency in the modelling process. Data-based models can incorporate unknown nonlinearities encoded in the sampled data, resulting in more accurate models in practice. In combination with automated measurement, data-based modelling can help to significantly accelerate the calibration process. Furthermore, the fast simulation speed of the resulting models allows their implementation into real-time simulation environments, such as Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) systems, and thus enables a model-based calibration of the related ECU software function. However, generating appropriate data for learning dynamic models, i. e., the transient Design of Experiments (DoE), is not straightforward, since system boundaries and <b>permissible</b> excitation <b>frequencies</b> are not known beforehand. Thus the training data of the system measurement will be inconsistent and the main challenge of the identification process is to deal with this data to achieve a globally valid model. Furthermore, when dealing with dynamic systems in an automotive context, the Engine Control Unit typically changes operating modes while driving. Thus nonlinearities and changes of physical structures appear, which need to be considered in the model. In this thesis, a modelling system called the Local Gaussian Process Regression (LGPR), is used and adapted in order to receive a flexible modelling approach, which allows an iterative modelling process and obtains robust and globally valid dynamic models. The adapted LGPR approach is employed for the ECU calibration of dynamical automotive systems, which is critical regarding system excitation. Using LGPR, it is possible to measure the system iteratively while exploring the relevant state-space regions and improving the quality of the model step by step. The results show that LGPR is beneficial for iterative modelling of dynamical systems. Compared to the traditional Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) modelling approach, LGPR yields better results regarding the variable system dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the impact of}} non-identical resistive and capacitive elements of high-voltage arm of mixed voltage divider on its frequency characteristics. The authors emphasized the general features and substantiated main shortcomings of existing methods of calculating the characteristics of high-voltage dividers. The analytical expressions received for influence study of non-identical elements of a high-voltage divider at extreme discrete distribution of these elements. Feature of the received analytical expressions {{is that they are}} valid for any values of not identity as for resistive, and capacitive elements, and also their cumulative action. It is shown that the selected discrete distribution of resistive and capacitive elements influence of their not identity on fluctuations of amplitude frequency response and the phase-frequency characteristic of a voltage divider increases more than five times in relation to "triangular" distribution of parameters of elements in case of equal values of their maximum deviations (from mean values). The maximum influence of not identity of resistive and capacitive elements of a high-voltage arm on its frequency characteristics was studied. The influence becomes significant at its extreme discrete distribution and can be considered as the worst case of influence of not identity of the components of a high-voltage arm of a voltage divider. The results received in the article are recommended for assessment "from above" of influence of not identity of resistive and capacitive elements of a high-voltage divider on his frequency characteristics that allows to define possible values of not identity of elements of a high-voltage arm depending on <b>permissible</b> instability of <b>frequency</b> characteristics of the voltage divider. ? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ????????? ??????????????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ??? ????????? ??????????????. ???????? ????????????? ????????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ????????????? ???? ?????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?? ?????????????? ?? ????????? ????????? ??????????-????????? ?????????????? ? ????-????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ????? ??? ? ???? ??? ?? ????????? ? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????????? ????????? ??? ?????? ????????? ?? ???????????? ??????????

40|$|Feeding {{electrical}} motors by long cables using PWM inverters {{has become}} lately problematic due to developments in semiconductor technology. Most used in converters, insulated gate bipolar transistors IGBTs switch voltages with high gradients, about 10 kV/μs. On one hand, faster switching transients {{lead to the}} reduction of switching losses and therefore, <b>permissible</b> higher switching <b>frequencies,</b> reduction of harmonics and audible noise at motors. On the other hand, bigger voltage gradients combined with long feeders lead to high frequency parasitic effects, like overvoltage at motor terminals leading to insulation stress, high common mode (CM) ground current, bearing currents, etc. Up-to-date several approaches {{have been made to}} overcome these problems. The most common solution is the use of filter between inverter and motor. But it increases the size, weight and cost of the inverter. This thesis investigates an alternative solution to high frequency parasitic effects in electrical drives with long cables. Quasi-resonant DC-link (QRDCL) converter topologies can be used in electric drives with long cables to reduce the parasitic effects. In a QRDCL converter, the slope of the output voltage can be reduced by means of resonant operation. A resonant cycle can be initiated at any time using auxiliary switches (therefore, the name quasi-resonant) making it suitable for PWM operation. A resonant cycle produces a zero voltage interval, and it {{can be used as a}} zero vector state in a PWM modulation. Further, by separating the DC-link during resonant operation (used as a zero voltage vector) the common mode voltage is reduced from its peak values (±Vdc/ 2) to zero, determining the important reduction of bearing currents. The thesis concentrates on motor-friendly and high efficient design of a QRDCL converter and its control implementation on FPGA. A 30 m long cable connected between inverter and motor produces the voltage reflections and causes high frequency noises in motor. For allowed 20...|$|R
