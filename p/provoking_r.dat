5000|$|Anani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist {{who lived}} in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a {{contemporary}} of R. Ammi. He rarely discussed Halakot, and his discussions of them were not original (Shab. 64b). Once he recited a Halakah in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which <b>provoked</b> <b>R.</b> Ammi to ask: [...] "Is it his own? It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah" [...] (M. Ḳ. 24b). In the Haggadah, he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original. Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (Ex. xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices. He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, [...] "That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high"; and similarly {{with the rest of the}} priestly garments (Zeb. 88b; [...] 'Ar. 16a; compare Yer. Yoma, vii. 44b; Lev. R. x.). Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush (Ex. iii. 2-4) he remarks, [...] "The Holy One—blessed be He!—said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says viii. 3, 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree xviii. 4; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written xxiii. 24, 'Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said xxxviii. 1, xl. 6, [...] "The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind"" [...] (Ex. R. iii., where the interpretation is somewhat forced).|$|R

40|$|Rhodococcus fascians can {{interact}} with many plant species and induce {{the formation of}} either leafy galls or fasciations. To <b>provoke</b> symptoms, <b>R.</b> fascians strain D 188 requires pathogenicity genes that are located on a linear plasmid, pFiD 188. The fas genes are essential for virulence and constitute an operon that encodes, among other functions, a cytokinin synthase gene, Expression of the fas genes is induced by extracts of infected plant tissue only. We have isolated an AraC-type regulatory gene,fasR, located on pFiD 188, which is indispensable for pathogenesis and for fas gene expression The combined results of our experiments show that in vitro expression of the fas genes in a defined medium is strictly regulated and that several environmental factors (PH, carbon and nitrogen sources, phosphate and oxygen content, and cell density) and regulatory proteins are involved, We further show that expression of the fas genes is controlled at both the transcriptional and the translational levers. The complex expression pattern probably reflects the necessity of integrating a multitude of signals and underlines {{the importance of the}} fas operon in the pathogenicity of R. fascians. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|When Austria re-established {{itself as}} an {{independent}} nation on 27 April 1945, the party leaders forming the provisional government decided not to frame a new constitution, reverting instead to that of 1920, as amended in 1929. Even though this revision was still somewhat controversial at that point, {{it was part of}} Austria's most recent constitutional framework, giving it at least some much-needed form of democratic legitimacy, and the party chairs were afraid that lengthy discussion might <b>provoke</b> the <b>Red</b> Army then in control of Vienna to barge in. The constitution thus reenacted effective 1 May therefore still included the provision calling for a president elected by popular vote. Following the November 1945 National Council elections, however, the National Assembly temporarily suspended this provision and installed Karl Renner as the President of Austria as of 20 December. The suspension in question seems to have been motivated mainly by lack of cash: no attempt was ever made to prolong it, and the benign septuagenarian Renner had been the universally respected provisional head of state anyway. Starting with the 1951 election of Renner's successor Theodor Körner, all presidents have in fact been elected by the people.|$|R
40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} 2 (IGF- 2) is {{important}} for normal development and growth of an organism. In humans it is encoded by 11 p 15. 5 paternally expressed imprinted gene.

Ligand binding to IGF- 1 <b>R</b> <b>provokes</b> mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects. IGF- 2 R/M 6 P has tumor suppressor function; it mediates IGF- 2 degradation. When the IGF- 2 gene/protein is overexpressed, mostly as a consequence of loss of heterozygosity resulting in paternal allele duplication (LOH) or by loss of imprinting (LOI), it is involved in the development and progression of many tumors and overgrowth syndromes by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} Newman's treatment of early Church heresies and his contemporary situation in the period up to 1845. Part I traces his view of heresy from the early Trinitarianism of its evangelical period and snows now It became a rhetorical tool in his defence of the Established Church, 1828 - 31, culminating in The Arians of the Fourth Century. His continuing use of analogies between Arianlsm and contemporary controversy is traced between 1832 and 1837, before {{an examination of the}} relation between rhetoric and politics in the years of Emancipation, Repeal and Reform (1829 - 32), and in the changed situation after 1832. Part II illustrates the use Newman made of his study of Sabellianism and Apollinarianism Ian Ism to describe 'liberalism', which he argued to be a heresy developing into an underlying Infidelity. His rhetoric was <b>provoked</b> by <b>R.</b> D. Hampden's view of Tests, and influenced by the example of his friend Blanco White's embracing of Unitarian ism in 1835. Newman's consideration, under the category 'Sabetlian', of a variety of systematic theologians arose out of a need to universalize Oxford controversies into an argument about 'rationalism' (Tract 73). He extended his critique both to aspects of Nicholas Wiseman's Roman Catholic apologetic, and, in his strictures upon H. H. Milman, to liberal Anglican historiography. Part III shows Newman's own past-present analogies turning Inwards upon himself in a parallel between his "Via Media' and Monophysltism. The relation of this analogy to his later reminiscences and to the revolution in his concept of orthodoxy and heresy in The Essay on Development, is considered. The modification of his general understanding of heresy, in the light of his new-found idea of development, is then related to his rhetorical use of specific heresies. The Conclusion assesses more theoretically the implications of Newman's rhetorlclzation of Antiquity and considers If there Is a fundamental coherence to his heresiology during the Anglican period...|$|R
40|$|Engagement of {{the cell}} surface {{receptor}} for interleukin 7 (IL- 7 <b>R)</b> <b>provokes</b> protein tyrosine phosphorylation, although the receptor lacks a kinase catalytic domain in its cytoplasmic tail. The molecular basis of this response is not known. Here we report that the IL- 7 R functions by recruiting p 59 fyn, an intracellular tyrosine kinase of the src family. Treatment of pre-B cells with IL- 7 causes an enhancement of the catalytic activity of p 59 fyn, but not of the related kinase p 62 yes. IL- 7 -dependent stimulation of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, a tyrosine kinase substrate, provides further evidence suggestive of p 59 fyn activation. We demonstrate that p 59 fyn forms part of a protein complex with the IL- 7 R. A chimeric receptor comprising the CD 8 extracellular domain and the IL- 7 R cytoplasmic tail (CD 8 /IL- 7 R) recruits tyrosine kinase activity in transfected myeloma cells, and p 59 fyn can be detected in association with it by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Conversely, p 59 fyn immunoprecipitates contain the phosphorylated CD 8 /IL- 7 R. We have identified {{a segment of the}} IL- 7 R cytoplasmic tail which mediates p 59 fyn recruitment: a truncated CD 8 /IL- 7 R containing only this segment recruits tyrosine kinase activity, associates with p 59 fyn, and activates phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. Interestingly, this segment contains no tyrosine residues, although it is the phosphotyrosine-binding src homology domains of p 59 fyn and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase which mediate their association with many growth factor receptors. Thus our results suggest that an unusual interaction links IL- 7 R to these two important signaling pathways...|$|R
40|$|Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) is a {{plant with}} known ethnomedicinal {{properties}} {{and its use}} in Ayurvedic medicine in India is well documented. The present investigation reports on immunomodulatory efficacy of aqueous-ethanol extracts of roots of three selected Withania somnifera chemotypes designated as NMITLI 101 R, NMITLI 118 R and NMITLI 128 R. Each chemotype was administered 10 – 100 mg/kg orally to BALB/c mice once daily for 14 days. The immunomodulatory consequences were recorded by determining the humoral immune response {{with the help of}} hemagglutination, plaque forming cell assay and cellular response by measuring delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. Additionally, other immune parameters such as proliferation of T and B cells, intracellular and secreted Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines along with modulation in ROS production by peritoneal macrophages were monitored after feeding with lower doses (3 – 30 mg/kg/day) of these three chemotypes individually. NMITLI 101 R incited both humoral and cellular immune response in terms of higher number of antibody producing cells and enhanced foot pad swelling at the 10 mg dose as also dose dependent B and T cell proliferations. Levels of intracellular and secreted cytokines post-NMITLI 101 R treatment illustrated generation of mixed Th 1 /Th 2 response that remained more polarized towards Th 1. This chemotype also generated maximum reactive oxygen species. NMITLI 118 <b>R</b> <b>provoked</b> comparatively reduced immune response in all humoral and cellular parameters at lower doses but induced highly polarized Th 1 cytokine response. In contrast, NMITLI 128 R led to enhanced antibody production with minimal cellular response demonstrating marginally Th 2 dominance at a lower dose. Taken together, it may therefore be concluded that there were distinct modulation in the immune response exhibited by the three chemotypes of Withania somnifera and NMITLI 101 R appeared to possess a better immunostimulatory activity than the other chemotypes at lower doses...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new vibriosis in the European Atlantic coasts {{has been associated with}} mass mortalities of molluscs causing important economic losses. For example, Vibrio carchariae, a bacteria already isolated from shark, has been associated with a severe Haliotis epizooty in hatchery. In oysters, Crassostrea gigas, a strain closely related to Vibrio splendidus is suspected to be associated with summer mortalities. Some other pathogenic vibrios have been also isolated a few years ago: Vibrio tapetis which <b>provokes</b> the Brown <b>Ring</b> Disease in the Manila clams Ruditapes philippinarum; Vibrio splendidus which induces conchyoline deposit in Pecten maximus; and also Vibrio pectenicida which causes larval scallop mortalities in hatchery. The list is not exhaustive. Several tools have been developed to detect these pathogenic vibrios. They include serological procedures using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and ELISA tests, biochemical criteria and molecular methods based on the 16 S or 23 S rRNA nucleic acid probes hybridization. Molecular identification of V. tapetis and V. pectenicida has been recently done by dot blot hybridation using specific 16 S rDNA probes and a SSP-PCR protocol method has allowed V. tapetis detection in individual diseased and asymptomatic clams. This last method suggests a potential utilization in commercial hatcheries to confirm V. tapetis free water and clams. If the virulence factors of fish pathogenic vibrios have been yet identified, little knowledge exist in mollusc pathogenic vibrios. Bivalve pathogenic vibrios are host specific, excepted V. splendidus which presents various variants depending on the host species. In this last vibrio, V. splendidus, some common mechanism mediated by molecular factors could be suspected. The interactions of the vibrios with the clam's tissus or hemocytes have been used to developed in vitro biotests to evaluate their pathogenicity. Accordind to these tests, in V. tapetis, adherence and hemocyte lysis factors have been yet identified. With this test, a toxin from Vibrio pectenicida, responsible of hemocyte lysis, was partially purified. It was a small molecule (< 3 Kdal), no-proteinic different to cilio-static toxin described by Nottage and Birkbeck. This molecule is probably common at different pathogenic vibrios. In bacteria, virulence factors are generally carried by plasmids. Two or three plasmids have been yet detected in V. tapetis, but the role of these plamids in pathogenicity is still not demonstrated. In conclusion, studies of these interaction models, vibrio-bivalve, allow to develop original comparative researchs, in particular characterisation of adherence factors and toxins in vibrios but also characterisation of the immune defence mechanisms against vibrios, in particular identification of anti-bacterial substances.
