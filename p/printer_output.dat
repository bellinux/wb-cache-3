40|$|A {{potential}} characterization {{tool for}} printer quality {{is the power}} spectral density (PSD) analysis of flat-field <b>printer</b> <b>outputs.</b> This thesis explains {{the relationship between the}} PSD and characteristics of printer defects using examples of scanned <b>printer</b> <b>outputs.</b> In addition, a protocol is also presented for scanning flat fields and performing a PSD analysis. The protocol considers sampling and windowing issues to best focus on defects or quality issues of interest. The main objective of this work is to determine the interactive relationships of print defect patterns such as graininess, streaking, and banding under flat-field hardcopy outputs. The additive and multiplicative models are considered for describing the interaction between printer defects. Simulated print defect patterns and metrics base on the PSD are used to demonstrate the patterns generated by multiplicative and additive processes. These results are compared the PSD of actual flat-field prints from digital printers to draw conclusion concerning actual artifact interaction. For all defects examined the additive model is shown to be a good model of the interactions between printer defects...|$|R

50|$|It {{features}} {{two main}} command modes; assembler and editor, and includes an auto line-numbering facility, and various subroutines for use within the user's programs, {{as well as}} <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> and basic assembler features such as labels and expressions.|$|E
5000|$|... are {{the pieces}} of {{hardware}} used by a human (or other system) to communicate with a computer. For instance, a keyboard or computer mouse is an input device for a computer, while monitors and <b>printers</b> are <b>output</b> devices. Devices for communication between computers, such as modems and network cards, typically perform both input and output operations.|$|R
50|$|An inkjet {{printable}} DVD is a DVD {{made with}} an inkjet ink permeable coating on the upper, non-recording {{surface of the}} DVD which allow consumers to perform printings onto them directly by using a special CD/DVD inkjet printer. Inkjet printable DVD media offer a way to customize DVD-Rs. When inserted into a suitable inkjet printer, it will be capable of reproducing appropriate inkjet <b>printer</b> page <b>output,</b> including text and pictures.|$|R
50|$|The only input was a {{paper tape}} reader {{and the only}} outputs were the console printer and paper tape punch. As the paper tape punch was much faster than the <b>printer,</b> most <b>output</b> was punched, and then listed on an {{off-line}} printer. This Iowa State machine {{should not be confused}} with the Atanasoff-Berry Computer of the late 1930s- Neither John Vincent Atanasoff nor Clifford Berry worked on this machine.|$|R
50|$|ASA {{carriage}} control characters are still used for <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> from mainframe applications and software today, {{and are not}} limited to seasoned software or applications dating from the days of the line printer. ASA {{carriage control}} characters are interpreted by other software before being printed on modern computer printers.|$|E
50|$|Beyond this, {{there are}} no {{system-wide}} printer-specific drivers for use at application level under MS-DOS/PC DOS. Under DR-DOS, however, the SCRIPT command can be loaded {{to run in the}} background in order to intercept and convert <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> from applications into PostScript to support PS-capable printers also by applications not supporting them directly.|$|E
50|$|Early word-processing {{programs}} whose on-screen representations look {{nothing like}} their <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> could be reactive. The common example was WordStar on CP/M. On-screen, {{it looked like}} a markup language in a character cell display, but it had deep built-in help which was always available from an on-screen menu bar, and the effect of each keystroke was obvious.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{specialty}} {{application for}} inkjets is producing prepress color proofs for printing jobs created digitally. Such printers {{are designed to}} give accurate color rendition of how the final image will look (a [...] "proof") when the job is finally produced on a large volume press such as a four-colour offset lithography press. An example is an Iris <b>printer,</b> whose <b>output</b> is what the French term Giclée was coined for.|$|R
40|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{in the evaluation}} of secondary and tertiary structures of nucleic acids is the lack of convenient methods for their construction and representation. As a first step in a study of the symbolic representation of biopolymers, we report the development of a structure editor written in Pascal, permit-ting model construction on the screen of a personal computer. The program calculates energies for helical regions, allows user-defined helices and displays the secondary structure of a nucleic acid based on a user-selected set of helices. Screen and <b>printer</b> <b>outputs</b> can be {{in the form of a}} backbone or the letters of the primary sequence. The molecule can then be displayed in a format which simulates its three-dimensional structure. Using appropriate glasses, the molecule can be viewed on the screen in three dimensions. Other options include the manipu-lation of helices and single-stranded regions which results in changes in the spatial relationship between different regions of the molecule. The editor requires an IBM or compatible PC, 640 kbyte memory and a medium or high resolution graphics card...|$|R
50|$|The tonal {{range of}} the final image depends on the {{characteristics}} of the display medium. Monitor contrast can vary significantly, depending on the type (CRT, LCD, etc.), model, and calibration (or lack thereof). A computer <b>printer’s</b> tonal <b>output</b> depends on the number of inks used and the paper on which it is printed. Similarly, the density range of a traditional photographic print depends on the processes used as well as the paper characteristics.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes a <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> line {{transistor}} would fail, {{resulting in}} a blank print position. If you knew your way around inside the 1130, {{it was possible to}} swap circuit cards so as to move the bad print position to near the right end of the printed line. This kept the 1130 usable until the repair person showed up.|$|E
50|$|The University of Alberta {{developed}} a Student Oriented Batch Facility in 1971 to provide quick job turnaround for undergrad students learning to program in FORTRAN, ALGOL, PL/C, and 360 Assembler. It was a dedicated punch card input, <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> system that provided 5 minute {{turn around and}} ran several thousands of jobs {{a week at a}} fixed cost per job (15 cents).|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure that}} ‘sell by dates’ are accurate, most autocoding systems {{directly}} control the line printers through the software application. Once the operator has selected {{the product to}} run, the product reference table identifies the date range to use and the <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> is sent directly to the printer. Again, like the bar code scanners, autocoding systems include two-way communications with date code printers, and prevent the production lines from starting if links are not available.|$|E
25|$|The printer's {{primary purpose}} is to produce {{stereotype}} plates for use in printing presses, which it does by pressing type into soft plaster to create a flong. Babbage intended that the Engine's results be conveyed directly to mass printing, having recognized that many errors in previous tables were {{not the result of}} human calculating mistakes but from error in the manual typesetting process. The <b>printer's</b> paper <b>output</b> is mainly a means of checking the Engine's performance.|$|R
40|$|Digital halftoning is a {{technique}} to convert a continuous-tone image into a binary image consisting {{of black and white}} dots. It is an important technique for printing machines and <b>printers</b> to <b>output</b> an image with few intensity levels or colors which looks similar to an input image. The purposes of this paper are to reveal {{that there are a number}} of problems related to combinatorial and computational geometry and to present some solutions or clues to those problems...|$|R

5000|$|Teletype Corporation, of Skokie, Illinois, made page {{printers}} for text, notably {{for news}} wire services and telegrams, but these used standards {{different from those}} for deaf communication, and although in quite widespread use, were technically incompatible. Furthermore, these were sometimes referred to by the [...] "TTY" [...] initialism, short for [...] "Teletype". When computers had keyboard input mechanisms and page <b>printer</b> <b>output,</b> before CRT terminals came into use, Teletypes were {{the most widely used}} devices. They were called [...] "console typewriters". (Telex used similar equipment, but was a separate international communication network.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{system is}} {{administered}} through {{an assortment of}} teletypewriter [...] "Channels", also called the system console, such as the TEST channel and Maintenance channel. Typically provisioning is done either through a command line interface (CLI) called RCV:APPTEXT, or through the menu-driven RCV:MENU,APPRC program. RCV stands for Recent Change/Verification, and can be accessed through Switching Control Center System. Most service orders, however, are administered through Recent Change Memory Administration Center (RCMAC). In the international market, this terminal interface has localization to provide locale specific language and command name variations {{on the screen and}} <b>printer</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} {{variations}} of display code, notably the 63-character character set, and the 64-character character set. There were also 'CDC graphic' and 'ASCII graphic' variants {{of both the}} 63- and 64-character sets. The choice between 63- or 64-character character set, and between CDC or ASCII graphic was site-selectable. Generally, early CDC customers started out with the 63-character character set, and CDC graphic print trains on their line printers. As time-sharing became prevalent, almost all sites used the ASCII variant - so that line <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> would match interactive usage. Later CDC customers {{were also more likely}} to use the 64-character character set.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel 2 x 1 D phase correlation based image registration method for verification of <b>printer</b> emulator <b>output.</b> The method combines the basic phase correlation technique and a modified 2 x 1 D {{version of it}} to achieve both high speed and high accuracy. The proposed method has been implemented and tested using images generated by printer emulators. Over 97 % of the image pairs were registered correctly, accurately dealing with diverse images with large translations and image cropping...|$|R

It resides in gdi.exe on 16-bit Windows, and gdi32.dll on 32-bit Windows in user-mode. Kernel-mode GDI support {{is provided by}} win32k.sys which communicates directly with the graphics driver.|$|R
40|$|After {{customizing}} an Epson Stylus Photo 1200 {{by adding}} a continuous-feed ink system and a cyan, magenta, yellow, black, orange and green ink set, a series of research tasks were carried out to build a full spectral model of the <b>printers</b> <b>output.</b> First, various forward printer models were tested using the fifteen two color combinations of the printer. Yule- Nielsen-spectral-Neugebauer (YNSN) {{was selected as the}} forward model and its accuracy tested throughout the colorant space. It was found to be highly accurate, performing as well as a more complex local, cellular version. Next, the performance of nonlinear optimization-routine algorithms were evaluated for their ability to efficiently invert the YNSN model. A quasi-Newton based algorithm designed by Davidon, Fletcher and Powell (DFP) was found to give the best performance when combined with starting values produced from the non-negative least squares fit of single-constant Kubelka- Munk. The accuracy of the inverse model was tested and different optimization objective functions were evaluated. A multistage objective function based on minimizing spectral RMS error and then colorimetric error was found to give highly accurate matches with low metameric potential. Finally, the relationship between the number of printing inks and the ability to eliminate metamerism was explored...|$|R
5000|$|Another project, {{apparently}} unrelated at first, {{attempted to}} address {{problems with the}} conversion from QuickDraw into various <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> formats. Whereas developers had earlier been forced to write their own code to convert their QuickDraw on-screen display to PostScript for printing, under the new printer architecture such conversions would be provided by the OS. Additionally the new system was deliberately engineered to be as flexible as possible, supporting not only QD and PS printers, but potentially other standards such as Hewlett Packard's PCL as well. The system also supported [...] "desktop printers" [...] (printers that appeared as icons on the user's desktop), a long sought-after feature missing from QD, and added improved printing dialogs and controls.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the first}} {{minicomputers}} were being released, most manufacturers {{turned to the}} existing mass-produced ASCII teleprinters (primarily the Teletype Model 33, capable of ten ASCII characters per second throughput) as a low-cost solution for keyboard input and <b>printer</b> <b>output.</b> The commonly specified Model 33 ASR included a paper tape punch/reader, where ASR stands for [...] "Automatic Send/Receive" [...] {{as opposed to the}} punchless/readerless KSR - Keyboard Send/Receive and RO - Receive Only models. As a side effect, punched tape became a popular medium for low cost minicomputer data and program storage, and it was common to find a selection of tapes containing useful programs in most minicomputer installations. Faster optical readers were also common.|$|E
5000|$|DEC {{operating}} systems (OS/8, RT-11, RSX-11, RSTS, TOPS-10, etc.) used both characters {{to mark the}} end of a line so that the console device (originally Teletype machines) would work. By the time so-called [...] "glass TTYs" [...] (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When Gary Kildall created CP/M he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in DEC's RT-11. Until the introduction of PC DOS in 1981, IBM had no hand in this because their 1970s {{operating systems}} used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line <b>printer</b> <b>output</b> on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's PC DOS (also marketed as MS-DOS by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of CP/M, and Windows inherited it from MS-DOS.|$|E
25|$|The Integrated Computing Network (ICN) is a multi-security level network at the LANL {{integrating}} large host supercomputers, a file server, a batch server, a <b>printer</b> {{and graphics}} <b>output</b> server {{and numerous other}} general purpose and specialized systems. IBM Roadrunner, {{which was part of}} this network, was the first supercomputer to hit petaflop speeds.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} notable {{features}} of AFP <b>printers</b> is that <b>output</b> data can be placed at any addressable point on a page. This capability is called all points addressability (APA). APA gives AFP applications the freedom to create output anywhere on a page, {{as opposed to being}} limited to just line and character positions.|$|R
50|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{did not have}} Ethernet hardware included in their design and bus adapters were initially expensive. A solution to was to use the, at the time, standard parallel port, typically used for connection to a <b>printer</b> or similar <b>output</b> device. The ports on two computers are connected with a so-called null-printer cable, sometimes called a LapLink cable.|$|R
