40|$|A key {{property}} of human visual behavior {{is the very}} frequent movement of our eyes to potentially relevant information in the environment. Observers thus continuously have to prioritize information for directing their eyes to. Research in this field has been hampered {{by a lack of}} appropriate measures and tools. Here, we propose and validate a novel measure of priority that takes advantage of the variability in the natural viewing behavior of individual observers. In short, our measure assumes that priority is low when observers' gaze behavior is inconsistent and high when it is very consistent. We calculated priority for gaze data obtained during an experiment in which participants viewed dynamic natural scenes while we simultaneously recorded their gaze position and brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> shows only limited correlation with various saliency, surprise, and motion measures, indicating it is assessing a distinct {{property of}} visual behavior. Finally, we correlated our <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> with the BOLD signal, thereby revealing activity in a select number of human occipital and parietal areas. This suggests the presence of a cortical network involved in computing and representing viewing priority. We conclude that our new analysis method allows for empirically establishing the priority of events in near-natural vision paradigms...|$|E

This report presents the results from a pre-study, investigating the potential that dynamic bus lanes could have as a <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> for public transport in a Swedish context. Knowledge of situations in which dynamic bus lanes have the highest potential, and their implementation requirements is scarce. It is moreover uncertain how they would affect traffic safety, level of service, user experience, travel time and delays for other vehicles. A workshop was conducted within this pre-study {{in order to further}} investigate plausible user experiences. The results indicate that: bus drivers’ stress levels could be reduced the relative attractiveness of travelling by bus might rise that motorists probably would experience the introduction of dynamic bus lanes as neither good nor bad, as long as the system is fairly intuitive Technical solutions for implementing dynamic bus lanes exist. A dynamic bus lane system would require development of a system control unit and integration with bus sensors, sensors for traffic flow measurement, variable message signs (to inform road users of the current status of the dynamic bus lane) and traffic signals. The overall conclusion form the pre-study is that dynamic bus lanes could be a useful complementary <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> for public transport vehicles in Sweden, especially when dedicated bus lanes are not feasible or desirable.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Integrated approach for Material Planning and finite Operations Scheduling (IMPOS). The approach assumes {{the existence of}} a system that provides a relative <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> for customer orders, based on a predetermined set of factors including—but not limited to—due dates. Orders are sequenced on descending order of the priority measures to form the Master Production Sequence (MPS) list. Starting {{from the top of the}} MPS list, orders are planned one at a time, by determining their respective quantity requirements first. The next phase schedules the requirements by time allocation of the available finite resources to their operational requirements. The IMPOS approach attempts to reduce production lead times during its finite scheduling procedure through analysis of the details of each operation in conjunction with other associated operations and the ordering policy applied. Generating finite schedules quickly enables IMPOS to handle effectively the dynamic behaviour of the manufacturing environment. The approach is detailed and exemplified...|$|E
40|$|We {{consolidate}} an unorganized {{point cloud}} with noise, outliers, non-uniformities, {{and in particular}} interference between close-by surface sheets as a preprocess to surface generation, focusing on reliable normal estimation. Our algorithm includes two new developments. First, a weighted locally optimal projection operator produces a set of denoised, outlier-free and evenly distributed particles over the original dense point cloud, so as to improve the reliability of local PCA for initial estimate of normals. Next, an iterative framework for robust normal estimation is introduced, where a priority-driven normal propagation scheme based on a new <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> and an orientation-aware PCA work complementarily and iteratively to consolidate particle normals. The priority setting is reinforced with front stopping at thin surface features and normal flipping to enable robust handling of the close-by surface sheet problem. We demonstrate how a point cloud that is wellconsolidated by our method steers conventional surface generation schemes towards a proper interpretation of the input data. ...|$|E

Measurements on the O 2 K validate the simulation results {{for two of the}} policies.

30|$|The Draft Agricultural Land Protection and Land Use Bill of 2011 is a {{response}} towards the recent ineffective policy context. It aims to bring villages under prudent ‘zoning principle’ to stop any illegal captivation of agricultural land, as often the politically and financially powerful grabbers hold large ceiling of agricultural land for non-farm development. The bill demonstrates a strong determination to restrict the existing agricultural land only for cultivation under any circumstance. Under the resolution, all the ‘Khas’ lands must be retained for cultivation only. Existing landscape elements (i.e., hills, water sheds and woods, etc.) are advised to retain intact and non-convertible to other usages under any circumstances. Apart from the protection measures, the bill principally encourages the compact development strategies for the existing non-farm lands to ensure maximum utilization and minimum wastage of spaces. Acquisition of land for infrastructure is advised to keep the minimum. Most importantly, ‘vertical extension’ of rural dwelling spaces has been advised as a <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> for new built-forms conforming local development plan, rural characteristics, and the environment.|$|E

Author {{of this paper}} introduces a notion of predictable time-based obstacles. The algorithm proposed in the paper defines a centralized obstacle-map that is shared among multiple agents (robots) performing path planning. Each robot plans its path individually on an obstacle-map using a slightly modified version of D * Lite and then shares {{an updated version of}} the map, which includes its planned path as a new obstacle, with its peers. The planned paths appear as temporary time-based obstacles to peer robots. Planned paths are divided into discrete temporal sections so as to help peer robots optimize paths temporally. The proposed algorithm also presents a <b>priority</b> <b>measure</b> which helps us decide the optimized sequence of individual pathplanning order followed by cooperating robots. Since the implemented algorithm is tested in simulation using Mobile robot Programming Toolkit, the Real–time performance analysis is done to confirm the real-time execution time of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we present a robust and effective multi-view dense matching algorithm for high-resolution aerial images based on a graph network. The overlap ratio and intersection angle between image pairs are used to find candidate stereo pairs and build the graph network. A Coarse-to-Fine strategy based on an improved Semi-Global Matching algorithm is applied for disparity computation across stereo pairs. Based on the constructed graph, point clouds of base views are generated by triangulating all connected image nodes, followed by a fusion process with the average reprojection error as a <b>priority</b> <b>measure.</b> The proposed method was successfully applied in experiments on aerial image test dataset provided by the ISPRS of Vaihingen, Germany and an oblique nadir image block of Zürich, Switzerland, using three kinds of matching configurations.

The results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers matches at higher completeness, efficiency, and accuracy than the other methods tested; the RMS for average reprojection error reached the sub pixel level and the actual positioning deviation was better than 1. 5 GSD...|$|E
40|$|The # 98 B-Line rapid {{bus service}} was planned to provide fast, reliable, and {{frequent}} bus service to connect Downtown Vancouver and Richmond City Center – a fast growing suburban business corridor.

While {{they find a}} large number of actual defects, they are often plagued by high rates of alerts that a developer would not act on (unactionable alerts) be-cause they are incorrect, do not significantly affect program execution, etc. High rates of unactionable alerts decrease the utility of static analysis tools in practice. We present a method for differentiating actionable and unactionable alerts by finding alerts with similar code pat-terns. To do so, we create a feature vector based on code characteristics at the site of each SA alert. With these fea-ture vectors, we use machine learning techniques to build an actionable alert prediction model that is able to classify new SA alerts. We evaluate our technique on three subject programs us-ing the FindBugs static analysis tool and the Faultbench benchmark methodology. For a developer inspecting the top 5 % of all alerts for three sample projects, our approach is able to identify 57 of 211 actionable alerts, which is 38 more than the FindBugs <b>priority</b> <b>measure.</b> Combined with pre-vious actionable alert identification techniques, our method finds 75 actionable alerts in the top 5 %, which is four more actionable alerts (a 6 % improvement) than previous action-able alert identification techniques...|$|E
