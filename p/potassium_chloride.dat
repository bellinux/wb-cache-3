5|$|Major {{potassium}} {{chemicals are}} potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium sulfate, and <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Megatons of these compounds are produced annually.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> after processing. The mineral industry refers to <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be {{hygroscopic}} to {{the extent}} that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably sodium and <b>potassium</b> hydroxides, magnesium <b>chloride,</b> calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, and sodium bromide. Sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorides</b> are slightly soluble in ethanol. Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most essential oils and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.|$|R
5|$|Lithium salts {{have to be}} {{extracted}} from the water of mineral springs, brine pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sodium occurs {{mostly in}} {{seawater}} and dried seabed, {{but is now}} produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°C {{through the use of}} a Downs cell. Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide. Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as sylvite (<b>potassium</b> <b>chloride).</b> Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> or potassium hydroxide, found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It can also be produced from seawater. However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide. As a result, pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> with sodium metal at 850°C.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes thorium is {{extracted}} by electrolysis of a fluoride {{in a mixture}} of sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> at 700–800°C in a graphite crucible. Highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and <b>potassium</b> <b>chlorides</b> also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the above mechanisms, the average adult with DKA has a total body water {{shortage}} of about 6liters (or 100mL/kg), in addition to substantial shortages in sodium, <b>potassium,</b> <b>chloride,</b> phosphate, magnesium and calcium. Glucose levels usually exceed 13.8mmol/L or 250mg/dL.|$|E
5|$|In {{the acute}} phase of an attack, {{administration}} of potassium will quickly restore muscle strength and prevent complications. However, caution is advised {{as the total}} amount of potassium in the body is not decreased, and it is possible for potassium levels to overshoot ("rebound hyperkalemia"); slow infusions of <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> are therefore recommended while other treatment is commenced.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{production}} has greatly increased {{since the end}} of World War II. The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals. The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55% lithium chloride and 45% <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> at about 450°C.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam {{acts as a}} {{sedative}} {{to render}} the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide and <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013. The usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug lethal injection cocktail using 100mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead {{of a heart attack}} 40 minutes after the execution began. An observing doctor stated that Lockett's vein had ruptured. It is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> were released before the execution was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} {{reactive}} nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal.

5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a cocktail of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> but this was blocked by a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride</b> and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and <b>potassium</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E

This “disengaging strategy” was successfully demonstrated in electro-reduction of solid oxides of zirconium and tantalum. It has led to significantly higher current efficiency (93 %), and lower energy consumption (1. 4 kWhkg− 1) in electrolysis of tantalum oxide to tantalum metal compared to the conventional electrolysis in molten calcium chloride (e. g. 78 % and 2. 4 kWh/kg-Ta) ...|$|R
