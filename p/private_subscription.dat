Marshall University and West Liberty University were both established in 1837, but as <b>private</b> <b>subscription</b> schools. Founded in 1867, West Virginia University is the state's largest public {{institution of higher}} learning in terms of enrollment, as it had 29,707 students as of spring 2013. Eastern West Virginia Community and Technical College is the state's smallest, with an enrollment of 822. With an enrollment of 1,549 students, Wheeling Jesuit University is West Virginia's largest traditional private post-secondary institution, while Valley College–Princeton is the state's smallest, with an enrollment of 72. The American Public University System, a private for-profit, distance education institution based in Charles Town, has the largest enrollment of any post-secondary institution in West Virginia, with 31,331 students.|$|E

25|$|The Royal College of Chemistry was {{established}} by <b>private</b> <b>subscription</b> in 1845 as there was a growing awareness that practical aspects of the experimental sciences were not well taught {{and that in the}} United Kingdom the teaching of chemistry in particular had fallen behind that in Germany. As a result of a movement earlier in the decade, many politicians donated funds to establish the college, including Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone and Robert Peel. It was also supported by Prince Albert, who persuaded August Wilhelm von Hofmann to be the first professor.|$|E

The landmark Old Main, which now serves as the primary administrative building for the university, was built on land known as Maple Grove, {{at the time the}} home of the Mount Hebron Church in what was then the state of Virginia. John Laidley, a local attorney, hosted the meeting which led to the founding of Marshall Academy, which was named after Laidley's friend, the eminent John Marshall who had served as the fourth Chief Justice of the United States from January 1801 to July 1835.|$|E
25|$|The History of Duke University {{began when}} Brown's Schoolhouse, a <b>private</b> <b>subscription</b> school in Randolph County, North Carolina (in the present-day town of Trinity), {{was founded in}} 1838. The school was renamed to Union Institute Academy in 1841, Normal College in 1851, and to Trinity College in 1859. Finally moving to Durham in 1892, the school grew rapidly, {{primarily}} due to the generosity of Washington Duke and Julian S. Carr, powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco industry. In 1924, Washington Duke's son, James B. Duke, established The Duke Endowment, a $40 million (about $430 million in 2005 dollars) trust fund, some of which {{was to go to}} Trinity College. The president thus renamed the school Duke University, as a memorial to Washington Duke and his family.|$|E

Public donations {{paid for the}} window itself, this officially opened by King George VI on 10 July 1947. Although not actually an 'official' memorial to the Battle of Britain {{in the sense that}} government paid for it, the window and chapel have since been viewed as such. During the late 1950s and 1960, various proposals were advanced for a national monument to the Battle of Britain, this also the focus of several letters in The Times. In 1960 the Conservative government decided against a further monument, taking the view that the credit should be shared more broadly than Fighter Command alone, and there was little public appetite for one. All subsequent memorials are the result of <b>private</b> <b>subscription</b> and initiative, as discussed below.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September 1779, {{a convoy}} of more than 50 ships, which had been trading with ports in the Baltic, had set sail from a {{rendezvous}} off the Norwegian coast {{at the mouth of}} the Skagerrak channel to cross the North Sea. Some ships left the convoy before Britain came in sight, heading for northern ports such as Leith and the River Tyne. When the Yorkshire coast was sighted early on 23 September, just over 40 remained, mostly carrying iron or timber (often in the form of planks and masts for ships), bound for ports all around the southern half of the British Isles, from Hull round to Bristol, and Waterford in Ireland. Although the Baltic convoy had received a warning from Scarborough that an enemy squadron was in the vicinity, some ships ignored the signals (by both flags and guns) from the 44-gun escort ship HMS Serapis to stay close for protection. Early in the afternoon, as they approached Flamborough Head, the lookouts of the foremost ships saw the danger in Bridlington Bay for themselves. Hastily tacking, they attempted to run for the safety of Scarborough. Serapis put on all sail to get between the fleeing merchant vessels and a potential attack from the Franco-American squadron, while the smaller Countess of Scarborough (a hired armed vessel built by <b>private</b> <b>subscription</b> and hired to the Admiralty for escort duty) shepherded the convoy. About 4pm, with the whole convoy to his north, and the squadron of strangers clearly in sight to the south, Captain Richard Pearson of the Serapis signalled the Countess of Scarborough to join him. As the squadron caught up, the Royal Navy vessels made sure to position themselves so that the presumed enemy could not easily sail round them to reach the slower merchant ships.|$|E

At the same time, Washington Duke gave the school $85,000 for an initial endowment and construction costs—later augmenting his generosity with three separate $100,000 contributions in 1896, 1899, and 1900—with the stipulation that the college [...] "open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men." ...|$|E
500|$|Opponents to {{the rule}} of the Puritans in Massachusetts were vocal in airing their {{complaints}} to the new king. Among their complaints was the fact that Charles' ascension to power had not been formally announced; this only took place in 1661 after Endecott received a chastising order from the king. This prompted the assembly to draft another of several laudatory letters it addressed to the king, congratulating him on his rise to power. The mint was claimed to be a bald-faced attempt to devalue good English currency, some colonists complained that the expansion of the colony's borders in 1652 {{was little more than a}} land grab, while others put forward claims of administrative malfeasance with respect to funds provided by the crown for the Christianization of Indians, and the Quakers cataloged a long list of grievances.

Later on, the stadium was renamed simply the Polo Field. In the mid 1930s, the City and County of San Francisco used PWA and WPA funds to renovate the polo field. In 1939, additional WPA funds were used to build polo sheds, replacing already-standing horse stables. Polo continued being played through the 1940s but by the 1950s polo stopped being played on the Polo Field because the sport had largely migrated to other bay area cities where land more suitable for polo was available.
