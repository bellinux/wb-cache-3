Despite differences in number of hauls for each net, the curves of cumulative species richness showed that additional hauls could not {{increase the number of}} species collected with {{the commercial}} net. The most abundant species from experimental net catches were Trachurus picturatus, which represented over 80 % of the specimens caught in spring and summer, Naucrates ductor, which represented about 50 % of autumn catches, both in terms of abundance and biomass, and Seriola dumerili, which represented 46 % and 21 % of the samples taken in summer and autumn respectively. Seriola dumerili was also frequent in commercial net catches, in which T. picturatus did not appear, while Coryphaena hippurus and N. ductor represented more than 85 % of both abundance and biomass. Large differences between the two types of net were also obtained in the mean fish weight and length frequency distributions of the catches by season. Fish caught with the experimental net ranged from 6 to 570 mm length, while fish collected from commercial hauls had a size range of 35 to 700 mm. The effectiveness of the experimental net in catching small fishes showed that it can be an optimal sampling method not only in the study of fish fauna associated with flotsam, but also in studies to catch early life stages...|$|E

Se determinó diferencia entre las curvas de profundidad de calado del cuerpo central de las redes (tc= 46, 670, t*= 1, 98, p= 0) la red experimental tuvo mayor profundidad de velado; entre las curvas de velocidad de caída del cuerpo central de las redes, hubo {{diferencia significativa}} (tc= 7, 790, t*= 1, 98, p = 0, 000), debido al mayor lastre y filtrado de las mallas de la red experimental. El coeficiente abertura horizontal (μ 1) de las mallas en la franja superior durante el máximo velado de la red y el gareteo fue en las mallas del cabecero o copo, parte central y ultimo cuerpo de la red, en promedio 0, 71; 0, 74 y 0, 73 respectivamente; (valores cercanos al coeficiente de armado ideal para el escape de ciertos peces fusiformes). El promedio de μ 1 obtenidos en la región de las mallas centrales en el cabecero, centro y ultimo cuerpo de la red fue 0, 85; 0, 85 y 0, 84 respectivamente; lo que indicó una mayor abertura horizontal de las mallas por encima del valor del coeficiente de armado que no permitiría el escape de los peces. Se concluyó que por la condición de las mallas de la red de cerco experimental (tamaño de malla 50 mm) no es óptima para gran parte de la estructura de la red, esto no permitiría la selectividad por tamaños. ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the use of}} mesh 50 mm (2 ”) in artisanal purse seiner of the Tumbes Region in a multispecies fishery was assessed. We worked with a control purse seiner of mesh size of 38 mm (1. 5 ”) and the experimental fishing net of 50 mm (2. 0 ”) with a percentage of hanging ratio of 0. 65 and 0. 77; respectively. Operational assessment of the purse seine was observed {{that there was a}} difference between the curves of setting depth of the central body of the net (tc = 46. 670, t* = 1. 98, p = 0), the experimental net had a more setting depth. Likewise between the curves drop speed of the central body of the purse seiners, {{there was a significant difference}} (tc = 7. 790, t* = 1. 98, p = 0) due to greater weight and filtering mesh of the experimental net. The horizontal opening (μ 1) of the meshes in the upper band for the maximum setting depth and <b>purse</b> <b>line</b> recovering, the meshes of cod end, middle part and last body of the net, was on average (μ 1) 0. 71, 0. 74 and 0. 73 respectively; (values close to the hanging coefficient ideal for escaping of fusiform fishes). The average (μ 1) obtained in the region of the central meshes in the cod end, middle part and last body of the net was 0. 85, 0. 85 and 0. 84 respectively; which indicated a greater horizontal opening of the mesh above the hanging coefficient would not allow the escape of fishes. It was concluded that the mesh condition of experimental net (mesh size 50 mm) is not optimal for large part of the net structure; this would not allow fish selectivity sizes.

The fact that the first group is constituted by CPUEs obtained from 3 different fishing gears (pole and <b>line,</b> <b>purse</b> seine and longline), operating at different depth levels, suggests that the regional trend reflects more a sub-population response to a local exploitation rate than to environmental conditions.
