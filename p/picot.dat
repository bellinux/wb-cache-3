5|$|Cambridge Castle was one {{of three}} castles built across the east of England in late 1068 by William the Conqueror in the {{aftermath}} of his northern campaign to capture York. Cambridge, or Grantabridge as it was then known, was on the old Roman route from London to York and was both strategically significant and at risk of rebellion. The initial building work was conducted by <b>Picot,</b> the high sheriff, who later founded a priory beside the castle. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design, within the existing town, and 27 houses had to be destroyed to make space for it.|$|E
5|$|Lamarche's Advance Guard counted 4,000 {{infantry}} and 1,000 cavalry. Auguste Marie Henri <b>Picot</b> de Dampierre led the Flankers of the Right, 2,000 {{infantry and}} 1,000 cavalry. Valence's Right Wing numbered 7,000 in 18 battalions and {{was divided into}} the divisions of Joachim Joseph Neuilly, Alexis Paul Michel Le Veneur and Valence. Duke Louis of Chartres led the Center which included 7,000 foot soldiers in 18 battalions and 1,000 horsemen. The subordinate generals of the Center were Jacques Thouvenot and Dominique Dietmann. Miranda's Left Wing {{was made up of}} Jean Alexandre Ihler's 7,000 men and Felix Marie Pierre Chesnon de Champmorin's 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. Joseph Miaczinski led the Flankers of the Left, 2,000 foot and 1,000 horse. Jean Nestor de Chancel commanded the eight battalion Reserve in the strength of 4,000 men. These figures total 38,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry.|$|E
25|$|A {{second meeting}} of the Nicolson {{committee}} with <b>Picot</b> took place on 21 December 1915 wherein <b>Picot</b> {{said that he had}} obtained permission to agree to the towns of Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damscus being included in the Arab dominions to be administered by the Arabs. Although the French had scaled back their demands to some extent, the British also claimed to want to include Lebanon in the future Arab State and this meeting also ended at an impasse.|$|E

25|$|The {{reforms were}} criticised for the {{influence}} of New Right ideas and their effect of introducing market mechanisms and notions of competition in the education system. Lange's appointment of businessman Brian <b>Picot</b> to head a task force into educational reform was taken {{as a sign of}} the government giving too much priority to economic and competitive concerns over the social aspect of education.|$|E
25|$|The French chose <b>Picot</b> as French High Commissioner for the {{soon to be}} {{occupied}} {{territory of}} Syria and Palestine. The British appointed Sykes as Chief Political Officer to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while pressing for a British Palestine. First Sykes in early May and then <b>Picot</b> and Sykes together visited the Hejaz later in May to discuss the agreement with Faisal and Hussein. Hussein was persuaded {{to agree to a}} formula to the effect that the French would pursue the same policy in Syria as the British in Baghdad; since Hussein believed that Baghdad would be part of the Arab State, that had eventually satisfied him. Later reports from participants expressed doubts about the precise nature of the discussions {{and the degree to which}} Hussein had really been informed as to the terms of Sykes–Picot.|$|E

40|$|Warp-knitted lace strip, {{material}} fabric, {{and manufacturing}} method thereof This invention {{is concerned with}} a new textile product {{in the form of}} a lace strip which is entirely warp-knitted with sinuate scallops. The scallops are manufactured from bent scallop-forming yarns and <b>picots</b> of which one end protrudes outwardly in a U-shape configuration. The novel lace strips are manufactured by forming chain stitch lines in step-like indentation by overlapping the scallop-forming yarns and passing the yarns in turn through a plurality of needles. Simultaneously picot-forming yarns are transversely positioned to produce protrusions from the scallops. In order to separate the scallops and their <b>picots,</b> the parts of the knitted fabric to be readily separated, said scallops and attached <b>picots</b> are knitted to soluble yarns which are subsequently dissolved to facilitate separation...|$|R
25|$|When the {{possibility}} of a British invasion of Palestine was first raised, it became necessary to reach an understanding with France, which also had an interest in Palestine and Syria. As early as 16 May 1916 Sir Mark Sykes, who had studied the political problems of Mesopotamia and Syria, had agreed with M. <b>Picot,</b> formerly a French Consul at Beirut, that Britain would occupy Palestine and France would occupy Syria. They also agreed that an all-arms French contingent would be attached to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force.|$|E
25|$|In February 1916, {{before the}} {{campaign}} ended, Britain and France agreed to divide Kamerun along the <b>Picot</b> Provisional Partition Line. This resulted in Britain obtaining approximately one {{fifth of the}} colony situated on the Nigerian border. France gained Duala {{and most of the}} central plateau, which consisted of the majority of former German territory. The partition was accepted at the Paris Peace Conference and the former German colony became the League of Nations mandates of French Cameroon and British Cameroon by the Treaty of Versailles.|$|E
25|$|Later, in February and March, Sykes and <b>Picot,</b> {{acted as}} advisors to Sir George Buchanan and the French {{ambassador}} respectively, during negotiations with Sazonov. Eventually, Russia having agreed (for a price, as it obtained {{large portions of}} Ottoman territory in the bargain, including Constantinople and the Straits) on 26 April 1916, the final terms were sent by Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Edward Grey, on 9 May 1916, and ratified in Grey's reply on 16 May 1916.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{approach is}} to bind off, possibly with decorative elements such as <b>picots.</b> This approach adds no extra thickness at the hemline (which is sometimes desirable).|$|R
50|$|This style, now {{described}} as Bedfordshire or Beds lace, often has a plaited headside known as nine pin. Plaits, sometimes with <b>picots,</b> and tallies are common. There are flowing lines, called cloth trails.|$|R
50|$|In older tatting and {{crocheting}} patterns, <b>picots</b> {{were sometimes}} specified as purls, purl stitches, or pearl stitches. These specifications {{are not to}} be confused with the reverse stitch known as a purl in knitting.|$|R
25|$|M. <b>Picot</b> may inform his {{government}} that {{the acceptance of}} the whole project would entail the abdication of considerable British interests, but provided that the cooperation of the Arabs is secured, and that the Arabs fulfil the conditions and obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus and Aleppo, the British Government would not object to the arrangement. But, as the Blue Area extends so far Eastwards, and affects Russian interests, it would be absolutely essential that, before anything was concluded, the consent of Russia was obtained.|$|E
25|$|In April and May, {{there were}} discussions {{initiated}} by Sykes {{as to the}} merits of a meeting to include <b>Picot</b> and the Arabs to mesh the desiderata of both sides. At the same time, logistics {{in relation to the}} promised revolt were being dealt with and there was a rising level of impatience for action to be taken by Hussein. Finally, at the end of April, McMahon was advised of the terms of Sykes-Picot and he and Grey agreed that these would not be disclosed to the Arabs.|$|E
25|$|In {{painting}} and drawing, Conrad figures {{in a small}} contemporary manuscript sketch of his ship sailing to Tyre in the Annals of Genoa, and various illustrations to Scott's The Talisman. There is an imaginary portrait of him, c. 1843, by François-Édouard <b>Picot</b> for the Salles des Croisades at Versailles: it depicts him as a handsome, rather pensive man in his forties, wearing a coronet and fanciful pseudo-medieval costume. He is shown with dark hair and beard; {{it is more likely}} that, like his father and at least two of his brothers, he was blond.|$|E
50|$|Elements of {{bobbin lace}} may include toile or toilé (clothwork), réseau (the net-like ground of {{continuous}} lace), fillings of part laces, tapes, gimp, <b>picots,</b> tallies, ribs and rolls. Not all styles of bobbin lace include all these elements.|$|R
50|$|Kempton is a {{very small}} village in south Shropshire, England. The village was listed as one of William de <b>Picot's</b> {{holdings}} in the Domesday Book of 1086. It lies on the small River Kemp, which it takes its name from.|$|R
50|$|The late 16th century {{marked the}} rapid {{development}} of lace, both needle lace and bobbin lace became dominant in both fashion {{as well as}} home décor. For enhancing the beauty of collars and cuffs, needle lace was embroidered with loops and <b>picots.</b>|$|R

25|$|Allenby {{was under}} {{pressure}} to set up foreign administrations in Palestine. Already the French representative in Palestine, <b>Picot,</b> was pressuring for {{a share in the}} administration of a French Protectorate in the Holy Land by pushing to assume the rights and dignities in church which the French representative enjoyed before the war. His presence and behaviour was resented by the Italians and the church representatives became angry. Allenby was aware that in Jerusalem angry priests came to blows in the Holy Places from time to time. He insisted that while military administration was required it must be under the British Commander in Chief alone.|$|E
25|$|Bianu {{authored}} {{a number}} of works on philology as well as history, particularly cultural history. Thoroughly familiar with old Romanian literature, he authored two books that remain valuable reference works. The first was the monumental Bibliografia Românească veche (1508–1830). Covering four volumes (1508–1716, 1716–1807, 1808–1817 and 1817–1830), {{it was written in}} collaboration with Nerva Hodoș and later Dan Simonescu. First suggested to Bianu by Émile <b>Picot,</b> it was conceived as a coherent and pan-Romanian project, supplanting earlier catalogues by Vasile Popp and Cipariu. As an analytical work, it was also based on Émile Legrand's Bibliographie hellénique ou description raisonnée des ouvrages publiés par des Grecs au XVIIIe siècle.|$|E
50|$|North-west of {{the town}} along the Aume and the Route d'Aigre {{there are a few}} hamlets: les <b>Picots,</b> les Citres, les Marais; and some farms: le Cambouil, les Thibauds, and le Goyaud. To the east, on the road to Mansle, there is Les Granges.|$|R
50|$|Casting on {{can also}} be {{decorated}} with various stitch patterns, especially <b>picots.</b> The cast-on stitches {{can also be}} twisted clockwise or counterclockwise as they {{are added to the}} needle; this is commonly done for the single cast-on described below to give it a neater, more uniform look.|$|R
50|$|Bruges lace {{is a part}} lace. This is made in pieces, {{with the}} designs later joined {{together}} to make the final lace. Bruges flower lace is assembled from leaves scrolls and open flowers. These features are joined together with plaits with <b>picots,</b> fillings, leaf plaits and braids.|$|R
25|$|From {{the first}} days of the Royal Family’s captivity, Rambaud asked in vain to serve at the Temple, where the young Dauphin and his parents had been imprisoned. Though she did not flee the country, Rambaud, and some of her family, were forced into hiding because of her {{relationship}} with the Royal family. After the Thermidorian Reaction, many of her friends and family, become incited by Freemasonry and new ideals, and zealously serve the French First Republic, the French Consulate and the First French Empire. She herself becomes close to many ministers, some generals, the mayor of Toulouse, and the scientist Philippe-Isidore <b>Picot</b> de Lapeyrouse.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, {{he won a}} {{competition}} to become professor of Romanian language and literature at Saint Sava National College. Later that year, {{with the help of}} his former professor Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, he received a scholarship to study Romance philology in Milan and Paris. He met the Romanist Émile <b>Picot,</b> took courses with Graziadio Isaia Ascoli and Gaston Paris, but the lasting impact of his sojourn lay in the eye-opening visits to libraries. Impressed by the Palazzo Brera, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, libraries across Italy, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the British Museum and the Bodleian Library, he at the same time became keenly aware of the poor state of Romania's libraries and gathered ideas for their improvement.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations {{with the}} French for {{returning}} Armenian refugees {{to their homes}} in Cilicia were performed with leadership of Boghos Nubar. Negotiations were directed by Quai d'Orsay which is a metonymy to French Ministry Foreign Affairs. Foreign Minister Aristide Briand seized this opportunity to provide troops for French commitment made in Sykes-Picot Agreement, which was still secret at the time. Armenian leadership also meet with Sir Mark Sykes and Georges <b>Picot.</b> The Legion (force) was established officially in Cairo, Egypt in November 1916. The force named as French Armenian Legion and planned {{under the command of}} General Edmund Allenby. However, beginning with 1917 and not in the original agreement, this Armenian force fought in Palestine, Syria.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} a necklines can be {{modified}} in many ways, e.g., by adding a collar or scarf, overlaying it with a gauzy material or decorating the edges with scallops, <b>picots</b> or ruffles. The neckline can be a sharp edge of fabric or a more gentle cowl, and can also be accentuated by pattern(s) in the fabric itself.|$|R
