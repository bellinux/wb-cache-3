40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of dark <b>pools</b> on <b>price</b> {{discovery}} (the efficiency of prices on stock exchanges to aggregate information). Assets are traded in either an exchange or a dark pool, with the dark <b>pool</b> offering better <b>prices</b> but lower execution rates. Informed traders receive noisy and heterogeneous signals about an asset's fundamental. We find that informed traders use dark pools to mitigate their information risk {{and there is a}} sorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges, traders with moderate signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak signals do not trade. As a result, dark pools have an amplification effect on price discovery. That is, when information precision is high (information risk is low), the majority of informed traders trade in the exchange hence adding a dark <b>pool</b> enhances <b>price</b> discovery, whereas when information precision is low (information risk is high), the majority of the informed traders trade in the dark pool hence adding a dark <b>pool</b> impairs <b>price</b> discovery.

50|$|Finance and Economy {{minister}} Nicolas Marceau {{introduced his}} 2013/14 {{budget in the}} fall. The budget laid out revenues, without specifying expenditures. These were presented later, after the budget had passed. The budget projects a break-even operating balance {{by the end of}} fiscal year 2013/14 mainly by slowing down the rate of growth of public spending. The budget implements higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol and modifies - but doesn't cancel outright - the $200 health tax passed in Raymond Bachand's 2010 budget, adding an element of progressiveness to it. The Marceau budget also changes the planned increase to the low-cost heritage pool electricity sold by Hydro-Québec to every Quebecer. Instead of raising the heritage <b>pool</b> <b>price</b> from 2.79 to 3.79¢/kWh from 2014 to 2018 as set by the previous government in 2010, the PQ government chose to let the rate increase with inflation while asking government-owned Hydro-Québec to increase its dividend. The budget narrowly passed on November 30, 2012, in spite of objections by the Liberals and CAQ. Subsequent to passage of the budget, the PQ government announced increased expenditures in the area of subsidized child care, while cutting payments to universities. The latter cuts to university funding included a retroactive cut of $124 million in the 2012-2013 fiscal year, an action criticized by both university rectors and student leaders.|$|E

These financial derivatives contribute to both share and reduce undesired risks through appropriate hedging strategies. Particularly, forward contracts are relevant derivatives within electricity markets. Forward contracts are agreements to buy/sell a fixed amount of electricity at a given price throughout a certain time interval in the future. Selling electricity through a forward contract at a fixed price allows power producers to hedge against the risk related to the volatility of <b>pool</b> <b>prices</b> [4].|$|R
