5|$|The {{workshop}} {{also featured}} a lecture by Michel Vandenbosch, of the Belgian organisation Global Action in the Interest of Animals. On the workshop's second day, those involved {{were joined by}} Niko Koffeman of the Dutch <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Animals and Karen Soeters of that party's Nicolaas G. Pierson Foundation think tank. Footage from that day of the workshop, shot by Joost de Haas, {{was included in the}} documentary film De Haas in de Marathon (The Pacer in the Marathon, 2012). The film was created by de Haas, who was commissioned by the Nicolaas G. Pierson Foundation. It focuses on the <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Animals's first ten years, including interviews with people associated with the party and illustrations of the party's public reception. The film premiered on 28 October 2012, during a gathering to celebrate the party's 10th anniversary, and has since been made available in numerous languages.|$|E

5|$|Fortuyn's {{political}} heritage scattered {{among various}} politicians, {{many of which}} were not successful. These include Marco Pastors, leader of the One NL, and Hilbrand Nawijn, leader of the <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands—none of which managed to win a seat in the 2006 election. More importantly however, the party had been squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration issues by mainstream politicians such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk, who largely adopted Fortuyn's policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV).|$|E

5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} of his <b>party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who {{was supported by}} the ruling center-left coalition.

Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to {{the founding of the}} MDRM, which many non-Merina feared would revive Merina political hegemony, the <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Disinherited of Madagascar (Parti des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed in June 1946 by members of coastal communities formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Militant leader Mahasampo Raveloson was key {{in the creation of the}} party. Other founding members included Philibert Tsiranana (who became Madagascar's first president after independence), Albert Sylla (who became Minister of Foreign Affairs under Tsiranana, and whose son, Jacques Sylla, would go on to become Prime Minister of Madagascar under Marc Ravalomanana), and Pascale Velonjara, father-in-law of future president Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E

Brown faced no challengers from his own <b>party.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E

She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one who}} went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, gunfire {{was heard}} between 19:00 and 21:00, as mutinous troops {{attempted}} {{to overthrow the}} government by seizing control of the centre of the capital Bissau.

The mutineers seized control of the offices of the incumbent African <b>Party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and radio stations. They also fought police officers loyal to the government, forcing them to retreat after coming under fire from RPGs.

Although Warhol continued painting other pop art, including Martinson's coffee cans, Coca-Cola bottles, S Green Stamps, and Campbell's Soup cans, he soon became known to many as the artist who painted celebrities. He returned to Blum's gallery to exhibit Elvis and Liz in October 1963. His fans Dennis Hopper and Brooke Hayward (Hopper's wife at the time) held a welcoming <b>party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> event.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened in}} Louisville on August 19, 1895. In his first address, Hardin came out squarely for free silver, ensuring {{the division of}} his <b>party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of the campaign. Bradley reprised much of his argument from the 1887 campaign against Buckner. He charged mismanagement of state government by Democrats, citing Tate's defalcation as evidence. He also stressed Hardin's association with Tate; Hardin had been the state's attorney general when Tate absconded, and the two {{were known to be}} friends. He denounced free silver and again called for a high protective tariff. He blamed Democratic President Cleveland for the national depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{resulted in}} a breakthrough for the populist True Finns, which came head-to-head with the three big parties, while every other parliamentary party in mainland Finland, excluding Åland, lost popularity. The National Coalition Party (NCP) also ended up as the biggest <b>party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{first time in its}} history. The total turnout rose to 70.5% from 67.9% in the previous election; and corruption scandals also {{resulted in a}}n anti-incumbency vote. The incumbent, Centre Party-led coalition, which included the NCP, Green League and Swedish People's Party (SPP), lost its majority by two seats and their Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party signaled that her party would then sit in opposition.|$|E

Terra Nova arrived from her winter mooring in New Zealand on 9 February, and instead of setting off for Scott, Atkinson used the shore <b>party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arduous task of {{unloading}} the ship – a mistake, Cherry-Garrard thought, since these men might be required to sledge again. Belatedly, on 13 February, Atkinson set out with Dimitri Gerov and the dog teams for the scheduled meeting with Scott on the Barrier, arriving and pausing at Hut Point on 19 February.|$|E
5|$|A {{paramedic}} is let into a {{house to}} the sounds of panic. Earlier, the fastidious Angela prepares to host a <b>party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 79th birthday of her mother, Maggie. Angela's daughter, Katie, heads to her room to complete her homework. When Angela moves a cake, she reveals the head of Jim, her husband. Jim plans to play a trick on Pat—a practical joker and the husband of Angela's sister, Carol (a recovering alcoholic)—by hiding under the cake. Maggie, Carol and Pat—the latter wearing a wolf mask—arrive at the house. As the three settle, Pat plugs in his mobile to charge—something Jim had asked Angela to prevent—and secretly places ice in a bucket. Carol privately drinks from a sunscreen bottle while ostensibly unblocking the toilet after her mother could not flush it. Angela is proud that the party food is from Marks's, but Carol mocks Angela's middle class affectations. Maggie wants a photograph with the food on the table, and Carol lights the cake's candles, which burn towards to the flammable fake cake—under which Jim is still hiding. Katie greets her nana and aunt, with Maggie insisting that she tell the joke from Pat's card. Panicking, Angela blows out the candles. The room clears, and Jim is left frustrated.|$|E

The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting <b>party</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog.
