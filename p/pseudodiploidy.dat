40|$|Cytology and {{cytogenetics}} {{were used}} to study ascitic fluid obtained from five patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Cytological examination showed that all fluids contained numerous mesothelial cells and some leucocytes. Cytogenetic analysis showed abnormal karyotypes in cultured cells from all five patients and in uncultured cells from three. A consistent abnormality was the presence of spreads with over 70 chromosomes. Clones of abnormal cells, with marker chromosomes, <b>pseudodiploidy,</b> or aneuploidy, in an effusion are characteristic of malignancy; the abnormal karyotypes fulfilled these criteria. This finding of abnormal karyotypes indicates that transformation of the mesothelium can occur in vivo, and such a reaction may be {{a reflection of the}} mutagenic effect of alcohol...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytogenetic}} evolution {{patterns in}} chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (SCT) {{are different from}} the ones observed in non-transplanted patients, a phenomenon suggested to be caused by the conditioning regime. We reviewed 131 CMLs displaying karyotypic evolution after SCT (122 allo, nine autologous (auto)), treated at Lund University Hospital or reported in the literature. Major route abnormalities (i. e., + 8, +Ph, i(17 q), + 19, + 21, + 17 and - 7) were seen in 14 %, balanced aberrations in 61 %, hyperdiploidy in 19 %, <b>pseudodiploidy</b> in 79 %, divergent clones in 14 %, and Ph-negative clones in 21 %. The breakpoints involved in secondary structural rearrangements clustered at 1 q 21, 1 q 32, 7 q 22, 9 q 34, 11 q 13, 11 q 23, 12 q 24, 13 q 14, 17 q 10 and 22 q 11. Cytogenetic abnormalities common in AML after genotoxic exposure, that is, der(1; 7) (q 10; p 10), del(3 p), - 5, del(5 q), - 7, - 17, der(17 p), - 18, and - 21, were only rarely seen post-SCT. Comparing the cytogenetic features in relation to type of SCT revealed that balanced aberrations were significantly more common after allo than after auto SCT (64 and 22 %, respectively, P = 0. 03). In addition, there was a trend as regards hyperdiploidy being more common after auto (P = 0. 07) and <b>pseudodiploidy</b> being more frequent after allo SCT (P = 0. 09). Possible reasons for these differences are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} chromosomal pattern {{among the}} major immunophenotypic subgroups in Egyptian children with ALL, and its correlation with clinical presentation and disease free survival. Patients and Methods: Cytogenetic and immunophe-notypic analysis were done for all patients. Patients re-ceived ALL-PNCI-III/ 98 chemotherapy protocol used at NCI, Cairo University. Results: The frequency of <b>pseudodiploidy</b> and normal karyotype in the whole group was 42. 9 % and 33. 3 % respectively. The frequency of <b>pseudodiploidy</b> was 36. 8 % in CALLA positive early pre B, 30. 7 % in pre B cases, 71. 4 % in T cell cases and 100 % in mature B cell cases. At 12 months, DFS was 50 % for pseudodiploid group having pre B phenotype, compared to 16. 6 % for pseudo-diploid group with CALLA positive early pre B ALL. Sixteen percent of the studied cases showed T cell pheno-type, 71. 4 % of them showed pseudodiploid karyotype, {{all of them had}} high risk features. Hyperdiploidy was found in 31. 5 % of CALLA positive early pre B cases and was associated with favorable prognostic features and DFS of 66. 6 % at 12 months. Hyperdiploidy of> 50 chromosome represented 62. 5 % of hyperdipoid cases, 80 % of them were CALLA positive early pre B ALL carrying good risk features. Fifty percent of normal karyotypic patients showed pre B phenotype, while 42. 8 % showed CALLA positive early pre B ALL. Their age, TLC, DFS, were almost comparable. Conclusion: CALLA early pre B phenotype has a positive impact on chromosomal pattern having best outcome among patients with hyperdiploidy. The Pseudo-diploid karyotype carries a better outcome with pre B phenotype...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} examine how long diploid cells can be {{maintained}} in vitro cultivation without any chromosomal aberrations and to evaluate the mechanism of chromosomal heteroploid transformation, changes of chromosomes were studied {{in the course of}} serial in vitro transfers in four normal rat liver cell lines. As a result the diploid cells decreased in number gradually at early culture stage and disappeared completely in the periods between 350 and 500 days. The culture shifted to heteroploid as follow: diploidy [...] -tpseudodiploidy [...] -thypodiploidy [...] -thypertriploidy or hypotetraploidy. This proces to heteroploid transformation is divided into five stages according to ploidy: 1 - and II-stages show diploidy, III-stage, <b>pseudodiploidy,</b> IVstage, hypodiploidy and V-stage, hypertriploidy or hypotetraploidy. Chromosomal heteroploid transformation and neoploastic conversion occurred in IV-stage of the cultures. A possible mechanism involved in the process of chromosomal transformation was discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{presentation}} cytogenetic {{result was}} correlated with outcome for 999 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) having bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in first complete remission (CR 1). The karyotype at diagnosis was classified according to the modified Chicago classification. Allogeneic BMT (AlloBMT) was performed in 500 patients and autologous BMT (ABMT) in 499 patients. For both groups, an abnormal chromosome (abn) 5 and/or 7 or a hypodiploid karyotype had a poor outcome, whereas t(15; 17), <b>pseudodiploidy,</b> hyperdiploidy and diploidy were associated with a standard prognosis. Abn (16) and t(8; 21) were also of standard prognosis for ABMT, but favorable for AlloBMT. When comparing AlloBMT and ABMT in patients with favorable or standard cytogenetics, AlloBMT was of benefit for remission duration and leukemia-free survival (LFS). Patients with an unfavorable karyotype had a similar outcome, regardless of type of BMT. By multivariate analysis, cytogenetics at diagnosis had the strongest prognostic value for relapse, LFS, and survival in AlloBMT. In ABMT, cytogenetics influenced relapse and LFS. We concluded that the karyotype at diagnosis had important prognostic implication in AML grafted in CR 1. (C) 1997 by The American Society of Hematology...|$|E
40|$|Of 706 children, 528 {{with acute}} lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 178 with acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML), whose leukaemia karyotypes could be {{successfully}} analysed, 48 were infants less than 1 year of age, 28 with ALL (5 % of ALL patients) and 20 with AML (11 % of AML patients). In contrast to older children. ALL-leukaemocytogenetics in infants was characterised by lack of hyperdiploidy with over 50 chromosomes and higher incidence of <b>pseudodiploidy.</b> Thirteen (= 46 %) infants had an 11 q 23 aberration, and 11 of them had t(4; 11). In AML, nine (= 45 %) infants also had an 11 q 23 abnormality, e. g. t(9; 11). Thus, the 11 q 23 aberration was present in almost 50 % of all leukaemia karyotypes of infants. In ALL of infants, the CALLA negative, pre-pre-B immunophenotype prevailed. In AML of infants, the monocytic subtype dominated. A biphenotypic morphology (lymphoid-monocytic) with the expression of lymphoid and myeloid antigens was seen in several ALL and AML cases. In conclusion, leukaemogenesis in infants is a rare event, arising in stem cells of very early hematopoietic differentiation (probably due to gene rearrangement errors, most frequently at FRA 11 B), and differs from leukaemogenesis in older age groups by unique clinical and cellular features...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies of}} {{childhood}} leukemia have made limited use of tumor genetic characteristics, {{which may be}} related to disease etiology. We characterized the cytogenetics of 543 childhood leukemia patients (0 - 14 years of age) enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study, an approximately population-based study comprised primarily of Hispanics (42 %) and non-Hispanic Whites (41 %), and compared the cytogenetic profiles between these two ethnic groups. Subjects were classified by immunophenotype, conventional cytogenetic characteristics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization findings. The ploidy levels most frequently observed among acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were high hyperdiploidy (51 - 67 chromosomes) and <b>pseudodiploidy</b> (34 % and 27 %, respectively). No ethnic differences in the frequency of 11 q 23 /MLL rearrangements were observed between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. Among B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, the percentage of TEL-AML 1 translocations was significantly lower in Hispanics (13 %) than in non-Hispanic Whites (24 %; P = 0. 01). Thisisthe first time that this ethnic variation has been observed in a large number of patients in a defined geographic region, which is consistent with findings from smaller international studies. The mechanistic basis for this 2 -fold variation in frequency of TEL-AML 1 may be due to ethnic-specific risk factors or genetics and should be explored further.

40|$|Karyotypes of 21 patients, {{originally}} {{entered into}} the Third International Workshop on Chromosomes in Leukemia (3 IWCL), were investigated in first, second and/or subsequent relapses. Karyotypes at diagnosis {{were related to the}} relapses in the following ways: normal to normal (N-N) (five cases); abnormal to normal (A-N) (two cases); abnormal to abnormal with no change (A-A) (five cases); abnormal to abnormal with clonal evolution (A-A+) (eight cases); and normal to abnormal (N-A) (one case). The A-A group comprised two each of t(4; 11) and t(9; 22) cases and one pseudodiploid case; included in this group were the only two patients who did not receive intensive treatment. Both A-N cases had been pseudodiploid at diagnosis. Clonal evolution A-A+ occurred in patients who had had 47 - 49 chromosomes or <b>pseudodiploidy</b> at diagnosis and was mainly due to the addition of structural change. The additional abnormalities were different in each case. The only de novo appearance of a clone (N-A) was in host cells in relapse following bone marrow transplantation. Clonal evolution occurred in patients who had been intensively treated and who relapsed late; the median time from diagnosis to relapse studied for the A-A group was 6 months and for the A-A+ group was 24 months. Survival following relapse was shorter for patients who had had a clonal abnormality at any time (median 10 months) than for those with no abnormality at diagnosis or in relapse (median 26 months) ...|$|E
40|$|Cytogenetic {{classification}} of 350 adults with {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} on MRC UKALL XA trial showed the following statistically significant associations: t(9; 22) (11 %) increased with increasing age and leucocyte counts (WBC) and most had a C/pre-B immunophenotype. t(4; 11) (3 %) was associated with higher WBCs, increasing age and null immunophenotype. Other abnormalities of 11 q (abn 11 q) (4 %) were associated with male sex and T-cell ALL. High hyperdiploidy (7 %) and abn 9 p (5 %) decreased with increasing WBC. High hyperdiploid patients were younger and tended to have C/pre-B ALL. Triploidy/tetraploidy (3 %) decreased and <b>pseudodiploidy</b> (11 %) increased with increasing WBC. Cytogenetic classification was prognostically important (chi-square for heterogeneity of classification = 53. 56; P < 0. 0001) and added significance to age, sex and WBC. A poor prognosis for patients classed as t(9; 22) (13 % disease-free survival at 3 years), as t(4; 11) 24 % at 3 years) and hypodiploid (11 % at 3 years), and good prognosis for abn 12 p (4 % of subjects) and high hyperdiploidy (74 % and 59 % at 3 years respectively) were statistically significant, but the 54 % 3 -year disease-free survival for patients with t(1; 19) was not.

40|$|SUMMARY-In 79 {{adults with}} acute leukemia, {{cytogenetic}} {{studies of the}} blood and marrow were made to assess {{their relationship to the}} patients ' clinical condition. Of the patients, 30. 4 % had abnormal cell lines and 69. 6 %, only diploid ones. In 75 % of the patients with abnormal lines, varying proportions of diploid cells were also present. Seventy-three patients were treated subsequent to the initial studies, and in 63 % of them serial (2 - 21) cytogenetic examinations were done. Remissions occurred in 35 % of the treated patients with abnormal lines and in 48 % of those with only diploid cells. The difference in remission rates was not sta-tistically significant. There was a significant tendency to deletions of G-group chromosomes in the group of patients with cytogenetic abnormalities. However, neither this nor any other specific chromosome abnor-mality had a significant relationship to the likelihood of remission induction, and neither had the nature of the ploidy (hyperdiploidy, <b>pseudodiploidy,</b> or hypodiploidy). Diploid cells completely replaced abnormal lines in 6 of 8 initially aneuploid patients entering remission. Multiple serial specimens confirmed that 100 % diploidy persisted throughout the remission periods, with return of the original abnormal clones in terminal relapse. The frequent finding of mixtures of diploid with aneuploid or pseudodiploid cell populations in untreated patients and of the disappearance of abnormal cells during remission supports the view that improved therapeutic methods aimed at the eradication of leukemic cells may lead to beHer clinical results. ...|$|E

With {{the use of the}} easily recognizable X chromosome as a cytological marker, it was determined that the diploid and neer-dlplold cells originated in the host and did not grow in a homologous animal. The analysis of 8 · 4 karyotypes showed the existence of <b>pseudodiploidy</b> and chromosomal changes in some of the diploid and neer-dlpleld cells. The polyploid cellshad a mode of 85 - 102, predominantly 96 chromosomes, and were characterized by a high number of X chromosomes. These cells with similar chromosome constitution were considered to be serially transferred from animal to animal, and it was thought that the large number of X chromosomes might give a selective advantage for transplantation. The high proportion of diploid and near-diploid cells in all tumors examined is discussed and viral induction of growth in the host animal is suggested. -J Nat Cancer Inst 35 : 381 - 411, 1965.
