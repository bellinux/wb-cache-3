5|$|The {{fire was}} fed not merely by wood, fabrics, and thatch, Hanson points out, {{but also by}} the oil, pitch, coal, tallow, fats, sugar, alcohol, turpentine, and {{gunpowder}} stored in the riverside district. It melted the imported steel lying along the wharves (melting <b>point</b> <b>between</b> 1,250 and 1,480°C (2,300 and 2,700°F)) and the great iron chains and locks on the City gates (melting <b>point</b> <b>between</b> 1,100 and 1,650°C (2,000 and 3000°F)). Nor would anonymous bone fragments have been of much interest to the hungry people sifting through {{the tens of thousands of}} tons of rubble and debris after the fire, looking for valuables, or to the workmen clearing away the rubble later during the rebuilding.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution.

A few patches of wetland on the National Wetlands Inventory are near the stream. It is flanked by a 100 year floodplain throughout its entire length.|$|E

TNA advertised the Barbed Wire Massacre between Abyss and Sabu on the November19 episode of Impact!.

Abyss challenged this fear on the December3 episode of Impact!, by bashing Sabu over the head with a barbed wire wrapped steal chair. Sabu defeated Abyss at the event to end their rivalry.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened on}} December 31, 1936 {{as the new}} {{terminal}} for the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line. The opening of the station brought significant growth to the adjacent communities of Forest Hills and Kew Gardens, transforming them from quiet residential communities to active population centers. Today, the station serves as a major transfer <b>point</b> <b>between</b> the subway and local buses. Bus service to eastern Queens or southern-central Queens {{is provided by the}} Q46, and the Q10 and Q37, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The titular Halo is an enormous, {{ring-shaped}} artificial space station/planet, which (according to Bungie Studios) has {{a diameter}} of ten thousand kilometers.

In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined {{the walls of the}} trading hall and the advent of electronic trading resulted in computers being placed on desktops.|$|E

5|$|This express {{station has}} four tracks and two island platforms. The F train {{stops on the}} outer local tracks at all times while the E stops on the center express tracks weekdays (Manhattan-bound from {{approximately}} 6:00a.m. to 6:00p.m., Jamaica-bound from 7:30a.m. to 7:45p.m.) and on the outer tracks at all other times. During weekdays this is the easternmost transfer <b>point</b> <b>between</b> the E and F trains before they branch off toward their eastern terminals.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the only}} subway station serving the island of Broad Channel, which is located in Jamaica Bay. The island only has about 3,000 residents, and as a result, this is the least-used station in the subway system not {{counting}} the closed Cortlandt Street station. However, this station serves an important role. It is the transfer <b>point</b> <b>between</b> the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which runs to Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street, and the A train, which runs through Brooklyn and Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a <b>point</b> <b>between</b> the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

5|$|After the Kingdom of Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies on 3 September 1943, the unfinished CB-20 was captured by German forces and completed by March 1944. The boat was then {{handed over to the}} Italian Social Republic where it saw service with the Tenth Flotilla performing reconnaissance and landing saboteurs. At some <b>point</b> <b>between</b> September and October 1944, CB-20 was relocated to its new home port in Pula, where it was captured by the Partisans on 3 May 1945. Renamed Mališan (P-901), translating as nipper in English, the boat was overhauled at the Uljanik Shipyard and commissioned in 1948. The Yugoslav Navy used it for training new submariners as well as evaluating the concept of midget submarines for future use, which eventually materialized {{in the form of the}} Una-class midget submarines three decades later. Depending on the source, the exact time Mališan was decommissioned differs from the early 1950s to 1957.|$|E
5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a <b>point</b> <b>between</b> Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition <b>point</b> <b>between</b> {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E

5|$|As the Turkish forces moved towards Nakhichevan, Andranik {{with his}} Armenian Special Striking Division {{moved to the}} mountainous region of Zangezur {{to set up a}} defense. By mid-1918, the {{relations}} between the Armenians and Azeris in Zangezur had deteriorated. Andranik arrived in Zangezur at a critical moment with around 30,000 refugees and an estimated force of between 3,000 and 5,000 men. He established effective control of the region by September. The role of Zangezur was crucial because it was a connection <b>point</b> <b>between</b> Turkey and Azerbaijan. Under Andranik, the region became one of the last centers of Armenian resistance after the Treaty of Batum.|$|E
5|$|At some <b>point</b> <b>between</b> 1935 and 1938, NY3 was {{truncated}} {{further to}} end at its junction with US104 in Hannibal. It was moved another half-mile (0.8km) {{to the east}} in the early 1960s following {{the completion of the}} super two bypass carrying US104 around {{the eastern edge of the}} village. NY3 continued to end at the super two until the early 1980s. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY3's former routing between the Cayuga County line and NY104 was transferred from Oswego County to the state of New York. One year later, on April1, 1981, the state assumed ownership and maintenance of the Cayuga County portion from that county. Both transactions were part of larger highway maintenance swaps between the state and the two counties. NY3 was reextended westward to NY104A following the second swap.|$|E
5|$|At some <b>point</b> <b>between</b> {{the death}} of Cnut the Great in 1035 and {{the death of}} Edward the Confessor in early 1066, the {{independent}} Kingdom of Cornwall was annexed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Wessex, a part of the Kingdom of England. In late 1066 Cornwall, {{along with the rest of}} the lands under the control of the English king, was conquered by the Normans and came under the control of William the Conqueror. By the late 12thcentury the metal mines were brought under the control of the Crown; operation of the tin mines was devolved to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and mining of other metals was directly controlled by the Crown as Mines Royal.|$|E
