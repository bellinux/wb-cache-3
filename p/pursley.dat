500|$|Brooks {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} motivation after the Olympics. He was recruited to the Australian Institute of Sport by swimming coaches Bill Sweetenham and Dennis <b>Pursley,</b> but his stay was brief. The inaugural director Don Talbot, a former head coach of the Australian swimming team, expelled him for indiscipline. He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100m freestyle without training, but his time of 52.61s was substantially slower than his personal best. Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the University of Arkansas to train under Sam Freas. He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system, particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches. He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers, saying that [...] "In Australia, after a race they want to lock you in your room. In America, you can share a beer after the meet with the coach." [...] The shortcourse pools used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks, as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns, which came twice as often in comparison to longcourse (50m) pools. He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year, but decided to extend his stay by a year, having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States. In both years, he won the 50m and 100m freestyle double in the Southwest Conference, and was fourth in the 100m freestyle at the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships. He also came second in the 100m freestyle at the AACC Championships to Rowdy Gaines, who {{went on to win the}} event at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.|$|E
