5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine on the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by {{shutting down the}} engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the <b>port</b> <b>wing.</b> In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E
5|$|In September 1938, Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXD Horatius of Imperial Airways {{suffered}} damage to its port undercarriage and lower <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> in a forced landing at Lympne. The aircraft was repaired {{and returned to}} service.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the starboard wing caught on fire.|$|E

5|$|EF-84E: Two F-84Es were {{converted}} into test prototypes, to test various methods of air-to-air refueling. EF-84E 49-2091 {{was used as}} a probe-and-drogue test aircraft. The probe was mid-span on the <b>port</b> <b>wing.</b> Production aircraft with probes (removable) had the probe fitted to the auxiliary wing tanks. EF-84E 49-2115 {{was used as a}} FICON test aircraft with a B-36 host. EF-84E 49-1225 and EF-84E 51-634 were test aircraft for the ZELMAL (Zero-length launch, Mat landing) experiments version for point defense, used the booster rocket from MGM-1 Matador cruise missile.|$|E
5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E

5|$|On 7 September 1940, No. 605 {{moved on}} {{rotation}} to Croydon Aerodrome {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Walter Churchill. McKellar scored a further four victories in a single mission on 9 September. McKellar attacked with the sun at his back with his Squadron, save for one Section which was left to provide top cover against Bf 109s. The attack was made head-on to break up the German bomber formation which consisted of a large mass of He 111s. He destroyed three He 111s with a single, 12–second burst. The first He 111 exploded. It damaged a second which rolled over and dived down into the ground. McKellar then moved his fire to a third. Its <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> snapped off. He then destroyed a Bf 109 in the afternoon giving him a fourth success.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E
5000|$|Roll creates counter {{rotational}} {{forces on}} both starboard and <b>port</b> <b>wings</b> whilst also generating such forces at the empennage. These opposing rolling moment effects {{have to be}} overcome by the aileron input in order to sustain the roll rate. If the roll is stopped at a non-zero roll angle the [...] upward rolling moment induced by the ensuing sideslip should return the aircraft to the horizontal unless exceeded in turn by the downward [...] rolling moment resulting from sideslip induced yaw rate. Longitudinal stability could be ensured or improved by minimizing the latter effect.|$|R

5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's number 2 port engine No.5097, {{constructed}} in 1961, had run for 14,917 hours from new, {{and had been}} overhauled in spring 1965 because of vibration caused by metal fatigue that had led {{to the failure of}} a stage 8 high-pressure compressor blade. In 1967 the engine had been removed from service because of flame tube deterioration, and as part of the repairs, the low-pressure compressor, of which the number 5 wheel was an original component, was overhauled, but the wheel itself was not tested for fatigue. On 22 November 1967 the engine was bench tested and rejected because of excessive vibration of the high-pressure compressor, but was later released as serviceable following further analysis. After 1,415 hours service on another 707 and modification to the turbine seals, on 5 April 1968 No.5097 became number 2 engine of the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> of the aircraft, scheduled to fly long-haul to Sydney, Australia, three days later.|$|E
5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave {{since the war began}} in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered with his family and those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 then disappeared. Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant that the chances of reaching England were slim. He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E
50|$|The Port Huron Flags were a {{minor league}} {{professional}} ice hockey team located in Port Huron, Michigan. The Flags competed in the International Hockey League between 1962 and 1981.

25|$|It was snowing and the {{airfield}} at Croydon {{was covered in}} dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia. The C-47A had just lifted from the runway at Croydon when the starboard wing dropped, then the aircraft turned {{to the left and}} the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> dropped. The pilot was seen to apply full starboard aileron but the bank angle increased to 40 degrees with the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> tip only {{a few feet from the}} ground. As the aircraft reached the perimeter track of {{the airfield}}, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed. Eleven of the 18 passengers and one of the five crew died.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-3/U4 — The A-3/U4 was a {{reconnaissance}} {{version with}} two RB 12.5 {{cameras in the}} rear fuselage and a EK 16 gun camera or a Robot II miniature camera in {{the leading edge of}} the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> root.

25|$|Because the {{intercooler}} {{required a}} radiator, the radiator under the starboard wing was halved {{in size and}} the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit.

25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} that a fuel pressure pipe had chafed against a metal clip, causing the pipe to leak aviation spirit. This fuel was then ignited, probably by a hot exhaust pipe. The fuel pipe would then have been burnt away, which would have caused fuel starvation to the No. 1 (outer port) engine. With the <b>port</b> <b>wing</b> on fire and both port engines out of action, the aircraft would have been increasingly difficult to control.|$|E
25|$|The C-47 {{aircraft}} suffered substantial {{damage to}} its tail and <b>port</b> <b>wing.</b> Nevertheless, {{due to its}} historic significance (and {{because it was the}} signature airframe of the company), Air Service Berlin stated that it intended a complete repair and restoration.

50|$|The torpedo bombers {{continued}} their attack, {{in spite of}} their damage and lack of fighter protection. There was heavy anti-aircraft fire from the German ships, and Esmonde's plane possibly sustained a direct hit from anti-aircraft fire that destroyed most of one of the <b>port</b> <b>wings</b> of his Swordfish biplane. Esmonde led his flight through a screen of the enemy destroyers and other small vessels protecting the battleships. He was still 2,700 metres from his target when he was hit by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, resulting in his aircraft bursting into flames and crashing into the sea. The remaining aircraft continued the attack, but all were shot down by enemy fighters; only five of the 18 crew survived the action. The four surviving officers received the Distinguished Service Order, and the enlisted survivor was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal.|$|R
