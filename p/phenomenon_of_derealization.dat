40|$|Throughout {{the history}} <b>of</b> psychiatry, the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> {{dissociation}} has been continuously debated, negotiated, and redefined. Outside {{the field of}} psychiatry, an understanding of dissociation and its impact is even more elusive. In this partial review of the literature, depersonalization disorder, a little known psychopathology intimately related to dissociation, is analyzed in detail. From defining the disorder {{in terms of our}} current understanding to exploring its prevalence and origins (both traumatic and biological), this analysis seeks to reveal this disorder to a public largely unaware of its existence. By examining depersonalization disorder in-depth, it is hoped that this analysis may aid in bringing the commonly experienced <b>phenomena</b> <b>of</b> depersonalization and <b>derealization</b> into public awareness and discourse. Future studies should strive to bolster the growing empirical data related to the understanding and treatment <b>of</b> these <b>phenomena</b> in their pathological form...|$|R
50|$|Cannabis, psychedelics, dissociatives, antidepressants, caffeine, nitrous oxide, albuterol, and {{nicotine}} can all produce feelings resembling derealization, {{particularly when}} taken in excess. It {{can result from}} alcohol withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Opiate withdrawal can also cause feelings <b>of</b> <b>derealization.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{detachment}} <b>of</b> <b>derealization</b> can {{be described}} as an immaterial substance that separates a person from the outside world, such as a sensory fog, pane of glass, or veil. Individuals may report that what they see lacks vividness and emotional coloring. Emotional response to visual recognition of loved ones may be significantly reduced. Feelings of déjà vu or jamais vu are common. Familiar places may look alien, bizarre, and surreal. The world as perceived by the individual may feel like it is going through a dolly zoom effect. Such perceptual abnormalities may also extend to the senses of hearing, taste, and smell. The degree of familiarity one has with their surroundings is among one's sensory and psychological identity, memory foundation and history when experiencing a place. When a person is in a state <b>of</b> <b>derealization,</b> they block this identifying foundation from recall. This [...] "blocking effect" [...] creates a discrepancy of correlation between one's perception of one's surroundings during a derealization episode, and what that same individual would perceive in the absence <b>of</b> a <b>derealization</b> episode.|$|R
50|$|In {{internet}} surveys, some psilocybin {{users have}} reported symptoms of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, {{although this is}} uncommon and a causal connection with psilocybin use is unclear. There is a case report of perceptual disturbances and panic disorder beginning after using psilocybin mushrooms in frequent cannabis users with a pre-existing history <b>of</b> <b>derealization</b> and anxiety.|$|R
5|$|Other sensory {{abnormalities}} {{include a}} {{distortion of the}} patient's sense of time, for example déjà vu, or a distortion {{of the sense of}} self (depersonalization) or sense <b>of</b> reality (<b>derealization).</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{hallucinations}} which appear to involve shifts in egocentric perspective (e. g., the out-of-body experience, OBE) reflect specific biases in exocentric perspective-taking processes. Via a newly devised perspective-taking task, we examined whether such biases in perspective-taking were present in relation to specific dissociative anomalous body experiences (ABE) - namely the OBE. Participants also completed the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS; Sierra and Berrios, 2000) which provided measures of additional embodied ABE (unreality of self) and measures <b>of</b> <b>derealization</b> (unreality <b>of</b> surroundings). There were no reliable differences in the level of ABE, emotional numbing, and anomalies in sensory recall reported between the OBE and control group as measured by the corresponding CDS subscales. In contrast, the OBE group did provide significantly elevated measures <b>of</b> <b>derealization</b> ("alienation from surroundings" CDS subscale) relative to the control group. At the same time we also found that the OBE group was significantly more efficient at completing all aspects of the perspective-taking task relative to controls. Collectively, the current findings support fractionating the typically unitary notion of dissociation by proposing a distinction between embodied dissociative experiences and disembodied dissociative experiences - with only the latter being associated with exocentric perspective-taking mechanisms. Our findings - obtained with an ecologically valid task and a homogeneous OBE group - also call for a re-evaluation of the relationship between OBEs and perspective-taking in terms of facilitated disembodied experiences...|$|R
50|$|Derealization {{can also}} {{manifest}} as an indirect result of certain vestibular {{disorders such as}} labyrinthitis. This is thought to result {{from the experience of}} anxiety precipitated by the functional disparity that arises between the ability to reconcile external stimuli relative to motion and equilibrioception that are compromised by vestibular dysfunction with the internal perceptions and expectations regarding the physical environment.An alternative explanation holds that a possible effect of vestibular dysfunction includes responses {{in the form of the}} modulation of noradrenergic and serotonergic activity due to a misattribution of vestibular symptoms to the presence of imminent physical danger resulting in the experience of anxiety or panic, which subsequently generate feelings <b>of</b> <b>derealization.</b>|$|R
50|$|Auras {{can also}} be {{confused}} with sudden onset of panic, panic attacks or anxiety attacks creating difficulties in diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of patients who experience symptoms <b>of</b> paresthesias, <b>derealization,</b> dizziness, chest pain, tremors, and palpitations can be quite challenging.|$|R
40|$|Many voices {{speak in}} Mauro Covacich's A nome tuo (2011) : the author himself, {{in a piece}} of autofiction; a fictitious character, who has written a long memoir; an {{anonymous}} academic, who accuses him of lying with regard to a video installation. This multiplicity of voices attests to the dispersion of the Self, but also to its tyranny. Covacich actually aims at vouching for the truthfulness of the text, and he engages in a paradoxical struggle against fiction as a factor <b>of</b> <b>derealization.</b> The body art performance therefore becomes his model, thus giving rise to a contradiction: Discourse can only be grounded on the Self, i. e. on the body – but the body can't guarantee the reality of the Self. One can only «cheat while remaining honest», in a desperate (and exemplary) attempt to escape the paper prison of fiction...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{preliminary}} work suggests that dissociative symptoms may impact neuropsychological performance in trauma-exposed populations, {{the relation between}} dissociation and cognitive performance has not been explored in patients with depression. Objective: The present study examined dissociative symptoms in relation to neuropsychological performance in participants with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) {{and a history of}} trauma exposure. Method: Twenty-three participants with MDD and 20 healthy controls who did not differ in age, sex, education, or IQ were assessed. In addition to a standardized neuropsychological battery assessing frontotemporally mediated cognitive processes, participants completed clinical measures assessing dissociative symptoms, illness severity, and past history of trauma exposure. Results: Among participants with MDD, greater severity <b>of</b> <b>derealization</b> was associated with reduced performance on measures of delayed visuospatial recall and recognition on a task of verbal memory recognition. In addition, more severe depersonalization was associated with slower processing speed and a response style lending itself toward better performance in a less active environment. Conclusions: These findings point toward dissociative symptoms as a transdiagnostic factor associated with neuropsychological dysfunction in patients with depression and a history of trauma. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Dissociative {{experiences}} involving music {{have received}} little research attention outside {{the field of}} ethnomusicology. This paper examines the psychological characteristics of normative dissociation (detachment) across musical and non-musical experiences in ‘real world’, everyday settings. It draws upon a subset of data arising from an empirical project designed to compare transformative shifts of consciousness, with and without music in daily life, {{and the ways in}} which use of music may facilitate the processes of dissociation and absorption. Twenty participants kept unstructured diaries for two weeks, recording free descriptions of involving experiences of any kind as soon as possible after their occurrence. All descriptions were subsequently subjected to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results suggest that dissociative experiences are a familiar occurrence in everyday life. Diary entries highlight an established practice of actively sought detachment from self, surroundings or activity, suggesting that, together with absorption, the processes <b>of</b> <b>derealization</b> (altered perception <b>of</b> surroundings) and depersonalization (detachment from self) constitute common means of selfregulation in daily life. Music emerges as a particularly versatile facilitator of dissociative experience because of its semantic ambiguity, portability, and the variety of ways in which it may mediate perception, so facilitating an altered relationship to self and environmen...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{recognizes the}} failure of con- {{temporary}} non-aesthetic theories of art and aims at recovering the phenomenological notion of derea- lization – which re-emerges in A. Dantoʼs idea of the ʻbracketting effectʼ of art –, in order to explain art and art-experience. The main point is that art makes us free from the ʻreal worldʼ through an act <b>of</b> <b>derealization</b> {{that leads to the}} establishment of possible or fictional worlds different from the one we live in. Artworks are primarly imaginary, unreal objects, {{due to the fact that}} they interest us only for its appearance and as appearance. Therefore, art cannot be understood without the frame of a particular kind of experience that we can understand in terms of Kantʼs notion of dis- interestedness. This notion is still productive to understand why art has a certain power to free us from the needs of reality, although through art we do have profound views of certain aspects of rea- lity and our life. Some objections against Kantʼs theory of aesthetic disinterestedness are discussed and refused, in order to understand the transcen- dental significance of the aesthetic theory of art...|$|R
50|$|One {{cognitive}} behavioral conceptualization is that misinterpreting normally transient dissociative symptoms as {{an indication}} of severe mental illness or neurological impairment leads {{to the development of the}} chronic disorder.

5000|$|One patient, {{referred}} to as WI for privacy reasons, was diagnosed with Cotard delusion after experiencing significant traumatic brain damage. Damage to the cerebral hemisphere, frontal lobe, and the ventricular system was apparent to WI's doctors after examining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. In January 1990, WI was discharged to outpatient care. Although his family had made arrangements for him to travel abroad, he continued to experience significant persistent visual difficulties, which provoked a referral for ophthalmological assessment. Formal visual testing then led {{to the discovery of}} further damage. For several months after the initial trauma, WI continued to experience difficulty recognizing familiar faces, places, and objects. He also was convinced that he was dead and experienced feelings <b>of</b> <b>derealization.</b> Later in 1990, after being discharged from the hospital, WI was convinced that he had been taken to hell after dying of either AIDS or septicaemia. When WI finally sought out neurological testing in May 1990, he was no longer fully convinced that he was dead, although he still suspected it. Further testing revealed that WI was able to distinguish between dead and alive individuals with the exception of himself. When WI was treated for depression, his delusions of his own death diminished in a month.|$|R

After being rushed to a nearby hospital, Logic deemphasized the impact of his attack by attributing it to attacks he would receive as a child. Remaining insistent to continue the tour, Logic's health deteriorated further, eventually inducing him into a state <b>of</b> <b>derealization.</b> Doctors attributed his poor state of health due to the consistent touring, performing and high pressure situations associated with music and its live environment. Logic soon took time off, and detailed its rationale in an interview, stating: [...] "I've gone my entire life, especially the last seven years, professionally, without a break. Literally, I got married and a week later, I jumped on a tour bus instead of taking my wife to an awesome exotic place favor of seeing my fans, over the span of two weeks, over the entire country, playing my album before it came out, for the fans.
