40|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>peaks</b> are {{powerful}} distractors. This study {{focuses on the}} impact of <b>noise</b> <b>peaks</b> on surgical teams' communication during 109 long abdominal surgeries. We related measured <b>noise</b> <b>peaks</b> during 5 -min intervals to the amount of observed communication during the same interval. Results show that <b>noise</b> <b>peaks</b> are associated with less case-relevant communication; this effect is moderated by the level of surgical experience; case-relevant communications decrease under high <b>noise</b> <b>peak</b> conditions among junior, but not among senior surgeons. However, case-irrelevant communication did not decrease under high noise level conditions, rather there was a trend to more case-irrelevant communication under high <b>noise</b> <b>peaks.</b> The results support the hypothesis that <b>noise</b> <b>peaks</b> impair communication because they draw on attentional resources rather than impairing understanding of communication. As case-relevant communication is important for surgical performance, exposure to high <b>noise</b> <b>peaks</b> in the OR should be minimised especially for less experienced surgeons. Practitioner Summary: This study investigated whether noise during surgeries influenced the communication within surgical teams. During abdominal surgeries, noise levels were measured and communication was observed. Results showed that high <b>noise</b> <b>peaks</b> reduced the frequency of patient-related communication, but did not reduce patient-irrelevant communication.

40|$|Abstract — Placing shields {{around a}} victim signal {{line is a}} common way to enhance signal {{integrity}} while minimizing delay uncertainty. For two coupled interconnects with a shield between the lines, the coupling noise can produce a <b>peak</b> <b>noise</b> of 15 % of in a 0. 18 m CMOS technology. A- model is used to develop an analytic estimate of the <b>peak</b> <b>noise</b> for shielded interconnects. The <b>peak</b> <b>noise</b> model is accurate within an average error of 4. 4 % as compared to SPICE. The effects of the shield width, length, separation between the shield and the signal, {{and the number of}} connections tieing the shield to ground on the overall crosstalk noise are described in this paper. Based on the <b>peak</b> <b>noise</b> model, a minimum number of ground connections for a target shield line with noise constraints is obtained. Inserting a shield line between two coupled interconnects is shown to be more effective in reducing crosstalk noise than increasing the physical separation. I...|$|E

40|$|Performance of {{high-speed}} VLSI circuits is increasingly limited by interconnect coupling noise. We present simple and improved an-alytical models for noise phenomena due to coupling capacitance. We extend the n model presented in [4] {{to accommodate a}} seg-mented aggressor. We also include a linear driver resistance in the modeling of both victims and aggressors to measure their es-timate on <b>peak</b> <b>noise.</b> Finally, we extend this model to multiple segmenred aggressors by superposing noise contributions of indi-vidual aggressors and sweeping the result in the time domain to de-termine <b>peak</b> <b>noise</b> (in contrast to adding the individual <b>peak</b> <b>noise</b> values for individual aggressors). Accuracy in the results depends greatly on actual positioning of victim-aggressor overlaps. We find that previous models that assume aggressors run parallel to the vic-tim net for its entire length do not yield <b>peak</b> <b>noise</b> results nearly as close to SPICE-computed values. We also find that inclusion of driver resistance in the model improves accuracy. Our noise model for a single segmented aggressor is within- 16 % of SPICE. Re-sults for two segmented aggressors are within acceptable tolerances with respect to SPICE, but error increases {{with the number of}} ag-gressors. We note that these results are almost always pessimistic. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{interaction}} of the substrate with the inductive on-chip ground distribution network is analyzed in this paper. A transistor level approach is presented to illustrate {{the effects of the}} substrate on ground noise. The substrate can {{have a significant effect on}} ground noise due to the inductance of the ground lines. For a CMOS inverter, the substrate can reduce negative <b>peak</b> ground <b>noise</b> by 49 % during the high-to-low output transition. The substrate, however, increases the positive <b>peak</b> ground <b>noise</b> by 72 % during the low-to-high output transition. The effect of the substrate should therefore not be neglected if the inductance of the on-chip ground distribution network is nonnegligible. Furthermore, conventional triangle or trapezoid type current demand estimations of the nonlinear circuits are shown to be significantly inaccurate if the ground lines exhibit inductive behavior.
