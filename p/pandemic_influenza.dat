5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E
5|$|Worst {{affected}} was German Samoa, {{today the}} independent state of Samoa, {{which had been}} occupied by New Zealand in 1914. A crippling 90% {{of the population was}} infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. By contrast, the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade. In New Zealand itself, 8,573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza,</b> resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0.74%. In Ireland, the Spanish Flu accounted for 10% of the total deaths in 1918 which can be seen as quite detrimental considering World War 1 was still occurring.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, most vaccine {{development}} {{efforts have been}} focused on the current <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> virus H1N1. As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials are have been completed or are ongoing for <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> vaccines. In September 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, and expect the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.|$|E

25|$|H5N1 {{may cause}} {{more than one}} <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic,</b> as it is {{expected}} to continue mutating in birds regardless of whether humans develop herd immunity to a future <b>pandemic</b> strain. <b>Influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> from its genetic offspring may include influenza A virus subtypes other than H5N1. While genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus shows that <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> from its genetic offspring can easily be far more lethal than the Spanish flu pandemic, planning for a future <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> is based on what can be done and there is no higher Pandemic Severity Index level than a Category 5 pandemic which, roughly speaking, is any pandemic as bad as the Spanish flu or worse; and for which all intervention measures are to be used.|$|R

25|$|An <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> is an {{epidemic}} of an influenza virus that spreads on a worldwide scale and infects {{a large proportion of}} the world population. In contrast to the regular seasonal epidemics of <b>influenza,</b> these <b>pandemics</b> occur irregularly—there have been about 9 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> during the last 300 years. Pandemics can cause high levels of mortality, with the 1918 Spanish <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> being the worst in recorded history; this pandemic was estimated to be responsible for the deaths of approximately 50–100million people. There have been about three <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> in each century for the last 300 years, the most recent one being the 2009 flu pandemic.|$|R

40|$|The study {{objective}} is to estimate the epidemiological and economic impact of vaccine interventions during <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> in Chicago, and assist in vaccine intervention priorities. Scenarios of delay in vaccine introduction with limited vaccine efficacy and limited supplies are not unlikely in future <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics,</b> as in the 2009 H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> We simulated <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> in Chicago using agent-based transmission dynamic modeling. Population was distributed among high-risk and non-high risk among 0 - 19, 20 - 64 and 65 + years subpopulations. Different attack rate scenarios for catastrophic (30. 15 %), strong (21. 96 %), and moderate (11. 73 %) <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> were compared against vaccine intervention scenarios, at 40 % coverage, 40 % efficacy, and unit cost of $ 28. 62. Sensitivity analysis for vaccine compliance, vaccine efficacy and vaccine start date was also conducted. Vaccine prioritization criteria include risk of death, total deaths, net benefits, and return on investment. The risk of death is the highest among the high-risk 65 + years subpopulation in the catastrophic <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic,</b> and highest among the high-risk 0 - 19 years subpopulation in the strong and moderate <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> The proportion of total deaths and net benefits are the highest among the high-risk 20 - 64 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> The return on investment is {{the highest in the}} high-risk 0 - 19 years subpopulation in the catastrophic, strong and moderate <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> Based on risk of death and return on investment, high-risk groups of the three age group subpopulations can be prioritized for vaccination, and the vaccine interventions are cost saving for all age and risk groups. The attack rates among the children are higher than among the adults and seniors in the catastrophic, strong, and moderate <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> scenarios, due to their larger social contact network and homophilous interactions in school. Based on return on investment and higher attack rates among children, we recommend prioritizing children (0 - 19 years) and seniors (65 + years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies. Based on risk of death, we recommend prioritizing seniors (65 + years) after high-risk groups for influenza vaccination during times of limited vaccine supplies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> have {{occurred}} at irregular intervals for over 500 years, unlike seasonal influenza epidemics which occur annually. Although {{the risk factors}} are known, {{the basis for the}} timing of <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> waves are unknown. Coherence of peaks of El Niño and <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> in 2009 – 2010, however, suggests that both waves are coupled. This study was done to determine the relation of <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> to the peaks and waveforms of El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO). ENSO cycles from 1871 – 2015 which had El Niño phases were windowed from Multivariate El Niño Index. <b>Influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> peaks were mapped to ENSO monthly time series. ENSO waveforms were compared graphically, and fitted to nonstationary cosinor models. Second order polynomial regression model was fitted to the peak and duration of El Niño. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster of ENSO waveforms was performed. All <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> peaks mapped to El Niño peaks, with lags of 0 – 5 months. ENSO waveforms during <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> share parameters of oscillation. Nonstationary cosinor models showed that ENSO cycles are complex waves. There was second order polynomial relationship between peak and duration of El Niños, p < 0. 0001. ENSO waveforms clustered into four distinct groups. ENSO waveforms during <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> of 1889 – 1900, 1957 – 1958, and 1968 – 1969 linked closely. ENSO indices were significantly high from 7 – 16 months after onset of cycles, p < 0. 0001. Surveillance for El Niño events to forecast periods of maximal transmission and survival of influenza A viruses is, therefore, crucial for public health control strategies...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{influenza}} virus A has an animal reservoir that contains all the known subtypes {{and it can}} undergo antigenic shift, this type of {{influenza virus}} is capable of producing <b>pandemics.</b> <b>Influenza</b> viruses A and B also cause seasonal epidemics every year due {{to their ability to}} antigenic shift. [...] Influenza virus C does not have this capability and it is not thought to be a significant concern for human health. Therefore, there are no vaccinations against influenza virus C.|$|R
25|$|Public Health Emergency Preparedness {{initiatives}} are {{managed by the}} CDC via the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Funds aim to support communities in preparing for public health emergencies, including <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza.</b> Also managed by the CDC, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) consists of bulk quantities of medicines and supplies for use during such emergencies. Antiviral stockpiles prepare for shortages of antiviral medications in cases of public health emergencies. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, guidelines for SNS use by local health departments was unclear, revealing gaps in antiviral planning. For example, local health departments that received antivirals from the SNS did not have transparent guidance {{on the use of}} the treatments. The gap made it difficult to create plans and policies for their use and future availabilities, causing delays in treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{circulating}} {{strain of}} influenza being the same, unmutant strain that caused global pandemic in 2009 (A H1N1 pdm 09), the sudden spurt {{of the cases}} {{in the beginning of}} 2015 left the Indian government unexplained but concerned. Government instructed the affected states to investigate into the epidemiological reasons of such spurt in the states, and had detailed the advisory guidelines to all states. The guidelines are mainly for (a) description of A H1N1 for prompt identification, detection, and distinction from the symptoms of other similar infection such as common flu(cold) (b) categorization of screening of influenza A H1N1 cases, (c) clinical management protocol of <b>Pandemic</b> <b>influenza</b> A H1N1, (d) providing home care, (e) collection of human sample. Besides, through the National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Government of India (GoI) had placed a tender to procure 8 kits of Assay sets, 37 kits of one step RT-PCR kit, and 36 kits of viral RNA extraction kits.|$|E

During the exercise, the BFSB – as part of Task Force Kitgum – performed command and control operations in Kitgum, Uganda, in order to synchronize multinational forces conducting field training exercises and humanitarian civic assistance operations to enhance interoperability among participating forces. the 560 BFSB served as a joint and multinational task force headquarters of over 1000 army, navy, air force, marines and personnel from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. This was the largest exercise of its kind in East Africa and the first test of a BFSB as a joint and multinational HQs.|$|E
40|$|II. Situation. Influenza {{epidemics}} occur seasonally, {{generally in}} winter months. Medical plans and annual vaccines minimize impacts of annual influenza epidemics in the United States (references a, c, d). <b>Influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> occur infrequently and cause substantially higher morbidity and mortality.

40|$|Abstract Background Healthcare {{workers have}} been {{identified}} as one of the high risk groups for being infected with <b>influenza</b> during <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Potential levels of absenteeism among healthcare workers in hospital settings are high. However, there was no study to explore the attitudes of healthcare workers in community setting towards the preparedness to the novel H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the willingness of community nurses in Hong Kong to work during H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among all 401 community nurses employed by the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong when the WHO pandemic alert level was 6. Results The response rate of this study was 66. 6 %. 76. 9 % participants reported being "not willing" (33. 3 %) or "not sure" (43. 6 %) to take care of patients during H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> The self-reported reasons for being unwilling to report to duty during H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> were psychological stress (55. 0 %) and fear of being infected H 1 N 1 influenza (29. 2 %). The reported unwillingness to report to duty was marginally significantly associated with the request for further training of using infection control clinical guideline (OR: 0. 057; CI: 0. 25 - 1. 02). Those who reported unwillingness or not being sure about taking care of the patients during H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> were more depressed (p Conclusions Interventions to provide infection control training and address community nurses' psychological needs might increase their willingness to provide care to patients in the community during H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> This would help to ensure an effective and appropriate health system response during the H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> </p...|$|R
