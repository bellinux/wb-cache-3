It also deals with issue of conversion of symbolic sequence into numerical form. Classifications of mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> are explained, basic types of mobile genetic sequences are described, and principles of numerical maps and detection in symbolic represetation are also clarified. Conversion of symbolic genetical sequences by chosen numerical map and calculation of normalized correlation values for set of mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> are compiled. Analysis of the mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> properties is performed for design of detector. The library of themes is created at the end for usage by designed detector...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the origin}} and {{function}} of homing endonucleases is still being researched, the most established hypothesis considers them as selfish <b>genetic</b> <b>elements,</b> similar to transposons, because they facilitate the perpetuation of the <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> that encode them independent of providing a functional attribute to the host organism.|$|R
40|$|Mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> are {{essential}} for the acquisition of new genetic information and genomic recombination. Among these, integrons and ICEs of the SXT/R 391 family are involved primarily in antibiotic resistance diffusion and in other adaptive functions in Vibrio. Many studies indicate that mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> are also important factors of genetic variability and suggest their role as potential vectors of cryptic functions. Resistance to drugs, molecular structure, geographic distribution and epidemiological relationship of these <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> circulating in Vibrio spp isolates from Africa and Vietnam (1985 - 2003) are described...|$|R

5000|$|Given these observations, {{researchers}} {{hypothesized that}} other classes of self-cleaving ribozymes would also associate with these <b>genetic</b> <b>elements.</b> Therefore, searches {{were conducted on}} the non-coding regions nearby to the associated <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> to find conserved RNA structures using a previously established method.

40|$|Some <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> spread infectiously in populations by {{increasing}} their rate of genetic transmission {{at the expense}} of other genes in the genome. These so-called selfish <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> comprise a substantial portion of eukaryotic genomes and have long been viewed as a potent evolutionary force. Despite this view, little is known about the evolutionary history of selfish <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> in natural populations, or their genetic effects on other portions of the genome. Here we use nuclear and chloroplast gene genealogies in two species of Silene to show the historical pattern of selection on a well known selfish <b>genetic</b> <b>element,</b> cytoplasmic male sterility. We provide evidence that evolution of cytoplasmic male sterility has been characterized by frequent turnovers of mutations in natural populations, thus supporting an epidemic model for the evolution of selfish genes, where new mutations repeatedly arise and rapidly sweep through populations...|$|R
40|$|The related <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> {{flanking}} the Bacteroides fragilis pathogenicity island (PAI) in enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) 86 - 5443 - 2 - 2 and {{also present in}} pattern III nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF) NCTC 9343 were defined as putative conjugative transposons (CTns), designated CTn 86 and CTn 9343, respectively (A. A. Franco, J. Bacteriol. 181 : 6623 - 6633, 2004). CTn 86 and CTn 9343 have the same basic structures except that their encoded transposases have low similarity and CTn 9343 lacks the B. fragilis PAI and contains an extra 7 -kb region not present in CTn 86. In this study, using DNA hybridization and PCR analysis, we characterized the <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> {{flanking the}} PAI {{in a collection of}} ETBF strains and the related <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> in a collection of NTBF pattern III strains. We found that in all 123 ETBF strains, the PAI is contained in a <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> similar to CTn 86. Of 73 pattern III strains, 26 (36 %) present a <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> similar to CTn 9343, 38 (52 %) present a <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> similar to CTn 9343 but lack the 7 -kb region that is also absent in CTn 86 (CTn 9343 -like element), and 9 (12 %) present a <b>genetic</b> <b>element</b> similar to CTn 86 but lacking the PAI (CTn 86 -like element). In addition to containing CTn 86, ETBF strains can also contain CTn 9343, CTn 9343 -like, or CTn 86 -like elements. CTn 86, CTn 9343, CTn 86 -like, and CTn 9343 -like elements were found exclusively in B. fragilis strains and predominantly in division I, cepA-positive strains...|$|R

40|$|Mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> {{are major}} agents of genome {{diversification}} and evolution. Limited studies addressed their characteristics, including abundance, and role in extreme habitats. One {{of the rare}} natural habitats exposed to multiple-extreme conditions, including high temperature, salinity and concentration of heavy metals, are the Red Sea brine pools. We assessed the abundance and distribution of different mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> in four Red Sea brine pools including the worldâ€™s largest known multiple-extreme deep-sea environment, the Red Sea Atlantis II Deep. We report a gradient in the abundance of mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements,</b> dramatically increasing in the harshest environment of the pool. Additionally, we identified a strong association between the abundance of insertion sequences and extreme conditions, being highest in the harshest and deepest layer of the Red Sea Atlantis II Deep. Our comparative analyses of mobile <b>genetic</b> <b>elements</b> in secluded, extreme and relatively non-extreme environments, suggest that insertion sequences predominantly contribute to polyextremophiles genome plasticity...|$|R

A d-xylose catabolic pathway was created using YPK with four or eight genes that resulted in one of the highest growth rates reported on d-xylose (0. 18 h- 1) for recombinant S. cerevisiae without adaptation.
