5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed <b>permits</b> <b>are</b> given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E

5|$|When Millennium Park {{first opened}} in 2004, Metra police stopped a Columbia College Chicago journalism student {{working on a}} {{photography}} project, and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism.
