5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars and lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{connected}} to the main power grid via household socket-outlets. Charging is done via a single-phase or three-phase network and installation of an earthing cable. A <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> is built into the cable. This solution is more expensive than Mode 1 due to the specificity of the cable.|$|E

Shear bolts which break when a plough body hits an obstruction are a cheaper overload <b>protection</b> <b>device.</b> It {{is important to}} use the correct replacement bolt.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In the {{advanced}} deep-submicron CMOS technology, {{it is more}} difficult to prevent damages from the ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) stresses. To understand the physical characteristics and ESD robustness of <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> a transmission line pulsing generator (TLPG) system had been set up in several companies to measure the secondary breakdown characteristics of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> The ESD level of ESD <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in CMOS IC’s is linearly dependent on the secondary breakdown current (It 2) of the ESD <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> The TLPG system is therefore used to measure and analyze the secondary breakdown characteristics of ESD <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> Based on the understanding on the secondary breakdown characteristics of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> some circuit techniques can be developed to improve the protection efficiency of the on-chip ESD protection circuits in the deep-submicron CMOS technologies...|$|R
40|$|For three {{fundamental}} input-protection schemes {{suitable for}} high-frequency CMOS ICs, which utilize <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> such as NMOS transistors, thyristors, and diodes, we attempt an in-depth comparison on HBM ESD robustness {{in terms of}} lattice heating inside <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> and peak voltages developed across gate oxides in input buffers, based on DC, mixed-mode transient, and AC analyses utilizing a 2 -dimensional device simulator. For this purpose, we construct an equivalent circuit model of input HBM test environments for CMOS chips equipped with input ESD protection circuits, which allows mixed-mode transient simulations for various HBM test modes. By executing mixed-mode simulations including up to six active <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> in a circuit, we attempt a detailed analysis on the problems, which can occur in real tests. In the procedure, we suggest to a recipe to ease the bipolar trigger in the <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> and figure out that oxide failure in internal circuits {{is determined by the}} peak voltage developed in the later stage of discharge, which corresponds to the junction breakdown voltage of the NMOS structure residing in the <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> We explain strength and weakness of each protection scheme as an input ESD protection circuit for high-frequency ICs, and suggest valuable guidelines relating design of the <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> and circuits...|$|R

The Rectiverter´s Surge <b>Protection</b> <b>Devices</b> (SPDs) are intended for ZONE 3 boundary, Class III <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> so a Zone 2, Class II SPD is desirable for maximum reliability.|$|R
25|$|A fire {{extinguisher}} {{is an active}} fire <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> used to extinguish or control small fires, often in emergency situations. It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire, such as one which has reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke, explosion hazard, etc.), or otherwise requires the expertise of a fire department. Typically, a {{fire extinguisher}} consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire. Fire extinguishers manufactured with non-cylindrical pressure vessels also exist, but are less common.|$|E
25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E

2500|$|At high optical intensities, above 2 megawatts {{per square}} centimeter, when a fiber is {{subjected}} to a shock or is otherwise suddenly damaged, a fiber fuse can occur. The reflection from the damage vaporizes the fiber immediately before the break, and this new defect remains reflective so that the damage propagates back toward the transmitter at 1–3 meters per second (4–11km/h, 2–8mph). The open fiber control system, which ensures laser eye safety {{in the event of}} a broken fiber, can also effectively halt propagation of the fiber fuse. In situations, such as undersea cables, where high power levels might be used without the need for open fiber control, a [...] "fiber fuse" [...] <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> at the transmitter can break the circuit to keep damage to a minimum.|$|E
2500|$|Damaged power cords of {{portable}} air conditioners cause many electrical fires and about 350 deaths per year. To combat this, each portable air conditioner {{sold in the}} United States is now required to have a leakage current detector interrupter (LCDI) or ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protective device built into its power cord. The device can be integral with the power plug, or a separate module within 12 inches of the plug. An LCDI cord has a fine wire mesh around the conductors, and circuitry to detect current leaking from the conductors to the mesh, which {{would happen if the}} cord were damaged or frayed. The plugs are normal NEMA 5-15, 5-20, 6-15, 6-20 or 6-30 plugs, depending on the air conditioner, typically molded-on plugs.

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{high rates of}} hearing loss, often NIHL, in firefighters, which {{increases}} with age and number of years working as a firefighter. [...] Hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with NIHL. Other {{attempts have been made}} to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) is responsible for occupational health programs and standards in firefighters which discusses what hearing sensitivity is required to work as a firefighter, but also enforces baseline (initial) and annual hearing tests (based on OSHA hearing maintenance regulations). While NIHL can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, NIHL can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. Hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the United States. Earmuffs are the most commonly used hearing <b>protection</b> <b>device</b> (HPD) as they are the most easy to put on correctly in a quick manner. Multiple fire departments have used HPDs that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.|$|E

50|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> noise assessments, and hearing testing are also more effective in improving the use of hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> compared with hearing testing alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing hearing protection equipment did reduce overall hearing loss.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To analyze whether sociodemographic, occupational, and {{health-related}} data {{are associated with}} the use of hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> at work, according to gender. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2006, using a random sample of 2, 429 workers, aged between 18 and 65 years old, from residential sub-areas in Salvador, BA, Northeastern Brazil. Questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic, occupational, and {{health-related data}}. Workers who reported that they worked in places where they needed to shout in order to be heard were considered to be exposed to noise. Exposed workers were asked whether they used hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> and if so, how frequently. Analyses were conducted according to gender, with estimates made about prevalence of the use of hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices,</b> prevalence ratios, and their respective 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS Twelve percent (12. 3 %) of study subjects reported that they were exposed to noise while working. Prevalence of the use of hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> was 59. 3 % for men and 21. 4 % for women. Men from higher socioeconomic levels (PR = 1. 47; 95 %CI 1. 14; 1. 90) and who had previous audiometric tests (PR = 1. 47; 95 %CI 1. 15; 1. 88) were more likely to use hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices.</b> For women, greater perceived safety was {{associated with the use of}} <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> (PR = 2. 92; 95 %CI 1. 34; 6. 34). This perception was specifically related to the presence of supervisors committed to safety (PR = 2. 09; 95 %CI 1. 04; 4. 21), the existence of clear rules to prevent workplace injuries (PR = 2. 81; 95 %CI 1. 41; 5. 59), and whether they were informed about workplace safety (PR = 2. 42; 95 %CI 1. 23; 4. 76). CONCLUSIONS There is a gender bias regarding the use of hearing <b>protection</b> <b>devices</b> that is less favorable to women. The use of such devices among women is positively influenced by their perception of a safe workplace, suggesting that gender should be considered as a factor in hearing conservation programs...|$|R
