5|$|The {{hull and}} single funnel {{amidships}} were both finished in black <b>paint,</b> <b>with</b> a single white stripe running {{the length of}} the hull highlighting a row of false gunports. The hull was flat-bottomed, with no external keel, and with bulges low on each side amidships which continued toward the stern in an unusual implementation of tumblehome—a result of the late decision to install propeller engines, which were wider at the base than the originally planned paddlewheel engines.|$|E
5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{the ride}} {{received}} a new coat of <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> Victorian-style architecture around the station. In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Giant Dipper was almost completely untouched. The ride {{was closed for}} about a month to be inspected. The park held a benefit for victims of the earthquake. In 2002, the ride celebrated its 50 millionth rider. Ten years after the 50 millionth rider, the park celebrated the Giant Dipper's 60 millionth rider on July 27, 2012. The park gave out trivia coasters leading up to the event. The 24 riders that were on the train when it hit 60 million riders received a hoodie among other prizes.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{the blue}} areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> indigo, while the green areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> indigo, a copper green (likely to be a basic copper {{chloride}} and possibly malachite) and a trace amount of orpiment. The yellow regions {{were most likely}} <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> an organic yellow such as gamboge. The red areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> vermilion and the dull red areas were <b>painted</b> <b>with</b> vermilion and {{a small amount of}} indigo. The suite of non-invasive techniques applied on the green fragments need to be applied directly on the map to areas of other colours to confirm the identification of the yellow pigments and give a fuller picture of the colorants used and the way they were used.|$|R

5|$|Nevinson {{obtained}} a commission from the Royal Air Force to portray airmen {{preparing for the}} Dieppe raid in August 1942 and they also allowed him to fly in their planes to develop pictures of the air war. He presented a painting, a cloudscape entitled The Battlefields of Britain, to Winston Churchill {{as a gift to}} the nation and which still hangs in Downing Street. Shortly afterwards a stroke paralysed his right hand and caused a speech impediment. He applied for a junior clerical post with WAAC and was refused. Nevinson taught himself to <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> his left hand and had three pictures shown at the Royal Academy in the summer of 1946. He attended that exhibition, with the assistance of his wife Kathleen, in a wheelchair but died a few months later aged fifty-seven.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1968, the PRR {{merged with}} New York Central Railroad to become Penn Central. The {{remainder}} of the cars were delivered with Penn Central logos, but retained the PRR-specified livery of gray <b>paint</b> <b>with</b> red pinstripes. On March 2, the first GE-powered Metroliners arrived for testing. The pantographs on the Westinghouse-powered cars would bounce on the aging catenary wires, then draw high currents due to improperly designed transformers. The GE-powered cars proved to have a superior pantograph design, but were still not fit for service. On March 12, entry into revenue service was delayed indefinitely. Testing was suspended entirely between June 24 and mid-July; tests with 6-car trains in July had severe issues with electrical arcing. The first combined test train of GE and Westinghouse cars ran on August 8.|$|E

Additionally, Lionel criticized the durability of competitors' products in ads targeted at parents.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Paris, Sargent quickly {{received}} several portrait commissions. His career was launched.
