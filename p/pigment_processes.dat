40|$|Abstract – Located on {{the eastern}} shores of South Africa, 180 km north of Durban, Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) {{produces}} approximately 2. 0 million metric tonnes of product annually making RBM a leading producer of titania slag, high purity pig iron, rutile and zircon. Heavy minerals are extracted from the nearby dunes by dredging and concentration on a floating gravity separation plant, followed by separation of the ilmenite, rutile and zircon at the mineral separation plant located at the smelter site. The ilmenite is processed through an oxidizing roast followed by magnetic separation and is then partially reduced to an 85 per cent TiO 2 slag in one of four six-in-line a. c. electric arc furnaces. The slag is milled and then classified into two product sizes suitable as a raw material for both the sulphate and chloride <b>pigment</b> <b>processes.</b> The high quality iron produced during the reduction process is further processed to produce various grades of low-manganese iron. Around 95 per cent of the products are exported, yielding a world market share of about 25 per cent of titania slag, rutile, high quality pig iron, and zircon...|$|E

40|$|Short-rotation tree {{plantations}} {{were established}} at seven industrial waste disposal sites in southern Finland. Altogether 31, 500 willow cuttings were planted between 1984 and 1989.

Biological sludges from a municipal sewage treatment plant, and {{pulp and paper}} mills were too compact to be used alone as substrate, but gave a good supply of nutrients. Sand, bark and de-inking waste were sufficiently porous, but were low in nutrients. A mixture of different waste materials is therefore recommended as a substrate for willow stands. Replacement of a natural soil cover with waste material allows disposal of a greater volume of refuse and diminishes the costs of revegetation.

We {{examine the}} light transmission {{and location of}} the yellow/orange pigment throughout the cornea, the temporal properties of pigment migration and the ultrastructure of the <b>pigmented</b> <b>processes</b> during light- and dark-adaptation. Each species was dark-adapted {{during the day and}} light-adapted during the night and then exposed to either sun illumination or darkness for different lengths of time (0 - 70 min). Movement of corneal pigment could be induced in both species regardless of time of day or night. The pigment was able to migrate in a dorsal or ventral direction and changed from minimal to maximal pigmentation within 60 min. Three types of transmission curves were found with varying degrees of transmission in the 400 - 500 nm waveband, indicating that the pigment distribution is not uniform across the cornea; some areas of the cornea transmit near UV light, while others absorb blue light. The gradual change of the transmission characteristics in different areas of the cornea indicates the presence of different concentrations of a single type of pigment. Ultrastructural examination of the corneas showed that the layer containing the pigment is situated within the scleral cornea either surrounding (T. pleurogramma) or abutting (T. hamiltoni) an iridescent layer. Long sheet-like processes or chromatophores extending centrally from dorsal and ventral reservoirs are filled with pigment during the light-adapted state but empty in the dark-adapted state...|$|R

40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} of {{the visual}} cells of the mudpuppy Necturus have revealed several new or hitherto neglected features of organization: (a) A system of deeply staining micelles in virtually crystalline array, probably located in the lamellae of the rod outer segments. These particles may contain the visual pigment, porphyropsin. Counts of the micelles, and microspectrophotometric measurements of porphyropsin in the retina and single rods yield the estimate that each lamellar micelle may contain about 50 molecules of porphyropsin. (b) Systems of about 30 cytoplasmic filaments (here called dendrites), continuous with the cytoplasm of the inner segment, and standing like a palisade about the outer segments of the rods and cones. In the rods, one such filament stands {{in the mouth of}} each of the approximately 30 deep fissures that carve the outer segment into a radial array of lobules. (c) A system of deeply staining particles in the membranes of the dendrites, and another in the membranes of the <b>pigment</b> epithelial <b>processes.</b> It is suggested that these may have a part in interchanges of material with the outer segments. The ciliary process is found to penetrate more deeply than is commonly supposed into the outer segments of the rods and cones. The edge of each double-membrane disc in rods forms a differentiated rim structure, both around the disc circumference and bordering the fissures. These anatomical arrangements are summarized in Figs. 13 and 14, and the relevant measurements in Table I. The dilution of visual pigment in Necturus rods and cones and a general consideration of their microstructures make it seem unlikely that such typically solid state processes as exciton migration or photoconduction can transport the effects of light far from the site of absorption. Excitation must, therefore, be conveyed to the receptor as a whole by some axial structure. Among axial structures, the plasma membrane is most likely to be the site of nervous excitation. The ciliary process probably plays its main role in the embryogenesis and regeneration of outer segments; and the dendrites and <b>pigment</b> epithelial <b>processes</b> in exchanges of material with the outer segments and perhaps with one another...|$|R

Previous studies of these pigmented capsalids have proven difficult because the pigmentation usually disappears when the worms are fixed using preservatives containing concentrations of formalin over 5 % and/or ethanol, acetic acid, chromic acid, picric acid and mercuric chloride.
