40|$|The {{invention}} is {{an improvement}} in a lightweight carbon-carbon composite piston, the improvement uses near-net shape knitted or warp-interlock preforms to improve the structural qualities of the piston. In its preferred embodiment, a one piece, tubular, closed-ended, knitted preform (a sock) of carbon fibers embedded within the matrix of the piston structure forms the crown, side wall, skirt and inner surface of the piston, and wrap-interlock preforms strengthen the piston crown and wrist <b>pin</b> <b>bosses...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the fatigue}} failure and the {{fracture}} injury occurs under the alternative mechanical loads, the optimal {{design of the}} piston pin and the piston <b>pin</b> <b>boss</b> is presented depending on the FEA static analysis. The optimization is carried out using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the piston noncircular pin hole is used to further reduce the stress concentration on {{the upper end of}} the piston pin seat...|$|R
50|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard was a {{standard}} wrestling {{match for the}} WWF Championship. The Big Show defended the title against the Big Boss Man. Boss Man's enforcer Prince Albert continuously interfered on his behalf throughout the match, prompting Big Show to perform a Chokeslam on Albert through the Spanish announce table. Big Show defeated Boss Man to retain the WWF Championship title by <b>pinning</b> <b>Boss</b> Man after chokeslamming him.|$|R
500|$|The next {{match was}} between the Big Boss Man, {{accompanied}} by Slick, and [...] "The Bird Man" [...] Koko B. Ware. With Slick as a distraction, the Big Boss Man took the early advantage in the match. After crushing Koko in {{between himself and the}} turnbuckle with a jumping Avalanche, Boss Man refused to pin him and finish the match. Instead, he attempted to climb to the top rope and land on Koko stomach-first, but missed. The Bird Man then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a <b>pin.</b> <b>Boss</b> Man got his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned, and he slammed his opponent into the mat, allowing him to pin Koko for the win.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Piston {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{stressed}} components of an engine. In this paper, a 1 / 2 3 -D solid model of a new designed piston was built by using ANSYS software. The stable stress distribution and the deformation under the thermo-mechanical coupling condition were firstly calculated. Calculating results indicates that the maximum stress concentration is at the upper end of piston <b>pin</b> <b>boss</b> inner hole, and is mainly caused by the peak pressure of the fuel gas. Then the finite element dynamic analysis was conducted based on the mechanical fatigue testing method, and the mechanical fatigue life-span was calculated. All these work indicate that the design of the piton is reasonable...|$|R

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of aluminium}} piston alloys comprises primary and eutectic silicon together with numerous intermetallics. Previous {{research has shown}} that primary silicon strongly influences both fatigue crack initiation and subsequent propagation behaviour, however, the detailed effects of varying silicon volume fraction and morphology have not been fully addressed. Therefore, the fatigue properties of a number of candidate piston alloys with varying volume fractions of silicon have been studied. Long crack fatigue tests have been performed at room and elevated temperature typical of the gudgeon <b>pin</b> <b>boss</b> (200 8 C) using a test frequency of 15 Hz (a typical engine frequency at engine idle condition). Microstructural characterisation using image analysis approaches combined with optical profilometry has been used to assess the fracture surfaces of test samples. The role of primary Si in enhancing crack growth rates at high DK levels, whilst affording improvements in crack growth rates at lower DK levels due to local crack deflections and shielding, has been confirmed. In the absence of primary Si (lower Si content alloys) the low DK level crack growth behaviour is dominated by matrix properties (intra-dendritic crack growth pre-dominates) whilst the high DK level crack growth behaviour is inter-dendritic and occurs along the weak path of the eutectic Si and/or intermetallic network...|$|R
50|$|Before {{the event}} aired live on pay-per-view, Boris Zhukov {{defeated}} Paul Roma {{in a dark}} match. The first Survivor Series match was between The Dream Team (Dusty Rhodes, Brutus Beefcake, The Red Rooster and Tito Santana) and The Enforcers (Big Boss Man, Bad News Brown, Rick Martel and The Honky Tonk Man). Originally, Boss Man's tag team The Twin Towers partner Akeem {{was scheduled to be}} a part of The Enforcers but was replaced by Brown. Rick Martel and Tito Santana, two former Strike Force partners and current rivals began the match. Martel pinned Santana with a roll-up, eliminating Santana, leaving Dream Team with three members. Sapphire made her debut in the audience cheering on Dusty Rhodes. Like the previous year, Bad News Brown walked out on his team after arguing with team captain Big Boss Man and getting counted-out. Enforcers had also three members. Now both teams were having equal members until Brutus Beefcake pinned Honky Tonk Man after a high knee, eliminating Honky and leaving Enforcers with only two members - Boss Man and Martel. Martel entered but failed to eliminate Beefcake. Instead, Beefcake pinned Martel with a roll-up, eliminating him and leaving Enforcers' captain Boss Man as the remaining member. He managed to pin Red Rooster after a Boss Man Slam. He fought the opposing Dream Team's captain Dusty Rhodes. The two captains had a battle with each other, which Rhodes won after he <b>pinned</b> <b>Boss</b> Man with a flying crossbody. Dream Team won with Rhodes and Beefcake as the survivors.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{pay-per-view}} event went on air, {{the crowd}} was warmed up with the cable television program Sunday Night Heat which consisted of four matches. In an intergender tag team contest, Val Venis and Nicole Bass defeated D'Lo Brown and Ivory when Nicole Bass pinned Ivory. Afterward Bass made sexual advances to Venis who quickly departed. In another tag team match, Droz and Prince Albert defeated Too Much (Brian Christopher and Scott Taylor) when Albert pinned Scott Taylor. After this Kane <b>pinned</b> The Big <b>Boss</b> Man in a singles match. The final match of the show saw Viscera pin Test after Big Boss Man hit Test with a nightstick, pretending to be aiming for Viscera.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The components of a modem internal combustion engine are required to give extreme reliability over extended periods of operation and none is exposed to more arduous conditions than the piston, especially in the <b>pin</b> <b>boss</b> and crown regions of pistons for diesel engines. The increasing emissions requirements and performance targets demanded of direct injection diesel engines has resulted in steep increases in both specific powers and maximum cylinder pressures. This has in turn lead to greater temperatures and pressures being felt by the piston. The adaptation of the piston design to these increasingly demanding load and temperature conditions has required a continuous improvement and innovation {{in the field of}} materials and process technologies. The vast majority of the internal combustion engine pistons produced globally are made by a gravity die casting process using Al-Si based alloys. Although Al-Si alloys {{have been the subject of}} a great deal of research over the last 30 years, the majority of work has been based on fairly rudimentary characterisation of the microstructures as a function of alloy chemistry and cooling rate. Most of the attention has been paid to the silicon morphology and distribution rather than on a fundamental knowledge of the development of the complex microstructures and intermetallic phases that arise in commercial alloys. However, the properties of cast near-eutectica: luminium-silicon alloys are very strongly influenced by the microstructure, i. e. the primary aluminium, and the interdendritic microconstituents, such as secondary phases, intermetallics, inclusions and porosity. A fine and uniform grain size is often desired as it improves mechanical properties of castings such as tensile strength, ductility and fatigue resistance, and at the same time aids castability, improves porosity distributions and reduces hot tearing susceptibility. A thorough phase characterisation has been carried out using a number of techniques including optical and electron microscopy with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and image analysis. Use was also made of thermodynamic modelling to predict the volume fraction and distribution of phases within the microstructure as a function of chemical composition and process parameters. From this analysis a detailed understanding of the phases occuffing in multicomponent Al-Si alloys was established. Furthermore, additions associated with grain refining, i. e. Ti, Zr and V, have been investigated systematically using commercial and model alloy systems. All three additions were observed to refine the structure of the castings through the formation of the phase A 13 Ti, although combined additions with Zr were found to be less efficient due to a 'poisoning' effect on the A 13 Ti. It was also established that there is a strong competition between the effects of grain refiners and P, with the formation of AbTi reducing the nucleating efficiency of AIP to silicon. The nucleation and growth of the primary silicon phase were thus examined by EBSD. AIP was confirmed as nucleating the silicon epitaxially, after which growth continues by surface nucleation, although the presence of twins were seen to influence the shape of the crystal. Finally, suggestions have been made as a consequence of this work for the future development of piston alloys...|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Rinnko in a {{colourful}} dress standing still, then falling to the ground. She is surrounded by paparazzi in suits in a concrete building. Linnko, wearing dark leather, bends down to look at Rinnko's body, and begins to move her arms in martial arts-like stances. She then attacks the paparazzi, knocking one into a pile of cardboard boxes and pushing one off of a ledge. The video shows a boss at a desk, angrily addressing more paparazzi. Linnko looks at a locket she's holding in her hand, featuring {{a picture of her}} with Rinnko. The video then shows Rinnko and Linnko dancing together with megaphones. Behind them are the kanji 凜凜, in blue and pink neon lights. Linnko makes her way to the <b>boss,</b> <b>pinning</b> him against a wall. She dodges an axe, and throws two round shuriken at her assailant. She strangles the paparazzi boss, and makes his office explode. The final shot depicts a Buddhist monk sitting in a traditional Japanese room, thinking.|$|R
50|$|In {{the main}} event The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage), Hercules, Koko B. Ware and Hillbilly Jim squared off against The Twin Towers (Akeem and the Big Boss Man), Ted DiBiase, Haku and The Red Rooster. Savage hit a Savage Elbow on Rooster to pin and {{eliminate}} him, giving the Mega Powers an early edge. The big Akeem quickly evened the two sides after overpowering Hillbilly Jim and striking him with the Air Africa splash for the <b>pin.</b> Akeem's partner <b>Boss</b> Man hit Koko with a Boss Man Slam to give the Twin Towers a 4-3 advantage. DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil distracted Hercules, allowing DiBiase to pin him with a schoolboy, leaving just team captains Hogan and Savage in the Mega Powers' corner. As DiBiase was taunting Hercules, Savage immediately pinned him with a schoolboy to eliminate him, leaving three members in Twin Towers' corner. Shortly thereafter, Slick (the manager of the Twin Towers) grabbed Elizabeth and—while pulling her away from ringside—began screaming threats at her, prompting Hogan {{to come to her}} rescue; Akeem and Boss Man intervened, hitting Hogan before Boss Man handcuffed Hogan to the ropes. In the process, Boss Man (the legal man in the ring) was counted out while Akeem was disqualified for shoving the referee and illegally double-teaming Savage. Haku, left as {{the only member of the}} heel team, dominated Savage for several minutes as Slick (who remained at ringside) taunted both Hogan and Elizabeth. Eventually, Haku accidentally kicked Slick from the ring apron (after a mistimed illegal double team on Savage) while Hogan clotheslined Heenan. After Elizabeth grabbed the key to unlock his handcuffs, Hogan was tagged into the match after Haku kicked an exhausted Savage into his corner. Hogan quickly dominated Haku and pinned him with a leg drop to score the win for the Mega Powers. After the match, Hogan began acting friendly toward Elizabeth, clearly upsetting Savage, whose reaction was known to the crowd and television audience but not acknowledged by Hogan; pro-heel color commentator Jesse Ventura also picked up on this and interviewed him later about the incident.|$|R
