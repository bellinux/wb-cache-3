Later the same year, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of Gustavus Adolphus College, Minnesota reviewed the book in Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online and while praising aspects of the book also asserted that it was [...] "shaped by the author's overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths", that Malcolm was [...] "partisan", and also complained that the book made a [...] "transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false". Malcolm responded in the same journal in early 2000, asserting that the book challenged both Albanian and Serbian myths about Kosovo, but that there were more Serbian myths about Kosovo than Albanian ones and this explained the greater coverage of Serbian myths in the book. He also observed that Emmert's perspective and work was largely within the framework of Serbian historiography, and that Emmert's own perspective was the reason for Emmert's assertion that Malcolm was [...] "partisan".|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} Rule 801 (d) ’s oxymoronic {{treatment of}} admissions and <b>prior</b> <b>statements</b> as “not hearsay. ” This “not hearsay” label is inaccurate – {{the evidence is}} hearsay, as defined in Rule 801 (c) – and is inconsistent with the analytically important and well-established {{use of the term}} not hearsay to describe evidence that is actually not hearsay. The Article tells the story of how the drafters of the Federal Rules of Evidence ended up with such a confused and confusing label and proposes an amendment that would classify admissions and <b>prior</b> <b>statements</b> as hearsay exceptions and place each in a new, separate, appropriately labeled category. The oxymoronic treatment has its roots in a longstanding debate between Wigmore and Morgan over the proper classification of admissions. The three codes that preceded the Federal Rules of Evidence [...] the Model Code, the Uniform Rules and the California Evidence Code – resolved that debate in favor of the Morgan view that admissions should be treated as a hearsay exception. However, Reporter Edward Cleary rejected Morgan’s view and came up with his own idiosyncratic and unfortunately oxymoronic formulation, which was uncritically accepted by the Advisory Committee and then adopted by Congress and 37 of the 44 states that have adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence. Because admissions and <b>prior</b> <b>statements</b> are hearsay evidence, they should be classified as hearsay exceptions. However, because they are distinctively different than the other hearsay exceptions, they should not be placed in either the Rule 803 or Rule 804 categories but in their own distinct categories. Drawing on the examples of several state evidence codes that rejected the FRE Rule 801 (d) classification, the Article develops a more appropriate alternative treatment for admissions and <b>prior</b> <b>statements</b> and presents the case for amending Rule 801 (d) ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, ConnectU filed {{a lawsuit}} against Facebook alleging that creator Mark Zuckerberg had broken an oral {{contract}} with them. The suit alleged that Zuckerberg had copied their idea and illegally used source code intended for the website he was hired to create. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub, another campus service. It named among the defendants ConnectU, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, Divya Narendra, Winston Williams, and Wayne Chang, founder of i2hub. A settlement agreement for both cases was reached in February 2008, reportedly valued at $65 million. [...] However, in May 2010, it was reported that ConnectU is accusing Facebook of securities fraud on the value of the stock {{that was part of the}} settlement and wants to get the settlement undone. [...] According to ConnectU's allegations, the value of the stock was worth $11 million instead of $45 million that Facebook presented at the time of settlement. [...] This meant the settlement value, at the time, was $31 million, instead of the $65 million. On August 26, 2010, The New York Times reported that Facebook shares were trading at $76 per share in the secondary market, putting the total settlement value at close to $120 million. If the lawsuit to adjust the settlement to match the difference goes through, the value will quadruple to over $466 million. According to Steven M. Davidoff, [...] "Facebook never represented its valuation in this negotiation, and so there is no <b>prior</b> <b>statement</b> that the company needs to correct."
