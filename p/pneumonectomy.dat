5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (<b>pneumonectomy)</b> is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} <b>pneumonectomy</b> for lung cancer {{was performed in}} 1933. Palliative radiotherapy has been used since the 1940s. Radical radiotherapy, initially used in the 1950s, {{was an attempt to}} use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit for surgery. In 1997, continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was seen as an improvement over conventional radical radiotherapy. With small-cell lung carcinoma, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection and radical radiotherapy were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, <b>pneumonectomy</b> or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. <b>Pneumonectomy</b> is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

30|$|Although a {{majority}} of P-EMC cases, as in our case, behave indolently, several poor progression cases have been reported. For distinguishing the minor malignancy cases from others, histological findings such as myoepithelial anaplasia could be a predictive factor. Complete resection is needed to evaluate the whole tumor, because P-EMCs often show histological heterogeneity. Moreover, incomplete excision may be a poor prognostic factor. Although lobectomies as well as lymph node dissections, sleeve lobectomies, or <b>pneumonectomies</b> are routinely performed for complete resection, further investigation is required to establish the optimal treatment strategy.|$|R

500|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} is {{a common}} result of certain types of surgery; for example {{it is not unusual}} in chest surgery. [...] It may also occur from surgery around the esophagus, and is particularly likely in prolonged surgery. Other potential causes are positive pressure ventilation for any reason and by any technique, in which its occurrence is frequently unexpected. It may also occur as a result of oral surgery, laparoscopy, and cricothyrotomy. [...] In a <b>pneumonectomy,</b> in which an entire lung is removed, the remaining bronchial stump may leak air, a rare but very serious condition that leads to progressive subcutaneous emphysema. Air can leak out of the pleural space through an incision made for a thoracotomy to cause subcutaneous emphysema. [...] On infrequent occasions, the condition can result from dental surgery, usually due to use of high-speed tools that are air driven. [...] These cases result in usually painless swelling of the face and neck, with an immediate onset, the crepitus (crunching sound) typical of subcutaneous emphysema, and often with subcutaneous air visible on X-ray.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveMultidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} still {{continues to}} be a major health problem. Adjuvant surgical resection combined with antituberculous drug management is the most favorable treatment modality for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. In this article we report the results of surgical resections we performed during the years 1993 through 2005. MethodsWe performed 81 lung resections in 79 patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. All these patients had at least 2 months of medical therapy before resection. Bronchial reinforcement was performed in 4 of the 81 operations. We present here the surgical results of the 81 procedures. Because 5 of 79 patients were lost to follow-up, we provide the medical treatment results on 74 of the patients. ResultsDuring this period, we performed 4 completion <b>pneumonectomies,</b> 39 <b>pneumonectomies,</b> 7 lobectomies with segmentectomy, 30 lobectomies, and 1 segmentectomy. Operative mortality was 2. 5 % (2 / 81). Bronchopleural fistula developed in 4 (4. 9 %) cases. Our overall cure rate was 94. 5 % (70 / 74). Relapse and treatment failure were 1. 3 % (1 / 74) and 1. 3 % (1 / 74), respectively. All but 5 patients are still under our follow-up. ConclusionsSurgical resection of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis combined with chemotherapy provides a favorable outcome. Our results will need to be validated more strongly by using randomized clinical trials that compare surgical resection plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone...|$|R
2500|$|As {{with other}} chest {{injuries}} such as pulmonary contusion, hemothorax, and pneumothorax, pulmonary laceration {{can often be}} treated with just supplemental oxygen, ventilation, and drainage of fluids from the chest cavity. A thoracostomy tube {{can be used to}} remove blood and air from the chest cavity. About 5% of cases require surgery, called thoracotomy. Thoracotomy is especially likely to be needed if a lung fails to re-expand; if pneumothorax, bleeding, or coughing up blood persist; or in order to remove clotted blood from a hemothorax. [...] Surgical treatment includes suturing, stapling, oversewing, and wedging out of the laceration.

40|$|ObjectiveBecause {{extensively}} {{drug-resistant tuberculosis}} has emerged, adequate control of drug-resistant tuberculosis {{has become increasingly}} important. We report on our experience using liberal adjuvant resectional surgery as part of aggressive treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the records of 56 consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary resections for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis between January 2000 and June 2007. There were 42 males and 14 females (mean age, 46 years; range, 22 - 64 years). Isolates were resistant to a mean of 5. 6 drugs (range, 2 - 10 drugs). Multi-drug regimens employing 3 to 7 drugs (mean, 4. 6 drugs) were initiated in all patients. Indications for surgery were {{a high risk of}} relapse for 37 patients, persistent positive sputum for 18, and 1 with associated empyema. ResultsThe 56 patients underwent 61 pulmonary resections (3 completion <b>pneumonectomies,</b> 19 <b>pneumonectomies,</b> 33 lobectomies, and 6 segmentectomies). Bronchial stumps were reinforced with muscle flaps in 54 resections. Operative mortality and morbidity rates were 0 % and 16 %, respectively. All patients attained postoperative sputum-negative status. Relapse occurred in 5 patients; 3 were converted by a second resection, and 1 responded to augmentation of chemotherapy. Late death occurred for 2 patients without evidence of relapse. Among 54 survivors, 53 (98 %) were considered cured.

40|$|Background—Extensively-drug {{resistant}} tuberculosis (XDR-TB) {{has been}} reported in 58 countries around the world and has emerged as a major public health challenge.

Methods—We conducted a retrospective case review of XDR-TB patients who underwent pulmonary resection between January 2007 and December 2009. Results—Two <b>pneumonectomies</b> and two right upper lobectomies were performed. No operative mortality or major morbidity was noted. All patients achieved sputum conversion and were ultimately regarded as either a “cure ” or “probable cure”. Conclusions—Although the initial cohort of XDR-TB patients from Tugela Ferry demonstrated near complete mortality, our results demonstrate the potential of adjuvant surgical methods in XDR-TB treatment. With appropriate neoadjuvant chemotherapy and timeous surgery, patients with disease localized to lobe or lung XDR-TB may achieve a “cure ” with low morbidity and mortality.
