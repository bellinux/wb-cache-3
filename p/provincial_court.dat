After {{employees of the}} Liquor Control and Licensing Branch told Ince that the art installation would likely result in the refusal of a special event liquor licence, the party asked for judicial review. Both a <b>provincial</b> <b>court</b> and an appeal court refused the review because an actual application had not been submitted for a decision to be reviewed, and the fundraiser went ahead with the serving of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to {{form the}} new province's first government. As premier, his first task was to win a {{workable}} majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, which {{he did in the}} 1905 provincial election. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established everything from speed limits to a <b>provincial</b> <b>court</b> system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected Edmonton over rival Calgary as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the University of Alberta, a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of Strathcona, just across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton.|$|E

50|$|The 1997 Reference caused {{numerous}} challenges {{regarding the}} creation of compensation committees. Some governments needed more time to establish and consult them. Moreover, by finding <b>provincial</b> <b>courts</b> were not independent because salary commissions were not used, the Reference seemed to imply criminal law decisions by <b>provincial</b> <b>courts</b> were invalid under section 11(d), since defendants were not tried before independent tribunals. Consequently, the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island turned to the Court again. In Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2) (1998), Lamer for a unanimous court decided that necessity dictated that dependent <b>provincial</b> <b>courts</b> be deemed acceptable for the time being. Also {{as a result of}} the second decision, the requirement for commissions did not become binding until September 18, 1998.|$|R

The Supreme Court replied more independence may be [...] "highly desirable," [...] but it was not [...] "essential for purposes of s. 11(d)." ...|$|R

25|$|The Canadian {{constitution}} {{gives the}} federal government the exclusive right to legislate criminal law while the provinces have exclusive control over civil law. The provinces have jurisdiction over the administration of justice in their territory. Almost all cases, whether criminal or civil, start in <b>provincial</b> <b>courts</b> and may be eventually appealed to higher level courts. The quite small system of federal courts only hears cases concerned with matters which are under exclusive federal control, such as federal taxation, federal administrative agencies, intellectual property, some portions of competition law and certain aspects of national security. The federal government appoints and pays for both the judges of the federal courts and the judges of the superior and appellate level courts of each province. The provincial governments are responsible for appointing judges of the lower <b>provincial</b> <b>courts.</b> <b>Provincial</b> administrative tribunals also comprise part of <b>provincial</b> <b>courts.</b> This intricate interweaving of federal and provincial powers {{is typical of the}} Canadian constitution.|$|R
