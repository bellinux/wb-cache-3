5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true <b>seals</b> (<b>Phocidae)</b> and eared <b>seals</b> (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|R
500|$|Monk seals {{are part}} of the family <b>Phocidae</b> (earless <b>seals),</b> the members of which are {{characterized}} by their lack of external ears, the inability to rotate the hind flippers under the body, and shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual molt. Monk seals as a whole vary minutely in size, with all adults measuring on average [...] and [...] They exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are slightly larger than females, {{with the exception of the}} Hawaiian monk seal where females are larger. Its white belly, gray coat, and slender physique distinguish it from the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), another earless seal. Much like elephant seals, they shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual molt.|$|R
50|$|Other than {{occasional}} vagrants, {{among the}} <b>seals</b> only the <b>Phocidae,</b> or earless <b>seals,</b> are represented. Two species, the grey seal and harbour or common seal, are present around {{the coast of}} Scotland in internationally important numbers. In 2002 the Scottish grey seal population was estimated at 120,600 adult animals, which is around 36% of the world population and more than 90% of the UK's. The Scottish population of the common seal is 29,700, about 90% of the UK and 36% of the European total.|$|R
40|$|The strict orthology of {{mitochondrial}} (mt) coding sequences {{has promoted}} {{their use in}} phylogenetic analyses at different levels. Here we present {{the results of a}} mitogenomic study (i. e., analysis based on the set of protein-coding genes from complete mt genomes) of 60 mammalian species. This number includes 11 new mt genomes. The sampling comprises {{all but one of the}} traditional eutherian orders. The previously unrepresented order Dermoptera (flying lemurs) fell within Primates as the sister group of Anthropoidea, making Primates paraphyletic. This relationship was strongly supported. Lipotyphla ("insectivores") split into three distinct lineages: Erinaceomorpha, Tenrecomorpha, and Soricomorpha. Erinaceomorpha was the basal eutherian lineage. Sirenia (dugong) and Macroscelidea (elephant shrew) fell within the African clade. Pholidota (pangolin) joined the Cetferungulata as the sister group of Carnivora. The analyses identified monophyletic Pinnipedia with Otariidae (sea lions, fur seals) and Odobenidae (walruses) as sister groups to the exclusion of <b>Phocidae</b> (true <b>seals)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Enaliarctos {{has been}} heralded as the {{ancestor}} of all known pinnipeds, including the families Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), Desmatophocidae (extinct <b>seal</b> convergent pinnipeds), <b>Phocidae</b> (true <b>seals),</b> and Odobenidae (walruses). Investigations of the biomechanics of Enaliarctos {{indicate that it}} used both its forelimbs and hindlimbs during swimming. Modern fur seals and sea lions only use their forelimbs, while true seals primarily use their hindlimbs for aquatic propulsion; lastly, the extant walrus uses both fore- and hindlimbs for swimming. It has been postulated that the condition in Enaliarctos is ancestral for all pinnipeds, and that forelimb swimming was lost in true seals, while hindlimb swimming was lost in fur seals and sea lions. This is significant {{because there has been}} considerable debate as to whether pinnipeds share common ancestry. Interpretation of Enaliarctos indicates that all pinnipeds share a common ancestor (which, if it was not Enaliarctos, must have been something very similar, such as the more newly discovered Puijila darwini.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{superfamily}} Canoidea (or suborder Caniformia) - Canidae (wolves, {{dogs and}} foxes), Mephitidae (skunks and stink badgers), Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, and otters), Procyonidae (raccoons), Ursidae (bears), Ailuridae (red panda), Otariidae (eared seals), Odobenidae (walrus), and <b>Phocidae</b> (earless <b>seals)</b> (the last three families formerly {{classified in the}} superfamily Pinnipedia) and the extinct family Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) - are characterized by having nonchambered or partially chambered auditory bullae, nonretractable claws, and a well-developed baculum. Most species are rather plain in coloration, lacking the flashy spotted or rosetted coats like many species of felids and viverrids have. This is because Canoidea tend to range in the temperate and subarctic biomes, although Mustelidae and Procyonidae have a few tropical species. Most are terrestrial, although a few species, like procyonids, are arboreal. All families except the Canidae and a few species of Mustelidae are plantigrade. Diet is varied and most tend to be omnivorous to some degree, and thus the carnassial teeth are less specialized. Canoidea have more premolars and molars in an elongated skull.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic mammals also {{display a}} variety of {{locomotion}} styles. Cetaceans excel in streamlined body shape and the up-and-down movements of their flukes make them fast swimmers; the tucuxi, for example, can reach speeds of 14 mph. The considerably slower sirenians can also propel themselves with their fluke, {{but they can also}} walk on the bottom with their forelimbs. The earless <b>seals</b> (<b>Phocidae)</b> swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side, while their fore-flippers are mainly used for steering. They are clumsy on land, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced; when confronted with predators, they retreat to the water as freshwater phocids have no aquatic predators.|$|R
5000|$|Hadrokirus martini is an {{extinct species}} of true <b>seal</b> (<b>Phocidae)</b> that {{lived on the}} coast of Peru about 6 million years ago. It was found in the Pisco Formation, {{together}} with other marine animals such as crustaceans, sharks, coastal birds, whales and aquatic sloths. The main particularity of this seal dwells in its teeth: they are extremely robust, hence the name (hadros, [...] "stout" [...] in Greek; kiru, tooth in Quechua). It is assumed that Hadrokirus martini was durophagous, its diet probably comprised crustaceans, small bivalves and other shelled animals, as it is seen for instance in the living sea otter. The extant seals the most closely related to Hadrokirus martini are the Lobodontini (seals from Antarctica).|$|R
500|$|Pinnipeds (...) (from Latin pinna [...] "fin" [...] and pes, pedis [...] "foot"), {{commonly}} known as seals, are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur <b>seals),</b> and <b>Phocidae</b> (the earless <b>seals,</b> or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are bears and musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.|$|R
40|$|The leptin gene has {{received}} intensive attention and scientific investigation for its importance in energy homeostasis and reproductive regulation in mammals. Furthermore, {{study of the}} leptin gene is of crucial importance for public health, particularly for its role in obesity, {{as well as for}} other numerous physiological roles that it plays in mammals. In the present work, we report the identification of novel leptin genes in 4 species of Cetacea, and a comparison with 55 publicly available leptin sequences from mammalian genome assemblies and previous studies. Our study provides evidence for positive selection in the suborder Odontoceti (toothed whales) of the Cetacea and the family <b>Phocidae</b> (earless <b>seals)</b> of the Pinnipedia. We also detected positive selection in several leptin gene residues in these two lineages. To test whether leptin and its receptor evolved in a coordinated manner, we analyzed 24 leptin receptor gene (LPR) sequences from available mammalian genome assemblies and other published data. Unlike the case of leptin, our analyses did not find evidence of positive selection for LPR across the Cetacea and Pinnipedia lineages. In line with this, positively selected sites identified in the leptin genes of these two lineages were located outside of leptin receptor binding sites, which at least partially explains why co-evolution of leptin and its receptor was not observed in the present study. Our study provides interesting insights into current understanding of the evolution of mammalian leptin genes in response to selective pressures from life in a...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPoxviruses of {{seals and}} sea lions have been {{tentatively}} identified as both orthopoxviruses and parapoxviruses, but their exact identity remained unconfirmed. Here, poxviral DNA sequences were generated from 39 clinical cases and compared to sequences from earlier poxvirus isolates from <b>seals</b> (<b>Phocidae)</b> and sea lions (Otariidae). Six genetically distinct poxvirus strains were detected, of which three were previously unrecognized. All detected strains were {{closely related to}} the parapoxviruses, confirming their classification as members of the genus Parapoxvirus. A phylogenetic analysis showed that pinniped parapoxviruses form a monophyletic group within the genus Parapoxvirus. Parapoxviruses from Atlantic pinnipeds were phylogenetically distant from those of Pacific pinnipeds. Parapoxviruses from phocids and otariids that inhabit the same geographical region were also phylogenetically distant, suggesting that parapoxviruses are not commonly transmitted between free-ranging phocids and otariids. However, one strain was detected in two otariid species, suggesting that pinniped parapoxviruses are capable of infecting multiple species within a phylogenetic family...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} and the zoogeography {{of the three}} extant pinniped families, Otariidae (sea lions and fur seals), Odobenidae (one extant species, the walrus), and <b>Phocidae</b> (true <b>seals),</b> have been contentious. Here, we address these topics in a molecular study that includes all extant species of true seals and sea lions, four fur seals and the walrus. Contrary to prevailing morphological views the analyses conclusively showed monophyletic Pinnipedia with a basal split between Otarioidea (Otariidae + Odobenidae) and Phocidae. The northern fur seal was the sister to all remaining otariids and neither sea lions nor arctocephaline fur seals were recognized as monophyletic entities. The basal Phocidae split between Monachinae (monk seals and southern true seals) and Phocinae (northern true seals) was strongly supported. The phylogeny of the Phocinae suggests that the ancestors of Cystophora (hooded seal) and the Phocini (e. g. harp seal, ringed seal) adapted to Arctic conditions and ice-breeding before 12 MYA (million years ago) as supported by the white natal coat of these lineages. The origin of the endemic Caspian and Baikal seals was dated well {{before the onset of}} major Pleistocene glaciations. The current findings, together with recent advances in pinniped paleontology, allow the proposal of a new hypothesis for pinniped origin and early dispersal. The hypothesis posits that pinnipeds originated on the North American continent with early otarioid and otariid divergences taking place in the northeast Pacific and those of the phocids in coastal areas of southeast N America for later dispersal to colder environments in the N Atlantic and the Arctic Basin, and in Antarctic waters.

40|$|Published by and {{copyright}} by American Geophysical Union. Marine mammals are {{a conspicuous}} faunal {{element of the}} Southern Ocean ecosystem and have evolved specialized life history patterns to live there. Six species of pinnipeds inhabit the Southern Ocean, including five species of true <b>seals</b> (family <b>Phocidae)</b> and one species of eared seal (family Otariidae. It is a critical feeding ground for many cetaceans: 15 species of cetaceans, including 6 species of baleen whales, Mysticeti, and 8 species of toothed whales, Odontoceti, inhabit the Southern Ocean. Climate, substrate and prey availability are key factors controlling breeding distributions. A unique reproductive pattern has evolved in the true <b>seals,</b> <b>Phocidae,</b> {{that enables them to}} inhabit and breed in the extensive ice regions of the Southern Ocean. While exerting strong direct influences on distribution, changes in the physical properties of the environment, most likely have strong indirect effects on both quality and quantity of breeding substrate, the nature of foraging habitat, or on determining the abundance of potential prey. The occurrence and extent of seasonal ice also play a role in determining the distribution and abundance of marine mammals.

40|$|Considerable long-standing {{controversy}} and confusion surround the phylogenetic affinities of pinnipeds, the largely marine group of "fin-footed" {{members of the}} placental mammalian order Carnivora. Until most recently, the two major competing hypotheses were that the pinnipeds have a single (monophyletic) origin from a bear-like ancestor, or {{that they have a}} dual (diphyletic) origin, with sea lions (Otariidae) derived from a bear-like ancestor, and <b>seals</b> (<b>Phocidae)</b> derived from an otter-, mustelid-, or musteloid-like ancestor. We examined phylogenetic relationships among 29 species of arctoid carnivorans using a concatenated sequence of 3228 bp from three nuclear loci (apolipoprotein B, APOB; interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, IRBP; recombination-activating gene 1, RAG 1). The species represented Pinnipedia (Otariidae: Callorhinus, Eumetopias; Phocidae: Phoca), bears (Ursidae: Ursus, Melursus), and Musteloidea (Mustelidae: Mustela, Enhydra, Melogale, Martes, Gulo, Meles; Procyonidae: Procyon; Ailuridae: Ailurus; Mephitidae: Mephitis). Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses of separate and combined datasets produced trees with largely congruent topologies. The analyses of the combined dataset resulted in well-resolved and well-supported phylogeny reconstructions. Evidence from nuclear DNA evolution presented here contradicts the two major hypotheses of pinniped relationships and strongly suggests a single origin of the pinnipeds from an arctoid ancestor shared with Musteloidea to the exclusion of Ursidae...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{investigated}} the diet of arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) in the Karupelv valley, East Greenland, {{during the summer}} of 1997. Despite a low density, lemmings were the most utilized prey, comprising 65. 3 % of dry fecal weight in fresh feces. This demonstrates the importance of lemming species as prey for arctic foxes all through a lemming cycle. Birds, arctic hare (Lepus arcticus), and insects also contributed to the diet. Arctic fox remains suggested that the foxes had scavenged their own species. Vegetation, muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), and <b>seal</b> (<b>Phocidae)</b> were found in small amounts. We compared estimates of prey availability and diets of arctic foxes for a coastal area ( 10 km from the shore). Abundance of avian prey tended to be higher in the coastal area. Fresh feces indicated a significant overall difference in arctic fox diets between the coastal and inland areas. Within prey categories, lemmings were significantly more represented in the inland area, while the coastal area had a more diverse diet overall. We also suggest that the existence of arctic foxes in East Greenland is dependent on regular peak years in lemming density. Key words: Arctic fox, Alopex lagopus, diet, East Greenland, fecal analysis, lemming RÉSUMÉ.

40|$|Marine pollutants, particularly, {{those that}} {{persist in the}} marine environment, are an ongoing problem, both on a local and global scale and have {{impacted}} water quality, birds, coral reef fishes, and marine mammals. Throughout history, many regulatory efforts, such the Clean Water Act,has beeninstrumental in preventing and reducing contaminants in marine environments. Extensive {{research has been done}} in order to address the effects onpinnipeds, however, due to contaminant variability and long residence times, and the remote locations of many seal populations, research has been challenging. Nevertheless, much can be learned from the literature regarding exposure and the types of persistent pollutants that have impactedseals. The purpose of this capstone review is {{to examine the effects of}} persistent pollutants onpinnipeds, with an emphasis on its role inlactationaltransfer. There are two main families ofpinnipeds, Phocidae and Otarridae. The family <b>Phocidae</b> or “true” <b>seals</b> are characterized by their lack of visible earpinnaeand large body size. On the other hand, the family Otarridae is known as “eared seals”. Each familysharesimilarlactationalprocesses, however,phocidshave shorterlactationalperiods and fasting females continuously produce milk. The energetics of lactationis very demanding on dams of both families and lactational strategies varyduring fasting periods. Lactation is one of the major routes in which persistentpollutantstransfer from dam to pup. Due to the high lipid content in milk, this facilitates in rapid pup growth from the start of the nursing period. Lipophilicpollutants such as PCBs, DDTs, and other organochlorine pesticides have been detected in milk samples. Exposure to these contaminants at an early stage may have detrimental effects on pup physiology, making them vulnerable to viruses and bacteria. It is still unclear, however, why certain pollutants transfer and others do not. Some of the recommendations made is this review paper include: 1) further study is needed to minimize that variability thatexistin determining contaminant concentrations, 2) uniformity in study methodology should be established between research studies for better comparisons between seal populations, and 3) implement managementcontrols if,non-existent, in susceptiblepinnipedhabitat...|$|R
