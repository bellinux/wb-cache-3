Due {{to the process}} complexity (the presence of forces on three directions—a vertical one and two in the blank's plane), a three axes CNC milling machine, capable of describing the complex paths covered by the punch for obtaining the truncated cone-shaped parts, has been chosen. To obtain a truncated cone, three different trajectories were selected: in first and second variants after each vertical press having a constant step, the punch covers a circular path. The differences show that the following circular trajectory can start {{at the same point}} or can be shifted at an angle of 90 ° from the previous <b>press</b> <b>point.</b> In the last variant, the punch performs a spatial spiral trajectory. The main objective of our {{study was to determine the}} optimal forming strategy, by shifting the press position of the punch and the path it follows to obtain a truncated cone through single point incremental forming. Thus, the strain distribution can be homogeneous, and the thickness reduction and the process forces are minimal...|$|E
40|$|Both {{academic}} and popular <b>press</b> <b>point</b> out that today employees from different generations are working side by side. Academic research has mainly focused on (work) values {{of these different}} generations and how these may impact employees’ attitudes and motivation. However, if and how generational differences are perceived, or what perceptions members from different generations (Baby-boomers, Generation X and Y) have about each other in turn, has received scant attention. This is important in various ways. Perception is essential in how social categorizations and self-categorization will be triggered. These categorization processes can give rise to stereotypes and conflicts. Hence, {{a better understanding of}} intergenerational perceptions can lead to successful management of a diverse body of employees. This exploratory study unravels how different generations of managers in the workforce perceive their coworkers belonging to different generations including their own generation. A cognitive mapping methodology, called the Repertory Grid Technique, is applied to elicit personal constructs. The results show that there are differences in intergenerational perceptions and that self-categorization, social identification, and stereotyping towards Generation Y occur. The results also indicate that some popular notions about generational differences such as the youngest generation not respecting the older generations should not be overgeneralized. We believe, that a good comprehension of how generations perceive each other is crucial for managing a diverse body of employees. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Critical systems {{heuristics}} (CSH) is {{a framework}} for reflective professional practice organised around the central tool of boundary critique. This paper, written jointly by the original developer, Werner Ulrich, and Martin Reynolds, an experienced practitioner of CSH, offers a systematic introduction to the idea and use of boundary critique. Its core concepts are explained in detail and their use is illustrated by means of two case studies from the domain of environmental planning and management. A particular focus is on working constructively with tensions between opposing perspectives as they arise in many situations of professional intervention. These include tensions such as ‘situation’ versus ‘system’, ‘is’ versus ‘ought’ judgements, concerns of ‘those involved’ versus ‘those affected but not involved’, stakeholders’ ‘stakes’ versus ‘stakeholding issues’, and others. Accordingly, boundary critique {{is presented as a}} participatory process of unfolding and questioning boundary judgements rather than as an expert-driven process of boundary setting. The paper concludes with a discussion of some essential skills and considerations regarding the practice of boundary critique. Parts of the account of the NRUA-Botswana study in Section 6. 2 of the present paper are reproduced from an earlier publication by one of the authors (Reynolds 2007); we are grateful to the publishers of Edge <b>Press,</b> <b>Point</b> Reyes, CA, for granting us permission to reproduce this material.

40|$|DEMO: India-EU MaP - Developing Evidence based Management and Operations in India-EU Migration and PartnershipThe report {{analyses}} {{the media}} representation of Indian community resident in Finland. The four major Finnish newspapers were analysed {{during the period}} between 2012 and 2015. In comparison with many other European countries with larger migrant communities, the Indian community in Finland is small. Although specific reporting on ethnic communities is limited in the Finnish press, interesting insights on the media representation of the Indian community {{can be drawn from}} the data. The research concludes that reports on business relations and Finnish companies' operations in India, mostly concerning Nokia's failures in India, are often portrayed in a negative light. India is considered as a difficult business environment and culturalist explanations dominate over others. At the same time the reporting recognizes the opportunities that India's new rising market can offer to Finnish companies. In turn, residents with Indian origin in Finland are portrayed as hard-working and important part of the economy in Finland. Indian culture understood as art is also seen as an enriching addition to the Finnish culture. However, occasional notions in the Finnish <b>press</b> <b>point</b> {{to the idea of a}} 'Finn' as a somewhat closed category : a migrant becomes Finn, or resembles a Finn instead of 'Finnishness' becoming more inclusive. Similarly the press sometimes gives an essentialized representation of gender roles among the Indian community in Finland without giving a voice to the immigrant community that is being essentialized...|$|E
40|$|When {{performing}} {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) experiments, a strong {{homogeneous magnetic field}} is often preferred, especially in clinical applications. However, all objects that are placed in the magnetic field will disturb the field homogeneity and cause local magnetic field gradients. In the human body, which consists {{of a large number}} of tissues and organs of different shape and susceptibility (the ability to become magnetised), the field distribution becomes very complex. To minimise magnetic field inhomogeneities in the studied region, shim gradients, of linear or higher order, are locally optimised for each measurement. In clinical MR the trend is towards higher field strengths, from 1. 5 T to 3 T and beyond, and this leads to increased susceptibility effects, both in MR imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS). To have control of the susceptibility effects, and achieve high accuracy in phantom studies, it is valuable to have an easy and accessible method for measuring the susceptibility value of the phantom materials. A method which utilises MRI for susceptibility measurements was significantly improved by using an echo planar imaging sequence instead of the standard implementation of a spin echo sequence. An increased sensitivity and accuracy provides a possibility to detect smaller susceptibility differences, to be more flexible in choice of reference liquid or to decrease the sample volume. An automated evaluation method based on model fitting was also developed and this increased the accuracy even further. Finally, the volume susceptibility of two plastics, commonly used in phantoms, was determined. For small volume 1 H MRS in susceptibility influenced regions, the spurious echo artifact has become a problem. It is, however, seldom recognised as a susceptibility artifact. In this thesis a k-space description was introduced and the causes and conditions of this artifact were studied. When the shim gradients are optimised for a small volume, the possibility of achieving a good local shim, i. e. a locally homogenous magnetic field, is increased. An imaging technique was developed, the WSI-scan (water suppression imaging), which visualises how the global effects of the locally optimised shim might shift the water resonance in some regions outside the water suppression bandwidth. When regions of unsuppressed water overlap with the excitation regions of the volume selection, the probability of a spurious echo artifact increases significantly. To destroy any outer volume signal strong spoiling gradients are implemented in the volume selection sequences. By using the new modified k-space concept it was possible to demonstrate all magnetic configurations and their relative positions prior to acquisition in one single k-space map. This tool showed to be powerful not only for describing the artifact formation but also for evaluating the effective spoiling of unwanted magnetic configurations and it was applied to two volume selection methods, <b>PRESS</b> (<b>point</b> resolved spectroscopy) and STEAM (stimulated echo acquisition mode). The k-space description was verified by in vitro experiments where the magnetic configurations of PRESS were separately refocused into spurious echo artifacts. This thesis shows that shim gradients are not only likely to shift water resonances of the brain outside the water suppression band, they might also refocus unwanted, and spoiled, magnetic configurations into a spurious echo. The k-space concept, the WSI-scan and the susceptibility measurements all provide important tools for evaluating strategies and prerequisites for high quality 1 H MRS of small volumes...|$|E
