25|$|Other {{emerging}} PV technologies include organic, dye-sensitized, quantum-dot, and <b>Perovskite</b> photovoltaics. OPVs {{fall into}} the thin-film category of manufacturing, and typically operate around the 12% efficiency range which {{is lower than the}} 12–21% typically seen by silicon based PVs. Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up. Dye-sensitized PVs are similar in efficiency to OPVs but are significantly easier to manufacture. However these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell. Quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized DSSCs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they peak at 12% efficiency. <b>Perovskite</b> solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid metal-halide <b>perovskites</b> have {{potential}} as cost-effective gain media for laser technology {{because of their}} superior optoelectronic properties. Although lead-halide <b>perovskites</b> have been most widely studied to date, tin-based <b>perovskites</b> have been proposed as a less toxic alternative. In this Letter, we show that amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI 3) thin films is supported by an observed radiative monomolecular charge recombination pathway deriving from its unintentional doping. Such a radiative component will be active even at the lowest charge-carrier densities, opening a pathway for ultralow light-emission thresholds. Using time-resolved THz photoconductivity analysis, we further show that the material has an unprecedentedly high charge-carrier mobility of 22 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1) favoring efficient transport. In addition, FASnI 3 exhibits strong radiative bimolecular recombination and Auger rates that are over {{an order of magnitude}} lower than for lead-halide <b>perovskites.</b> In combination, these properties reveal that tin-halide <b>perovskites</b> are highly suited to light-emitting devices...|$|R

40|$|The topical review {{describes}} the recent {{progress in the}} modeling of hybrid <b>perovskites</b> by molecular dynamics simulations. Hybrid <b>perovskites</b> and in particular methylammonium lead halide (MAPI) have a tremendous technological relevance representing the fastest-advancing solar material to date. They also represent the paradigm of an organic-inorganic crystalline material with some conceptual peculiarities: an inorganic semiconductor for what concerns the electronic and absorption properties with a hybrid and solution processable organic-inorganic body. After briefly explaining the basic concepts of ab initio and classical molecular dynamics, the model potential recently developed for hybrid <b>perovskites</b> is described together with its physical motivation as a simple ionic model able to reproduce the main dynamical properties of the material.

25|$|Coordination polyhedra are {{geometric}} representation {{of how a}} cation is surrounded by an anion. In mineralogy, coordination polyhedra are usually considered in terms of oxygen, due its abundance in the crust. The base unit of silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron – one Si4+ surrounded by four O2−. An alternate way of describing the coordination of the silicate is by a number: {{in the case of}} the silica tetrahedron, the silicon is said to have a coordination number of 4. Various cations have a specific range of possible coordination numbers; for silicon, it is almost always 4, except for very high-pressure minerals where compound is compressed such that silicon is in six-fold (octahedral) coordination by oxygen. Bigger cations have a bigger coordination number because of the increase in relative size as compared to oxygen (the last orbital subshell of heavier atoms is different too). Changes in coordination numbers between leads to physical and mineralogical differences; for example, at high pressure such as in the mantle, many minerals, especially silicates such as olivine and garnet will change to a <b>perovskite</b> structure, where silicon is in octahedral coordination. Another example are the aluminosilicates kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite (polymorphs, as they share the formula Al2SiO5), which differ by the coordination number of the Al3+; these minerals transition from one another as a response to changes in pressure and temperature. In the case of silicate materials, the substitution of Si4+ by Al3+ allows for a variety of minerals because of the need to balance charges.|$|E

40|$|In {{transition}} metal oxides, preferential occupation of specific d orbitals on the {{transition metal}} ion {{can lead to}} the development of a long-range ordered pattern of occupied orbitals. This phenomenon, referred to as orbital ordering, is usually observed indirectly from the cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions (CJTDs) that result as a consequence of the orbital ordering. This paper examines the interplay between orbital ordering, octahedral tilting and cation ordering in <b>perovskites.</b> Both ternary AMX 3 <b>perovskites</b> containing an active Jahn-Teller (J-T) ion on the octahedral site and quaternary A 2 MM 2 ̆ 7 X 6 <b>perovskites</b> containing a J-T ion on one-half of the octahedral sites have been examined. In AMX 3 <b>perovskites,</b> the tendency is for the occupied 3 d 3 x 2 -r 2 and 3 d 3 z 2 -r 2 orbitals to order in the ac plane, as exemplified by the crystal structures of LaMnO 3 and KCuF 3.

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as <b>perovskite</b> and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure.

40|$|Why {{is it that}} ABO 3 <b>perovskites</b> {{generally}} do not exhibit negative thermal expansion (NTE) over a wide temperature range, whereas layered <b>perovskites</b> of the same chemical family often do? It is generally accepted {{that there are two}} key ingredients that determine the extent of NTE: the presence of soft phonon modes that drive contraction (have negative Grüneisen parameters); and anisotropic elastic compliance that predisposes the material to the deformations required for NTE along a specific axis. This difference in thermal expansion properties is surprising since both ABO 3 and layered <b>perovskites</b> often possess these ingredients in equal measure in their high-symmetry phases. Using first principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we show that in layered <b>perovskites</b> there is a significant enhancement of elastic anisotropy due to symmetry breaking that results from the combined effect of layering and condensed rotations of oxygen octahedra. This feature, unique to layered <b>perovskites</b> of certain symmetry, is what allows uniaxial NTE to persist over a large temperature range.
