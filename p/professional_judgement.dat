40|$|Summary: The {{factorial}} survey approach, {{which was}} first introduced {{in the social sciences}} around the beginning of the 1980 s, constitutes an advanced method for measuring human judgements of people or social situations. At the general level, this quasi-experimental approach involves presenting respondents with vignettes (fictive descriptions), in which selected characteristics describing the vignette ‘person’ or ‘situation’ are simultaneously manipulated. The aim {{of this article is to}} present a conceptual and an analytical framework for factorial survey studies of <b>professional</b> <b>judgements</b> in social work. Findings: In the first part of the article, I develop and discuss the proposition that this approach may be used in order to study the contents of <b>professional</b> <b>judgements</b> about the diagnosis and treatment of clients. The ‘contents’ is discussed in terms of knowledge assumptions that practitioners explicitly and tacitly use as a basis for their <b>professional</b> <b>judgements.</b> Second, I outline a strategy for modelling social workers’ judgements. This modelling strategy proceeds from the possibilities afforded by multilevel regression analysis. Applications: Findings from analyses of factorial survey data may reveal both professional agreement and disagreement in practitioners’ judgements. While results that reveal high levels of disagreement in judgements about what constitutes a particular diagnosis or about which intervention is the most suitable for a particular client may raise questions as regards the ‘professionalism’ of practitioners’ judgements, results that reveal professional agreement in diagnostic and treatment assumptions may be transformed into hypotheses that can be tested further in research...|$|R

25|$|Although not {{specifically}} {{linked to the}} use of warning beacons, the police, fire brigade and ambulance services (and in certain cases, the blood services and bomb disposal units, but not the other emergency services listed above) may also choose to allow their drivers to claim legal exemptions from certain motoring regulations, such as being able to treat a red traffic light as a give way sign, exceeding the speed limit, passing the wrong side of a keep left/right sign, driving in a bus lane, or parking in restricted areas. They may not, however, ignore ‘no entry’ signs, drive the wrong way down a one-way street or cross a solid white line {{in the middle of the}} road (other than the same exceptions granted everyone else, for example to pass a stationary vehicle). In reality some drivers will disobey other laws at their <b>professional</b> <b>judgement</b> but they do so without any automatic protection from the law.

40|$|Critical Comparative Nursing Assessment (CCNA) is {{a theory}} about how the {{competence}} of completing Bachelor of Nursing students in New Zealand is determined. Semi-structured, audio-taped interviews and field notes were used to collect data from twenty-seven nurses with experience in undertaking competency assessment. A Glaserian grounded theory approach was used to guide the data collection and analysis. This utilised the processes of constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling and saturation to generate a middle range substantive grounded theory. This {{is presented as a}} model consisting of four emergent categories that explain how nurses formulate <b>professional</b> <b>judgements</b> about competence. These are a) gathering, which describes the processes used to collect evidence of practice to inform decisions; b) weighing up, which explains how evidence is analysed using the processes of benchmarking and comparative analysis; c) judging brings into focus the tensions inherent in making <b>professional</b> <b>judgements</b> about competence and how nurses formulated these, and d) moderating, which describes the processes nurses use to validate decisions and ensure that professional responsibilities and public safety are upheld. The basic social psychological process of comparing integrates these categories to explain how nurses resolve the tensions associated with making decisions about competence. This research presents a new way of viewing and understanding how nurses assess competence. It identifies where the challengers and tensions related to the assessment of competence lie and suggests strategies that if implemented could further enhance the validity and reliability of assessment outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Awareness {{of the needs}} of gifted and talented (GAT) {{students}} has been raised in recent times through the introduction of Excellence in Cities (EiC) and other initiatives. However, there has been little work carried out in the design and technology (D&T) area. This research sets out to investigate the use of standardised tests {{in the form of the}} Middle Years Information System (MidYis) for identification of GAT students within D&T. It also looks at whether a more creative delivery can encourage even more imaginative ideas and improved satisfaction levels from these students. MidYis data for a Year 7 cohort is examined and compared to the original system of using <b>professional</b> <b>judgements.</b> Student self-nomination is also considered. Students were grouped according to MidYis ability for an initial group design task and questionnaires are used to determine their opinions on the project. Results indicate that identification needs to be initially based on quantitative data although <b>professional</b> <b>judgements</b> must be employed to identify the student with a particular talent. It is concluded that self-nomination is not appropriate within D&T at this point but may be useful within whole school development work in the GAT area. Data should also be used in the identification of underachievement. Products produced by the test group, across all ability levels, showed more imagination in design than the control group. GAT students preferred to work with peers of similar ability for designing although when making they found ‘passing on’ their knowledge to less able students consolidated their own learning...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{teachers}} {{are regarded as}} {{key players in the}} process of identifying and catering to students’ additional support needs within mainstream primary classrooms. However, teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>judgements</b> regarding students with special needs {{have been found to be}} contextually influenced (e. g. by school context, student population, level of achievement). It is unclear whether teachers’ perceptions of their students’ actual support needs are also influenced by their personal and professional characteristics. Hence, a better understanding of the value of teachers’ perceptions regarding students’ needs is needed. Therefore, this study explored perceptions of 109 Dutch mainstream primary teachers regarding four dimensions of students’ additional support. It addressed whether these teacher-perceived students’ needs are affected by teachers’ years of experience, level of training, personality traits and self-efficacy beliefs. It was found that teachers’ perceptions of students’ needs were relatively unbiased by their personal and professional characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Many of us {{wanted to}} be {{teachers}} {{in order to be}} different from some of the teachers we had known, and to be inspiring, as some of our teachers were. At a time of continuously changing expectations and prescriptions, often politically driven, how free are we to do this? The answer is, remarkably free, if we have a confident and secure understanding of the professional choices we are able to make. It sometimes seems that, because everyone has been to school, they all feel entitled to a valid opinion about how children should be taught. This can be very frustrating! Learning how to be a primary school teacher – deciding how and what to teach, discerning high-quality research with political awareness and criticality is like learning how to play three-dimensional chess, challenging in its complexity but not impossible. The ability to make informed professional choices is what gives you the authority to be a teacher and we hope this book will provide you with some strategies and thinking points to support your learning. The book aims to guide your decision making about how to teach, based on personal and <b>professional</b> <b>judgements</b> about the needs of children, recognising their different, individual needs, what excites them and what makes them want to learn. You will become a teacher who understands children’s different backgrounds, difficulties, local and personal environments, and that emotional and social development {{are an integral part of}} cognitive development. You will become a teacher who enjoys exploring learning with children, who fosters their imagination and curiosity, who works in partnership with children’s parents and carers, who helps children to be articulate about and evaluate their learning. You will be confident in working with others to plan children’s learning and to monitor it in skilful and sensitive ways.
