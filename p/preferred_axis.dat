According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any superposition of these states. This explains also why the choice of z-axis for the directional quantization of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given ℓ and m&prime; obtained for another <b>preferred</b> <b>axis</b> z&prime; can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different m (but same l) that have been obtained for z.|$|E

The evolution of the order parameters and the specific heat is also studied. The transition associated with the positional degrees of freedom is found to change from a second-order to a first-order behavior when the two phase transitions are close enough, due to the coupling with the orientational degrees of freedom.

5000|$|By linearly perturbing the {{equations}} defining the mechanical equilibrium {{of a star}} (i.e. mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium) and assuming that the perturbations are adiabatic, one can derive a system of four differential equations whose solutions give the frequency and structure of a star's modes of oscillation. The stellar structure is usually assumed to be spherically symmetric, so the horizontal (i.e. non-radial) component of the oscillations is described by spherical harmonics, indexed by an angular degree [...] and azimuthal order [...] In non-rotating stars, modes with the same angular degree must {{all have the same}} frequency because there is no <b>preferred</b> <b>axis.</b> The angular degree indicates the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface, so for large values of , the opposing sectors roughly cancel out, making it difficult to detect light variations.

5000|$|The above {{equation}} {{is known as}} the phase-matching condition. Typically, three-wave mixing is done in a birefringent crystalline material, where the refractive index depends on the polarization and direction of the light that passes through. The polarizations of the fields and the orientation of the crystal are chosen such that the phase-matching condition is fulfilled. This phase-matching technique is called angle tuning. Typically a crystal has three axes, one or two of which have a different refractive index than the other one(s). Uniaxial crystals, for example, have a single <b>preferred</b> <b>axis,</b> called the extraordinary (e) axis, while the other two are ordinary axes (o) (see crystal optics). There are several schemes of choosing the polarizations for this crystal type. If the signal and idler have the same polarization, it is called [...] "type-I phase matching", and if their polarizations are perpendicular, it is called [...] "type-II phase matching". However, other conventions exist that specify further which frequency has what polarization relative to the crystal axis. These types are listed below, with the convention that the signal wavelength is shorter than the idler wavelength.Most common nonlinear crystals are negative uniaxial, which means that the e axis has a smaller refractive index than the o axes. In those crystals, type-I and -II phase matching are usually the most suitable schemes. In positive uniaxial crystals, types VII and VIII are more suitable. Types II and III are essentially equivalent, except that the names of signal and idler are swapped when the signal has a longer wavelength than the idler. For this reason, they are sometimes called IIA and IIB. The type numbers V-VIII are less common than I and II and variants.|$|E

Disorder effects are shown to be unimportant at both very small and very large separations.

There is a flat patch (i. e. a low chi-squared region) in the same-l components of the bispectrum spanning the range l= 32 - 62; this may be interpreted as ruling out Gaussianity at the 99. 6 % confidence level.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the point-parity and mirror-parity handedness {{of the large}} angle anisotropy in {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB).

Even though this feature is ``visually'' present in most renditions of the WMAP dataset we find that it never supports parity preference beyond the meagre 95 % confidence level. This is fortunate as point parity handedness implies almost certainly a high level of galactic contamination. Mirror reflection parity, on the contrary, is related to the emergence of a <b>preferred</b> <b>axis,</b> defining the symmetry plane.

40|$|Growing and {{studying}} large Coulomb crystals, composed of tens {{to hundreds of}} thousands of ions, in linear quadrupole ion traps presents new challenges for trap implementation. We consider several trap designs, first comparing the total driven micromotion amplitude as a function of location within the trapping volume; total micromotion is an important point of comparison since it can limit crystal size by transfer of radiofrequency drive energy into thermal energy. We also compare the axial component of micromotion, which leads to first-order Doppler shifts along the <b>preferred</b> spectroscopy <b>axis</b> in precision measurements on large Coulomb crystals. Finally, we compare trapping potential anharmonicity, which can induce nonlinear resonance heating by shifting normal mode frequencies onto resonance as a crystal grows. We apply a non-deforming crystal approximation for simple calculation of these anharmonicity-induced shifts, allowing a straightforward estimation of when crystal growth can lead to excitation of different nonlinear heating resonances.

The red (metal-rich) GC subpopulations show strong alignment with the major axis of the host galaxy, which supports the notion that these GCs are associated with metal-rich field stars. The metal-rich GCs in lenticular galaxies show signs of being more strongly associated with disks rather than bulges. Surprisingly, we find that the blue (metal-poor) GCs can also show the same correlation.
