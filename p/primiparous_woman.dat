5000|$|Women {{with this}} {{condition}} frequently, {{at the time}} of delivery, have a precipitous birth. There is virtually no resistance of the huge pelvic opening {{to the size of a}} newborn so only the soft parts resist the birth. With a huge Justo Major Pelvis, there is no pelvic bone [...] "molding" [...] of the fetal head. With the average pelvic size (2/3 or less Justo Major size) the usual pelvic molding process slows the birth, resulting in a slow and gradual stretching of the vaginal opening for primiparous women. When a huge Justo Major Pelvis allows such an extremely rapid vaginal birth, there can be tears of the perineal soft tissues. At the time of delivery the strong uterine contractions and maternal bearing down almost instantly overwhelm the integrity of a tightened and previously unstretched vaginal orifice. This is often the case if such women have not previously practiced vaginal stretching to the degree that allows such an instant birthing, especially so for a <b>primiparous</b> <b>woman.</b> This [...] "instant delivery" [...] problem causes many OBGYN doctors to stress the importance of women with a huge pelvis practicing pre-delivery vaginal stretching to avoid perineal injury.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to describe the experiences of <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> with the support they received from their birth companions during labour and delivery in Malawi. The study design was descriptive and utilized qualitative data collection and analysis method on a sample of 20 <b>primiparous</b> <b>women.</b> The women were recruited from the postnatal ward of Bwaila hospital and were interviewed regarding their experiences on the support they received from their birth companions during labour and delivery using an open ended interview guide. Data was manually analyzed using content analysis. <b>Primiparous</b> <b>women</b> described the support they received from their birth companions as useful and beneficial. Birth companions provided advice, physical, emotional and spiritual support to the women during their labour and delivery. In addition, the birth companions were viewed as guardians of the women during labour and delivery. Results however, show that some women were not properly assisted by their companions because both the mothers and companions lacked knowledge on birth companionship. The results further show that birth companions play important roles during the birth and delivery of <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> and thereby improving birth outcomes.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. A major {{component}} of the increasing trend in cesarean sections in Western Australia is the rise in emergency cesarean sections in <b>primiparous</b> <b>women.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to identify independent risk factors (particularly those known early in pregnancy) associated with operative delivery in low-risk <b>primiparous</b> <b>women.</b> METHODS. Retrospective multivariate logistic regression analyses of antenatal and perinatal data were conducted for all low-risk <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> entering labor spontaneously and giving birth in Western Australia in 1987 (n = 3641). RESULTS. Of the subjects, 58 % had a spontaneous vaginal delivery, 8 % had an emergency cesarean section, and 34 % had an operative vaginal delivery. The significant independent risk factors for emergency cesarean section were older maternal age, shorter maternal height, heavier infant birthweight, and long labor. The risk factors for operative vaginal delivery were older maternal age, shorter maternal height, heavier infant birthweight, epidural anesthesia, labor/delivery complications, male infant, private patient status, and being married. CONCLUSIONS. This multivariate analysis confirms known risk factors for operative delivery in low-risk <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> and suggests that it may be possible to predict the likelihood of operative delivery for an individual woman by using knowledge of maternal age and height and assessment of infant birthweight...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{the association between}} perineal trauma and pain in 473 <b>primiparous</b> <b>women.</b> Method Cross-sectional study in which pain {{was measured by the}} numerical pain scale (0 to 10 - 0 being no pain and 10 maximal pain). Results The prevalence and mean intensity of pain were 33. 0 % and 4. 7 points (standard deviation = 2. 0) in the numeric scale, respectively. Episiotomy represented the most frequent trauma (46. 7 %). The occurrence and intensity of the pain were associated with perineal trauma and postpartum time. Having perineal trauma tripled the chance of pain. Each hour elapsed following the birth reduced the chance of pain by 4. 8 %. Conclusion <b>Primiparous</b> <b>women</b> are subject to a high frequency of perineal trauma, with episiotomy being the most prominent.

Methods: this was a cross-sectional study conducted after 50 - 70 postpartum days, with 24 <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> who underwent cesarean delivery and 72 who had a normal birth. The 9301 PeritronTM was used for analysis of muscle strength. The mean muscle strength was compared between the groups by two-way analysis of variance. Results: the pelvic floor muscle strength was 24. 0 cmH 2 O (Â± 16. 2) and 25. 4 cmH 2 O (Â± 14. 7) in postpartum <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> after normal birth and cesarean section, respectively, with no significant difference. The muscular strength was greater in postpartum women with &# 8805; 12 years of study (42. 0 Â± 26. 3 versus 14. 6 Â± 7. 7 cmH 2 O; p= 0. 036) and in those who performed perineal exercises (42. 6 Â± 25. 4 11. 8 Â± 4. 9 vs. cmH 2 O; p = 0. 010), compared to caesarean.

Methods: Through the Danish Medical Birth Registry, we identified all <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> giving live birth or stillbirth at&nbsp;&ge; 22 gestational weeks in northern Denmark, from 1999 to 2009. From the Aarhus University Prescription Database we obtained {{information on the}} women&# 39;s prescriptions for reimbursed drugs filled from 30 days before conception until delivery. Results: Among 85, 710 <b>primiparous</b> <b>women,</b> 47, 982 (56. 0 %) redeemed at least one prescription from 30 days before conception until delivery.

Cold therapy is a topical treatment which {{is effective in}} relieving inflammation and wound healing. Olive oil also increases the rate of wound healing. The present study has been conducted to evaluate and compare the effect cooling gel pads and topical olive oil on the intensity of episiotomy pain and wound healing in <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> referring to hospitals affiliated with the Gilan University of Medical Sciences in 2014. Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 90 <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> who referred to hospitals affiliated with the Gilan University of Medical Sciences. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups: those receiving cooling gel pads (for 20 minutes 12 hours after labor and in case necessary, for 10 days) and the topical olive oil (2 times a day, 12 hours after delivery and for 10 days). The two groups were evaluated interms of episiotomy pain intensity through visual analogue scale (VAS) and analgesics usage for 3 times: the 12 hours, 5 th and 10 th day after episiotomy. Results: The two groups did not show any significant differences in demographic features and other intervening variables. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} in the intensity of perineal pain in two groups at 12 hours (p= 0. 04) and on the day 5 after episiotomy (p= 0. 03).

There {{was no significant difference in}} relation to mean score of PTSD in <b>primiparous</b> and multiparous <b>women.</b> Mean score of social support in 2 nd and 6 th week postpartum was significantly higher in <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> (P= 0. 000). 34 % of multiparous vs. 5. 4 % of <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> had unwanted pregnancy (P= 0. 000). There was also a direct relationship between postpartum social support in 2 nd (P= 0. 005) and 6 th weekÂ  postpartum (P= 0. 002) and the rate of PTSD. Conclusion: The rate and mean score of PTSD in multiparous has been higher than <b>primiparous</b> <b>women.</b> Thus, it seems that multiparous women are at higher risk for PTSD due to lower postpartum social support and higher rate of unwanted pregnancy. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The rate of cesarean {{delivery}} (CD) in Brazil {{has increased}} over the past 40 Â years. The CD rate in public services is three times above the World Health Organization recommended values. Among strategies to reduce CD, {{the most important is}} reduction of primary cesarean. This study aimed to describe factors associated with CD during labor in <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> with a single cephalic pregnancy assisted in the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS). Methods This study is part of the Birth in Brazil survey, a national hospital-based study of 23, 894 postpartum women and their newborns. The rate of CD in <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> was estimated. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze factors associated with CD during labor in <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> with a single cephalic pregnancy, including estimation of crude and adjusted odds ratios and their respective 95 Â % confidence intervals. Results The analyzed data are related to the 2814 eligible <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> who had vaginal birth or CD during labor in SUS hospitals. In adjusted analyses, residing in the Southeast region was associated with lower CD during labor. Occurrence of clinical and obstetric conditions potentially related to obstetric emergencies before delivery, early admission with[*]<[*] 4 Â cm of dilatation, a decision late in pregnancy for CD, and the use of analgesia were associated with a greater risk for CD. Favorable advice for vaginal birth during antenatal care, induction of labor, and the use of any good practices during labor were protective factors for CD. The type of professional who attended birth was not significant in the final analyses, but bivariate analysis showed a higher use of good practices and a smaller proportion of epidural analgesia in women cared for by at least one nurse midwife. Conclusions The CD rate in <b>primiparous</b> <b>women</b> in SUS in Brazil is extremely high and can compromise the health of these women and their newborns. Information and support for vaginal birth during antenatal care, avoiding early admission, and promoting the use of good practices during labor assistance can reduce unnecessary CD. Considering the experience of other countries, incorporation of nurse midwives in childbirth care may increase the use of good practices during labor...|$|R
