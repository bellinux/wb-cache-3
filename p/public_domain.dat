Reel Funds International Inc. ruled that the episodes in question were derivative works based on the copyrighted episodes even though the episodes themselves were not under copyright and granted CBS indirect copyright over the <b>public</b> <b>domain</b> episodes; the ruling enjoined Reel Funds International, a <b>public</b> <b>domain</b> distributor, from selling DVDs with those episodes within {{the jurisdiction of the}} United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.|$|E

5|$|When the two {{companies}} were unable to reach a solution, Twin Books filed suit against Disney for copyright infringement. Disney argued that because Salten's original 1923 publication of the novel {{did not include a}} copyright notice, by American law it was immediately considered a <b>public</b> <b>domain</b> work. It also argued that as the novel was published in 1923, Anna Wyler's 1954 renewal occurred after the deadline and was invalid. The case was reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which ruled that the novel was copyrighted upon its publication in 1923, and not a <b>public</b> <b>domain</b> work then. However, in validating 1923 as the publication date, this confirmed Disney's claim that the copyright renewal was filed too late and the novel became a <b>public</b> <b>domain</b> work in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} <b>public</b> <b>domain,</b> and then second, that King Kong was not part of the <b>public</b> <b>domain,</b> and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

40|$|The {{services}} provided by public safety organizations bring value to society by creating a stable and secure environment. These services include protection to people environment and properties and they address {{a large number of}} threats both natural and man-made, acts of terrorism, technological, radiological or environmental accidents. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have always {{played an important role in}} the <b>public</b> safety <b>domain.</b> The capability of exchanging information (e. g., voice or data) is essential to improve the coordination of public safety officers during an emergency crisis. Wireless communications are particularly important in field operations to support the mobility of first responders. Operational and business requirements in the <b>public</b> safety <b>domain</b> are significantly different from the commercial domain. Innovative ICT concepts and technologies may not be directly applicable to the <b>public</b> safety <b>domain</b> or they need to be customized to fit specific requirements (e. g., security). This paper will identify the most significant challenges in the <b>Public</b> Safey <b>domain,</b> the main technical enablers and the opportunities provided by new ICT technologies. In particular, this paper focuses on the lack of interoperability and broadband connectivity for public safety organizations. The potential evolution paths for ICT in the <b>public</b> safety <b>domain</b> will also be described. JRC. G. 6 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{component of}} immigration in the Netherlands was studied by comparing views on multiculturalism and acculturation orientation of Turkish migrants between Dutch majority (N= 1565) and Turkish-Dutch minority (N= 185) members. Multiculturalism {{was measured with}} an adaptation of the Multicultural Ideology Scale (Berry & Kalin, 1995); acculturation orientation was investigated in different domains of life. The results revealed that Dutch on average had a neutral attitude towards multiculturalism in the Netherlands while Turkish-Dutch showed a more positive attitude. Regarding the acculturation strategies, Dutch adults preferred assimilation above integration of Turkish migrants in all life domains. Turkish-Dutch adults made a distinction {{in public and private}} domains: integration was preferred in <b>public</b> <b>domains,</b> and separation in private <b>domains.</b> In <b>public</b> <b>domains</b> both cultural groups agreed that Turkish migrants should adapt to the Dutch culture. In private domains there was no agreement at all in the views of Dutch and Turkish-Dutch. These results suggest that the views on acculturation and multiculturalism differ substantially for majority and minority group members. Implications are discussed. ...|$|R
