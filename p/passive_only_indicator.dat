40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the results of the surgical management of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), following the introduction of systematic calcitonin measurement in patients referred for thyroid diseases. METHOD: We included all the patients with elevated calcitonin and MTC from January 1993 to March 2001. RESULTS: Among 8497 patients, MTC was diagnosed in 52 with a mean age of 56. 1 years. Thirty-two fine needle biopsies led to diagnose MTC in 19 cases. The median basal pre-operative calcitonin level was 245 pg/ml. Elevated calcitonin serum was the <b>only</b> <b>indicator</b> of MTC in 31 patients. Fifty-one patients underwent total thyroidectomies, with lymphadenectomy in 45. Thirteen patients had lymph node involvement. Post-operatively, 40 (77 %) had normal basal and pentagastrin (Pg) stimulated calcitonin serum levels, and remained normal at a mean follow-up of 5. 16 years (1. 8 - 8). CONCLUSION: Routine pre-operative measurement of calcitonin should be performed because it is often the <b>only</b> <b>indicator</b> of MTC at an early stage. This could lead to an improved MTC cure rate...|$|R
