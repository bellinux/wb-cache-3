5|$|After the war, <b>Puglia</b> {{had been}} {{assigned}} to patrol the Dalmatian coast. On 11 July 1920, men from the ship became involved in the unrest in Split. During a violent confrontation with a group of Croats, the ship's captain and a sailor were shot and killed. <b>Puglia</b> was sold for scrapping on 22 March 1923. While the ship was being dismantled, the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini donated the ship's bow section to the writer and ardent nationalist Gabriele D'Annunzio, who had it installed at his estate as part of the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, most of {{the ships}} had been {{withdrawn}} to secondary roles, with Elba having {{been converted into a}} seaplane tender. <b>Puglia</b> was {{the only member of the}} class to take an active role, based out of Durazzo. Etruria was deliberately blown up by the Regia Marina as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary. The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of <b>Puglia</b> was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E

5|$|<b>Puglia</b> {{was built}} by the new Regia Marina {{shipyard}} in Taranto, the first major warship to be built there. Her keel was laid down in October 1893, and she was launched on 22 September 1898. Fitting-out work {{proved to be a}} lengthy process, and she was not ready for service until 26 May 1901. By this time, her design was over ten years old and the ship was rapidly becoming obsolescent; in comparison, Germany had already commissioned the world's first light cruisers, the , which were significantly faster and better armed. This new type of ship rapidly replaced protected cruisers like <b>Puglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of real use, and she remained in service for only two years. <b>Puglia</b> was the only ship of the class to {{take an active role in}} the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, <b>Puglia</b> became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold <b>Puglia</b> in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Puglia</b> served {{abroad for}} much of her early career, {{including}} periods in South American and East Asian waters. She saw action in the Italo-Turkish War in 191112, primarily in the Red Sea. During the war she bombarded Ottoman ports in Arabia and assisted in enforcing a blockade on maritime traffic in the area. She was still in service during World War I; the only action in which she participated was the evacuation of units from the Serbian Army from Durazzo in February 1916. During the evacuation, she bombarded the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. After the war, <b>Puglia</b> {{was involved in the}} occupation of the Dalmatian coast, and in 1920 her captain was murdered in a violent confrontation in Split with Croatian nationalists. The old cruiser was sold for scrapping in 1923, but much of her bow was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
50|$|However, {{following}} numerous bankruptcies {{that involved}} every southern team in Prima Divisione (second level) except the <b>Puglia's</b> teams, were later promoted in Prima Divisione also Savoia and Tivoli.

50|$|The vine is {{vigorous}} and high-yielding with {{a preference for}} calcareous and limey soils but adapting readily to others. It is well suited to <b>Puglia’s</b> hot summers and exhibits good drought-resistance. The grapes, carried in bunches of around 300-350 g, are oval in form, medium-large in size with thick skins, and black-violet in colour. They ripen mid-season (late September-early October). The first American producer of Negroamaro is Chiarito Vineyards in Ukiah, California (Mendocino County).|$|R

5000|$|... "The Albanian Mafia {{seems to}} have {{established}} good working relationships with the Italian Mafia". [...] "On the 27th of July 1999 police in Durres (Albania), with Italian assistance arrested one of the godfathers of the [...] "Sacra Corona Unita", <b>Puglia’s</b> Italian mafia. This Albanian link seems {{to confirm that the}} Sacra Corona Unita and the Albanian mafia are [...] "partners" [...] in Puglia/Italy and delegate several criminal activities". Thus, in many areas of Italy, the market for cannabis, prostitution, and smuggling is run mainly by Albanians. Links to Calabria’s mafia, the Ndrangheta, exist in Northern Italy. Several key figures of the Albanian mafia seem to reside frequently in the Calabrian towns of Africo, Platì, and Bovalino (Italy), fiefs of the Ndrangheta. Southern Albanian groups also have good relationships with Sicily’s Cosa Nostra.|$|R
40|$|The {{trade of}} wheat and wool {{has been one}} of the {{economic}} pillars of the Kingdom of Naples during Modern Age. Since Romans times the production of these commodities – in the continental part of the Kingdom – has been regulated by the trashumance system that coordinated the flow of sheep on <b>Puglia’s</b> Tavoliere lands. We would highlight the role exercised by the institutions as development agents. In particular, the paper would demonstrate that the new institutions introduced by the king Alfonso I of Aragon were the main driver not only of trashumance but of the entire economic framework of the kingdom. A simple analytical model based on the complementary dynamics of pasturing and wheat production shows the results of the functioning of the new system. The results challenges the negative interpretation of the trashumance led on by the Neapolitan Reformers (illuministi) at the end of XVIII Century and widely absorbed by historians in the XX Century...|$|R

25|$|After {{the accord}} of Melfi, Pope Niccolo II {{gave to the}} Normans the {{government}} of Calabria and <b>Puglia.</b> The Normans were very democratic and enterprising. We owe to them {{the creation of the}} Abbey of Sant' Eufemia Lamezia, the construction of the Sanctuary of the Madonna of Dipodi, the fortification of the Amato Plains and the introduction of the sugar cane. Under Norman rule the Amato Plains enjoyed peace and prosperity. Under their rule Pope Callistro II personally visited all the towns of the Amato Plains. During this visit he inaugurated the Sanctuary of Dipodi, consecrated the Cathedral of Nicastro, the Church of Mileto and then he went to Catanzaro to consecrate the Church Maggiore.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{crossing}} between Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo occurred {{is not known}} with some believing the cross happened in Tuscany while other ampelographers suggesting it may have happened in southern Italy. Evidence for this latter theory is the proliferation of seedless mutations of Sangiovese, known under various synonyms, throughout various regions of southern Italy including Campania, Corinto nero which is grown {{on the island of}} Lipari just north of Sicily and Tuccanese from the <b>Puglia</b> region in the heel of the Italian boot. In Campania, among the many seedless mutations of Sangiovese still growing in the region are Nerello from the commune of Savelli, Nerello Campotu from the commune of Motta San Giovanni, Puttanella from Mandatoriccio and Vigna del Conte.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, Sangiovese {{has been}} known {{under a variety of}} synonyms, many of which have come to be {{associated}} with a particular clone of the grape variety.

In 1914, Liguria had all of her 15cm guns removed, along with six of the 37mm guns. [...] Her armament was reduced further in 1917 when she was refitted as a minelayer; at this point, she mounted only six 12cm guns and two 37mm guns. Starting in 1915, Etruria and Lombardia were equipped with only six 12cm guns, six 57mm guns for Etruria and eight for Lombardia, two 37mm guns, and their torpedo tubes.
