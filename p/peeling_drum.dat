40|$|Plastics are not degradable materials, {{therefore}} improper disposal after use constitute environmental problem. The developed plastic recycler was fabricated using 1. 5 mm mild {{metal sheet}} punched and rolled into cylindrical form. The outer <b>peeling</b> <b>drum</b> was punched inward and {{fixed to the}} machine frame while the inner <b>peeling</b> <b>drum</b> was punched outward. The inner drum was constructed using 1. 5 mm galvanized metal sheet while the die was constructed using carbon steel. It has an outer diameter of 70 mm and inner diameter of 68 mm. The main frame of the machine was constructed from 50 x 50 mm angle bar to provide support for other units. It has a height of 850 mm, length of 6600 mm and width of 400 mm. A 68 mm diameter and 550 mm length cast iron rod shaft ensures satisfactory rigidity and strength when the shaft transmits power under different operating and loading conditions {{with the aid of}} a 3 kW, 3 -phase electric motor. The performance valuation of the machine was carried out using polythene bags and polyethylene bottles at speeds 200 and 300 rpm and temperature of 220 oC. Results obtained indicated that torque increases for all screw speeds due to a proportional increase in extruder feed rate as screw speed is decreased. The recycling efficiency of the machine is estimated to be 86 % while the capacity of the machine is 300 kg/hr. Hence, a cost effective machine for recycling low-density plastic was developed. This will help solve disposal problems of plastics...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{experimental}} {{determination of the}} fracture toughness of inter-ply interfaces in monolithic composite specimens is far from trivial: even in standard test methods such as the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB), some precautions must be taken {{in the choice of}} the test configurations and in the post-treatment of the experimental results.

In this paper, we investigate an alternative test configuration, the Climbing <b>Drum</b> <b>Peel</b> (CDP) test, classically used in the ‘adhesives’ community.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{characterize}} adhesive bonding performance through the fracture evaluation. Failure modes correlate to the bond strength, in which the weak bond of adhesion will be considered unacceptable in the aircraft manufacture certification, whereas the cohesion bond as strong as adhesive itself is preferably accepted.

A good anodizing treatment is properly maintained in order to eliminate possible bond failures in the long term bond durability in service.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} the Mode I fracture toughness of core/facesheet bonds in sandwich Structures is desired, {{particularly with the}} widespread use of models that need this data as input. This study examined if a critical strain energy release rate, G(sub IC), can be obtained from the climbing <b>drum</b> <b>peel</b> (CDP) test. The CDP test is relatively simple to perform and does not rely on measuring small crack lengths such as required by the double cantilever beam (DCB) test. Simple energy methods were used to calculate G(sub IC) from CDP test data on composite facesheets bonded to a honeycomb core. Facesheet thicknesses from 2 to 5 plies were tested to examine the upper and lower bounds on facesheet thickness requirements. Results from the study suggest that the CDP test, with certain provisions, can be used to find the GIG value of a core/facesheet bond...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} a novel K-Cor sandwich structure reinforced with partially-cured Z-pins. The influence of pultrusion processing parameters on Z-pins characteristics was studied {{and the effect of}} Z-pins on mechanical properties was disclosed. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical microscopy (OM) methods were employed to determine the curing degree of as-prepared Z-pins and observe the implanted Z-pins in the K-Cor structure. These partially-cured Z-pins were treated with a stronger bonding link between face sheets and the foam core by means of a hot-press process, thereby decreasing burrs and cracking defects when the Z-pins were implanted into the Rohacell foam core. The results of the out-of-plane tensile tests and the climbing <b>drum</b> <b>peel</b> (CDP) tests showed that K-Cor structures exhibited superior mechanical performance as compared to X-Cor and blank foam core.

40|$|Composite {{sandwich}} structures {{will be used}} in many future applications in aerospace, marine and offshore industries {{due to the fact that}} the strength and stiffness to mass ratios surpass any other structural type. Sandwich structure also offers advantages over traditional stiffened panels such as ease of manufacturing and repair. During the last three decades, sandwich structure has been used extensively for secondary structure in aircraft (fuselage floors, rudders and radome structure). Sandwich structure is also used as primary structure in rotorcraft, the most common example being the trailing edge of rotor blades. As with other types of composite construction, sandwich structure exhibits several types of failure mode such as facesheet wrinkling, core crushing and sandwich buckling. Facesheet/core debonding has also been observed in the marine and aerospace industry. During this failure mode, peel stresses applied to an existing facesheet/core debond or an interface low in toughness, results in the facesheet being peeled from the core material, possibly leading to a significant loss in structural integrity of the sandwich panel. In an incident during a test on a liquid hydrogen fuel tank of the X- 33 prototype vehicle, the outer graphite/epoxy facesheet and honeycomb core became debonded from the inner facesheet along significant areas, leading to failure of the tank. As a consequence of the accident; significant efforts were made to characterize the toughness of the facesheet/core bond. Currently, the only standardized method available for assessing the quality of the facesheet/core interface is the climbing <b>drum</b> <b>peel</b> test (ASTM D 1781). During this test a sandwich beam is removed from a panel and the lip of one of the facesheets is attached to a drum, as shown in Fig. 1. The drum is then rotated along the sandwich beam, causing the facesheet to peel from the core. This method has two major drawbacks. First, it is not possible to obtain quantitative fracture data from the test and so the results can only be used in a qualitative manner. Second, only sandwich structure with thin facesheets can be tested (to facilitate wrapping of the facesheet around the climbing drum). In recognition of the need for a more quantitative facesheet/core fracture test, several workers have devised experimental techniques for characterizing the toughness of the facesheet/core interface. In all of these cases, the tests are designed to yield a mode I-dominated fracture toughness of the facesheet/core interface in a manner similar to that used to determine mode I fracture toughness of composite laminates. In the current work, a modified double cantilever beam is used to measure the mode I-dominated fracture toughness of the interface in a sandwich consisting of glass/phenolic honeycomb core reinforced with graphite epoxy facesheets. Two specimen configurations were tested as shown in Fig 2. The first configuration consisted of reinforcing the facesheets with aluminum blocks (Fig. 2 a). In the second configuration unreinforced specimens were tested (Fig. 2 b). Climbing <b>drum</b> <b>peel</b> tests were also conducted to compare the fracture behavior observed between this test and the modified double cantilever beam. This paper outlines the test procedures and data reduction strategies used to compute fracture toughness values from the tests. The effect of specimen reinforcement on fracture toughness of the facesheet/core interface is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} energy {{absorption}} characteristics of honey comb sandwich panels manufactured from recyclable materials. In this study, honeycomb cores were manufactured from sawdust-polypropylene composites. The composites were thermoformed between matched-dies into half hexagonal profiles which were ultrasonically bonded at their nodes and facesheets to form recyclable sandwich panels. As the bonding efficiency at the nodes and the core-to-facing interface will {{be governed by}} several process parameters, an L 8 partial factorial and full factorial design of experiments (DoE) based on the Taguchi method was used. Single lap shear {{test was used to}} determine the shear strength of the bond at the nodes, and climbing <b>drum</b> <b>peel</b> test was used to determine the skin-to-core bonding strength in the sandwich panels. The energy absorption characteristic of the honeycombs was determined experimentally by subjecting them to quasi-static compressive loads. The effect of the thickness-to-length ratio (t/l) of the cell walls on the energy absorption was evaluated using finite element (FE) modelling, and energy absorption maps were constructed for various t/l ratios. Taguchi analysis suggested setting all the parameters at their highest levels to obtain maximum lap shear strength at the nodes and indicated that the hold time has negligible influence, following which a L 8 full factorial DoE based on orthogonal arrays was used to maximise the peel load, neglecting the hold time parameter. The results indicated a minor interaction between the welding amplitude and welding time, indicating the increase in welding amplitude should be complimented with the welding time. However, this interaction was marginal compared to the main factor effects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} {{a review of}} the main activities carried out {{within the context of the}} ‘COMPTINN’ research program, for the activities focusing on the durability and thermo-oxidation behaviour of organic matrix composite materials at ‘high’ temperatures (120 °C- 180 °C). The scientific aim of ‘COMPTINN’ research program was to better identify, with a multi-scale approach, the link between durability, accelerating ageing factors and physical mechanisms involved in thermo-oxidation phenomena, and to provide theoretical and numerical tools for predicting the mechanical behaviour of aged composite materials including damage onset and development. Work has been carried out on continuous carbon fibre composite with epoxy matrix. The influence of thermo oxidation on the mechanical behaviour of the matrix, the creep properties and durability of the composite, has been identified with ultra-micro indentation (UMI). Based on the evolution of the elastic indentation modulus of the resin in the thickness of a sample exposed to oxidative environment at 150 °C for different durations, we have clearly validated that the thickness of the oxidised layer is linked with the exposed time. Another innovative experimental technique has also been used: a climbing <b>drum</b> <b>peel</b> test has been modified to investigate the influence of oxygen on mode I delamination propagation in a composite laminate. In this test, crack propagation is driven by oxidation under constant mechanical energy and the delamination propagation speed can be linked with the oxidation level. This enables one to identify the critical strain energy release rate associated with an oxidized interface and to predict the interaction between mechanical and environmental loadings. Thermo-oxidation is identified as the result of oxygen diffusion and oxygen reaction with the molecular structure of the resin. The predominance of chain scissions over crosslinking leads to a decrease in the glass transition temperature combined with an increase in the Young’s modulus at room temperature (called “antiplasticization” effect). This process is also at the origin of matrix shrinkage, weight loss and cracks initiation...|$|R
40|$|Fast moved {{machine tool}} {{assemblies}} should be light and stiff. By reason of the lightweight construction and the dynamical loads these assemblies {{are susceptible to}} vibrations very often. Aluminium foam sandwiches are laminates with an aluminium foam core and compact cover sheets. The foam cores have a high energy absorption. Machine tool assemblies constructed with aluminium foam sandwiches offer very high flexural stiffness together with comparatively light weight. Vibrations generated by machining are damped very well due to the cellular structure of foam. For industrial applications of sandwiches with aluminum foam core {{it is necessary to}} obtain adhesive forces above the strength of the aluminum foam. This condition will be fulfilled when in case of loading the foam will be destroyed and not the connection between cover sheet and foam core. Aim of the following examinations was to determine the bond strengths of different sandwiches. For this reason, the materials of the cover sheets and of the foam, as well as the surface properties of the cover sheets were varied. The alloys AlMg 1 Si 0. 5 and AlSi 10 have been used for the foam core. By using <b>drum</b> <b>peeling</b> tests according to DIN 53295 the adhesion of different combinations of different cover sheet/aluminum foam have been analyzed. Good adhesion have been reached for sandwiches with cover sheets made of low-alloy steel, in connection with AlMg 1 Si 0. 5 core layers. Surface treatment (e. g. blast cleaning) leads to increased adhesion. Clearly worse results were obtained with the alloy AlSi 10 and high-grade steel cover plates, except for the high-grade steel 1. 4713 for which in combination with the alloy AlMg 1 Si 0. 5 good adhesion was obtained, too. Reproducible and high adhesive strength within compound structures is necessary for launching serial production of these semi-finished foam products. For the future there will be focus on pursuing analyses based on the present results...|$|R
