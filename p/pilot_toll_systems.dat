50|$|The <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> of Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway is {{a closed}} road system that uses cards with {{magnetic}} strips, and from March 2016, electronic toll collection, using the Easytrip system by its concessionaire, Manila North Tollways Corporation, is introduced, eventually integrating the <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> of the expressway with North Luzon Expressway's. Before March 2016, the <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> is completely independent, with toll collection from NLEX {{and vice versa}} being done at a toll plaza on Clark Spur Road in Mabalacat, until the structure's demolition following the <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> integration.|$|R

In this paper we discuss imposed methods to charge infrastructure used in Slovakia and abroad. Further analysed are various electronic <b>toll</b> <b>systems</b> applied in chosen Central European country and Slovakia. All the electronic <b>toll</b> <b>systems</b> used in the Slovak Republic and Poland are successively analysed.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to make an {{analysis}} of the <b>tolling</b> <b>system</b> of Czech republic. The analysis was approached via data collection, based on this analysis recommendation on implementing <b>tolling</b> <b>system</b> on II. and eventually in limited scope on III. class road was proposed. In this proposal economical, ecological aspects and aspects of safety were taken into account. The theory section is devoted to road-pricing in general and it is also orientated on electronic <b>tolling</b> <b>system.</b> In the section of practical applications of theory the analysis of existing <b>tolling</b> <b>system</b> of Czech republic and selected countries of EU was taken. Through all identified information the possible benefits and risks of <b>tolling</b> <b>system</b> expansion on lower class roads were detected. As well as there was assessment of overall efficiency from a fiscal and regulatory point of view. In conclusion there were set out alternative possibilities and approaches...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the Electronic <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> as a {{regulatory}} action for traffic management. All sorts of transportation have detrimental effects on the environment and ultimately the public health. Therefore, the mail aim of the thesis is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} electronic <b>toll</b> <b>systems</b> as a tool for traffic regulation within cities. To this end a comparison of available technologies by several criteria is presented and optimal solutions including the order of preference of specific technologies are suggested. Modern electronic <b>toll</b> <b>systems</b> enable variable setting of the toll amounts to reflect specific needs of particular towns and cities such as reduction of vehicle entry, noise or emissions as well as congestions of traffic and other issues. The text is accompanied by examples of possible traffic management by the means of an electronic <b>toll</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
