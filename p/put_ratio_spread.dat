For this purpose, we use Vertical <b>Ratio</b> Call <b>Spread</b> and Vertical <b>Ratio</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Spread</b> option strategies. We also show in theory and in practice as well the ways of creating these option strategies and their usage for spreading the profit interval for long and short positions open, and without any additional costs...|$|R
50|$|The {{backspread}} is {{the converse}} strategy to the <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> {{and is also}} known as reverse <b>ratio</b> <b>spread.</b> Using calls, a bullish strategy known as the call backspread can be constructed and with puts, a strategy known as the put backspread can be constructed.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Ratio</b> <b>spread</b> is a complex, multileg options {{position}} {{that is a}} variation of a vertical spread. Like a vertical, the <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> involves buying and selling options on the same underlying security with different strike prices and the same expiration date. Unlike a vertical spread, a number of option contracts sold is not equal {{to a number of}} contracts bought. An unequal number of options contracts gives this spread certain unique properties compared to a regular vertical <b>spread.</b> A typical <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> would be where twice as much option contracts are sold, thus forming a 1:2 ratio.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{perception}} that whenever a Stockgoes down, traders in that stock aredoomed. This was probably true before 2001, when derivatives were not introduced in the IndianStock Markets.

One such strategy in optionssegment of derivatives is <b>Ratio</b> <b>spread</b> with Calls. This strategy has Zero Risk on the downside (with chosen strike prices and entry time), and if theMarket is mildly bullish, profits can also be madeon the upside.

40|$|Three {{government}} bond futures contracts {{and their respective}} 3 -month interest rate futures contracts traded on LIFFE are examined. The data period covers three years of observations, January 1994 -December 1996, sampled at half-hourly intervals. Borrowing from the calculation of minimum variance hedge ratios, half-hourly minimum variance <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> (the ratio of one contract to another, which provides the minimum variance) are estimated for the above contracts. The hypothesis under examination is whether there is any value-added in estimating minimum <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> based on intraday data. Three <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> are defined: two ratios calculated from daily data and a third one based on intraday data. Evidence tends to indicate that <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> calculated from intraday data exhibit a substantially lower variance {{than the other two}} <b>spread</b> <b>ratio</b> speciications. Thus, it is shown that intraday data, in comparison with daily data, allow for lower hedging costs. Moreover, the use of intraday-based <b>spread</b> <b>ratios</b> might be a contributing factor to reducing the maximum cumulative loss potentially incurred while holding a spread position.

40|$|The maximum {{spreading}} of drops impacting on {{smooth and}} rough surfaces is measured from low to high impact velocity for liquids with different surface tensions and viscosities. We demonstrate that dynamic wetting {{plays an important}} role in the spreading at low velocity, characterized by the dynamic contact angle at maximum spreading. In the energy balance, we account for the dynamic wettability by introducing the capillary energy at zero impact velocity, which relates to the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero impact velocity. Correcting the measured <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> by the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero velocity, we find a correct scaling behaviour for low and high impact velocity and, by interpolation between the two, we find a universal scaling curve. The influence of the liquid as well as the nature and roughness of the surface are taken into account properly by rescaling with the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> at zero velocity, which, as demonstrated, is equivalent to accounting for the dynamic contact angle...|$|R

30|$|A more {{detailed}} {{exploration of the}} role of community age in the relationship between nucleus-to-periphery ratio and future activity, is illustrated in Additional file  1 : Figure S 1. In that figure, we divide communities into six tiers of age. The situation depicted in that figure is a bit more complex. As communities age, the optimal nucleus-to-periphery <b>ratio</b> <b>spreads</b> out and then for communities of 2  years and older, it narrows again at a lower value. In other words, as communities reach very old ages, a small nucleus is associated with more activity (even though, in general, future activity wanes as communities mature).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{information}} theoretic {{capacity of}} a single-user ultra-wideband (UWB) communications is investigated for various modulations under specific UWB regimes: low power spectral density, large <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio,</b> and a highly dispersive channel. We demonstrate that biphase modulation provides the best performance among several studied formats. The performance loss due to a fixed low coding rate is negligible in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. It is shown that capacity {{can be obtained by}} fixing the <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> and allowing the coding rate to vary. However, little is lost by employing a distancedependent <b>spreading</b> <b>ratio</b> {{in the presence of a}} fixed coding rate. I...|$|R

INTRODUCTION There is an increasing emphasis on the provision of meaningful warranty conditions and reliability predictions for software 1. This has been parallelled by greater emphasis on statistical control of the software process 2.

50|$|In {{order to}} inject ions from an {{external}} ion source, the field between the electrodes is first reduced. As ion packets are injected tangentially into the field, the electric field is increased by ramping the voltage {{on the inner}} electrode. Ions get squeezed towards the inner electrode until they reach the desired orbit inside the trap. At that moment ramping is stopped, the field becomes static, and detection can start. Each packet contains a multitude of ions of different velocities spread over a certain volume. These ions move with different rotational frequencies but with the same axial frequency. This means that ions of a specific mass-to-charge <b>ratio</b> <b>spread</b> into rings which oscillate along the inner spindle.|$|R
50|$|Rational {{trigonometry}} follows {{an approach}} {{built on the}} methods of linear algebra to the topics of elementary (high school level) geometry.

(Spread also corresponds to a scaled form of the inner product between line segments taken as vectors). The three main laws in trigonometry: Pythagoras's theorem, the sine law and the cosine law, given in rational (square-equivalent) form, are augmented by two further laws: the triple quad formula (relating the quadrances of three collinear points) and the triple spread formula (relating the spreads of three concurrent lines), giving the five main laws of the subject.|$|R

These ratios reflect various changes that hold between years 2003 and 2012. Under the time of financial crisis, recession and serious socio-economic changes the profitability parameter Gross Profit ranged from 2003 - 2011 = 16. 12 - 22. 79 % (average = 19. 20 %; mean = 19. 78 %; σ = 2. 41), but in 2012 decreased on 14. 35 %. Net Profit ranged 2003 - 2011 = 10. 96 - 18. 3 % (average = 14. 62 %; mean = 16. 62 %; σ = 4. 92), while in 2012 reached only 2. 29 %. Debt ratio ranged from 2003 - 2012 = 2. 33 - 4. 81 (average = 3. 44; mean = 3. 07; σ = 0. 82). Liquidity parameters Current <b>Ratio</b> <b>spread</b> between 2003 - 2012 = 1. 13 - 1. 71 (average = 1. 43; mean = 1. 46; σ = 0. 15) and Quick <b>Ratio</b> <b>spread</b> between 2003 - 2012 = 0. 72 - 1. 27 (average = 1. 07; mean = 1. 09; σ = 0. 15).

40|$|Documenting {{spread and}} {{combination}} trading {{in a major}} options market for the first time, we find that spreads and combinations collectively account for over 55 % of large trades (trades of 100 contracts or more) in the Eurodollar options market and almost 75 % of the trading volume due to large trades. In terms of total volume, the four most heavily traded combinations are (in order) : straddles, <b>ratio</b> <b>spreads,</b> vertical spreads, and strangles. These four represent about two thirds of all combination trades. On the other hand, condors, horizontal spreads, guts, iron flys, box spreads, guts, covered calls or puts, and synthetics are very rarely traded while trading is light in collars, diagonal spreads, butterflies, straddle spreads, seagulls, doubles, and delta-neutral combinations. Significant differences in size, cost, and time-to-expirations are found among the various combination types. Our results confirm that traders use spreads and combinations to construct portfolios which are highly sensitive to some risk factors and much less sensitive to other risk factors. The most popular combination designs are those yielding portfolios which are quite sensitive to volatility and less sensitive to directional changes in the underlying asset value- thoug...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new risk management tools such as revenue insurance has dramatically expanded the tools from which producers may choose to manage revenue risk. Little is known regarding how these products interact with market-based risk management tools such as futures and options. Our analysis addresses this issue by examining optimal futures and <b>put</b> <b>ratios</b> under increasing levels of insurance coverage. Four alternative insurance designs are examined. Two are yield triggered and two reflect currently available revenue insurance designs. The analysis is conducted by using a revenue simulation model which incorporates four random variables; futures price, basis, county yield, and farm-county yield differences. Optimal hedge and at-the-money <b>put</b> options <b>ratios</b> are derived for an expected utility maximizing corn producer in four distinct geographical regions. Revenue insurance tends to result in slightly lower hedging demand than would occur given {{the same level of}} yield insurance coverage. To the extent that producers would switch from yield insurance to revenue insurance there would be a decline in the demand for hedging. If a person were to go from being uninsured to the purchase of one of the insurance designs, we fmd that the revenue products result in a hedge ratio that is at least as high as the uninsured case when considering the permissible levels of coverage...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Plant growth {{regulators}} play {{an important}} role in seed germination. However, much of the current knowledge about their function during seed germination was obtained using orthodox seeds as model systems, and there is a paucity of information about the role of plant growth regulators during germination of recalcitrant seeds. In the present work, two endangered woody species with recalcitrant seeds, Araucaria angustifolia (Gymnosperm) and Ocotea odorifera (Angiosperm), native to the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil, were used to study the mobilization of polyamines (PAs), indole-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) during seed germination. Methods Data were sampled from embryos of O. odorifera and embryos and megagametophytes of A. angustifolia throughout the germination process. Biochemical analyses were carried out in HPLC. Key Results During seed germination, an increase in the (Spd + Spm) : <b>Put</b> <b>ratio</b> was recorded in embryos in both species. An increase in IAA and PA levels was also observed during seed germination in both embryos, while ABA levels showed a decrease in O. odorifera and an increase in A. angustifolia embryos throughout the period studied. Conclusions The (Spd + Spm) : <b>Put</b> <b>ratio</b> could be used as a marker for germination completion. The increase in IAA levels, prior to germination, could be associated with variations in PA content. The ABA mobilization observed in the embryos could represent a greater resistance to this hormone in recalcitrant seeds, in comparison to orthodox seeds, opening a new perspective for studies on the effects of this regulator in recalcitrant seeds. The gymnosperm seed, though without a connective tissue between megagametophyte and embryo, seems to be able to maintain communication between the tissues, based on the likely transport of plant growth regulators.
