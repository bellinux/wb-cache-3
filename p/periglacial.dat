5|$|Glacial {{conditions}} ended suddenly, 11,550 years BP, {{when the}} Gulf Stream current was re-established. <b>Periglacial</b> processes in seasonal freeze-thaw conditions, both present and past, have produced sorted stone stripes and solifluction lobes and sheets {{on the summit}} ridge of Helvellyn.

5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a <b>periglacial</b> region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Hallival and Askival {{are formed}} from an {{extraordinary}} series of layered igneous rocks created as olivine and feldspar crystals accumulated {{at the base}} of a magma chamber. The chamber eventually collapsed, forming a caldera. There are swarms of near-vertical dykes of basalt on the northwest coast between Kilmory and Guirdil, created by basaltic magma forcing its way into fissures in the pre-existing rock. The western hills, although less elevated than the Cuillin, exhibit a superb collection of <b>periglacial</b> landforms including boulder sheets and lobes, turf-banked terraces, ploughing boulders and patterned ground. On Orval and Ard Nev the weathered basalt and granophyre has been sorted by frost heaving into circles 50centimetres in diameter and weathering on Barkeval has produced unusual rock sculptures. On Sròn an t-Saighdeir there are large sorted granite boulder circles 2–3metres across on the flat summit and sorted stripes on the slopes. Lava flowing away from the volcanic centre formed Bloodstone Hill, gas bubbles leaving holes in the structure that were then filled with green agate flecked with red. There are some outcrops of the pre-volcanic Lewisian gneiss near Dibidil in the southeast corner of the island, and more extensive deposits of sandstone in the north and east.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authorities}} had included the northern pika as a subspecies of the alpine pika. However, in 1973, Nikolai Vorontsov and Elena Ivanitskaya, {{pointed out the}} difference between their chromosome numbers. In 1980, Vladimir Sokolov and V. N. Orlov treated them as separate species, with their ranges overlapping in the Khenteii and Khangai Mountains in Mongolia. It is believed that after glaciation, the ancestors of the alpine pika were restricted to {{the borders of the}} Sayan and Altai glaciers, as well as the <b>periglacial</b> region of the major North Asiatic glaciation. The American pika and the collared pika were also included as subspecies of the alpine pika, by A.I. Argyropulo in 1948, A.A. Gureev in 1964, and G.B. Corbet in 1968. However, in 1981, M.L. Weston found out that they were morphologically different from the alpine pika. In 1986, Corbet and J.E. Hill treated them as separate species. O. a. sushkini was formerly considered a subspecies of the Pallas's pika, but is now a subspecies of the alpine pika. The Helan Shan pika and the Hoffmann's pika were formerly included as a subspecies of the alpine pika, but are now considered an independent species based on their chromosome number, morphology, and bioacoustic behaviour.|$|E

25|$|A stone run (called also stone river, stone stream or stone sea) is a {{conspicuous}} rock landform, {{result of the}} erosion of particular rock varieties caused by myriad freezing-thawing cycles taking place in <b>periglacial</b> conditions during the last Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|Abkhazia is richly {{irrigated}} {{by small}} rivers {{originating in the}} Caucasus Mountains. Chief of these are: Kodori, Bzyb, Ghalidzga, and Gumista. The Psou River separates the region from Russia, and the Inguri serves as a boundary between Abkhazia and Georgia proper. There are several <b>periglacial</b> and crater lakes in mountainous Abkhazia. Lake Ritsa {{is the most important}} of them.|$|E
25|$|The Kobuk River is a <b>periglacial</b> river, fed by {{a remnant}} glacial lake (Walker Lake) and {{mountain}} snowmelt in the Brooks Range. It cuts a channel through a landscape otherwise dominated by permafrost. The Kobuk’s current form and structure {{is a direct}} result of several stages of erosion and channel formation following the last glacial retreat.|$|E
25|$|The latest {{concept of}} the origin of the Driftless Area is the pre-Illinoian {{continental}} glacial ice flowing over the Driftless Area and depositing on it pre-Illinoian till, which is more than 790,000 years old. When the ice retreated and uncovered the area, <b>periglacial</b> erosion removed it: Anticyclonic snow-bearing winds episodically dropped large amounts of snow, which then gradually removed superficial sediment by solifluction and snowmelt overland flow, so-called sheetwash.|$|E
25|$|In geology, {{physical}} geography, {{and sediment}} transport, fluvial processes relate to flowing water in natural systems. This encompasses rivers, streams, <b>periglacial</b> flows, flash floods and glacial lake outburst floods. Sediment moved by {{water can be}} larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher density and viscosity. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of sand and gravel size, but larger floods can carry cobbles and even boulders.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{actively}} work {{to understand}} {{past and future}} climate by using observations and theoretical models. A climate record—extending deep into the Earth's past—has been assembled, {{and continues to be}} built up, based on geological evidence from borehole temperature profiles, cores removed from deep accumulations of ice, floral and faunal records, glacial and <b>periglacial</b> processes, stable-isotope and other analyses of sediment layers, and records of past sea levels. More recent data are provided by the instrumental record. General circulation models, based on the physical sciences, are often used in theoretical approaches to match past climate data, make future projections, and link causes and effects in climate change.|$|E
25|$|Xerocrassa geyeri {{seems to}} have survived in local refugia the {{reduction}} of the favourable steppe-like habitat due to climatic extremes during the pleniglacial and interstadial periods, as it is the case today. Pfenninger & Bahl (1997) suggested that snail species with restricted dispersal might survive in habitats of a size in the magnitude of few square meters. There is increasing evidence that such small spots with a favourable microclimate existed in the <b>periglacial</b> area of central Europe and were presumed to have provided refuges for comparatively cold resistant snail species. Southern and eastern European refugia were also supplemented by cryptic sanctuaries in northern Europe during the late Pleistocene in shaping present day species composition.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the general}} mammoth {{population}} died out for climatic reasons or due to overhunting by humans is controversial. During {{the transition from}} the Late Pleistocene epoch to the Holocene epoch, there was shrinkage of the distribution of the mammoth because progressive warming {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene epoch changed the mammoth's environment. The mammoth steppe was a <b>periglacial</b> landscape with rich herb and grass vegetation that disappeared along with the mammoth because of environmental changes in the climate. Mammoths had moved to isolated spots in Eurasia, where they disappeared completely. Also, it is thought that Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic human hunters might have affected the size of the last mammoth populations in Europe. There is evidence to suggest that humans did cause the mammoth extinction, although there is no definitive proof. It was found that humans living south of a mammoth steppe learned to adapt themselves to the harsher climates north of the steppe, where mammoths resided. It was concluded that if humans could survive the harsh north climate of that particular mammoth steppe then it was possible humans could hunt (and eventually extinguish) mammoths everywhere. Another hypothesis suggests mammoths fell victim to an infectious disease.|$|E

Patterned ground is also common. Permafrost is found at higher altitudes. Cryoplanation and solifluction landforms are also observed on Iris and Mitral. Other than on periglacially influenced terrain, the ground at Llullaillaco is formed mostly by lavic rocks and block debris, which are frequently buried by tephra.|$|E

500|$|The gorge {{was formed}} by meltwater floods during the cold <b>periglacial</b> periods which have {{occurred}} over the last 1.2million years. During the ice ages permafrost blocked the caves with ice and frozen mud and made the limestone impermeable. When this melted during the summers, water was forced to flow on the surface, and carved out the gorge. During warmer periods the water flowed underground through the permeable limestone, creating the caves and leaving the gorge dry, so that today much of the gorge has no river until the underground Cheddar Yeo river emerges in the lower part from Gough's Cave. The river is used by Bristol Water, who maintain a series of dams and ponds which supply the nearby Cheddar Reservoir, ...|$|E
500|$|The geology of Southcote {{includes}} the Reading Formation—rock strata in the Lambeth Group consisting of clay, silt and sand {{formed in the}} Palaeogene period. Bedrock in Southcote is also formed of chalk, with geological surveys also finding flint samples. A map produced by the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1860 identifies the area as being predominantly Plastic Clay (now known as the Lambeth Group) and chalk north of the river, with flint and gravel samples typical of the Bagshot Formation south of the Kennet. More specifically, the 2000 survey showed different types of gravel, including Winter Hill (variably clayey and sandy), Lynch Hill (sand and gravel with lenses of silt, clay or peat), and head (a polymict deposit usually formed by <b>periglacial</b> solifluction or gelifluction). The survey also identified {{that much of the}} land south of the Kennet is [...] "infilled" [...] or [...] "worked" [...] ground; this area was formerly gravel pits and now used for leisure.

500|$|Intense {{glaciation}} {{has taken}} place at Level Mountain in the last 5.33 million years, {{as shown by the}} presence of strongly developed glacial grooves reaching elevations over [...] This evidence indicates that much of the massif was covered by ice during past glacial periods, with the latest glacial period ending approximately 12,000 years ago. A series of U-shaped valleys have been carved into the stratovolcano by radially directed alpine glaciers. These serve as a radial drainage for at least six small streams; Dudidontu, Kakuchuya, Beatty, Lost, Kaha and Little Tahltan. Those that flow from the Level Mountain Range drain across the lava plateau in a pinwheel-like fashion. Two streams, Kakuchuya and Dudidontu, contain a series of small lakes. The Kakuchuya and Beatty creek valleys have been eroded to a level below that of the plateau surface. Also dissecting the massif are V-shaped stream canyons along the lava plateau margin, exposing a section of Tertiary basalts along the Grand Canyon of the Stikine. <b>Periglacial</b> processes, such as cryoturbation and stone stripping, occur on Level Mountain at elevations greater than [...] Cryoturbation takes place mainly on flat and gently sloping areas while stone stripping happens primarily on gently sloping areas adjacent to peaks of the Level Mountain Range. Some of the steeper slopes of the Level Mountain Range are confined to nivation and solifluction. Snow avalanches are limited only to the Level Mountain Range and the steepest slopes.|$|E
