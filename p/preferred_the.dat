The Xbox version of the game sold 159,000 copies in August 2004, and was among the best-selling games on any platform during June 2004; it was later re-released as a Platinum Hits title. Conversely, the PC version sold 32,500 after six months on shelves.|$|E

When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer <b>preferred</b> <b>the</b> chamber music version anyway.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} toward a new stadium, with the city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still <b>preferred</b> <b>the</b> Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean <b>preferred</b> <b>the</b> Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a massive disparity between the East and West Divisions, it decided {{in the middle of}} the season to grant the fourth place Western team a playoff berth.

In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E
