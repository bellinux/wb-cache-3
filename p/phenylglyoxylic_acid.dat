Transient-evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were recorded and analyzed in a sample of workers (15 subjects) exposed to styrene and noise in a fiberglass manufacturing facility and in a control group of 13 non-exposed subjects. Individual exposure monitoring of the airborne styrene concentrations was performed, as well as biological monitoring, based on the urinary concentration of two styrene metabolites, the Mandelic and <b>Phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> Noise exposure was evaluated using wearable phonometers, and hearing loss with pure tone audiometry. Due to their different job tasks, one group of workers was exposed to high noise and low styrene levels, another group to higher styrene levels, close to the limit of 20 [*]ppm, and to low noise levels. A significant negative correlation was found between the otoacoustic emission levels and the concentration of the styrene urinary metabolites.

The highest levels of human exposure to styrene occur during the production of reinforced plastic products. The objective of this work was to evaluate both DNA and cytogenetic damage in styrene-exposed workers, analysing only non-smoker individuals. Environmental levels of styrene and urinary concentrations of mandelic and <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acids</b> were determined, and genetic damage was studied by means of micronucleus (MN) test, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and comet assay. Fifty-two fibreglass-reinforced plastics workers and 54 controls took part in the study. The mean air concentration of styrene in the breathing zone of workers exceeded the threshold limit value, and 24 workers exceeded the biological exposure index. A strong and significant correlation was found between styrene environmental concentrations and urinary metabolites. Higher SCE rate (P< 0. 01) was observed in exposed workers than in controls.

40|$|A {{biomonitoring}} {{study to}} evaluate chromosome and DNA damage respectively in somatic and germ cells {{of a group}} of male workers exposed to styrene by using biomarkers of genotoxicity was carried out. Styrene-exposed workers from three different areas of Tuscany and healthy subjects, of comparable mean age, sex and lifestyle characteristics, as a control group not exposed to chemicals, have been enrolled. In addition to previous reports [L. Migliore, A. Naccarati, A. Zanello, R. Scarpato, L. Bramanti and M. Mariani (2002) Hum. Reprod., 17, 2912 – 2918; L. Migliore, A. Naccarati, F. Coppede` et al. (2006) Pharmacogenet. Genomics, 16, 87 – 99] we present now data on a cross-sectional investigation involving a homogeneous group of subjects for which data on both somatic and germ cells have been obtained from individuals (42 exposed and 25 controls). Somatic cell genotoxicity was assessed by analysing the frequency of micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBN) in blood lymphocytes. The micronucleus assay was coupled with centromeric fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Primary DNA damage in germ cells was evaluated by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) and the percentage of the tail DNA (%TD) was used as parameter of Comet evaluation. Moreover, to investigate the frequencies of aneuploidy and diploidy in sperm, we performed multicolour FISH, using DNA probes specific for the centromeric regions of sex chromosomes and chromosome 2, in decondensed sperm nuclei of samples with normal semen parameters in a subgroup of individuals. Mandelic and <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (MAPGA) in end of shift samples were determined as biomarkers of internal dose. MAPGA excretion was consistent with an exposure to styrene above the threshold limit value-time weighted average concentration of 20 p. p. m. Styrene workers showed significantly higher frequency ofMNBN as compared to controls (13. 8 6 5. 2 versus 6. 2 6 5. 1; P < 0. 001), due to higher proportions of both micronuclei (MN) arising from chromosomal breakage (CMN) and harbouring whole chromosomes (C 1 MN). DNA damage in sperm cells was also higher among styrene-exposed, the %TD being 11. 02 6 2. 99 versus 7. 42 6 2. 30 in controls (P < 0. 001). The incidence of aneuploidy and diploidy for the tested chromosomes in sperm did not show a statistically significant difference between workers and controls. However, a positive correlation was found between genotoxic damage detected in somatic and in germ cells, even after removing the effect of age (r 5 0. 475; P < 0. 001). Although cytogenetic biomarkers detected both in somatic and germ cells were interrelated, no relationships were apparent with exposure parameters. Styrene exposure may increase the likelihood of both chromosome and DNA damage in somatic and germ cells, thus supporting the hypothesis of an interference on reproductive capacity among exposed workers.

The 8 -hour time-weighted average (TWA) exposure values ranged from 10 to 522 and 14 to 1581 mg/m 3 on Monday and from 9 to 423 and 10 to 579 on Thursday for styrene and acetone, respectively. Urine samples were collected {{at the end of}} the work shift and before the start of the work shift the next morning (Tuesday and Friday). Mandelic acid and <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> were measured in the urine using a high pressure liquid chromatography method; values were expressed in milligrams/gram creatinine. Styrene TWA exposure values significantly correlated with the sum of metabolites {{at the end of the}} workday (r = 0. 60 on Monday and r = 0. 77 on Thursday) and also the next morning (r = 0. 87 on Tuesday and r = 0. 84 on Friday). Mandelic acid was always correlated with exposure better than <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid.</b> A calculated styrene exposure level of 213 mg/m 3 (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists threshold limit value) was associated with an excretion of metabolites (mandelic acid + <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid)</b> higher on Thursday (921 mg/g creatinine) than on Monday (706 mg/g creatinine). The same observation was made on Friday (423 mg/g creatinine) as compared with Tuesday (315 mg/g creatinine). In conclusion, the threshold limit value of styrene was associated with different values of metabolites at the beginning and at the end of the workweek, and we must take this into account in establishing biological exposure indices.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{electrochemical}} reduction behavior of glyoxylic acid and <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> at silver electrode in aqueous medium and <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> in non-aqueous medium. The earlier studies of these compounds were confined only with mercury electrode. These bifunctional organic compounds exist in hydrated from in aqueous conditions and only dehydrated molecules are electro active. The above organic acids are in disassociation equilibrium with their anions and due to above mentioned conditions the reduction behavior of these compounds are complex in nature. The electrochemical reduction behavior of glyoxylic acid and <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> has been studied using rotating disc electrode voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and controlled potential electrolysis techniques. Reduction of glyoxylic acid : The limiting current was found to be non-linear with W 1 / 2 at neutral and alkaline pH. The current function values, ip/ACV 1 / 2 obtained from cyclic voltammetric study were not constant. These observations along with the current time relationship obtained from chronoamperometric study indicated that the process at the limiting current region is mixed controlled both by diffusion and kinetics of the preceding dehydration reaction even in highly alkaline medium. The overall process was found to be irreversible. Tafel slope value for the reduction of glyoxylic acid was found to be pH dependent. At neutral pH the tafel slope was 60 mV and 30 - 40 mV at alkaline pH. Reaction orders were fractional with respect to glyoxylic acid and protons. E 1 / 2 were found to shift in the cathodic direction with pH and reactant concentration glyoxylic acid was found to give tartaric acid as dimerized product-both at neutral and alkaline pH conditions. Based on the above observations the reduction mechanism at neutral medium and at alkaline medium involving Temkin type of adsorption was proposed for the reduction of glyoxylic acid. Reduction of phenylglyoxylic acid: Almost similar observations were made with <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid.</b> At the limiting current region the process was found to be diffusion controlled irreversible process in the pH range 4 - 14. The reduction product was mandelic acid. The reduction mechanism {{at the foot of the}} wave in alkaline medium was proposed. Reduction of phenylglyoxylate in DMF: The electrochemical reduction of phenylglyoxylate was studied in dimethylformamide containing 0. 2 M NaClO 4. Single wave was observed with nearly half the wave height of the wave observed for the same concentration of <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> in aqueous alkaline medium. This observation gave an indirect indication that one electron transferred radical anion is formed as an intermediate. Addition of proton donors like water and phenol resulted in an additional wave formation at less negative potential. It was also observed that the wave height of the two waves (original wave in pure DMF and additional wave in presence of proton donors) observed in the presence of water was found to increase enormously when n-butyl bromide was added to the system. As n-butyl bromide is known to react with radicals and radical anions to regenerate the reactant, both the waves observed in presence of water were due to one electron reduction and the additional wave was due to the reduction of molecular form of <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> and the original wave was due to the reduction of phenylglyoxylate anion. In conclusion the reduction of phenylglyoxylate anion in DMF id found to undergo one electron transfer with coupled fast dimerization reaction which leads to phenyl substituted tartaric acid. ...|$|E

Average recoveries for loading 100 muL of urine samples varied from 88 - 110 % and the quantification limits were less than 30 ng/mL for each analyte (3 ng/mL for trans,transmuconic acid). The qualitative information obtained (mass accuracy, resolution and full-scan spectra) with the QqTOF mass spectrometer allows a secure identification of analytes in biological matrices.

40|$|Eighty-four workers {{exposed to}} toluene (printing industry), styrene (fiberglass industries), n-hexane, and other {{solvents}} (shoe industry) were monitored {{with a total}} of 248 sequential samples. Sampling times varied between a minimum of 2 hours and maximum of 3. 5 hours. Highly significant correlations were found between exposure levels to solvents (as daily time-weighted averages) and concentrations of the respective urinary metabolites (hippuric acid, mandelic acid, <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> 2, 5 -hexanedione), confirming that these metabolities are good indices for routine monitoring of subjects occupationally exposed to the above solvents. In view of their results, the authors believe that monitoring individual exposure with personal sequential samples covering the whole workshift can be viewed as the procedure which provides the best information (exact estimate of time-weighted average and evaluation of variable exposures during the workday) for improved understanding of the relations between environmental and biological data, with consequent knowledge of the optimal biological sampling strategy...|$|E
40|$|The urinary {{excretion}} of styrene {{represents a}} promising indicator {{of exposure to}} this solvent. Nevertheless extensive research under field conditions is scant. In this investigation 214 styrene-exposed workers from 10 fiberglass-reinforced plastics factories were studied. Environmental monitoring was performed by personal passive sampling. Blood styrene and the urinary excretion of styrene and its main metabolites, mandelic acid (MA) and <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA), were measured. The correlation coefficient between the time-weighted average of environmental styrene and the mean urinary excretion of styrene was 0. 88 (0. 91 after logarithmic transformation), compared with the 0. 82 and 0. 78 of the end-of-shift MA and PGA values, respectively. A high correlation (0. 86) was also found between styrene in the blood and urine. The results, obtained under field conditions with {{a large group of}} exposed workers, confirm the usefulness of the urinary excretion of styrene as an exposure index for the biological monitoring of styrene exposure...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of urinary mandelic acid (MA) <b>phenylglyoxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA) and hippuric acid (HA) (metabolites of styrene monomer.) was conducted. For the {{determination of}} urinary MA and PGA, a known amount of myristric acid (internal standard) {{is added to the}} urine, before its extraction with mixture of ethyl acetate and ethyl ether. After evaporation of the solvents, the acids are silylated with bis (trimethylsilyl) acetamide. For {{the determination of}} urinary HA, HA in ethyl acetate extract from urine, is methylated with diazomethane. Thereafter they were injected into gas chromatograph. Rats were administrated styrene intraperitoneally, and their urins were collected as time lapses. Maximum excretion of MA and PGA reached after 24 hours from styrene injection and that of HA did after 6 hours. Total excretion of MA was caluculated to be 45. 9 % of styrene administrated that of PGA 23. 9 %, that of 18. 1 % and that of all metabolites 87. 9 %, respectively. Discussion was made between amount of styrene exposed with people and amount of their urinary metabolites...|$|E
