After a two-year hiatus during World War 1 the plate reappeared in 1918, but as a mechanically printed image depicting five School Bowlers of the Year. The image in the 1919 edition continued to reflect wartime exigencies with its five Public School Cricketers of the Year before normal service resumed in 1920 with five Batsmen of the Year. From then on, with four exceptions (see Wisden Cricketers of the Year), the norm was to include an image of five Cricketers of the Year. It was not until 1938 that other photographs were introduced.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{two different}} {{ways to improve the}} performance of single sided laser-doped solar cells. The first is replacing the aluminum rear contact with localised contacts and a high-quality passivation layer. The second is optimising the laser processing to minimise any detrimental effects. It is demonstrated that annealing in the 600 - 820 °C range significantly improves the passivation of different SiNx films on different silicon surfaces. Significant bulk lifetime enhancement is seen when SiNx-passivated CZ wafers are annealed. Using an optimal annealing condition, the implied Voc of CZ silicon substrates increased to a value comparable to that of FZ wafers - almost 720 mV. Laser-induced defects are investigated using a wide range of characterisation techniques. It is found that laser doping degrades the electrical performance of the device. This degradation is more pronounced when a dielectric layer is present during the laser process, possibly due to the thermal expansion mismatch between the silicon and the overlying dielectric layer. Methods to reduce defect density are discussed. The influence of laser parameters on the electrical performance of laser-doped solar cells is studied. It is demonstrated that a wide range of laser diode currents can be used to create a p-n junction by laser doping. Grooves formed through intermediate levels of ablation can be used to improve the adhesion between the silicon and metal without significantly degrading the cell performance. Electroless and photo-plating are compared; higher pseudo-FFs are achieved for <b>photoplated</b> laser-doped solar cells. If the <b>photoplating</b> technique is combined with well-optimised Ni sintering, the pseudo-FF is almost independent of the laser diode current. A new double sided laser-doped structure is developed. This structure is based on silicon nitride passivation of the rear surface and the formation of a selective emitter and local back-surface field by laser doping. One-sun implied Voc above 680 mV is achieved on commercial grade CZ p-type wafers when measured after laser doping and prior to metallisation. This is ~ 50 mV higher than the Voc obtained for the single-sided laser-doped cell at the same stage. This high Voc demonstrates the potential of this structure to achieve efficiencies exceeding 20 %...|$|R

Involving 24 workshops the event showcased 300 prints by 195 artists from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, UK and the USA. The resulting exhibition presented a fascinating insight into contemporary concerns, thematic and cultural {{as well as more}} pragmatic matters of media, technique and format. Master Printer Paul Croft was one of three artists invited to participate at the week of events - symposium, talks and workshops planned to coincide {{with the opening of the}} exhibition at Hong Kong City Hall. Croft also curated prints by ten artists to represent Aberystwyth School of Art and Aberystwyth Printmakers at the event. For the catalogue essay - Positivity in an Age of Doubt: A Time for Reflection ? significantly Croft reflects upon the current status and popularity of printmaking in the UK ? just at the time when there is increasing economic uncertainty and approaching austerity.

40|$|To {{reach the}} goal of grid parity, the cost of {{crystalline}} solar cells need to be reduced considerably. This {{can be done by}} using cheaper materials, such as thinner or lower quality wafers, or by reducing manufacturing costs, both process and material costs. Increasing the efficiencies of the devices while maintaining low costs via simple fabrication schemes is an ideal combination. The benefits of selective emitter have been known and quantified for many years. However, the adaptation of selective emitter solar cell designs into mass-production has been quite slow due to the relatively complex processing steps involved in applying such a design. 	This thesis begins with a review of various existing selective emitter solar cell technologies. A method of creating a selective emitter is then selected to be the main focus of the thesis due to its simple yet powerful features. This method is laser-doping through a dielectric layer. A new solar cell structure that employs the laser-doping process combined with a self-aligned metallisation method is then introduced, termed Laser-Doped Selective Emitter (LDSE) solar cell. A study is then presented to help further understanding of the laser-doping through dielectric process. Investigative work combines the use of defect Yang etch, SEM and EBIC analysis, light JV curve measurements and local ideality factor derived from dark JV curve measurements. These investigations help to identify several challenges associated with the laser-doping process. Theories on the causes of these challenges are then presented along with possible solutions. One of the most critical findings is the use of a stacked layer consisting of a thin layer of thermally grown SiO 2 and PECVD SiNx to prevent laser-induced defects. Next, several characterisation methods that include four point-probes, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), spreading sheet resistance, Electron Beam Induced Current (EBIC) analysis and photoluminescence imaging are utilised to measure the sheet resistances, doping profiles and lifetime of the laser-doped region. These measurement techniques are used to optimise the laser parameters and other processing parameters involved in the fabrication of LDSE solar cells. In the final chapter, a novel self-aligned metallisation method that utilises the solar cell&# 146;s ability to produce voltage and current is investigated. It is found that this <b>photoplating</b> method is well-suited for fabrication of LDSE cells and potentially suitable in mass-production. Finally, the integration of the optimised process flow and parameters combined with the <b>photoplating</b> method is demonstrated through the fabrication and characterisation of a batch of LDSE solar cells made of commercial 125 mm 1 &# 937;. cm p-type wafers. Efficiencies of up to 19 % with VOC in excess of 635 mV and JSC close to 38 mA/cm 2 are reported on 125 mm commercial grade CZ p-type wafers.

40|$|With an {{automatic}} photoplate-evaluation system in Spark-Source Mass Spectrometry, complete <b>photoplate</b> information {{is used for}} the concentration-procedure, that means, all isotopes of single and multiple-chargedions contribute to the analytical result. Experiments show that the ion-intensities of elements in their ionization states lie on parabolas. The parabola-position of impurity-elements within a matrix is mainly influenced by that matrix and shows a characteristic relation to the analytical result. Systematic investigations lead to a significant parameter, the so-called "mean charge number" Zi, which forms a common link between the very different parabola-positions of all elements within a matrix. This knowledge is the basis for a new evaluation procedure which, without using a calibration standard,leads to an essential improvement of the analytical result. Experiments in practical analysis work show that this method, used on many different matrices, show a maximum deviation from the certificate value by a factor of 2 (in many cases < 1. 5). Analyzing the main components in alloys yields accuracies between 10 and 20 %. For the standard-deviation of analysis results an upper limit of 10 % was reached. The knowledge of the common Zi makes it possible, that also elements {{with a small amount of}} detected states of charge may be integrated within the normal determination of concentration.

Since participating in two international portfolio projects in 2008 that encouraged cross-disciplinary working, I have become increasingly interested incorporating digital methods of working with traditional techniques of stone and plate lithography. In 2011, working with the computer software programmes Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter 12, I was able to demonstrate how it is possible to develop digitally engineered tusche wash and how this can be applied on screen in a relatively authentic and lithographic manner. Since Melbourne there has been opportunity to develop this process of digitising tusche further and to explore how lithographic prints can be made using both a combination of digital and conventional techniques as well as producing work that is conceived in wholly digital terms.

There is also some information about gravestones, funeral expenses, medical services, immigration and naturalization, marriages, conversions, social welfare, divorces, and other legal issues. Many of the earlier death records contain information about the members and their wives, which is reflected in folder dates that end several years after the date of the primary member’s death. The materials in this collection date from 1913 - 2004 with the bulk dating from 1932 - 2001. The dates of the subseries for Series I and Series II refer to the dates of death and resignation or expulsion, rather than the dates of the materials in the folders. For example, Series I, subseries 1 is Deaths 1918 - 1969, but the materials date from 1913 - 1988. Victor Besso’s records only go until 1995 although he did not die until 2006, whiwhy the death dates go through 2006 although the dates of the materials only go through 2004. The majority of the collection is in English, although various official documents are in Spanish, Ladino, French, Greek, Italian, and Hebrew. The collection consists of 81 Paige boxes comprising 81 linear feet. The Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of America began as the Salonican Brotherhood of America, Inc. which was founded in Manhattan in 1915 as a society to help Sephardic immigrants from Salonica become accustomed to life in the United States, as well as to have a place of Sephardic worship and community. It was incorporated on April 3, 1916. Over the years, the Salonican Brotherhood merged with various other Sephardic groups, including the American Sephardic Alliance, Affika Yehuda, Chain of Life Association of Constantinople, Brotherhood of Rhodes, Centro Judio Sephardi, Inc., Brotherhood of Adrianople, and the United Sephardim of New York. A New Jersey branch was established in New Brunswick in 1917, partially in response to members' employment in New Jersey's war industries during World War I. A mass immigration from Salonica in the years 1919 - 1921 helped to swell the organization's membership. By 1921, the Salonican Brotherhood’s leadership recognized that its focus and membership had moved beyond its roots as a society concerned with the interests of immigrants solely from Salonica. Subsequently, the society changed its name to the Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of America, Inc. on December 10, 1921. The Brotherhood’s original stated purpose was “to promote the industrial, social, educational and religious welfare of its members and to engage in philanthropic endeavors for the welfare of Sephardic immigrants. ” Two branches, one in Harlem and one on the Lower East Side, were established in 1922, as was a Secret Relief Fund to assist needy families, and funds were raised to help the Jewish community of Salonica. By 1933, there were four branches, Downtown and Brooklyn, Long Island and Manhattan, New Brunswick, New Jersey, and the Bronx and Washington Heights. A scholarship committee was set up in 1934 which continues to give out monetary awards. By 1933, members were steadily leaving Harlem and so, in 1935, the Brotherhood moved its offices to ord erremain closer to its members. Between 1938 and 1940, the Bronx Social Club and the Bronx Ladies Auxiliary were established. In 1939, the Secret Relief Fund was renamed the Henry J. Perahia Funds for the Needy in honor of the man who had provided so much of the money to help out needy members during the Depression. In 1941, the Brotherhood needed more space and so it moved into new headquarters at 1380 Jerome Avenue, Bronx. This move allowed the Synagogue, the Junior League, which was established in 1935, the Bronx Social Club, and the Brotherhood to have separate accommodations under the same roof. The same year, the Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood was a founding member, along with several other Sephardic organizations, of the Central Jewish Community of America, Inc., an institution intended to serve as a link with the world Jewish community and to promote Sephardic unity. After World War II, the Brotherhood organized a Jewish War Veterans Post, the Brotherhood Memorial Post Number 454. On August 26, 1946, the American Sephardic Alliance, Inc., itself the result of several mergers between Sephardic organizations, merged with the Brotherhood, further unifying the American Sephardic community. The following year, on April 3, 1947, the Brotherhood merged with the Centro Judio Sephardi, Inc (the Sephardic Jewish Center, Inc.) to form the Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of America, Inc. More members began retiring to the greater Miami area in the years after World War II and some of these members helped to establish a benevolent society known as the Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of Greater Miami. The leaders of the Sephardic Jewish Brotherhood of Greater Miami requested {{to become part of the}} Brotherhood and, on April 20, 1950, the Florida branch was established, with its own cemetery plot. In 1949 - 1950, fundraising efforts began for a nursing home for Sephardim, the Sephardic Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, also known as the Sephardic Home for the Aged, wh o 1957. Although the Brotherhood is affiliated with the Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, the Center has always been an autonomous organization. After a fire destroyed the headquarters at Jerome Avenue in late 1952, the Brotherhood temporarily moved into the Sephardic Jewish Center of the Bronx, Inc. Later the Brotherhood moved into property bought from the Sephardic Jewish Center at East 169 th Street, Bronx, where ground was broken for a new community center in 1955. In 1956, the Brotherhood's official publication, The Sephardic Brother, was launched to help keep members informed of the Brotherhood's activities. The Brotherhood moved to Rego Park, Queens in 1977 - 1978 and later moved to Forest Hills, Queens.
