40|$|Abstract. Even though {{energy-efficient}} {{and sustainable}} solutions, such as {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs), have become popular in general lighting, mainly incandescent lamps are used as measurement standards in photometry. Optical properties of the LED lamps together with the often unstable built-in power converters bring challenges to NMIs and testing laboratories. Due to the narrow and complicated spectra of the LED lamps, the uncertainties of traditional photometers calibrated by incandescent lamps tend to increase when LED lamps are measured. Switching from an incandescent lamp to an LED-based calibration source would decrease the uncertainty related to the spectral mismatch correction. LED-based <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> would also have other benefits, such as long lifetime and good temporal stability. Moreover, as spectra of white LED lamps are limited to the visible wavelength range, a novel method for illuminance measurements based on the Predictable Quantum Efficient Detector (PQED) {{can be used to}} characterize these <b>standard</b> <b>lamps</b> with luminous flux uncertainties significantly below 1 % (k = 2) at NMIs. The method eliminates the need of photometric filters in realization of the illuminance unit. Instead, the photometric weighting is carried out numerically using a separately measured relative spectrum of the source. Well characterized LED-based calibration lamps, together with improved electrical power measurement, would reduce measurement uncertainties of illuminance, luminous intensity, luminous flux and luminous efficacy measurements of LE...|$|R

The overall long-term change was declining. In addition, abrupt changes of as large as 25 % were detected. The short-term changes were found to fluctuate on time frames shorter than the interval between the measurements of the primary <b>standard</b> <b>lamps.</b> This underlines the importance of the use of more frequently measured working <b>standard</b> <b>lamps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Stars {{appearing}} in CCD images obtained over 224 nights {{during the course}} of 69 observing runs have been calibrated to the Johnson/Kron-Cousins BVRI photometric system defined by the equatorial standards of Landolt (1992, AJ, 104, 340). More than 15, 000 stars suitable for use as <b>photometric</b> <b>standards</b> have been identified, where "suitable" means that the star has been observed five or more times during photometric conditions and has a standard error of the mean magnitude less than 0. 02 mag in {{at least two of the}} four bandpasses, and shows no significant evidence of intrinsic variability. Many of these stars are in the same fields as Landolt's equatorial standards or Graham's (1982, PASP, 94, 244) southern E-region standards, but are considerably fainter. This enhances the value of those fields for the calibration of photometry obtained with large telescopes. Other standards have been defined in fields containing popular objects of astrophysical interest, such as star clusters and famous galaxies, extending Landolt-system calibrators to declinations far from the equator and to stars of sub-Solar chemical abundances. I intend to continue to improve and enlarge this set of <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> stars as more observing runs are reduced.

40|$|Evidence is {{building}} that remnants of solar systems might orbit {{a large percentage}} of white dwarfs, as the polluted atmospheres of DAZ and DBZ white dwarfs indicate the very recent accretion of metal-rich material. (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Some of these polluted white dwarfs are found to have large mid-infrared excesses from close-in debris disks that are thought to be reservoirs for the metal accretion. These systems are coined DAZd white dwarfs (von Hippel et al. 2007). Here we investigate the claims of Bonnet-Bidaud & Pantin (2008) that Sirius B, the nearest white dwarf to the Sun, might have an infrared excess from a dusty debris disk. Sirius B's companion, Sirius A is commonly observed as a mid-infrared <b>photometric</b> <b>standard</b> in the Southern hemisphere.

Our photometry is consistent with the expected photospheric emission such that we constrain any mid-infrared excess to < 10 % of the photosphere. Thus we conclude that Sirius B does not have a large dusty disk, as seen in DAZd white dwarfs. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R
