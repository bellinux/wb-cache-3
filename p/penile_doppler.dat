40|$|Penile Mondor's {{disease is}} a {{thrombophlebitis}} of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis. It is a rare clinical diagnosis and generally resolves spontaneously. A simple physical examination is sufficient for diagnosis but color Doppler ultrasonography is often carried out as a further investigation.

Moreover, functional changes in penile blood flow, as seen in erectile dysfunction (ED), can be analyzed using color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS). This review article describes the normal sonographic anatomy of the penis, the sonographic technique for evaluating ED, the normal phases of erection, and the various causes of ED. Additionally, we describe the interpretation of different parameters and findings on penile CDUS for the diagnosis and classification of ED, priapism, and Peyronie disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{assess the}} chronologic {{relationship}} between the cessation of smoking and the restoration of erectile function. Smoking is {{associated with an increased}} risk of erectile dysfunction. METHODS Twenty active smokers (20 to 40 cigarettes/day) affected by erectile dysfunction (International Index of Erectile Function 5 -item score less than 21) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 40 years. All the patients underwent penile color Doppler ultrasonography during the basic and dynamic phases (10 mu g prostaglandin E- 1). A second Doppler evaluation was performed 24 to 36 hours after cessation of smoking. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were recorded. The PSV and EDV cutoff value was 30 cm/s and 5 cm/s, respectively. RESULTS Of the 20 patients, 10 (50 %) had normal PSV values but only 5 (25 %) had normal EDV values at the baseline Doppler evaluation. All the patients (100 %) had normal PSV values at the second <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> evaluation after smoking withdrawal, and 17 (85 %) also had normal EDV values. The average PSV was 40. 1 and 50. 3 cm/s (P = 0. 09) and the mean EDV was 6. 8 and 2. 4 cm/s (P < 0. 01) at the baseline <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> examination and after smoking withdrawal, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Within 24 to 36 hours of the cessation of cigarette smoking, the color Doppler parameters demonstrated a significant improvement in EDV and a trend toward an increase in PSV. Additional clinical evaluation is required to further characterize the expeditious improvement in erectile function after the cessation of smoking...|$|E

40|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) is {{inability to}} achieve and maintain an erection to permit satisfactory sexual activity. Homocysteine (Hcys) is a sulfur-containing amino acid synthesized from the essential amino acid methionine. Experimental models have elucidated the role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcys) as a strong and independent predictor for atherosclerosis progression and impaired cavernosal perfusion. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the serum levels of Hcys in our cohort of patients with ED, to compare these values with these of control population and to examine Hcys as a predictive marker for those patients who are beginning to complain mild-moderate ED. A total of 431 patients were enrolled in the study. The whole cohort was asked to complete the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. The study population was divided in 3 main groups: Group A: 145 patients with no ED serving as a control group; Group B: 145 patients with mild or mild-moderate ED; Group C: 141 patients with moderate or severe ED. Each participant underwent blood analysis. All patients underwent baseline and dynamic <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasonography. We found in our cohort mean Hcys plasma concentrations significantly higher than the cut-off point in both groups B and C (18. 6  ±  4. 7 and 28. 38  ±  7. 8, respectively). Mean IIEF score was 27. 9  ±  1. 39, 19. 5  ±  2. 6, and 11. 1  ±  2. 5 for groups A, B, and C, respectively (P <  0. 0001). In the <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasonography studies, a high significant inverse correlation was detected between the mean values of the 10 th minute's peak-systolic velocity (PSV) and Hcys levels for the groups B and C. This establishes a dose-dependent association between Hcys and ED. Furthermore, we showed that Hcys was an earlier predictor of ED than Doppler studies, as the Hcys increase was present in patients with mild ED even before abnormal Doppler values...|$|E
40|$|Priaprism is a {{persistent}} painful erection that continuous beyond or is unrelated to sexual stimulation. Majority of cases are idiopathic (46 %), {{alcohol and drug}} related (21 %), perineal trauma (12 %), sickle cell anemia and hypercoagualable state related (11 %). We report case of priapism caused by hyperhomocysteinemia with favorable outcome with only few cases so far {{reported in the literature}} {{to the best of our}} knowledge. A 31 year-old male referred to our institution with non resolving priaprism for the last 6 days. Immediate distal shunt (Al-ghorab) was created but it could not achieve the detumescence. The <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> showed no flow into the corpora, so a proximal shunt (Quackels) was made which achieved satisfactory detumescence. On thorough evaluation for the cause of priaprism, only homocysteine level was found to be significantly raised (40. 46 µmol/L), being the unusual and rare cause for priaprism. The patient was discharged on homocheck. In the follow-up the patient is on vacuum assisted device for the erectile dysfunction and has been advised for the penile implant. Priaprism being a urological emergency should be thoroughly evaluated even for the rare causes and should be timely intervened to avoid the unavoidable consequences of permanent erectile dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Intracorporeal {{injections}} (ICIs) of vasoactive substances during <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound (PDU) are {{a common}} investigation for erectile dysfunction (ED) diagnosis. ICI can be responsible of priapism, a pathological condition of prolonged penile erection not related to sexual stimulation. The aim of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of physical exercise and medical treatment as noninvasive therapy to restore detumescence in prolonged erections after ICI. Materials and Methods: Data were prospectively collected on men undergoing PDU in three urological centers. Three hundred and sixty-nine patients underwent PDU for the investigation of ED. All the participants received an ICI of quadrimix; prostaglandine E 1, papaverine, phentolamine, and atropine. The data of the patients have been analyzed to record their comorbidities, results of PDU, and the complications encountered. Results: Fifty-three patients (14. 4 %) developed prolonged erections. Physical exercise alone was successful in reversing prolonged erection within 30 min in 21 (39. 6 %) patients. Out of the remaining 32 patients, oral salbutamol induced detumescence in 18 (34 %) within the observation period of 60 min. Nonresponders were managed successfully with aspiration and irrigation of corpora with saline (11 patients, 20. 75 %) or with Phenylephrine (three patients, 5. 66 %). Conclusions: Physical exercise and oral salbutamol are safe and effective in restoring detumescence of pharmacologically-induced priapism.

40|$|Andrologists, cardiologists and diabetologists (and general practitioners) {{have the}} great {{opportunity}} to collaborate and find shared clinical workup {{for the benefit of}} a large number of men. Several evidence established a link between erectile dysfunction (ED), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Not only these conditions share many risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms but also an emerging paradigm indicates that ED is, in fact, an independent marker of cardiovascular disease risk, CV events and CV mortality. However, there is no consensus on the best cardiologic investigation in men with ED with no known CVD and, on the contrary, on what is the clinical and prognostic role of detecting ED during cardiovascular investigation and CVD risk assessment. Only vasculogenic ED, which represents the most common type of organic ED, indeed represents a harbinger of CVD, especially for younger patients, and might be diagnosed by dynamic <b>penile</b> color <b>doppler</b> ultrasonography, which represents a real cardiovascular imaging technique that give evidence on the presence of systemic endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, assessment of glucose and lipid metabolism is warranted as first step workup in all ED patients, and diabetologists should ask their patients for erectile function, address ED patients to andrologists, and consider vasculogenic ED in the context of the cardiovascular and metabolic workup and in the context of diabetic complications. Sexual symptoms (and testosterone levels) should sound as harbinger for cardiovascular and metabolic investigation and cardiologists and diabetologists have the opportunity to have a symptom (erectile dysfunction) and a vascular test (<b>penile</b> color <b>doppler)</b> that help them in better management of patients, their comorbidities and complications...|$|R

Additionally, we compared the frequency of complications between the two groups. Materials and methods: In the last 13 years, 202 men diagnosed with organic erectile dysfunction (ED) had previously undergone penile prosthesis implantation. Patient data were evaluated retrospectively. Of the 202 patients, 175 were included to the study. The mean age of patients was 57. 5 (34 - 83) years. Preoperatively, a physical examination, medical and sexual history, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, Combined Injection and Stimulation (CIS) test and, if necessary, Nocturnal Penile Tumescence (NPT) / <b>Penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasonography (US) were performed in all cases. Results: All patients were diagnosed with organic ED. We determined that 43 (21 %) patients had diabetes mellitus, 53 (26 %) had a history of radical pelvic surgery, 38 (19 %) had cardiovascular pathology and 19 (9 %) had other reasons for ED. Approximately 98 % of patients and their partners were satisfied with the surgical results of the penile prosthesis operation.

40|$|Purpose: Ischemic priapism, a {{compartment}} syndrome, requires urgent {{treatment in}} order to nourish the corpora cavernosa. As the first step, aspiration of blood and irriga-tion of the cavernosal bodies is performed to prevent fibrotic activity and secure erectile capability. During aspiration, there are risks of cardiovascular side effects of adrenergic agonists. We aimed to evaluate a transient distal penile corporoglanular shunt techni-que in place of aspiration and irrigation techniques for treatment of early ischemic priapism. Materials and Methods: A transient distal penile shunt was applied to 15 patients with early ischemic priapism between January 2011 and May 2012. Priapism duration, his-tory, causes, pain, and any prior management of priapism were assessed in all patients. A complete blood count and <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasonography were performed, which showed attenuated blood flow in the cavernosal artery. A sterile closed system blood collection set, which has two needles and tubing, {{was used for the}} transient distal penile shunt. Results: Ten of 15 patients with early ischemic priapism were successfully treated with this transient shunt technique. No additional procedures were needed after the reso-lution of rigidity in the 10 successfully treated patients. Conclusions: The transient nature of this technique is an advantage over aspiration and irrigation in the treatment of early ischemic priapism. Our results indicate that the technique can be offered for patients with an ischemic priapism episode of no more than 7 hours...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES:The {{purpose of}} our study {{was to assess the}} {{prevalence}} and extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis in asymptomatic patients with vascular erectile dysfunction (ED). BACKGROUND:An association between ED and ischemic heart disease has been suggested, but it is unknown if it represents a marker of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. METHODS:We studied 70 consecutive patients with vascular ED, evaluated by <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler,</b> and 73 control subjects with no history of coronary artery disease. We measured traditional coronary risk factors, circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), endothelial function by ultrasound of brachial artery, and coronary artery calcification by multi-slice computed tomography. RESULTS:The patients and the control group were similar for age, race, and coronary risk score. Patients with ED had significantly higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (2. 62 vs. 1. 03 mg/l, p < 0. 001). Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery was more impaired in patients with ED than in controls (2. 36 vs. 3. 92, p < 0. 001). Coronary artery calcification was more frequent in individuals with ED than in control subjects (p = 0. 01). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that patients with ED had an overall odds ratio of 3. 68 for having calcium score above the 75 th percentile, compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS:Coronary atherosclerosis is more severe in patients with vascular ED; ED predicts the presence and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Thus, ED may be considered an additional, early warning sign of coronary atherosclerosis...|$|E

Peripheral conduction velocities and pudendal-evoked responses (PER) were also performed if neurological history or examination and/or BCR were abnormal. Only 30 patients (15 %) had an abnormal BCR. In 17 patients, a neurological associated disorder was found. Four patients had normal erections during plethysmography, despite their complaints. Nine patients with an isolated prolonged BCR also presented a vascular abnormality that could explain impotence. Abnormal PER was observed only in 6 patients, 4 of them with a prolonged BCR as well. These results suggest that PER is not an interesting neurophysiological routine test for the diagnosis of neurogenic impotence and that the relationships between an abnormal BCR and neurogenic impotence is doubtful.

40|$|Introduction: Peyronie's Disease (PD) is {{a disease}} causing psycho social trauma to the patient. Multiple {{treatment}} options are available with variable results. Extra Corporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) is a new insight into the non invasive modality of management. It focuses on the mechanism of inducing angiogenesis in the penile cavernous tissue. Materials and Methods: The aim {{of the study is}} to determine the role of ESWT in the management of PD. The objectives include demonstrating the improvement in mean International Index of Erectile Function Score (IIEFS), improvement in pain score by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), change in cavernosal artery flow on colour <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler,</b> reduction in plaque size, and improvement in penile curvature degree after the therapy. 30 patients, between 25 - 65 years, who were non responders to conservative line of management, were treated with ESWT. The results were evaluated at baseline and 18 - 24 weeks after the therapy. Results: ESWT significantly improves the cavernosal artery velocity, thereby supporting the theory of angiogenesis. ESWT improves all the domains of IIEF including Erectile Function, Sexual Desire, Sexual Satisfaction, Orgasm and Overall Satisfaction. There is a significant improvement in the pain and penile curvature, and reduction in the plaque size. No adverse effects have been recorded. Conclusion: ESWT offers a safe, minimally invasive, OPD based option to the management of the patients of PD in the stable phase of the disease.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to evaluate in a selection of patients with erectile dysfunction {{the influence of alcohol}} consumption and the response to alcohol abstinence with and without sildenafil association. Materials and Methods. In a population of 150 consecutive patients with erectile dysfunction we studied 50 patients aged between 22 and 77 years (mean 56 ± 14 SD). These 50 patients were divided into three different treatment groups and were screened for three different levels of alcohol risk with two questionnaires. All patients were evaluated with an International Index Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF) questionnaire before and after one month of treatment. RESULTS. The 50 patients included 14 patients with high alcohol risk, 34 patients with low alcohol risk and only 2 patients with no alcohol risk. After one month, 29 patients responded to the therapy, and 21 did not respond. The IIEF questionnaire presented a statistically significant difference between the different risk groups before and after treatment (p≤ 0. 05). All the patients were examined with a <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> Ultrasound. Only 10 of them had an abnormal diastolic peak velocity (PDV) and only 1 presented both pathologic systolic peak velocity (PSV) and PDV. These 11 patients did not respond to therapies and 10 of them were at high alcohol risk. The alcohol consumption risk was directly correlated with PDV (p= 0. 00001; R 2 = 0. 4). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study demonstrated a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and erectile dysfunction.

All but one had undetectable or low testosterone. Subjective erectile function, according to IIEF- 15 scores, and penile CDU findings did not correlate with testosterone levels, whereas NPT test findings correlated well with testosterone levels. These findings would suggest that nocturnal erections are androgen-dependent whereas sexually induced erections are androgen-independent.

40|$|Purpose: Although <b>penile</b> duplex <b>Doppler</b> {{ultrasonography}} (PDDU) is {{a common}} and integral procedure in a Peyronie’s disease workup, the intracavernosal injection of vas-oactive agents can carry a serious risk of priapism. Risk factors include young age, good baseline erectile function, and no coronary artery disease. In addition, patients with Peyronie’s disease undergoing PDDU in an outpatient setting {{are at increased risk}} giv-en the inability to predict optimal dosing. The present study was conducted to provide support for a standard protocol of early administration of phenylephrine in patients with a sustained erection after diagnostic intracavernosal injection of vasoactive agents to prevent the deleterious effects of iatrogenic priapism. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective review of Peyronie’s disease patients who received phenylephrine reversal after intracavernosal alprostadil (prostaglandin E 1) administration to look at the priapism rate.

40|$|Objectives: Penile {{fracture}} with concomitant complete urethral disruption is {{an uncommon}} urologic disorder. Data {{about the treatment}} and outcome measurements of this condition are scarce in the literature. The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the long term urinary and sexual functions of patients with penile fracture associated with complete urethral injury after immediate surgical reconstruction. Patients and methods: Twelve patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in this retrospective case series study; however, one was lost during follow-up. Patient's medical records were reviewed and all patients were interviewed for clinical evaluation. Urinary function was assessed by history, uroflometry and retrograde urethrography, while, sexual function was assessed by questionnaire (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) and <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> for patients with erectile dysfunction. Results: Patients’ mean age was 32. 3 ± 7. 5 years (range 21 - 43) and the mean follow-up period was 72. 6 ± 45. 4 months (range 14 - 187). Vigorous sexual intercourse was the main cause in 91 % of our patients. No serious long term complications was found. Only 1 patient (9 %) suffered from anterior urethral stricture, 1 patient (9 %) complained of weak erection, 3 patients (27 %) had a palpable fibrosis and 2 patients (18 %) reported a slight penile curvature during erection. Ninety one percent of all our patients maintained their normal urinary and sexual functions. Conclusion: On the long term follow-up, most of the patients maintained their normal erectile and voiding functions with no harmful long-term complications. We advocate immediate surgical intervention and reconstruction of both corpora cavernous and urethra as a first line treatment for those patients...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{present the}} {{underlying}} etiological factors in patients referring with priapism, sharing {{how they are}} managed according to etiology and priapism type together with our experiences, creating awareness so that urologists and emergency physicians may play {{a more active role}} together in priapism management. Materials and methods: Patients referring to emergency service with priapism were examined. <b>Penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasonography (PDU) and/or corporeal aspiration and blood gas analysis were made in order to determine priapism type after anamnesis and physical examination. The most appropriate treatment option was chosen and applied on the patients considering priapism type, underlying etiological factors and priapism time. Presence of a statistical difference between etiological factors causing priapism, priapism type and applied treatment methods was calculated using Chi square (χ 2) test. Results: A total of 51 patients referring to emergency service with priapism attacks for 53 times were included in the evaluation. When compared to other etiological factors, number of priapism cases developing secondary to papaverine after PDU was found statistically significantly high (p < 0. 001). Ischemic priapism ratio was detected statistically higher compared to other groups (p < 0. 001). Aspiration and/or irrigation treatment were the most common method used for treatment at a statistically significant level (p < 0. 001). All patients (100 %) were hospitalized in urology service without applying any treatment in emergency service and had treatment and intervention {{under the control of the}} urologist. Conclusions: Application of non-invasive treatments in suitable priapism patients would protect patients from invasive painful interventions. We believe that emergency physicians should be more effective in priapism phase management and at least noninvasive treatment phase...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} and present satisfaction rates {{of our patients}} and their partners after 3 part inflatable penile prosthesis implantation. Materials and methods: We searched our hospital electronic data for patients who underwent inflatable penile prosthesis implantation between January 2008 and July 2013. Computer and archived file data were used to get information and reach the patients. We made telephone calls to patients and asked questionnaires about self and partner satisfaction rates. Results: 36 patients underwent prosthesis implantation during the 5 year period. We were able to reach by telephone call 18 of them. The mean age of 18 patients was 55. 7 ± 9. 4 years and mean body mass index was 24. 6 ± 2. 1 kg/m 2. The etiology was diabetes mellitus on 14 (77. 8 %) and radical pelvic surgery on 4 (22. 2 %) patients. 14 of 18 patients had <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound test. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated venous insufficiency in 8 and arterial insufficiency in 6 patients. Mean time from implantation to study was 20. 8 ± 13. 9 months. Out of 18 patients 2 had prosthesis removal operation because of infection in one patient and perforation in the other. Satisfaction rate was 88. 9 %, and recommendation rate was 94. 4 %. Causes of dissatisfaction were pain in one patient and insufficient rigidity plus shortening of the penis in the other one. Partner satisfaction rate was 94. 4 %. Conclusion: Penile Prosthesis Implantation (PPI) is the gold standard treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) irresponsive to medical treatment.

These vessels are either anastomoses connecting the cavernosal arteries with the urethral arterial network or afferent vessels to the corpus spongiosum. Sixty-one consecutive patients underwent <b>penile</b> color <b>Doppler</b> US. Waveform changes in CSC were evaluated in comparison with changes in the cavernosal artery. Eighteen of 61 patients had normal erection, 17 of 61 had arterial insufficiency, and 26 of 61 had veno-occlusive dysfunction. Resistance index (RI) in CSC was significantly lower than in cavernosal arteries in all patients and increased during phases 1 - 2 (positive diastolic flow). Peak systolic velocity (PSV) in CSC was significantly higher in the patients with veno-occlusive dysfunction. During cavernosal phase 4 (diastolic flow reversal) CSC of patients with normal erection or with arterial insufficiency disappeared, underwent markedly reduced diastolic flow, or had systolic flow inversion. Conversely, low resistance flow was appreciable in CSC of patients with veno-occlusive dysfunction who reached phase 4. During phase 5 (systolic peak reduction) all CSC disappeared. Color Doppler US allows evaluation of CSC both in patients with normal and impaired erection...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} prevalence and <b>Doppler</b> characteristics of <b>penile</b> cavernosal-spongiosal communications (CSC) in patients with severe Peyronie's disease. These vessels are either anastomoses connecting the cavernosal arteries with the urethral arterial network or afferent vessels to the corpus spongiosum. Twenty patients with severe Peyronie's disease underwent <b>penile</b> color <b>Doppler</b> US after intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E(1). Study inclusion criteria were penile curvature or shortening which made intercourse difficult or impossible. The quality of erectile response was subjectively scored. The spectral characteristics of CSC were evaluated in comparison with waveform changes in cavernosal artery. There were 4 patients with normal erectile response, 10 with discrepancy in rigidity of the penile base and tip, 4 with veno-occlusive dysfunction and 2 with arteriogenic dysfunction. The CSC just proximal to the plaques had peak systolic velocity (PSV) significantly higher and resistance index (RI) significantly lower than the other CSC. The PSV in CSC near the plaques of patients with base-tip discrepancy and with veno-occlusive dysfunction were significantly higher than in the other patients. In patients with severe Peyronie's disease CSC near the plaques remain patent with low-resistance flow supporting the hypothesis that blood leakage can occur through these vessels...|$|R
40|$|Study Type - Therapy (cohort) Level of Evidence 4 What 2 ̆ 7 s {{known on}} the subject? and What does the study add? <b>Penile</b> colour <b>Doppler</b> {{ultrasonography}} (CDU) {{can be an}} invaluable investigative tool to characterize penile abnormalities to complement clinical history and physical examination {{in the evaluation of}} men with Peyronie 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) and/or erectile dysfunction (ED). Although CDU findings between men with PD and those with ED were not markedly different, subtle differences were observed. The classic penile CDU findings in men with PD comprise tunical thickening, intracavernosal fibrosis, septal fibrosis and intracavernosal calcification, while, in men with ED, low peak systolic velocity and high end-diastolic velocity are found on penile haemodynamics. Previously published studies have focused predominantly on either ED or PD exclusively, or examine the risk of progression to ED in the PD population. To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive analysis of penile CDU and clinical findings in men with PD and/or ED. The large sample size and multivariable analysis allow meaningful interpretation of the results. This study has found some substantial differences in the penile CDU findings of men with PD and/or ED that have not previously been reported. Although the risk factors of ED may be greater than those for PD, there is crossover in age, cardiovascular risk factors, trauma and penile CDU findings in men with PD and/or ED. OBJECTIVE To explore the differences in <b>penile</b> colour <b>Doppler</b> ultrasonography (CDU) findings between men with Peyronie 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) and those with erectile dysfunction (ED). MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients presenting with PD and/or ED who underwent penile CDU were recruited to the study. Patient demographics, comorbidities, International Index of Erectile Function- 5 scores, previous therapies and physical findings were documented. Penile curvature, presence of tunical thickening, septal fibrosis, intracavernosal fibrosis and calcification, and cavernosal vascular status were recorded. RESULTS A total of 1500 men underwent penile CDU during the 10 -year period. Of these men, 891 men presented with PD and 609 men had ED only. Men with ED had higher rates of diabetes and coronary artery disease (P < 0. 05). Isolated tunical thickening was more common in older men and in the PD cohort. The presence of intracavernosal fibrosis correlated strongly with difficulty maintaining erection (P < 0. 05). Impaired cavernosal arterial flow was observed in men with decrease penile rigidity and penile pain, while higher end-diastolic velocities were found in men with difficulty maintaining erection and tunical thickening on penile CDU. CONCLUSIONS Men with PD and ED had many similarities and differences on penile CDU. Penile CDU continues to be an invaluable clinical tool in the management of men with male sexual dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{association}} of low testosterone level and erectile dysfunction (ED) with metabolic syndrome (MS) is receiving increasing attention. The present study determined the psychobiologic characteristics of sexual dysfunction (SD) associated with MS (as {{defined by the}} National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) {{in a series of}} 803 consecutive male outpatients. Methods: Several hormonal, biochemical, and instrumental (<b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound [PDU]) parameters were studied, along with general psychopathology scores (Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire modified [MHQ]). The Structured Interview on Erectile Dysfunction (SIEDY) was also applied. Results: Among the 236 patients (29. 4 %) diagnosed as having a MS, 96. 5 % reported ED, 39. 6 % hypoactive sexual desire (HSD), 22. 7 % premature ejaculation, and 4. 8 % delayed ejaculation. Patients with MS were characterised by greater subjective (as assessed by SIEDY) and objective (as assessed by PDU) ED and by greater somatised anxiety {{than the rest of the}} sample. The prevalence of overt hypogonadism (total testosterone < 8 nM) was significantly higher in patients with MS. Among MS components, waist circumference and hyperglycaemia were the best predictors of hypogonadism. Hypogonadal patients with MS showed higher gonadotropin and lower free testosterone levels, suggesting a primary hypogonadism. Among patients with MS, hypogonadism was present in 11. 9 % and 3. 8 % in the rest of the sample (p < 0. 0001) and was associated with typical hypogonadism-related symptoms, such as hypoactive sexual desire, low frequency of sexual intercourse, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Our data suggest that MS is associated with a more severe ED and induces somatisation. Furthermore, MS is associated with a higher prevalence of hypogonadism in patients with SD. The presence of hypogonadism can further exacerbate the MS-associated sexual dysfunction, adding the typical hypogonadism-related symptoms (including HSD, 66. 7 %). Recognising MS associated with hypogonadism is important for both sexual and general health and its serious potential associated risks. © 2006 European Association of Urology.

40|$|Introduction: Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetS) is a clustering {{of cardiovascular}} and metabolic risk factors, {{often associated with}} erectile dysfunction (ED) and hypogonadism. Recently, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) proposed a substantial revision of the National Cholesterol Education Program-Third Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATPIII) MetS criteria, essentially lowering the diagnostic cutoff values. Aim: To investigate the associations between these two recently proposed definitions of MetS with the relative risk of arteriogenic ED and hypogonadism in a large cohort of patients with male sexual dysfunction. Methods: A consecutive series of 1086 patients with sexual dysfunction (mean age 51. 9 ± 12. 8 years) was studied. Main Outcome Measures: Several hormonal, biochemical, and instrumental (<b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound) parameters were studied, along with ANDROTEST, a 12 -item validated structured interview, specifically designed for the screening hypogonadism in a sexual dysfunction population. In particular, a score > 8 is predictive of low testosterone (< 10. 4 nmol/L) with a sensitivity and specificity of about 70 %. Results: The prevalence of MetS was 32. 0 % and 44. 7 % according to NCEP-ATPIII and IDF criteria, respectively. After adjustment for confounding factors, only NCEP-ATPIII {{was significantly associated with}} dynamic prostaglandin E 1 -stimulated penile flow (Vpmax, B = - 7. 7 ± 3. 8; P < 0. 05). Patients with MetS defined according to both criteria reported lower total and free testosterone levels, higher prevalence of hypogonadism, and higher ANDROTEST score. However, when IDF, but not NCEP-ATPIII, criteria were fulfilled, the prevalence of hypogonadism was significantly lower than that observed in patients fulfilling both criteria (15. 6 % vs. 34. 8 %, respectively; P < 0. 00001). Conversely, patients fulfilling NCEP-ATPIII, but not IDF, criteria did not show a significant different prevalence of hypogonadism than those positive for both sets of criteria (30. 8 % vs. 34. 8 %; P = NS). Conclusions: In patients with ED, NCEP-ATPIII criteria seem to be a better predictor of hypogonadism and impaired penile blood flow than IDF ones. © 2007 International Society for Sexual Medicine.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe high {{effectiveness}} of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE 5 -i) {{in the treatment}} of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been demonstrated. However, previous research shows that PDE 5 -i treatments have high discontinuation rates. AimThe main goals of this study were to (i) characterize the way men use PDE 5 -i and (ii) analyze the adherence to treatment, identifying the factors that influence PDE 5 -i use. MethodsA total of 148 men with clinical diagnosis for ED who maintained the treatment with PDE 5 -i for over 3 years were interviewed. Interviews concerning their ongoing treatment were carried out using a standardized questionnaire with quantitative and qualitative items. Main Outcome MeasuresPhysiological measures included the intracavernous alprostadil injection test, associated with penile rigidometry and <b>penile</b> <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound. The qualitative measure included two questions: “Do you use the drug in every sexual intercourse?" and “How do you use the inhibitor?"ResultsED causes were classified as venogenic (31 %), arteriogenic (23 %), psychogenic (18 %), iatrogenic (13 %), neurogenic (8 %), and diabetic (7 %). Participation rate was 71. 8 %. Of the 148 patients studied, 75 % claimed not to use PDE 5 -i in every intercourse. Most used tadalafil (66 %), followed by sildenafil (20 %), vardenafil (10 %), and 4 % alternated the type of medicine. Four main categories emerged concerning the factors that determine the intake of PDE 5 -i in some intercourse situations and not in others: (i) psychological factors; (ii) medication-related factors; (iii) circumstantial factors; and (iv) relational factors. ConclusionThe analysis of men's narratives revealed a combination of factors that influence the adherence to PDE 5 -i. The psychological and medication-related factors were the most prevalent. This study highlighted the importance of taking these factors into account, both at the time of prescription and during the follow-up in order to improve adherence.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the possible improvement {{of sexual activity}} following a non on-demand administration of a long half-life selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE- 5) in elderly patients without major cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: Sixty subjects with erectile dysfunction (ED) aged 60 - 70 years and 30 control patients aged 18 - 40 years, affected by psychogenic ED, were studied. All underwent routine and hormonal blood tests, Nocturnal Penile Tumescence Rigidity Monitoring test (NPTRM), ultrasonographyc evaluation of common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and <b>penile</b> colour <b>Doppler</b> ultrasonography (P-CDU). All patients underwent therapy with tadalafil 20 mg in alternative days, non on-demand, at 5. 00 p. m., for three consecutive months. IIEF- 5, NPTRM test and P-CDU were re-evaluated {{one month after the}} end of the therapy. RESULTS: Among elderly subjects 20 (33 %) had normal carotid IMT (1. 3 mm). NPTRM and P-CDU parameters were inversely related to different degrees of carotid wall alteration and showed a significant improvement respect to pre-treatment only in patients without atherosclerotic plaques. Also IIEF- 5 showed significant improvements only in patients without atherosclerotic plaques. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly subjects with slight or no signs of vascular disease at the carotid level, chronic and non on-demand treatment with tadalafil can induce spontaneous resumption of erections, probably through the improvement of endothelial function, but direct evidences to confirm this hypothesis are required...|$|R
40|$|Reduced cavernosal {{arterial}} inflow {{has been}} hypothesized {{to be the}} likely cause of erectile dysfunction after kidney transplants in recipients revascularized through end-to-end anastomosis to the internal iliac artery, suggesting that end-to-side anastomosis at the external iliac artery is preferable. The {{aim of this study}} was to prospectively evaluate the effect of the use of the external iliac artery on erectile function, hormone profiles and penile blood flow by evaluating changes in <b>penile</b> colour <b>Doppler</b> ultrasound parameters in a consecutive series of 22 recipients before and after end-to-side external iliac artery transplantation. The mean International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) domain score decreased significantly 3 months after transplant (18. 09 ± 6. 33 vs. 22. 50 ± 7. 09, P= 0. 01). The reduction in peak systolic velocity (PSV) was significant for the cavernous artery homolateral to the side of transplant (42. 60 ± 18. 77 vs. 52. 01 ± 19. 91, P= 0. 01). The mean postoperative end diastolic velocity (EDV) did not differ significantly from the preoperative value (P= 0. 74). No statistical differences were found in the serum levels of testosterone or prolactin. Kidney grafts anastomosed at the external iliac artery produced significant (P= 0. 01) reductions in arterial inflow at the homolateral cavernosal artery that remained above the normal threshold. Whether these haemodynamic changes can explain the worsening of postoperative erectile function remains to be prove...|$|R
