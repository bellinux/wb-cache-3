Parametric analysis of this model using GRUMCBL software was conducted to assess stability for wind tunnel tests. Two configurations of the F/A- 18 E/F were examined. The parameters examined were pulley-cable friction, mach number, dynamic <b>pressure,</b> <b>cable</b> geometry, center of gravity location, cable tension, snubbing the model, drag, and test medium. For the nominal cable geometry (Cable Geometry 1), Configuration One was unstable for cases with higher pulley-cable friction coefficients. A new cable geometry (Cable Geometry 3) was determined in which Configuration One was stable for all cases evaluated. Configuration Two with the nominal center of gravity position was found to be unstable for cases with higher pulley-cable friction coefficients; however, the model was stable when the center of gravity moved forward 1 / 2. The model was tested using the cable mount system during the initial wind tunnel entry and was stable as predicted...|$|E

50|$|The 2009 {{dispute between}} Time Warner Cable and Fox {{is an example}} of a {{carriage}} dispute involving an over-the-air broadcaster. The dispute pitted the second largest United States cable system against one of the four major U.S. television networks, whose broadcasts included the popular prime time series American Idol and National Football League games. Fox's then-parent company, News Corporation (which has since spun off the network and its cable channels to 21st Century Fox), reportedly sought a monthly fee of $1 per subscriber; Time Warner offered 20 to 25 cents. Both companies mounted aggressive public relations campaigns, including dedicated websites and advertising. Fox suggested that viewers look into alternatives to Time Warner, including satellite and Verizon's Fios service. Time Warner Cable countered that it was trying to reign in expenses that would ultimately be paid by subscribers. The companies ultimately settled close to the deadline, and, as is typical with carriage disputes, did not disclose the terms.

40|$|This study {{consists}} of two empirical analyses regarding the state of competition in the Korean cable television (CATV) markets. In the first analysis, this study provides empirical evidence regarding the effects of intra-modal competition within the CATV markets and inter-modal competition from direct broadcast satellite (DBS) on market performance in the CATV industry prior {{to the introduction of}} internet protocol television (IPTV). The empirical results described herein demonstrate that intra-modal competition between two cable operators in the same franchise area tended to reduce both cable prices and operator profits, and to increase the CATV penetration rate. The strong presence of a DBS was concomitant with reductions in a cable operator's profitability and cable subscriptions. The second part of this study attempts to briefly describe the state of competition in the CATV industry for the post-IPTV period. The results demonstrate that IPTV experienced a rapid growth in its subscriptions, which exerted competitive <b>pressures</b> on <b>cable</b> prices. That is, IPTV is emerging as a close substitute for CATV shortly after its introduction.

50|$|The {{specifications}} for cables and housings rarely give any details other than dimensions {{and the purpose}} of the products. The specific resistance to compression or bending is never quoted, so there is much rhetorical evidence and comment as to the performance and durability of products, but little available science for the consumer's use. A particularly severe quality test for housings is at or near the hinge of a folding bicycle where a sharp bend is made repeatedly. The radius of curvature of cables on a folded bicycle can be as low as 1.5 inches, (4 cm); therefore it is advisable to shift to the gear with the lowest <b>cable</b> <b>pressure</b> before folding, to minimize any adverse effects on housings or derailleurs.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{real-time}} detection of leaks for self-contained fluid-filled cables without taking {{them out of}} service has been assessed and a novel machine learning technique, i. e. support vector regression (SVR) analysis has been investigated to improve the detection sensitivity of the self-contained fluid-filled (FF) cable leaks. The condition of a 400 kV underground FF cable route within the National Grid transmission network has been monitored by Drallim pressure, temperature and load current measurement system. These three measured variables are used as parameters to describe {{the condition of the}} cable system. In the regression analysis the temperature and load current of the cable circuit are used as independent variables and the <b>pressure</b> within <b>cables</b> is the dependent variable to be predicted. As a supervised learning algorithm, the SVR requires data with known attributes as training samples in the learning process and can be used to identify unknown data or predict future trends. The load current is an independent variable to the fluid-filled system itself. The temperature, namely the tank temperature is determined by both the load current and the weather condition i. e. ambient temperature. The pressure is directly relevant to the temperature and therefore also correlated to the load current. The Gaussian-RBF kernel has been used in this investigation as it has a good performance in general application. The SVR algorithm was trained using 4 days data, as shown in Figure 1, and the optimized SVR is used to predict the pressure using the given load current and temperature information...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{irregularity}} {{is one of}} {{the parameters}} that have not been deeply examined on stay cables of cable-stayed bridges. This paper focuses on wind tunnel tests on original High Density Polyethylene cable covers, in a range of Reynolds numbers from the sub-critical regime to the critical one, corresponding to values ranging from Re = 9. 6 x 104 to Re = 3. 3 x 105. The experiment consists in measurement of parietal <b>pressures</b> on <b>cable</b> covers in order to investigate the effect of surface irregularity on the mechanism of dry galloping excitation. Previous studies ([1], [3] and [4]) reported that dry galloping of cables with a circular cross section is linked to the appearance of a negative pressure bubble, {{on one side of the}} circular cylinder at the critical Reynolds number range, leading locally to a rapid drop in the drag coefficient and the appearance of a no negligible lift force. But such a steady change in local lift force does not generate an alternate excitation on a whole cable. The question of the spatial correlation of this “one bubble “ regime along a cable in real conditions and the capability of this lift force to be varied with time are still not resolved.

40|$|Introduction Approximately {{ten million}} {{patients}} in Germany suffer from hypertension, 10 % {{of these patients}} are difficult to medicate, whereas 1 % requires long-term blood pressure monitoring. The purpose of our study is the empirical evaluation of a novel monitoring system recording blood pressure, pulse rate and body temperature of hypertensive patients which is designed for minimally-invasive implantation into the femoral artery. Methods The device is tested in twelve chronic animal trials (sheep) {{for a period of}} three to six months. Implantation of the sensor is accomplished by means of a dedicated sheath (PASIS) in the femoral artery under X-ray-control. A reference sensor positioned contra laterally is used to counter-check the measurement quality and validity of each sensor after implantation. Position and proper functioning of the sensor are controlled via regular readout measurements and CTs. Pathologic evaluation are made to investigate possible ingrowth of sensor tip and sensor cable {{at the end of each}} trial. Results Although the project is still in process, several interesting findings can already be reported. The pressure sensors in general deliver stable pressure history. However, the stiffness of the micro-cable as well as the implantation technique and position have an important impact on stable positioning of the sensor in the artery and thus on the validity of the <b>pressure</b> curves. <b>Cables</b> with low stability tend to slip out of the artery easily whereas high stiffness may injure the vessel. Conclusion Achieved findings are promising and support the feasibility of a stable long-term blood pressure implant to monitor hypertensive patients.

With these advances, the demands on the subsea umbilical are constantly increasing with deployment lengths and depths growing and the quantity of controlled functions now greater than ever. The need for {{a good understanding of}} the effects of deployment subsea is essential, as communications frequencies and data throughput constantly increase. This research aims to address some of the issues regarding umbilical modelling and sets up a series of tests to measure the effects of <b>pressure</b> and <b>cable</b> flooding within the umbilical and assesses the effect of steel tubes, hydraulic hoses and cable armouring on the operating parameters of the cables. In addition, the cables are modelled using electromagnetic field solver tools and the results compared with those measured. Once prediction losses have been established, these are compared with measurements taken on the full lengths of umbilical and the reasons for any discrepancies examined. It is shown that, in a typical subsea umbilical, the proximity of conducting cores to adjacent components, such as hydraulic hoses or steel wire armour, the flooding with sea water and the pressure due to the depth of deployment all {{have a significant impact on}} the impedance parameters of the cables. The effect of cable screening on attenuation is also examined and it is shown that, as well as affecting capacitance and conductance, the screen has a significant impact on the cable resistance and inductance, with the resistance rising to a maximum at a certain screen thickness before a subsequent reduction. This effect was investigated further by modelling with an electromagnetic field solver and a possible explanation for this effect is proposed. Comparison of the modelled data and measurement of cables under the various operating conditions investigated show good correlation with the results, allowing very accurate prediction of the effects on electrical performance of cables when deployed subsea in Subsea Control System umbilicals...|$|R
