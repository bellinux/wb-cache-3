5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E
5|$|Renovation {{began in}} 1994 under the {{direction}} of architect Gerhard Spangenberg, with the objective of returning the building so far as possible to its original condition while not ignoring the events of the more recent past. The first priority was the removal of iron girders, <b>particle</b> <b>board,</b> and chipboards. Relics of the GDR period deemed worthy of preservation were placed either in the Museum of German History in the former Prussian arsenal or in the House of History in Bonn. The original murals and reliefs, painted over and enclosed during the GDR period, were then restored. The fountain in the Klosterstraße vestibule was accurately recreated. Four bronze bear sculptures by Ignatius Taschner were returned from the Märkisches Museum and reinstalled on replacement stone columns in the Judenstraße vestibule. Exterior restoration of the building required either restoration or replacement with replicas of some 180 sculptural elements from the tower, including the allegorical figures of the virtues, giant vases, window embrasures, and one of the columns, which had bomb damage and had merely been patched. In addition, the original mansard roof was reconstructed in 1998/99 on the west, main facade facing Jüdenstraße. The technical facilities were also updated, including ventilation equipment, elevators, lighting, and plumbing. It proved impossible to use the tower for offices because it lacked the second exit required by safety regulations. This was later rectified by the addition of office space in the roof cavity.|$|E

40|$|Subject of investigation: {{process of}} sawing of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> by {{circular}} saws. Purpose of the work: substantiation of the rational {{parameters of the}} circular saw teeth and sawing conditions. The theoretical results include the study and determination {{of the influence of}} technological and tool factors on the power, energy and qualitative characteristics of the process of sawing of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> by circular saws; specification of the peculiar dependences of the characteristics of the sawing conditions on the geometry of the saw teeth; development of a mathematical model for sawing of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> by the circular saws. The work substantiates the rational parameters of circular saw teeth and the conditions of sawing of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> which provide for lower power consumption and for a high quality of the sawn surface. The rational parameters are substantiated for the circular saws and for the conditions of sawing of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> by the circular saws. The use of the improved circular saws and sawing conditions makes it possible to decrease the extent of chipping of the edges of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards,</b> to reduce power consumption in sawing and to prolong the durability of toolsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

The particleboards were sectioned in test samples, and accomplished by physical-mechanical tests for the determination of density, swelling and absorption of water (0 - 2 h; 2 - 24 h; and 0 - 24 h); rupture module and elasticity module in static bending, internal ligation and screw withdrawal. The <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> pressed with pressure of 3. 0 MPa and temperature of 90 ºC and that with pressure of 3. 5 MPa and temperature of 60 ºC presented the best results.

50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly cement bonded <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> and cement fibre. Cement bonded <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement fibre boards have {{cellulose}} fibre, {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> have higher capacity than cement fibre <b>boards.</b> Cement <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|R

25|$|Formaldehyde {{levels in}} {{building}} environments {{are affected by}} a number of factors. These include the potency of formaldehyde-emitting products present, the ratio of the surface area of emitting materials to volume of space, environmental factors, product age, interactions with other materials, and ventilation condition. Formaldehyde emits from a variety of construction materials, furnishings, and consumer products. The three products that emit the highest concentrations are medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and <b>particle</b> <b>board.</b> Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity can elevate levels because formaldehyde has a high vapor pressure. Formaldehyde levels from building materials are the highest when a building first opens because materials would have less time to off-gas. Formaldehyde levels decrease over time as the sources suppress.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} the investigation of finishing wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> is presented. The testing process of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> involved an original stand. The following three types of finished boards underwent evaluation: finished with veneer on both sides, finished with veneer {{on the one side}} and with compensatory paper on the other side, and finished with melamine impregnated paper on both sides. It was established that the first vibrational modes of finished wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> in two perpendicular directions share similarity with modes of the beam-shaped body in terms of their shape. It was obtained that the modulus of elasticity of wood <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> with different finishing differs by approximately 30  % – 70  % in two perpendicular directions. It was established that when dealing with boards finished with veneer on both sides, with veneer on the one side and compensatory paper on the other side, and with melamine impregnated paper, the value of the modulus of elasticity in two perpendicular directions differs by 1. 71, 1. 54 and 1. 34 times, respectively.
