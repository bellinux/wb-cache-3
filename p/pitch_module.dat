40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of a song-singing program on the affective speaking intonation of traumatically brain-injured people who presented with monotonal voices. Four subjects received 15 sessions of music therapy comprising the singing of three subject-preferred songs. The variables of: speaking fundamental frequency, standardised variability and slope, pitch range, pitch-matching accuracy and mood were analysed pre and post-session. The audio data was analysed using Multi-speech with real-time <b>pitch</b> <b>module.</b> A key phrase selected from songs used in the subjects 2 ̆ 7 sessions was also analysed to determine pitch-matching accuracy and later compared with the intervals in the pitch-matching exercise. The visual analogue mood scales were assessed as per standardised procedure. Results suggest that long-term improvements in affective intonation are evident, especially in fundamental frequency, however the response direction and degree of change are idiosyncratic. Immediate treatment effects (pre/post-session differences) were in the direction contrary to that expected (negative). Fatigue is suggested as one explanation for this result, particularly as fatigue was reported in the visual analogue mood scale. Vocal range improved over time in all four subjects and was positively correlated with all three intonation components, particularly the standardised variability score. High variability in responses was evident in the interval tasks. The mood scale responses were also variable, and interpretations of therapy effects on mood should be treated with caution. Negative correlations (that opposite to expected) were found between the mood scales and intonation variables suggesting that as subjects reported becoming more emotional, they became more monotonal, had flatter slope measures and a lower fundamental frequency. Subjects sang intervals more accurately when they were in a song than when presented in isolation...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a pitch {{tracking}} system for noisy speech is a challenging and yet unsolved issue due to the association of "traditional" pitch determination problems with those of noise processing.

For example, the Moog modular synthesizers also use the 0-5v control voltage for all other parameters. They are represented on the front panel of many synthesizers as knobs, but often a patch bay allows the input or output of the related CV to synchronize multiple modules together. So, for example, the pitch voltage from a keyboard {{could also be used}} to control the rate of an LFO, which could be applied to the volume of the oscillator output, creating a tremolo that becomes faster as the <b>pitch</b> rises. <b>Modules</b> that can be controlled by CV include VCF, VCA, high and low frequency oscillators, ring modulators, sample and hold circuits and noise injection.|$|R

These numbers (or at least one of them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid {{unnecessary}} wear and damage. An even uniform gear wear is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the two gears meshing together are relatively prime to each other; this occurs when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each gear tooth count equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the 1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case. Mechanical engineers, at least in continental Europe, usually use the module instead of circular <b>pitch.</b> The <b>module,</b> just like the circular pitch, can be used for all types of cogs, not just evolvent based straight cogs.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we model a large-area high-efficiency {{interdigitated}} back-contact (IBC) {{solar cell}} {{by means of}} a distributed electrical network. The simulation tool allows accounting for the distributed resistive effects in diffusions and metallization. The model also considers the electrical shading effect and resistive losses due to both back-surface field (BSF) and emitter busbars. A calibrated model is used to investigate the case of a large-area (15. 6 × 15. 6 cm 2) IBC cell, in which we investigate the influence of key busbar parameters: number of busbars, busbar width, soldering <b>pitch</b> (for <b>module</b> connection), and metal sheet resistance. The predictive simulations allow finding out the optimum number of busbars, arising from a tradeoff between the electrical shading effect due to the BSF busbars and resistive losses due to the emitter busbars and the fingers. Moreover, we show how the distance between soldering points on the metal busbars influences the choice of the busbar width. We found out that if an adequate number (> 7) of soldering points is adopted, the busbar width should be kept lower than 0. 5 mm. On the other hand, the adoption of a thick Cu-plating (15 μm) leads to an increase of efficiency of 0. 2 %abs with respect to the case of sputtered Al metal (3 μm thick) ...|$|R
40|$|Cosmic-ray muons {{are highly}} penetrative charged {{particles}} that are observed {{at sea level}} with a flux of approximately one per square centimetre per minute. They interact with matter primarily through Coulomb scattering, which is exploited {{in the field of}} muon tomography to image shielded objects {{in a wide range of}} applications. In this paper, simulation studies are presented that assess the feasibility of a scintillating-fibre tracker system for use in the identification and characterisation of nuclear materials stored within industrial legacy waste containers. A system consisting of a pair of tracking modules above and a pair below the volume to be assayed is simulated within the GEANT 4 framework using a range of potential fibre <b>pitches</b> and <b>module</b> separations. Each module comprises two orthogonal planes of fibres that allow the reconstruction of the initial and Coulomb-scattered muon trajectories. A likelihood-based image reconstruction algorithm has been developed that allows the container content to be determined with respect to the atomic number Z of the scattering material. Images reconstructed from this simulation are presented for a range of anticipated scenarios that highlight the expected image resolution and the potential of this system for the identification of high-Z materials within a shielded, concrete-filled container. First results from a constructed prototype system are presented in comparison with those from a detailed simulation. Excellent agreement between experimental data and simulation is observed showing clear discrimination between the different materials assayed throughout. Comment: 11 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis used {{virtual reality}} {{techniques}} to investigate how differences in visual vertical direction of two docked spacecraft affect {{the ability of}} a person in one module to mentally visualize the relative orientation of the other module, and spatial relationships of surfaces in it. Spacecraft and space station modules are typically connected differently in space from the way they would be in training simulators on Earth. The local visual vertical is the direction that appears to be "up" as defined by panel and rack orientation, labeling, and placement. In space, the local visual verticals of adjacent modules are not always consistently aligned and astronauts say they find it hard to orient themselves within those configurations. We investigated how relative module orientation determines performance in a spatial memory and visualization task. An experiment compared six different attachment configurations of two modules. Subjects (n = 20) wearing a color stereo head mounted display first learned the interiors of two modules separately. They then learned six flight configurations sequentially. In each configuration, subjects located in the first module were shown one "cue" wall in that module, so they could determine their orientation, and were then asked to visualize, place and orient a "target" wall within a wireframe view of the adjacent second module. (cont.) The total time to respond to each trial was recorded, along with the percentage of correct responses, and the subject's head orientation. The analysis of time to respond and percentage of correct responses showed that certain configurations were statistically significantly different. As expected, the easiest configurations were "terrestrial like" where the visual verticals of the two modules were co-aligned. Including a 180 deg <b>pitch</b> between the <b>modules</b> made the task harder. The hardest were those that included a 90 deg pitch - in which the local visual verticals of the two modules were orthogonal. Comparing the easiest (terrestrial like) configurations with hardest, subjects needed 3 seconds more to orient and accomplish the task. This represents a significant amount of time given that we perform this task without much thinking about it and almost instantaneously on Earth. Subjects relied heavily on the visual verticals, and often tilted their heads toward alignment with the local visual vertical. Performance could be predicted, {{based on the number of}} pitches and yaws relating the two modules in the configurations tested.

40|$|The Standard Model of {{elementary}} particles, which is summarized {{briefly in the}} second chapter, incorporates a number of successful theories to explain the nature and consistency of matter. However not all building blocks of this model could yet be tested by experiment. To confirm existing theories and to improve nowadays understanding of matter a new machine is currently being built at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), described in the third chapter. LHC is a proton-proton collider which will reach unprecedented luminosities and center of mass energies. Five experiments are attached to it to give answers to questions like {{the existence of the}} Higgs meson, which allows to explain the mass content of matter, and the origin of CP-violation, which {{plays an important role in}} the baryogenesis of the universe. Supersymmetric theories, proposing a bosonic superpartner for each fermion and vice versa, will be tested. By colliding heavy ions, high energy and particle densities can be achieved and probed. This state of matter is called the quark gluon plasma and is similar to the state of our universe short after the Big Bang. In addition high precision measurments are performed to improve current models in high energy physics. The design of the two experiments related to this thesis are described in more detail in chapter 3 : CMS, the 'Compact Muon Solenoid', which is an exploratory experiment symmetrically surrounding the interaction point and LHCb, the 'LHC beauty experiment', which is a forward spectrometer to CP-violation in the B-meson system. A crucial part of these experiments are the tracking detectors which measure the tracks of charged decay products after collision in the accelerator. From the bending under an applied magnetic field the momentum of charged particles can be derived. LHC imposes a harsh environment and heavy constraints on these detectors due to the fast readout requirements of 25 ns as well as the harsh radiation environment. Silicon microstrip detectors are the favourable choice for large area tracking devices. The resulting radiation damage is well understood and it can be expected that they will withstand the accumulated dose of 10 years of operation at LHC. In addition signal formation occurs within the bunch crossing time of 25 ns. Reproducibility at high precision is ensured by standard processes known from micro electronics industry. After a short introduction to semiconductor detectors in chapter 4 the layout and performance of the silicon trackers of the LHCb and CMS experiments are described in chapter 5. Radiation damage in silicon detectors under proton and neutron irradiation was investigated intensively within the ROSE collaboration (RD 48). Based on their results good performance of the LHCb Inner Tracker is still expected after 10 years of operation. It was found that the degraded signal over noise ratio due to radiation damage of all modules lay above the given thresholds for track reconstruction efficiency and the expected depletion voltage after ten years of operation will be well below the specifications. Due to radiation damage the leakage currents inside the silicon detectors increase. This generates additional heat which in turn generates additional leakage current. If the provided cooling is not sufficient this could result in a break down called thermal runaway. Cooling for the sensors inside the detector boxes of the Inner Tracker is provided just via natural heat convection. A short review on natural heat convection and the equations used here are given in the appendix. It was investigated whether natural heat convection from the detector surface is sufficient to suppress thermal runaway. The results are summarized in chapter 5. In the Silicon Strip Tracker of the CMS experiment additional cooling to the sensors is provided via cooling pipes. In the outer part of the tracker the sensors are placed on a sophisticated rod structure which is later on inserted into a carbon barrel. An experimental setup to study the cooling performance of this rod structure is described in chapter 6. The temperature distributions on the fully equipped rod were measured under different conditions. For the first time the temperatures of the optohybrids when operated on the rod were measured. In a final test it could be concluded that the cooling performance of the rods is sufficient to guarantee a temperature difference of 10 ^o C between silicon surface and ambient. For understanding the behaviour of a detector it is essential to understand as well the behaviour of its readout electronics. The requirements for the readout electronics at LHC are quite demanding due to the high bunch crossing frequency. The readout chips for tracking detectors used for LHC show similar design principles: a charge sensitive preamplifier followed by a CR-RC shaper. In chapter 7 the BEETLE preamplifier chip used for the LHCb Silicon Tracker is introduced. Signal formation and potential noise sources are discussed. An in depth study of the resulting pulse shape is given, supported by numeric simulations. By means of Laplace transformation models for the pulse shape could be derived which were used later on for analysis. The parameter space of both the preamplifier and the shaper settings are investigated with respect to undershoot, spill-over and ballistic deficit. Performance studies on prototype modules under testbeam conditions are crucial for the final design of tracking detectors. Prototype modules were built for the LHCb Silicon Tracker with different length, thickness and readout pitch. To better understand the impact of strip width and readout <b>pitch</b> prototype <b>modules</b> from multigeometry sensors were built. The setup and the outcome of the comprehensive measurement program of the testbeam experiments are described in chapter 8. The main parameter describing the performance of silicon microstrip detectors is the ratio of signal over noise. This parameter was derived as both a function of the total strip capacitance and the impact point of the traversing particle. A signal loss is observed in the inter-strip region. Together with laboratory measurements of the strip capacitance the signal over noise ratio could be interpolated as a function of readout pitch and strip width. Bias voltage scans were performed to test whether the 500 mum thick detectors are sensitive to ballistic deficit. The studies were supported by numeric simulations of the signal formation in silicon sensors and suggest no significant signal loss due to ballistic deficit. In addition the measurements underline the hypothesis that the charge loss in the inter-strip region arrises due to charge traps on the sensor surface. Pulseshapes are studied for different bias voltage settings and shaper settings. The signal remainder after 25 ns of the peaking time contributes to the spill-over rate in the next event and is studied carefully. A parametrization as a function of the total strip capacitance could be given. Undershoot and crosstalk were investigated and tabled for the various prototype modules. The cluster finding efficiency is a crucial parameter for the tracking performance in the final experiment. It was found to be sufficient for all prototype modules, except the two- and three- sensor modules built from 320 mum multigeometry sensors. A direct comparison is given between the performance of a 500 mum thick three sensor modules once with long interconnect cable and once without. The interconnect cable is important for the Trigger Tracker station where the readout electronics is located outside the detector box. Before the detectors are placed into the final experiment they have to be tested carefully. Especially for long modules where silicon microstrip sensors are wire bonded together, short circuits and missing wire bonds are to be expected. It turned out that the internally generated testpulses on the readout chip are a powerfull tool to test for such defects. The response of the whole readout chip is highly dependent on the total capacitance on the input node of the preamplifier. Short circuits double the strip capacitance whereas missing wire bonds are leading to a decrease. Characteristic pulseshape parameters like the pulseheight are investigated whether the change due to the different capacitances are significant. Measurements were performed on a prototype module with artificially introduced defects. All defects could be detected at a significance higher than three standard deviations. No misidentification occured using an algorithm which automatically returns a channel map with type of defect and significance. Punch throughs in the dielectricum between implant strip and aluminum strip lead to a DC-coupling of the readout strips. In the case of the APV readout chip used for the CMS Silicon Strip Tracker it was shown that the occurance of about five such pinholes could lead to a loss of the whole readout chip. To detect pinholes a very sufficient method requiring no additional hardware is suggested based again on internal calibration pulses. The results of these tests together with a characterization of the testpulses are given in chapter 9...|$|R
