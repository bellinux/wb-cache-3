This also increased tax revenues, which others had found difficult to do, because of the logistics of taxing a rural population which moved around with its cattle.

50|$|Most slab-hut {{construction}} techniques {{could be}} described as bush carpentry. Few early settlers could afford the time, or possessed the capital, to build any dwelling more impressive than a slab hut: they had first to clear their land and get a crop planted or <b>pasture</b> <b>fenced.</b> In later years, according to the terms of their purchase, selectors had to erect and occupy a dwelling on their land as soon as possible. On the goldfields, or timber-getting, only a temporary dwelling, produced quickly from available materials, was thought necessary.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{nitrogen}} pools (NP), denitrification (DN), gross nitrification (GN), N 2 O and CO 2 flux rates {{with their}} responses to temperature increases were determined under five different land uses and managements in a subalpine forest-grassland ecotone of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Land uses consisted of 1) sparse woodland, 2). shrub-land, 3) natural <b>pasture,</b> 4) <b>fenced</b> <b>pasture,</b> and 5) tilled pasture mimicking a gradient degenerating ecosystem under grazing impacts. The NO 3 [...] N content was higher than the NH 4 +-N content. Comparing tilled <b>pasture</b> with <b>fenced</b> <b>pasture</b> showed that higher intensive management (tillage) led to a significant decrease of soil organic matter (SOM) (P < 0. 05) in the soils, which was {{in contrast to the}} significant increases (P < 0. 05) of DN, GN, N 2 O and CO 2 flux rates. GN (excluding tilled pasture) and CO 2 flux rates increased with a temperature rise, but DN and N 2 O flux rates normally reached their maximum values at 12 - 14 degreesC with tilled pasture (the highest management intensity) being very sensitive to temperature increases. There was a difference between net nitrification and GN, with GN being a better indicator of soil nitrification...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} pasture-based dairy {{operations}} across the United States is rapidly increasing. This shift from confinement dairying to pasture-based dairying {{is driven by}} goals of reduced feed and labor costs. Efficient use of pasture resources is crucial to accomplish cost reduction and optimize milk production from <b>pasture.</b> <b>Fence</b> and water distribution systems are the tools used for controlling the grazing dairy herd. Practical, easy-to-use fence and water technologies are needed to reduce labor requirements. Dairy herd management requires flexibility in pasture allocation throughout the grazing season, so water and fence systems must also be flexible.

50|$|Edwin Stanton's {{purchase}} of the major part of Santa Cruz Island brought {{a major shift in}} agricultural production on the island. After trying for a short time to continue the sheep operation, he decided to switch to beef production. At the time, the beef industry in California was growing rapidly, with Santa Barbara County among the top ten beef producers in the state.Edwin Stanton's ranch on Santa Cruz Island saw changes that reflected the evolution of cattle ranching in a working landscape. While retaining most of the 19th century structures dating from the Caire period, Stanton constructed a few buildings {{to meet the needs of}} his cattle ranch, the most notable of which is Rancho del Norte on the isthmus. <b>Pasture</b> <b>fencing</b> and corrals were altered to suit the cattle operation and an extensive water system was added to provide water to the cattle.|$|R
50|$|In February 1911, Francisco I.

Up to that point, the Mormon colonists had established a friendly relationship with their Mexican neighbors. During the initiation of Madero's revolt, there were some efforts made by local officers to enlist the loyalty of the Mormon settlers to the federal ranks. Nevertheless, the settlers maintained a position of neutrality during the developments surrounding them. The LDS Church's headquarters had also endorsed a policy of strict neutrality. The unstable conditions in the Country didn't affect the Mormon colonies much, except for occasional stealing of <b>pasture</b> <b>fences,</b> horses and cattle used mostly for beef.

He makes plain {{the fact that the}} cowboy of today must master many skills unknown to the cowboy of the colorful open range before the era of tractors, vaccination, controlled breeding, and 2 ̆ 2 calfpullers. 2 ̆ 2 The modern cowboy should be a mechanic and something of a veterinarian and horticulturist as well. Although he still rides horses and ropes cattle, he also builds <b>pasture</b> <b>fences,</b> repairs windmills, and puts up hay. Even so, as Erickson makes clear, the romance is not all gone from the life of the cowboy. The glamor invested in the old-time riders of the purple sage by great western movies and innumerable cowboy stories still firmly surrounds the cowboy, a durable fellow indeed, both in fact and fiction. Most important, perhaps, as Erickson points out, {{is the fact that the}} cowboy is still needed. As long as Americans perfer beef on their tables, and until the cattle business modernizes and mechanizes him out of existence, the cowboy will be a part of the scene...|$|R

40|$|The {{current market}} demand and price for organic milk is {{encouraging}} dairy producers, particularly those on smaller farms, to consider organic production {{as a means}} for improving the economic viability of their operations. Organic production systems vary widely in scale, in practices, and across agroclimatic settings. Within this context, case studies of 4 actual organic dairy farms were used to characterize existing systems in Pennsylvania. Based on data from these farms, a whole-farm simulation model (Integrated Farm System Model) was used to compare 4 production systems representing organic grass, organic crop, conventional crop with grazing, and conventional confinement production. The performance of each of these systems was simulated over each year of 25 yr of central Pennsylvania weather data. Simulation results indicated that farm level accumulation of soil P and K may be a concern on organic farms that use poultry manure as a primary crop nutrient source, and that erosion and runoff loss of P may be of concern on organic farms producing annual crops because more tillage is required for weed control. Whole-farm budgets with prices that reflect recent conditions showed an economic advantage for organic over conventional production. A sensitivity analysis showed that this economic advantage depended on a higher milk price for producers of organic milk and was influenced by the difference in milk production maintained by herds using organic and conventional systems. Factors found to have little effect on the relative profitability of organic over conventional production included the differences between organic and conventional prices for seed, chemicals, forage, and animals and the overall costs or prices assumed for organic certification, machinery, <b>pasture</b> <b>fencing,</b> fuel, and labor. Thus, at the current organic milk price, relative to other prices, the case study organic production systems seem to provide an option for improving the economic viability of dairy operations of the scale considered in Pennsylvania. To motivate transition to organic systems, the economic advantage found requires the persistence of a substantial difference between conventional and organic raw milk prices...|$|R

50|$|Along {{with their}} {{habitats}} in woody forests and behind sand dunes, indigenous marsupials patrol domestic lawns nightly. The animals chew off any {{growth in the}} grass from the previous night. Fire risk is reduced by this frequent trimming, and the soil remains fertilized and conditioned by fecal matter the marsupials leave behind. Many farmers have found that using the marsupials to aid their plants works great. They allow the marsupials to come in at night and trim grasses in their gardens. This also reveals weeds or other shrubs, making extraction of unwanted plants easier. The marsupials leave vegetables and fruits alone while focusing only on eating grass. While this may be beneficial to crop farmers, others are frustrated with constant efforts to keep marsupials out of their grass cattle <b>pastures.</b> Expensive <b>fencing</b> and repair to keep marsupials out of pastures has caused much controversy.|$|R
