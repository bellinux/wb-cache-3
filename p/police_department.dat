50|$|In {{response}} to instances of police brutality, the United States Commission on Civil Rights suggested in 1981 that <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> enforce early intervention programs. The goal {{of these programs}} is to spot potentially risky behaviors within <b>police</b> <b>departments,</b> and to take preventative action to reduce instances of police misconduct. Although not required, many <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> have opted to adopt early prevention programs. However, the methods used to identify problematic police officers {{were found to be}} inefficient. The identifiers used often flag officers that in reality pose a minimal threat, while those that would benefit from additional oversight fly under the radar. To offset this, <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> have been using an increased number of indicators to determine risk factors.|$|R

5000|$|... 8,000 {{local law}} {{enforcement}} agencies participate in the reutilization program. <b>Police</b> <b>departments</b> are responsible for paying for shipment and storage of material acquired, but do not pay for the donation.

The program gives smaller <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> access to material that larger <b>police</b> <b>departments</b> are usually able to afford without federal assistance. A memorandum of agreement between the DLA and the states participating in 1033 requires that local police forces either utilize the military equipment within one year or return it.
