50|$|Sand cores {{are used}} to form the {{internal}} cavities when the engine block or cylinder head(s) is cast. These cavities are usually the coolant passages.

Core plugs are usually thin metal cups <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> into the casting holes, but may be made of rubber or other materials. In some high-performance engines the core plugs are large diameter cast metal threaded pipe plugs.|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{studies of}} <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> {{contacts}} {{have been performed}} during environmental stress tests as well as during the manufacturing process. We investigated several <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> pin geometries according to their reliability under thermal, mechanical and electrical load. Correlations with the push-out force have been performed. In this paper we also focus on the mechanical reliability of electronic components which are soldered nearby the press-in pins. During press-in of the contact pin, a strain affected zone is created in the printed circuit board (PCB) near the contacts. The reliability of electronic components soldered near the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> pins can be reduced if the solder joints are bearing strains > 400 µm/m. We investigated the strains {{on the surface of}} PCBs during <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> injection by two different sensor technologies and numerical simulations. Apart from standard electrical strain gauges we used fiber optic Bragg grating sensors. Their advantage is the ability to detect strain gradients, which are common in the sphere of influence of a <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> contact. In a distance of 3 mm away from the investigated contact pins the surface strain on the PCB is around 0. 1 %; in a distance of 10 mm at least 500 µm/m...|$|R

The stators are traditionally <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> into the housing. Tolerance rings can be used instead of press fitting. With their wavelike protrusions, tolerance rings generate a retention force when compressed between the housing and the stator. These protrusions act as springs and allow the mating components to expand and contract at different rates while still providing the required retention force.|$|E
5000|$|A record {{press is}} a machine for {{manufacturing}} vinyl records.

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of two bundles, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PM). Double bundle reconstructions appear to give better rotational stability. The usual technique is to make two tunnels in the femur and two in the tibia. This is difficult and in small knees {{may not even be}} possible. We have developed a foreign material free <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation for double bundle ACL reconstruction using a single femoral tunnel (R). This is based on the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> ACL reconstruction. It is suitable for the most common medium and, otherwise difficult, small sizes of knees. Method: Using diamond edged wet grinding hollow reamers, bone cylinders in different diameters are harvested from the implantation tunnels of the tibia and femur and used for the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation. Using the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> technique the graft is first fixed in tibia. It is then similarly fixed under tension in the femoral side with the knee in 120 degree flexion. This is called Bottom To Top Fixation (BTT). On extending the knee the graft tension is self adapting. Depending {{on the size of the}} individual knee, the diameter of the femoral bone plug is varied from 8 to 13 mm to achieve an anatomic spread with a double bundle-like insertion. The tibia tunnel can be applied with two 7 or 8 mm diameter tunnels overlapping to a semi oval tunnel between 10 to 13 mm. Results: Since May 2003 we have carried out ACL-reconstructions with Hamstring grafts without foreign material using the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> technique. Initially, an 8 mm <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> fixation was used proximally with good results. Since April 2008, the range of diameters was increased up to 13 mm. The results of the Lachman tests have been good to excellent. Results of the Pivot shift test suggested more stability with femoral broader diameters of 9, 5 to 13 mm. Conclusions: The foreign material free fixation of hamstring in the ALL <b>PRESS</b> <b>FIT</b> Bottom To Top Fixation is a successful method for ACL Reconstruction. The Diamond Instruments and tubed guiding devices are precise, reliable and easy to manage. On this basis a double bundle reconstruction is achieved using a single tunnel.

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is <b>press</b> <b>fitted.</b> The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|E
50|$|Tolerance Rings are {{radially}} sprung rings {{that are}} <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> between two mating components {{to act as}} frictional fasteners. They are flexible shims designed to fix two cylindrical parts together. The wavelike protrusions that run around the circumference of the ring generate a retention force to provide an optimal fit between the two mating components {{without the need for}} adhesive or excessive assembly force, simplifying the process for manufacturers. They allow for any misalignment caused by thermal expansion or excessive vibration. Tolerance rings can be used as bearing mounts and as a means of dealing with torque transfer, torque overload protection and axial slip between mating components. They are often used to isolate undesirable vibration in engines and electric motors, for noise-free mechanism operation in passenger vehicles and domestic appliances, where noise reduction has become a major trend in recent years. Modifications to tolerance rings can be made to tune the dynamic stiffness and, therefore, the frequencies that can be isolated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to propose a {{frictional}} damper so as to enhance structural damping leading to the chatter suppression in the slender endmill tool. The proposed damper is composed of a core <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> inside a multi-fingered hollow cylinder. Core and cylinder both are <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> into an axial hole inside the tool. First, an analytical model is developed for the damper. Then, a parameter study is conducted to find optimum parameters of the damper for the increase of the stability limit as much as possible. In order to validate the analytical model, a nonlinear finite element model of the damped milling tool is simulated using ANSYS software package. Having finite element model, the stability lobe diagrams for simple tool and optimally damped tool are extracted from frequency response functions. Modal test is applied to a real specimen of damped tool in order to validate finite element results. Good agreement between experiments and modeling is obtained...|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{crack propagation}} simulation is {{performed by the}} Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM). The Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) along {{the front of a}} semi elliptical crack, initiated from the external surface of a hollow axle, are calculated for bending and <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> loading separately and for a combination of them. In correspondence of the latter loading condition, a crack propagation is also simulated, with the crack growth rates calculated using the NASGRO 3 formula, calibrated for the material under analysis (steel ASTM A 469). The J-integral and COD approaches are selected for SIFs calculation in DBEM environment, where the crack path is assessed by the minimum strain energy density criterion (MSED). In correspondence of the initial crack scenario, SIFs along the crack front are also calculated by the Finite Element (FE) code ZENCRACK, using COD, in order to provide, by a cross comparison with DBEM, an assessment on the level of accuracy obtained. Due to the symmetry of the bending problem a pure mode I crack propagation is realised with no kinking of the propagating crack whereas for <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> loading the crack propagation becomes mixed mode. The crack growth analysis is nonlinear because of normal gap elements used to model the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> condition with added friction, and is developed in an iterative-incremental procedure. From the analysis of the SIFs results related to the initial cracked configuration, it is possible {{to assess the impact of}} the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> condition when superimposed to the bending load case...|$|R

A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three lead screws upon actuation of a drive gear. The drive gear meshes with the sun gear and is driven by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the drive gear, the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three lead screws and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the drive gear rotates, the traversing plate is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity. Thus, the length or size of the cavity can be tuned while maintaining the traversing plate in an exact parallel relationship with an opposing plate on another end of the cavity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Press-fit {{component}} fixation {{is one of}} {{the primary}} goals in uncemented total hip arthroplasty. When aiming at proximal load transfer, the stem size has to be selected with regard to the shape of the proximal femoral canal. This can be challenging in patients with ‘champagne flute ’ femurs with a relatively narrow diaphysis, especially when a long stem femoral component is used. The present case report describes a complication during femoral broaching for a primary uncemented femoral component. Because of the narrow diaphysis, the distal portion of the broach got caught in the narrow canal and it became impossible to remove the broach with conventional techniques. Via a second distal incision, the femur was split from the distal tip of the broach to approximately 5 cm distal of the femoral neck cut along the posterior aspects of the femur. This loosened the broach enough to allow for an uncomplicated removal. The longitudinal split was secured with cables before a similar size primary implant was <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> into the femoral canal...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the biomechanical effects induced by oral implant insertion because of the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> action caused by the difference between the major diameter of the implant and that of the drilled hole. The intent is to provide a correlation between bone–implant interaction and heavy stress–strain effects induced in bone tissues. In particular, the analysis allows for the evaluation of the bone mechanical response considering the inelastic range. Materials and methods. Bone material properties are defined, with regard to the elastic phase, according to a procedure that distributes, over the entire volume, the material constants magnitude and orthotropic directions deduced from experimental data. The inelastic phenomena are interpreted by a specific constitutive formulation and parameter identification procedure. The displacement field induced by implant insertion is provided by imposing the geometric configuration of the implant on the assumed drilled surface. Results. Results are reported with regard to the displacement and strain fields caused in the peri-implant region. The range of strains induced in bone confirms that inelastic effects occur and their characterisation is essential for the interpretation of the <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> phenomenon. Significance. The investigation allows for an accurate evaluation of the short term effects induced by <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> phenomenon in bone tissues which can be of particular interest also in consideration of immediate loading techniques in oral surgery...|$|R
