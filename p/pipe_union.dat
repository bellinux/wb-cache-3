By 1958 all but the MM1 had received the new vaporising spirit burners, which had first appeared in 1957 {{with the introduction of}} the all new twin cylinder SE3. Again there was another round of cosmetic changes with updated boiler bands and fireboxes. Combinations of these old and new parts {{can be found in the}} 'transitional' engines of the late 1950s period (e.g. the SE1, 2 and MM2). By the mid-1960s the engines were using pop rivets for the engine frame securing method (along with the entire Mamod range) as well more cosmetic changes. In 1967 the SE range received its next major update with the introduction of the SE1a and SE2a replacing the SE1 and 2. The superheating was gone and the simplified pipe work was all new. The SE2a also got a reversing lever like the 'MEC1' Meccano engine of 1965. Other details such as paint colour, boiler end cap and whistle design as well as decal layout were gradually changed. One point worth mentioning was the fact that from 1967 until about 1972 the Se1, 2 and 3 could be found with a different green paint on their engine frames. This paint was similar to a hammered effect type finish and was probably purchased as a job lot by the Managing Director at the time, Eric Malins. Steve Malins has confirmed that this was the case and his father would try anything new or changes which made production cheaper. The Minor range never received this paint finish. The SE3 was unchanged bar the introduction of the Griffin and George (educational suppliers) version in 1969. This engine was the only real variation to Mamod's biggest post-war stationary engine. It featured the very first silver soldered boiler (at the insistence of G&G) and also had a steam <b>pipe</b> <b>union</b> nut at the boiler instead of the usual stop cock. It carried an extra foil G&G lozenge logo by the engine too. About 2,000 were made until about mid-1970s. It was only sold to schools and came complete with a comprehensive manual for using the engine in lab experiments. Later examples of this engine were standard SE3s but carrying a revised G&G logo of a different design. This Griffin badge could sometimes be found placed alongside the warning labels applied to all stationary engines in 1976 explaining the use of inappropriate fuel containers and refuelling techniques.|$|E

Neste trabalho se apresenta uma metodologia para união de tubos pelo processo de soldagem com a deposição do passe de raiz. Na realização da soldagem de topo, externa e sem abertura de raiz, a altura da face de raiz é um fator {{fundamental}} para obter penetração total. Em alguns casos, mata-juntas (podem ser de cobre o de materiais cerâmicos) são usadas para evitar vazamentos de solda. Porém, o cobre pode ocasionar inclusões e corrosão, além de trazer muitas dificuldades no momento de instalação e gerar grandes custos em campo. Assim sendo, realizou-se uma análise do efeito da penetração utilizando-se o método de fase de nariz decrescente na soldagem de passe de raiz sem uso de cobre-junta nem abertura de raiz, para as seguintes posições críticas de soldagem: plana, vertical e sobrecabeça. A análise foi feita utilizando o processo de soldagem MIG/MAG por curto-circuito derivativo, GMAW-CMT (Gas Metal Arc Welding - Cold Metal Transfer), com arame AWS ER 70 S- 6 (1, 2 mm) e o gás de proteção Ar+ 25 %CO 2. O Planejamento Composto Central foi utilizado como ferramenta para a melhor organização dos testes e para análise dos resultados fez-se uma otimização utilizando a teoria de Desirability para múltiplas respostas, usando chapas planas de aço 1020 com chanfro estreito em U. Logo, valida-se esta metodologia de penetração completa em soldagem orbital de meia volta descendente em um tubo ASTM 106 por meio do processo de soldagem curto-circuito convencional com a ajuda da potência de soldagem mesurada. Os testes foram realizados com arames consumíveis de diâmetros 0, 9 e 1, 2 mm. Ensaios de macrografia mostraram os passes de raiz com bom aspecto visual e sem defeitos internos, sugerindo assim a possibilidade de execução da soldagem com penetração total. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIn {{this manuscript}} is presented a methodology {{to realize the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>union</b> by the welding process with the deposition of the root pass. In the butt welding execution external without open root, {{the height of the}} root face is a key factor for getting full penetration. Sometimes, copper-joints are used to prevent leaks. Though, copper can cause inclusions and corrosion, producing many troubles during the installation and generating large costs in the work area. Therefore, it was performed a penetration effect analysis using the slanted nose phase, method in root pass welding without the use of copper-joint or root opening, for the following critical welding positions: flat, vertical and overhead. The analysis was performed using the welding process MIG/MAG by derivative short circuit, GMAW-CMT (Gas Metal Arc Welding – Cold Metal Transfer), with AWS ER 70 S- 6 wires (1. 2 mm) a with Ar+ 25 %CO 2, as shielding gas. The Central Composite Design (CCD) was used as a tool for a better organization of the tests, whereas to analyze the results it was made an optimization based on the Desirability theory for multiple responses, employing flat sheets of 1020 steel with a narrow-gap in U-shape. Then, this full penetration methodology in orbital welding turned down was validated in a ASTM 106 pipe through the conventional short-circuit welding process, with the joint established in the previous stages. The tests were performed with wires of 0. 9 and 1. 2 mm in order to evaluate the welding power. Macrography tests showed root pass with an acceptable visual appearance and without internal defects, thereby suggesting the possibility of welding execution with full penetration...|$|E

Height corrector, brake master valve and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail even after excessively high mileages but the rubber components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.|$|R

50|$|The first {{reference}} to the instrument in Ireland is provided by John O'Keefe in (1760) {{as an instrument of}} polite society and the emerging 'Pastoral' and prototype <b>Union</b> <b>pipe</b> influenced the folk tradition of the 18th and 19th century in Scotland and Ireland. This {{can be thought of as}} a shared tradition which served a Neo-baroque orchestral and concert fashion but also drew strongly on the ‘native traditions’ of both Scotland and Ireland and the music styles of the times.The pastoral pipes can be played either standing or in a seated position using a set of bellows, and the chanter is similar to the later <b>Union</b> <b>pipes,</b> but it had an added foot joint that extended its range one tone lower. This added foot joint had holes in its sides in addition to the hole at the bottom of the bore. The pastoral pipes are like the Highland pipes in that the sound is continuous; notes are articulated by finger techniques such as gracenotes. The <b>Union</b> <b>pipes,</b> which evolved from the pastoral pipes, enable the player to interrupt the flow of air by stopping the end of the chanter on his knee; this doesn't work for the Pastoral instrument because of the side tone holes. Many later Pastoral sets, though, have a dismountable foot joint; when this is removed they can be played as <b>union</b> <b>pipes.</b> The surviving instruments indicate that the Pastoral pipes had two or three drones and generally one regulator.|$|R
5000|$|The term “New bagpipe” {{refers to}} the {{expanded}} compass and improvements to the instrument. Although the term Pastoral is not historically found outside Geoghegan's London context, it is evocative of a style of music played at the time. Originally the label “Pastoral” may refer to the “ancient Pastoral airs" [...] played on the instrument composed in a [...] "gentle, very sweet, easy manner in the immolation of those airs which Shepard’s are supposed to play" [...] This style would suit the sweet tone of the Pastoral pipes Union/Uilleann pipes of the late 18th century, when literature, art and music romanticized rural life. In the 19th century oboes were being marketed in London as “Pastoral” to fit the music styles of the times. The pastoral bagpipe {{may have been the}} invention of an expert instrument maker who was aiming at the Romantic market. The Pastoral <b>pipes</b> and later <b>Union</b> <b>pipes</b> were certainly a favourite of the upper classes in Scotland, Ireland and the North-East of England and were fashionable for a time in formal social settings, where the term <b>Union</b> <b>pipes</b> may originate.|$|R
50|$|Robertson crafted {{instruments}} were popular {{especially with the}} gentleman set and crafted the Edinburgh Great Highland prize pipe of 1802 as well as prize pipes for the Highland Society of London between the 1780s -1820s. The Highland Society of London regularly set up piping competitions and commissioned pipes as prizes from Robertson {{that were used in}} annual pageants of Highland culture at the Theatre Royal in Edinburgh. Recognized for his skill and development of the pastoral and <b>union</b> <b>pipes,</b> Roberson was presented a set of <b>union</b> <b>pipes</b> from the Duchess of Northumberland belonging to the famous and somewhat infamous Newcastle upon Tyne piper Jamie Allen.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Reid {{was also}} active in making Union Pipes; the {{precursor}} to modern Uilleann pipes. [...] Henry Clough (I) {{was known to}} play a Reid set of <b>Union</b> <b>pipes</b> including regulators; surviving parts of this set are now in private hands.|$|R
5000|$|Ever the innovator, {{he was not}} {{restricted}} to the sole use of hardwoods alone, and experimented in ivory sets of bass, baritone and tenor drones in an ivory common stock with characteristic [...] "lotus-top" [...] style of tuning. Many of the surviving Robertson pastoral and <b>union</b> <b>pipe</b> sets displayed a U-bend in the bass drone; that bends back into the stock of the instrument, to reduce the length and stretch to tune the bass drone. Other modifications of Scottish-made <b>Union</b> <b>pipes</b> of this period, included {{the addition of a}} third drone and model the drone stock into a separate chamber for the drone and regulator reeds, instruments of this period regularly attached the regulators above the stock. Robertson attached the regulators {{to the front of the}} stock to achieve a better balance or greater volume with double regulator reeds and the drones. Pastoral sets with one or two regulators are common in Roberstson’s sets as well as keyed Pastoral and shortened union chanters. Such developments were driven by experimentation as musical styles changed, diversifying the instruments by the maker or the particular tastes of the customer. Leading as musical instruments advanced from an open pastoral bagpipe chanter, to a staccato or closed <b>union</b> <b>pipe</b> in the mid-18th century. Robertson was one of the contemporary innovators of the pastoral and <b>union</b> <b>pipes,</b> as with other instrument makers in the mid-18 to 19th centuries across Scotland, England and Ireland. Makers would regularly exchange ideas, innovations and knowledge in the development of these pipes well into the 19th century, as well as their own unique styling and craftsmanship and sophisticated development of the instrument.|$|R
50|$|If {{frequent}} disconnection will be required, gasketed <b>pipe</b> flanges or <b>union</b> fittings {{provide better}} reliability than threads.

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a vertical cylindrical drum, heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most active region for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual <b>pipe</b> <b>unions</b> through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual scaling hammer. This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus for scale or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by thermal shock, by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid heating coils flexed continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|R
5000|$|Uilleann is the genitive of the Irish word uillinn, meaning elbow, emphasising {{the use of}} {{the elbow}} when playing the uilleann pipes. The Irish word for uilleann pipes is píobaí uilleann which {{literally}} means pipes of the elbow. However, the first attested written form is [...] "Union pipes", {{at the end of the}} 18th century, perhaps to denote the union of the chanter, drones, and regulators. Another theory is that it was played throughout a prototypical full union of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. This was only realised, however, in 1800, with the Act of Union; the name for the bagpipe slightly predates this.

5000|$|This bagpipe was {{commonly}} {{played in}} the Lowlands of Scotland, the Borders, and Ireland from the mid-18th until the early 20th century. It was a precursor of what are now known as Uilleann pipes, and there were several well-known makers over a large geographic area, including London, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dublin, and Newcastle upon Tyne. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} say which country the pastoral pipe and its later adapted <b>Union</b> <b>Pipe</b> specifically come from although the earliest known piping tunebook - [...] "Geoghegan's Compleat Tutor" [...] - refers to a maker in London in 1746. As the pastoral pipe was modified it developed into the <b>Union</b> <b>pipe</b> in the period 1770-1830, makers in all three countries contributed ideas and design improvements[...] Both pipes were played by gentlemen pipers of the period in Scotland, England and the Anglo-Irish Protestants in Ireland, people in society who could afford an expensive hand made set of pipes.|$|R
5000|$|From his {{biography}} {{we know that}} he was also a respected player of the <b>Union</b> <b>Pipes.</b> The engraving above shows him playing this instrument. One detail apparent from this, is that the drones were not tuned solely in octaves like the modern instrument, but there were two drones in octaves, and another intermediate drone a fourth or fifth above the bass drone. This corresponds to the drone pattern of earlier [...] "Pastoral pipes", and there are surviving sets of <b>Union</b> <b>pipes</b> in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum by Robert Reid, with such drones. There seem to be two regulators, in contrast to modern Irish sets which have three, but he is playing with the chanter stopped on the knee, as with the modern instrument, so these are not Pastoral pipes. He visited Bedlington, where he played the closing part of an entertainment at the Northumbrian piper and fiddler Thomas Hair's public house, the Blue Bell. This was relatively early in his career, after 1815 but before 1818. It is stated that Billy was made very welcome there, and that Hair [...] "was much taken with my <b>Union</b> <b>pipes</b> and my manner of playing them", so it seems he was well respected as both a musician and an entertainer. Purvis says he spent 'many a happy night' there, so he must have been a regular visitor. He was welcome too; Hair gave him the best room free, which he would not normally let out to anyone. Purvis's act became very popular, so he would have brought a good, and no doubt thirsty, crowd to The Blue Bell.|$|R

Tom later moved to Newsham, being hired as a sinker in 1849, working on the Cowpen 'C', or 'Isabella' pit which was begun in October 1848. A sinker was a specialist in the sinking and lining of new pit shafts, a skilled and dangerous trade, and relatively well paid. He gave his occupation, more generically, as 'pitman' when he married in 1850. His wife, Jane Brown, was the daughter of Jane Frost, the landlady of The Willow Tree, then the only public house in Newsham.
