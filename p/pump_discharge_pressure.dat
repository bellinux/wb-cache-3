50|$|Discharge {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes {{the majority of the}} fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a venturi), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Effect of fine {{graphite}} flake, carbon nanotube, {{and carbon}} nanofiber additives on {{the efficiency of}} an external gear pump driving an ethanol-based closed hydraulic loop was investigated experimentally. A number of graphite, carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) dispersions in ethanol were prepared with concentrations ranging from 194 - 1500 ppm. The fluids were investigated in an external gear pump with a maximum operating pressure of 100 psi. Pump inlet pressure, volumetric flow rate, and electric power consumption data were recorded over a range of <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressures.</b> The power consumed by the motor at a given differential pump pressure was found to remain approximately constant for all additive concentrations. It was found that increases in both volumetric flow rate and overall pump efficiency were observed when pure ethanol {{was replaced by the}} colloidal suspensions. This was attributed to a roller bearing effect caused by the alignment and self-lubrication of the colloidal additives when confined to micro-scale clearances between the gear surfaces. It was found that that pump performance was also a function on the CNT aspect ratio and could very from pump to pump, or even after a pump was disassembled and reassembled. This indicates that the clearance geometry between the gears and between the housing may play a critical role. To examine any potential structural changes in the additives, environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) images of the additives were obtained before and after extended run periods within the pump. The results indicate that graphite and CNTs retained significant resilience, i. e. no breakage and deformation was observed. However, the very long aspect ratio CNFs appear to have undergone some scission. To examine any issues with filterability, iii graphite and CNT suspensions were run through two filters of different size and composition and the filters where then qualitatively examined using ESEM images.

The hydraulic actuation systems used in tilting trains operate at constant pressure, which is established to allow operation against the maximum loads at minimum ambient temperatures. However, these conditions occur seldom and unnecessary power is dissipated as heat under normal operating conditions that normally occur {{for more than}} 95 % of the service time. A research activity was performed to define a variable pressure system adapting the discharge pressure {{as a function of}} the outside temperature and of the force to be developed by the actuators. In this system, the variable pressure is established as a function of an appropriate control strategy in order to minimize the power losses while keeping the required dynamic performance. This system architecture provides a large power saving; a reduction between 25 and 50 % power is obtained depending on the severity of the track and on the operating conditions.

The experimental investigation was undertaken to obtain data for modelling the flow of dense phase fly ash slurries. Tests were conducted using fly ashes from different power stations in a purposely built test facility. The test facility contained 50 mm and 80 mm bore internal pipeline viscometers in series. Slurry <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure,</b> differential pressure over 5 meters of a 80 mm pipe section, differential pressure over 5 meters of a 50 mm of pipe section, slurry temperature, slurry volumetric and mass flowrates were measured.

40|$|AbstractA dynamic {{simulation}} model of an injection riser/pipeline/well for injection of shipped liquefied CO 2 {{was set up}} using the multiphase flow simulator OLGA. Furthermore, the topside offloading process was modelled using HYSYS. The models were applied for case studies using parameters from the existing Sn∅hvit and Sleipner CO 2 injection wells and reservoirs. The study quantified effects related to flow capacity (pump/compressor requirements and line sizing of the riser, pipeline and well), freezing, hydrate formation, phase change and heat transfer in the offloading and injection system. With an available injection <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> of about 120 bar, the injection capacities were predicted to about 275 kg/s on Sn∅hvit and 400 kg/s on Sleipner when assuming 7 ” ID tubing size in the well and 700 m flowline length. In the base case scenario with a 700 m buried pipeline and injection temperature of - 53 °C (this storage temperature on the ship, at a pressure of 7 - 8 bar had been selected for optimum transport capacity) {{there is a high}} risk of unwanted hydrate formation and freezing in the formation and on the outer surface of the riser and pipeline. The bottomhole temperatures were predicted as low as - 38 and - 46 °C on Sn∅hvit and Sleipner respectively when injecting at pump design rate, far beneath expected hydrate and freezing temperature of 10 - 12 °C and - 1. 9 °C (in salt water) respectively. Thus heating, either by topside heat exchangers and/or by utilizing the warmer sea water (5 °C) via a longer injection pipeline is required to avoid problems. An alternative storage condition at - 20 °C and 20 bar was proposed and simulated to reduce energy requirements due to heating and pressurization at the ship.

40|$|The {{ratio of}} rocket engine thrust to weight is a {{limiting}} constraint in placing more payload into orbit {{at a low}} cost. A key component of an engine's overall weight is the turbopump weight, Reducing the turbopump weight can result in significant engine weight reduction and hence, increased delivered payload. There are two main types of pumps: centrifugal and axial pumps. These types of pumps can be further sub-divided into those with shrouds and those without shrouds (unshrouded pumps). Centrifugal pumps can achieve the same <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> as an axial pump and it requires fewer pump stages and lower pump weight than an axial pump. Also, with unshrouded centrifugal pumps (impeller), the number of stages and weight can be further reduced. However. there are several issues with regard to using an unshrouded impeller: 1) there is a pump performance penalty due to the front open face recirculation flow; 2) {{there is a potential}} pump axial thrust problem from the unbalanced front open face and the back shroud face; and, 3) since test data is very linu'ted for this configuration, there is uncertainty in the magnitude and phase of the rotordynamics forces due to the front impeller passage. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the design of an unshrouded impeller and to examine the design's hydrodynamic performance, axial thrust, and rotordynamics performance. The design methodology will also be discussed. This work will help provide some guidelines for unshrouded impeller design. In particular, the paper will discuss the design of three unshrouded impellers - one with 5 full and 5 partial blades (5 + 5). one with 6 + 6 blades and one with 8 + 8 blades. One of these designs will be selected for actual fabrication and flow test. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to help design and optimize the unshrouded impeller. The relative pump performance penalty is assessed by comparing the CFD results of the unshrouded impeller with the equivalent shrouded impeller for a particular design. Limited unshrouded - versus - shrouded impeller data from the J- 2 pump is used to anchor the CFD. Since no detailed impeller blade force data is available, axial thrust and rotordynamic force predictions are based on the CFD model. For the axial thrust, the impeller front flow passage axial force is integrated from the CFD results and compared to the equivalent shrouded impeller axial force. For the rotordynamics forces, the fluid reaction forces are computed from unsteady flow CFD results using a moving boundary method; the rotor- shaft is moved at several whirl-to-speed frequency ratios to extract the rotordynamics coefficients...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} {{to develop a}} bench scale test facility, using a mixer, transfer pump, and transfer line to determine the impact of conveying the grout through the transfer lines to the vault on grout properties. Bench scale testing focused on the effect the transfer line has on the rheological property of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Rheological and other physical properties of grout samples were obtained prior to and after pumping through a transfer line. The Bench Scale Mixing Rig (BSMR) consisted of two mixing tanks, grout feed tank, transfer pump and transfer hose. The mixing tanks were used to batch the grout which was then transferred into the grout feed tank. The contents of the feed tank were then pumped through the transfer line (hose) using a progressive cavity pump. The grout flow rate and <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> were monitored. Four sampling stations were located {{along the length of}} the transfer line at the 5, 105 and 205 feet past the transfer pump and at 305 feet, the discharge of the hose. Scaling between the full scale piping at Saltstone to bench scale testing at SRNL was performed by maintaining the same shear rate and total shear at the wall of the transfer line. The results of scaling down resulted in a shorter transfer line, a lower average velocity, the same transfer time and similar pressure drops. The condition of flow in the bench scale transfer line is laminar. The flow in the full scale pipe is in the transition region, but is more laminar than turbulent. The resulting plug in laminar flow in the bench scale results in a region of no-mixing. Hence mixing, or shearing, at the bench scale should be less than that observed in the full scale, where this plug is non existent due to the turbulent flow. The bench scale tests should be considered to be conservative due to the highly laminar condition of flow that exists. Two BSMR runs were performed. In both cases, wall shearing was shown to reduce the rheological properties of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Samples taken at the static feed tank showed that gelling impacted the rheological properties of the grout before it was fed into the pump and transfer line. A comparison of the rheological properties of samples taken at the feed tank and transfer line discharge indicated shearing of the grout was occurring in the transfer line. Bench scale testing of different mixing methods with three different salt solutions showed that method of mixing influences the rheological properties of the grouts. The paddle blade mixing method of the salt solution used for the BMSR testing provided comparable rheological properties of the grout prepared in the BMSR after 14 minutes of processing, B 3. The paddle blade mixing method can be used to represent BMSR results and mixing time can be adjusted to represent larger scale mixing...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the output}} {{pressure}} of a centrifugal pump {{varies with the}} square of the speed, pressure can be controlled accurately by controlling the speed of the pump. For example: a pump runs at 1785 RPM during shutoff with an output pressure of 204 PSI and a suction pressure of 0 PSI. If the speed of the motor is reduced by 10% to 1607 RPM, the new output pressure becomes 165 PSI. This in turn enables the Variable Speed Controller to maintain a perfectly flat <b>pump</b> <b>discharge</b> curve until the full rating of the pump is reached. Further, the variable speed controller adjusts for varying suction pressure - as in the following example: a city water supply of 65 PSI drops to 26 PSI while flowing. The variable speed drive will speed up to adjust for the sudden drop in pressure and slow down again when it is not needed - all the while maintaining a constant total <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R

In addition, the tap-water flowrate has a negligible influence on the maximum heating capacity while increasing the water-source temperature can greatly enhance the heating capacity...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{metering}} pumps are piston-driven. Piston pumps are positive displacement pumps {{which can be}} designed to pump at practically constant flow rates (averaged over time) against {{a wide range of}} <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure,</b> including high <b>discharge</b> <b>pressures</b> of thousands of psi.|$|R
50|$|<b>Discharge</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> (also called {{high side}} pressure or head pressure) is the pressure generated on the output {{side of a}} gas compressor in a refrigeration or air conditioning system. The <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> is affected by several factors: size and speed of the condenser fan, condition and cleanliness of the condenser coil, {{and the size of}} the discharge line. An extremely high <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> coupled with an extremely low suction pressure is an indicator of a refrigerant restriction.|$|R
