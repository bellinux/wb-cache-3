40|$|Biodegradation {{tests with}} {{bacteria}} from activated sludge revealed the probable persistence of cyano-based ionic liquid anions when these leave {{waste water treatment}} plants. A possible biological treatment using bacteria capable of biodegrading similar compounds, namely cyanide and cyano-complexes, was therefore examined. With these bacteria from the genera Cupriavidus, the ionic liquid anions B(CN) 4 -, C(CN) 3 -, N(CN) 2 - combined with alkaline cations were tested in different growth media using ion chromatography for the examination of their <b>primary</b> <b>biodegradability.</b> However, no enhanced biodegradability of the tested cyano-based ionic liquids was observed. Therefore, an in vitro enzymatic hydrolysis test was additionally run showing that all tested ionic liquid (IL) anions can be hydrolysed to their corresponding amides by nitrile hydratase, but not by nitrilase under the experimental conditions. The biological stability of the cyano-based anions is an advantage in technological application, but the occurrence of enzymes {{that are able to}} hydrolyse the parent compound gives a new perspective on future cyano-based IL anion treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{biodegradation}} {{of alcohol}} ethoxylates (AE) and alkylphenol ethoxylates (APE) is reviewed. Biodegradation test methods, ranging from laboratory tests to full-scale waste treatment plant studies are described for these surfactants. A comparison is made between <b>primary</b> and ultimate <b>biodegradability</b> criteria and the liminations {{of the various}} analytical methods used in these determinations are discussed. The most recently published data suggest sewage bacteria degrade AE by a mechanism which {{is different from that}} by which APE degrades. The use of radiolabeled surfactants to elicit more detailed information about the biodegradation mechanism of AE is described. The role of biodegradation on the impact of surfactants released to the environment is assessed, and future environmental concerns for nonionics are considered...|$|R
40|$|The <b>primary</b> and {{ultimate}} <b>biodegradability</b> of phthalic acid, monobutyl phthalate, and five structurally diverse {{phthalic acid ester}} plasticizers in river water and activated sludge samples were determined via ultraviolet spectrophotometry, gas chromatography, and CO 2 evolution. The compounds studied underwent rapid primary biodegradation in both unacclimated river water and acclimated activated sludge. When activated sludge acclimated to phthalic acid esters {{was used as the}} inoculum for the CO 2 evolution procedure, greater than 85 % of the total theoretical CO 2 was evolved. These studies demonstrate that the phthalic acid ester plasticizers and intermediate degradation products readily undergo ultimate degradation in different mixed microbial systems at concentrations ranging from 1 to 83 mg/liter...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to demonstrate that municipal and industrial wastewater sludges could be used as a sole raw material to sustain growth of rhizobia. Growth of two different groups of rhizobium (fast growing: Sinorhizobium meliloti, Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae; and slow growing: Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium elkanii) was tested on primary, secondary and mixed sludges obtained from different wastewater treatment plants. The results obtained in Erlenmeyer flasks indicated that slow- and fast-growing rhizobia grew well in sludge. Generally, the number of cells of rhizo-bia exceeds 1 × 109 cfu/mL in 72 h. The composition of sludges varies with the sludge type and origin. The sludge composition affected the generation time, cell yield and nodulation index. Higher solids concentration tended to give higher generation time. The high sludge metals concentration did not affect the growth kinetics of rhizobia. However, primary sludge could inhibit cell growth. Acid, alkaline and oxidative pre-treatments increased the <b>primary</b> sludge <b>biodegradability</b> and consequently the cell count of S. meliloti. Pre-treatment of pulp and paper sludge with NaOH enhanced the bacterial cell concentration to a maximum 1 × 1010 cfu/mL. Sludge pre-treatment decreased the generation time and reduced the process time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{study focused}} on {{evaluating}} the toxi-city as well as <b>primary</b> and ultimate <b>biodegradability</b> of morpholinium herbicidal ionic liquids (HILs), which incorporated MCPA, MCPP, 2, 4 -D or Dicamba anions. The studied HILs were also subjected to determination of surface active properties {{in order to assess}} their influence on toxicity and biodegradability. The study was carried out with microbiota isolated from different environmental niches: sediments from river channel, garden soil, drainage trench collecting agricultural runoff stream, agricultural soil and municipal waste repository. The obtained results revealed that resistance to toxicity and biodegradation efficiency of the micro-biota increased in the following order: microbiota from the waste repository[microbiota from agricultural soil & microbiota from an agricultural runoff stream[microbiota from garden soil[microbiota from the river sludge. It was observed that the toxicity of HILs increased with the hydrophobicity of the cation, however the influence of the anion was more notable. The highest toxicity was observed when MCPA was used as the anion (EC 50 values ranging from 60 to 190 mg L- 1). The results of ultimate biodegradation tests indicated that only HILs with 2, 4 -D as the anion were mineralized to some extent, with slightly higher values for HILs with the 4 -decyl- 4 -ethylmorpholinium cation (10 – 31 %) compared to HILs with the 4, 4 -didecylmorpholinium cation (9 – 20 %). Overall, the cations were more susceptible (41 – 94 %) to primary biodegradation compared to anions (0 – 61 %). The obtained results suggested that the surface active properties of the studied HILs may influence their toxicity and biodegradability by bacteria in different environmental niches...|$|R
