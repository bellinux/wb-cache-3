25|$|Four men manned {{this family}} station and were {{provided}} with quarters as follows: One 4 bedroom unit, three 3-bedroom units. Other buildings are the light tower, <b>paint</b> <b>locker,</b> fuel locker, bosun locker and buildings housing the fire pump, water pumps and JP-5 fueling pumps. The station had a ½-ton pickup truck assigned which, among other things, was utilized to transport dependent school children to school three miles (5km) from the station.|$|E
25|$|The ship got {{underway}} at 9:30am. As it {{was passing}} East 90th Street, a fire {{started in the}} Lamp Room in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. It was fueled by the straw, oily rags, and lamp oil strewn around the room. The first notice of a fire was at 10:00am; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a <b>paint</b> <b>locker</b> filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier, but was not believed.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} removal of {{artifacts}} by divers, little of value {{was thought to}} remain. Significant artifacts recovered include the statue of Genoese Admiral Andrea Doria, for whom the ship was named. It {{was removed from the}} first-class lounge, having been cut off at the ankles to accomplish this. Examples of the ship's china have long been considered valuable mementos of diving the wreck. The ship's bell is normally considered to be the prize of a wreck. This ship carried three bells: one bell located on the bridge, and two much larger ceremonial bells located on the fore and aft decks. The ship's stern bell was retrieved in the late 1980s by a team of divers led by Bill Nagle. On June 26, 2010, a diver from New Jersey, Carl Bayer, discovered the bridge bell lying on the bottom at 241feet. He recovered it with assistance from Ernie Rookey, also from New Jersey. The bell, measuring 16inches tall and weighing 73.5pounds, was possibly used to signal fog {{on the night of the}} collision. The forward bell remains undiscovered. It has for years been thought to be in the ship's <b>paint</b> <b>locker</b> where it was stored during ocean crossings, but recent reports indicate that that part of the ship has collapsed in on itself and the forward bell may never be found.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, a $4 {{million bond}} issue was passed to fund {{improvements}} to the {{middle school and high}} school facilities. The project saw the 1956 middle school building extensively renovated with new ceilings and lighting, floor tiles, <b>paint,</b> <b>lockers,</b> doors, cupboards, cabinets, marker boards, and bulletin boards. An addition was built that houses a new main office, principal's office, teacher workroom, and freight room. By renovating existing space, three additional classrooms and a conference room were added to the middle school.|$|R

25|$|As student {{enrollment}} continued to grow, another renovation project was planned {{to increase the}} capacity of the high school while updating the facilities to better meet students' needs. The two-year project began in 1995 and required the ninth grade students to remain in their respective middle schools another year. Students in grades 10-12 occupied half of the high school while the other half was being renovated. Staff and students then picked up and moved all books, furniture and equipment into the renovated half of the building in 1996, and construction began on the other half. The $30 million renovation project connected the former ninth grade building and the high school. New construction took place over the former parking tiers with a new cafeteria (seating capacity of 600), gymnasium (capacity of 2000), library/media center, and enclosed walkway. All classrooms were reconfigured with additional classrooms located in the former library and cafeteria. The familiar curving hallways remained, but new terrazzo floors, ceiling tiles, and freshly <b>painted</b> <b>lockers</b> were added. Along with updated lab facilities, technology was a huge part of the project, as over 500 computers were added throughout the building.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "very rare" [...] {{fog bell}} square {{pyramidal}} tower {{was built in}} 1896 {{in front of the}} tower. The structure and the striking mechanism are still in place.

5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{constructed}} with fire-resistant materials and also had enhanced fire-detecting and fire-extinguishing equipment installed for the time. A [...] "smoke-pipe" [...] fire-detecting system {{was installed in}} all cargo spaces, the <b>paint</b> <b>locker,</b> carpenter shop, dry storeroom and bosun's storerooms. A CO2 fire suppression system protected the cargo spaces, service spaces and machinery space in addition to standard fire fighting equipment.|$|E

50|$|The idea of shaping {{behaviours}} {{through the}} psychological effects of architecture {{is a very}} clever tool used in design. Often this element of control is harder to distinguish and can even be overlooked by the public. The most common example would be the use of particular colours to influence {{the mood of the}} user. For instance, pink is known to have a calming effect, and for this reason is often used within prison facilities to control the mood of the inmates. Similarly, stadiums have been known to <b>paint</b> the <b>locker</b> rooms of the opponents in shades of pink to keep players in a more passive and less energetic state. Users are often unaware of the psychological effects of the surrounding architecture, and for this reason, are often very successful at shaping user behaviours.|$|R
50|$|Still {{recovering}} from the loss to the Bears and without Shaun Alexander and WR Bobby Engram, the Hawks were ineffective {{for much of the}} first half. Trailing 21-7, Mike Holmgren blistered the <b>paint</b> in the <b>locker</b> room and a different Hawks team took the field in the second half. Seattle scored 20 unanswered points to lead 27-21 and looked to have put the game away after a Lofa Tatupu interception late in the game. However, RB Maurice Morris fumbled on the Ram 7-yard line with 2:48 left. A few plays later Ram QB Marc Bulger hit Torry Holt with a 67-yard TD pass to give the Rams a 28-27 lead with 1:38 remaining.|$|R

50|$|On 11 February 1930, after docking and {{discharging}} {{passengers and}} most of her crew from a voyage from Bremen, Germany, a fire broke out in a <b>paint</b> <b>locker</b> which quickly spread to another storage hold; the massive fire and explosion resulting in a five-alarm fire with all fire equipment in New York City {{being sent to the}} burning ship. The fire could not be controlled and it sank next to the wharf where it had docked.|$|E
50|$|In The Penalty of Failure, Hornblower and {{his crew}} are still out at sea, between British and French ports. The captain of the {{recently}} sunk Marie Galante pleads with Hornblower to navigate to France and release him and his men, and promises safe passage for Hornblower {{and his crew}}. Hornblower promptly rejects the Captain's pleading {{in spite of their}} bleak situation and uses his pistols to prevent a mutiny. Not long afterwards, Hornblower and his crew are caught by a privateer named Pique which was converted from a slave ship. This ship is commanded by Captain Neuville. Hornblower is now a prisoner of war, but Indefatigable falls in with them and makes chase. As Pique is the faster sailer, Hornblower devises a plan to slow her down: he sets a fire, which soon spreads to the very flammable <b>paint</b> <b>locker.</b> All hands are diverted to fighting the fire, which soon breaks out on the deck and spreads to the rigging, immediately slowing the vessel. The British ship ultimately overpowers Pique, extinguishes the fire and Captain Neuville and his crew surrender. Hornblower's fears of reprimand for losing Marie Galante are quickly extinguished by the offhanded dismissal of the incident by Captain Pellew. However, instead of taking credit for the fire, Hornblower claims there was a spontaneous combustion in the <b>paint</b> <b>locker,</b> as way of punishing himself for losing Marie Galante in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{he proved}} {{competent}} in the role, creative differences between Winters' traditional booking style and Gordon's more radical approach {{led to his}} eventual replacement by Eddie Gilbert, who had the necessary contacts and experience needed by the young promotion. In a 2003 shoot interview, Gordon claimed he was upset with a racial-based angle which occurred during the main event of ECW's first show at Philadelphia's Original Sports Bar. Winters and Johnny Hotbody fought DC Drake & JT Smith to a double disqualification. Originally, {{they were supposed to}} spraypaint JT Smith white and DC Drake black. Instead, the two left the black <b>paint</b> in the <b>locker</b> room and only painted Smith white. Upset that he was [...] "worked by the boys", Gordon took over as booker until bringing in Eddie Gilbert later that year.|$|R

50|$|About {{this time}} five {{twin-engine}} land-based bombers and three additional four-engine patrol bombers were sighted. The five bombers made a {{pass over the}} ship, but did not release any bombs until they had circled again. On the rerun they dropped a stick of bombs. One hit directly {{on the top of}} the mainmast, and three others hit just off the port bow. Pieces of shrapnel cut all the mainmast stays to the boat booms, injuring most of the gun crew there. The near misses off the port bow set the <b>paint</b> <b>locker</b> in the forward storeroom on fire, damaged the port 3-inch gun, killed one of the lookouts, and injured all the gun crew on the port 3-inch gun and the gun crews on the port machine guns.|$|E
50|$|An Installation Restoration (IR) {{project is}} {{underway}} {{at the base}} to clean up environmental hazards and restore damaged areas. Working with a Restoration Advisory Board made up of representatives from the surrounding community, a total of 73 sites needing attention were identified. Studies of the recommended sites were done and 46 {{were found to have}} no contamination and required no intervention. Five facilities were permitted and are still in use and were removed from the IR program. Responsibility for two underground tanks was transferred to other agencies with expertise in such tanks. Seven sites have had the cleanup process completed with 13 other sites in the process of analysis or cleanup as of September 2005. The remaining 13 sites range from the station landfill to a <b>paint</b> <b>locker</b> to an explosives burning ground.|$|E

50|$|Point Reyes Light Station was {{established}} in 1870 at Point Reyes, Calif., 19 mi from the nearest town of Inverness. It is a family station with a complement of four men who maintain a first order light, fog signal and radio beacon. The light tower itself is a sixteen-sided structure of forged iron plate (the original tower) bolted to solid rock. The top of the lantern is 37 feet (11 m) above the ground and focal plane of the light is 294 ft above sea level. To reach the light, men assigned must descend 308 steps on the headland from the plateau above the station where the family quarters are situated. The quarters are new, two-story, four-family units (four-plex) built in 1960. The four-plex contains two 2-bedroom and two 3-bedroom units. Buildings maintained on the property, {{in addition to the}} family quarters, are the fog signal building, engine room, pump house, <b>paint</b> <b>locker,</b> double garage and a four-car carport with adjoining office and workshop.Point Reyes is, by official records, the windiest and foggiest on the Pacific Coast. The station is frequently blanketed by week-long periods of fog and few years pass that do not see violent gales of 75 to 100 mph strike the area. Point Reyes Light Station is one of the District’s outstanding tourist attractions. On fair summer weekends we often have several hundred visitors logged aboard. Escorting visitors has become a major portion of the duties of men assigned. Dependent children on the station travel three miles (five kilometers) by station vehicle to school. Commissary and post exchange privileges are available at Hamilton Air Force Base (the nearest armed forces installation), or in the San Francisco area.|$|E
