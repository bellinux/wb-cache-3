After publishing the results, he planned to convene a conference of experts in the field in an attempt to get them behind his design. The first step in that plan was to design and build two more small scale designs (WB-7 and WB-8) to determine which full scale machine would be best. He wrote [...] "The only small scale machine work remaining, which can yet give further improvements in performance, is test of one or two WB-6-scale devices but with [...] "square" [...] or polygonal coils aligned approximately (but slightly offset on the main faces) along the edges of the vertices of the polyhedron. If this is built around a truncated dodecahedron, near-optimum performance is expected; about 3–5 times better than WB-6." [...] Bussard died on October 6, 2007 from multiple myeloma at age 79.|$|E
2500|$|Official synopsis: [...] "After one of {{his friends}} is killed in Iraq, Geoffrey Waters prays for help in {{understanding}} God's purpose for humanity. He is whisked forward in time to witness what a world could be like when the prophesies from Isaiah bring about peace on earth, and the lines 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' come to fruition. The <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> he visits explain that God's kingdom will be established on Earth no matter what, even if a horrible calamity must occur." [...] The Bahá'í author notes that this book is her impression of what the future may be like based on the premise of fulfilled Biblical prophecy, with specifics from Bahá'í sources. There are several quotes and paraphrases from the Bahá'í Writings as well as examples of attitudes among various characters that believe as guided by these references, and the book was approved by the Special Materials Review Committee. Directly it only refers to the Bahá'í Faith as one of many religions mentioned in the foreword (which also mentions that it is meant to be the first of a trilogy.) Internally the strongest reference perhaps {{is the name of the}} Book of the religion of the future - [...] "Qadas", which is similar to [...] "Aqdas" [...] - the central Book of Laws, of the Bahá'í Faith. However [...] "Qadas" [...] could also be rather more obscure references ("the holiness of God", or a Muslim style of prayer for example.) The overall feel of the story is much like Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time - of grand themes being played out not through technological achievements, but of spiritual beings and achievements. Ralya has also published children’s stories, two full-length musicals, a weekly newspaper column in a Minnesota paper for about 2 years, and a novel for 9- to 15-year-olds which also has significant reference to the Bahá'í Faith.|$|E
40|$|Humans learn through {{interaction}} with their environment. The most important {{components of the}} environment for learning are other humans and their artefacts. Historically learning {{has been seen as}} acquiring knowledge and storing it away for future use. However, more recent views have suggested that learning is more about making connections and that, in a world where information is constantly changing and increasing, capacity to learn through making and using connections to other people may be more important than what we actually know. Where once our social connections, and access to learning, were limited by capacity to travel for direct contact or by the speed with which correspondence could be exchanged, modern information and communication technology enables essentially instant communication with <b>people</b> anywhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> This chapter explores some implications of these changes for how educators approach the facilitation of learning in an age of global information networks. ...|$|R
