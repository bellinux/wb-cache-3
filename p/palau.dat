5|$|Palau's {{interaction}} with Japan was {{kept to a}} minimal level during the post-war years, although Okinawan fishermen occasionally visited <b>Palau</b> for catches from the 1960s onwards. A few Japanese nationals resettled in <b>Palau</b> in the 1970s, and married local Palauans. In the 1980s, Japanese businessmen set up businesses in <b>Palau,</b> and by 1995 there were 218 Japanese nationals residing in <b>Palau.</b> Of these, {{about half of them}} expressed a desire for permanent residency in <b>Palau</b> and a few married Palauan or Filipino women. However, the majority brought their families from Japan along, and maintained frequent contacts with Japan. Some settlers from the 1980s also consisted of former Japanese settlers who were repatriated back to Japan after World War II. Former settlers who returned to <b>Palau</b> usually consisted of individuals over 60 years of age, and often worked as tour guides or restaurateurs in <b>Palau.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} account of Japanese contact in <b>Palau</b> occurred in 1820, when a coastal sailing ship was blown off course and eight surviving men {{spent five years}} in <b>Palau</b> until 1825. Japanese traders began to establish settlements from the mid-19th century onwards, and by 1890 two Japanese trading stations had been established. Many of these traders married the daughters of local chieftains and raised local families. When Japan annexed <b>Palau</b> from Germany in 1914, Japanese settlers and their descendants acted as state liaison officials and interpreters for the Japanese military administration.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a small}} Japanese {{community}} in <b>Palau,</b> which mainly consists of Japanese expatriates residing in <b>Palau</b> over a long-term basis. A few Japanese expatriates started to reside in <b>Palau</b> after it gained independence in 1994, and established long-term businesses in the country. Japanese settlement in <b>Palau</b> {{dates back to the}} early 19th century, although large scale Japanese migration to <b>Palau</b> did not occur until the 1920s, when <b>Palau</b> came under Japanese rule and administered as part of the South Pacific Mandate. Japanese settlers took on leading administrative roles in the Japanese colonial government, and developed Palau's economy. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, virtually all of the Japanese population was repatriated back to Japan, although people of mixed Japanese-Palauan descent were allowed to remain behind. People of Japanese-Palauan descent constitute a large minority of Palau's population as a result of substantial intermarrriage between the Japanese settlers and Palauans. They generally identify with, conforming to cultural norms and daily lives with the Palauans.|$|E
5|$|By December12, <b>Palau</b> {{received}} a US$100,000 grant from USAID and US$25,000 from the Bank of Guam for relief efforts. On December13, the Government of Japan offered ¥5million (US$60,000) worth of emergency goods, such as jerry cans and water purifiers, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency. The following day, the Republic of Korea provided US$50,000 in humanitarian assistance to <b>Palau</b> through the local Red Cross.|$|E

Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s he worked in TTPI positions such as translator, public defender, counselor, administrative assistant, and district court judge. During the 1954-1955 academic year, he studied law and social welfare in the Philippines under a United Nations scholarship. On April 9, 1956, he succeeded his brother Toribiong Uchel as president of <b>Palau's</b> local legislature Olbiil era Kelulau era Belau (<b>Palau's</b> House of Whispered Decisions). He worked from 1954 to 1962 to regain Ngerekebesang Island, which the TTPI had acquired from the Japanese government.|$|R

5|$|Two {{recently}} designed national flags {{resemble the}} Japanese flag. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it adopted a national flag {{that had a}} green background, charged with an off-centered red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh. The current flag, adopted in 1972, dropped the golden map and kept everything else. The Government of Bangladesh officially calls the red disc a circle; the red color symbolizes the blood that was shed to create their country. The island nation of <b>Palau</b> uses a flag of similar design, but the color scheme is completely different. While the Government of <b>Palau</b> does not cite the Japanese flag as an influence on their national flag, Japan did administer <b>Palau</b> from 1914 until 1944. The flag of <b>Palau</b> is an off-centered golden-yellow full moon on a sky blue background. The moon stands for peace and a young nation while the blue background represents Palau's transition to self-government from 1981 to 1994, when it achieved full independence.|$|E

50|$|The weak {{defenses}} of the <b>Palaus</b> {{and the potential}} for airfield construction made them attractive targets for the Americans after the capture of the Marshall Islands, but a shortage of landing craft meant that operations against the <b>Palaus</b> could not begin until the Mariana Islands were secure.|$|R
5|$|When the Japanese {{surrendered}} in 1945, Japanese business {{enterprises and}} organisations in <b>Palau</b> closed, effectively ending the Japanese influence on Palau's economy. In {{the first two}} decades after the war, the American occupation government imposed strict trade restrictions with Japan. Contact with Japan was reestablished in the 1960s, starting with Okinawan fishermen who were granted fishing rights. Japanese tourists began to visit <b>Palau</b> in increasing numbers from the mid-1970s. The growing influx of tourists to <b>Palau</b> led to the restoration of heritage sites around <b>Palau,</b> particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the Japanese era as well as Palauan longhouses to accommodate {{to the interests of}} Japanese tourists, which accounted for half of all visiting tourists. Many of Palau's tourist sites were run and maintained by Palauan citizens of Japanese-Palauan heritage, whose knowledge in Japanese and Palauan customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of Japanese tourists.|$|E
5|$|About 2.4inches (61mm) of {{rain fell}} on Yap, while Koror in <b>Palau</b> {{reported}} a 24-hour total of 1.88inches (48mm) of rain through 6a.m. UTC on July 3. The peak wind gusts reported were 53knots (98km/h, 61mph) on Yap at the Weather Service Office (WSO) in Yap and 46knots (85km/h, 53mph) at the WSO in Koror. During its course through the islands, Tropical Storm Ewiniar also necessitated tropical storm warnings and watches for Ngulu, Yap, Koror and Kayangel. No deaths in Yap or <b>Palau</b> were reported due to Ewiniar.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Japanese settlers were repatriated back to Japan, {{and male}} Japanese settlers who had raised Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, reasoning that the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in <b>Palau</b> than in Japan. Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, while others were abandoned and adopted by Palauan families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated to Japan, but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to <b>Palau</b> after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along.|$|E

Electricity and water service in many areas was lost during the storm, and remained so for over {{a week in the}} hardest hit areas. Throughout <b>Palau,</b> 92homes were destroyed while 59others sustained severe damage. Total damage amounted to US$10.1million with repair costs estimated at US$15–20million. A state of emergency was declared on December5 while the <b>Palau</b> Red Cross Society assisted with recovery efforts. Palau's congress allocated US$10million for relief while international donors provided a collective US$235,000 in aid.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese-Palauans assumed key {{positions}} in the public service sector and politics. At least one ethnologist, Mark Peattie, suggested that the strong representation of Japanese-Palauans in leading positions in society {{could be attributed to}} the mainstream Japanese education which they had received in their youth. Palau's first president, Kuniwo Nakamura—who was half-Japanese—fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and <b>Palau</b> during his Presidency. During a state visit to Japan in 1996, Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura, and the visit was commended by Palauans and Japanese alike. Nakamura's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to <b>Palau</b> to facilitate repair work on the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge and securing special trade agreements with Japan.|$|E

5|$|State Shinto {{was heavily}} {{emphasised}} in the 1930s {{as a means}} to promote Japanese nationalism and acculturalisation of Palauans to Japanese norms. A few shrines were built around <b>Palau</b> during the 1930s. Of particular note was the completion of the Taisha Nanyo Jinja (transliterally the Great Southern Shrine) in November 1940 at Koror, which subsequently served as the central shrine in Micronesia. Civilian participation of Shinto rituals was heavily emphasised, which focused on Japanese cultural ideals and worship of the Japanese emperor. Shinto, Zen Buddhist and Tenrikyo missions were also encouraged to establish religious missions, and the first Buddhist temple in <b>Palau</b> was erected in 1926, mainly to cater to the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlers. Early Japanese settlers reportedly built small Shinto shrines in agricultural colonies before the civilian government actively encouraged religious missionary activities in <b>Palau.</b>|$|E
