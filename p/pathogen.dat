5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a <b>pathogen</b> breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the <b>pathogen.</b> This improved response is then retained after the <b>pathogen</b> has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this <b>pathogen</b> is encountered.|$|E

Using the adaptive dynamics methodology, we investigated the evolution of sibling <b>pathogens</b> in relation to host specialization for groups 1 to 3. In particular, we focused {{on the role of}} multiple host niches and a trade-off in infectivity of <b>pathogens</b> to these hosts on the evolutionary outcome.

40|$|The {{transmission}} route {{used by many}} bacterial <b>pathogens</b> of clinical importance includes a step outside the host; thereafter {{refer to as the}} non-clinical environment (NCE).

Thus, we recommend that researchers begin to use natural Drosophila <b>pathogens</b> to identify novel immune strategies that may have arisen through antagonistic coevolution with common natural <b>pathogens.</b> In this review, we address the benefits of using natural <b>pathogens</b> in research, describe the known natural <b>pathogens</b> of Drosophila, and discuss the future prospects for research on natural <b>pathogens</b> of Drosophila...|$|R
40|$|Veterinary {{diagnostic}} microbiology is {{a unique}} specialty within microbiology. Although isolation and identification techniques {{are similar to those}} used for human <b>pathogens,</b> many veterinary <b>pathogens</b> require unique cultivation or identification procedures. Commercial identification systems provide rapid, accurate identification of human <b>pathogens.</b> However, the accuracy of these systems with veterinary <b>pathogens</b> varies widely depending on the bacterial species and the host animal from which it was isolated. Increased numbers of veterinary strains or species in the data bases of the various systems would improve their accuracy. Current procedures and interpretive criteria used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of veterinary <b>pathogens</b> are based on guidelines used for human <b>pathogens.</b> The validity of these guidelines for use with veterinary <b>pathogens</b> has not been established.

5|$|The {{success of}} any <b>pathogen</b> {{depends on its}} ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, {{pathogens}} evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the <b>pathogen</b> to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of multi-host <b>pathogens</b> over their host range conditions their population dynamics and structure. Also, host co-infection by different <b>pathogens</b> may have important {{consequences for the}} evolution of hosts and <b>pathogens,</b> and hostpathogen co-evolution. Hence it is of interest to know if the {{distribution of}} <b>pathogens</b> over their host range is random, or if there are associations between hosts and <b>pathogens,</b> or between <b>pathogens</b> sharing a host. To analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by <b>pathogens,</b> and for the observed patterns of co-infection, and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations. Applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host-virus associations: most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts, respectively. Interestingly, the more host-selective viruses were the more prevalent ones, suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host <b>pathogens.</b> Analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts. The developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of <b>pathogens,</b> which will help to understand and model the population biology of multihost <b>pathogens...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fungi and Oomycetes {{are notorious}} plant <b>pathogens</b> and use similar {{strategies}} to infect plants. The majority of plants, however, is not infected by <b>pathogens</b> as they recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors that mediate PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), a basal defense response effective against potential <b>pathogens.</b> Successful <b>pathogens</b> secrete effectors to suppress PTI and alter host plant physiology. In turn, plants have evolved immune receptors that recognize effectors, resulting in effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI includes the hypersensitive response which is effective against biotrophic plant <b>pathogens</b> that require living cells to feed on. Other <b>pathogens</b> are hemi-biotrophic, which start infection as a biotroph, but after having colonized the host tissue can also feed on death tissue.

40|$|AbstractRationaleThe new acronym, PES <b>pathogens</b> (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), was {{recently}} proposed to identify drug-resistant <b>pathogens</b> associated with community-acquired pneumonia. ObjectivesTo evaluate {{the risk factors}} for antimicrobial-resistant <b>pathogens</b> in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia and to validate the role of PES <b>pathogens.</b> MethodsA retrospective analysis of a prospective observational study of immunocompetent patients with pneumonia between March 2009 and June 2015 was conducted. We clarified the risk factors for PES <b>pathogens.</b> ResultsOf the total 1559 patients, an etiological diagnosis was made in 705 (45. 2 %) patients. PES <b>pathogens</b> were identified in 51 (7. 2 %) patients, with 53 PES <b>pathogens</b> (P.  aeruginosa, 34; ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae, 6; and MRSA, 13). Patients with PES <b>pathogens</b> had tendencies toward initial treatment failure, readmission within 30 days, and a prolonged hospital stay. Using multivariate analysis, female sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1. 998, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 047 – 3. 810), admission within 90 days (AOR 2. 827, 95 % CI 1. 250 – 6. 397), poor performance status (AOR 2. 380, 95 % CI 1. 047 – 5. 413), and enteral feeding (AOR 5. 808, 95 % CI 1. 813 – 18. 613) were independent risk factors for infection with PES <b>pathogens.</b> The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the risk factors was 0. 66 (95 % CI 0. 577 – 0. 744). ConclusionsWe believe the definition of PES <b>pathogens</b> is an appropriate description of drug-resistant <b>pathogens</b> associated with pneumonia in immunocompetent patients. The frequency of PES <b>pathogens</b> is quite low. However, recognition is critical because they can cause refractory pneumonia and different antimicrobial treatment is required...|$|R
