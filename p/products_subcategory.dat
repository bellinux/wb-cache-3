40|$|The Healthy Kids Association (HKA) is a NSW-based not-for profit, non-government, health {{promotion}} organisation offering a product registration scheme to support NSW schools in identifying and selecting healthier foods and beverages to sell from their school canteen.   This report describes the key nutritional characteristics {{of food and}} beverage products registered with the HKA (formerly the New South Wales School Canteen Association). Nutrient content data {{were obtained from the}} product nutrition information panels for each product, within popular <b>product</b> <b>subcategories,</b> registered as of October 2009. The level of key nutrients (including saturated fat, sugar, calcium and fibre) was identified and analysed in relation to the nutrient criteria threshold levels for green and amber products specified by the HKA. The results indicated that for most <b>product</b> <b>subcategories,</b> the nutrient content of products clustered just below the nutrient criteria thresholds for total energy, saturated fat, sodium and sugar, while the nutrient content for the positive nutrients (calcium and fibre) frequently clustered just above the thresholds. In addition, small package sizes were found to be common among products classified as amber. The distribution of key nutrients around the criteria thresholds suggests that products are formulated with reference to these thresholds, although manufacturers may also achieved the nutrient thresholds through smaller portion sizes. The potential of nutrient thresholds as levers to influence the nutritional profile of foods needs further research and industry dialogue...|$|R

40|$|Super-premium {{beverages}} are a fast-emerging <b>product</b> <b>subcategory.</b> While often promoted for its nutritional properties, this subcategory {{does not}} conform to the definitions of 100 % juices and juice drinks used for providing dietary guidance to consumers. Therefore, {{it can be difficult}} for consumers to apply the recommendations from the dietary guidelines and existing research findings to the super-premium subcategory. In light of this context and the lack of existing research related to super-premium beverages, understanding the market and demand for this particular subcategory is timely and relevant. This study uses retail-level scanner data from 2007 - 2012 to analyze retail sales and pricing trends and demand for super-premium beverages as well as 100 % fruit juices, fruit drinks, and vegetable juices. Results from this research indicate that total sales of super-premium beverages more than doubled between 2007 and 2012, with approximately 16 % average annual growth, far outpacing the other subcategories included in the study. This high growth happened, despite the fact that these super-premium products have much higher prices compared to other juice and juice drink subcategories, reflecting consumers? willingness to pay for its differentiated characteristics. Demand estimation is conducted with the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) model of Banks, Blundell, and Lewbel (1997) and used to calculate elasticity values. Super-premium beverages were found to be considerably more responsive to changes in own price compared to other subcategories...|$|R

40|$|A {{brand name}} can be {{considered}} a mental category. Similarity-based categorization theory has been used to explain how consumers judge a new product {{as a member of a}} known brand, a process called brand extension evaluation. This study was an event-related potential study conducted in two experiments. The study found a two-stage categorization process reflected by the P 2 and N 400 components in brand extension evaluation. In experiment 1, a prime-probe paradigm was presented in a pair consisting of a brand name and a product name in three conditions, i. e., in-category extension, similar-category extension, and out-of-category extension.

40|$|Abstract Background Increased {{marketing}} of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods {{has been identified}} as a driver of the global obesity epidemic and a priority area for preventative efforts. Local and international research has focused on the unhealthiness of television advertising, with limited research into the growing outdoor advertising industry. This study aimed to examine the extent of food and beverage advertising on the Sydney metropolitan train network, and to assess the nutritional quality of advertised products against the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Methods All 178 train stations on the Sydney metropolitan train network were surveyed in summer and winter. A survey tool was developed to collect information for all advertisements on and immediately surrounding the train station. Information included product, brand, location and advertisement format. Advertisements were coded by nutrition category, <b>product</b> <b>subcategory</b> and size. Chi-square, ANOVA and ANCOVA tests were conducted to test for differences in the amount of food and beverage advertising by season and area socioeconomic status (SES). Results Of 6931 advertisements identified, 1915 (27. 6 %) were promoting a food or beverage. The majority of food and beverage advertisements were for unhealthy products; 84. 3 % were classified as discretionary, 8. 0 % core and 7. 6 % miscellaneous. Snack foods and sugar-sweetened beverages were the most frequently advertised products, regardless of season. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were the largest advertisers on the network, contributing 10. 9 % and 6. 5 % of total advertisements respectively. There was no difference in the mean number of food and beverage advertisements by area SES, but the proportion of advertising that was for discretionary foods was highest in low SES areas (41. 9 %, p <  0. 001). Conclusions The results indicate that, irrespective of season, food and beverage advertisements across the Sydney metropolitan train network are overwhelmingly for unhealthy (discretionary) products. The results of this study highlight the inadequacy of Australia’s voluntary self-regulatory system in protecting members of the public from exposure to unhealthy food advertising. Regulatory action by government, such as placing a cap on the amount of unhealthy food advertisements, or requiring a proportion of all advertising to be for the promotion of healthy foods, is required to address this issue...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a morphism between coloured nets. Our definition generalizes Petris definition for ordinary nets. A morphism of coloured nets maps the topological space of the underlying undirected net as well as the kernel and cokernel of the incidence map. The kernel are flows along the transition-bordered fibres of the morphism, the cokernel are classes of markings of the place-bordered fibres. The attachment of bindings, colours, flows and marking classes to a subnet is formalized by using concepts from sheaf theory. A coloured net is a sheaf-cosheaf pair over a Petri space and a morphism between coloured nets is a morphism between such pairs. Coloured nets and their morphisms form a category. We prove the existence of a <b>product</b> in the <b>subcategory</b> of sort-respecting morphisms. After introducing markings our concepts generalize to coloured Petri nets...|$|R
40|$|A {{classical}} {{tensor product}} A ⊗ B of complete lattices A and B, consisting of all down-sets in A × B that are join-closed in either coordinate, is isomorphic to the complete lattice Gal(A,B) of Galois maps from A to B, turning arbitrary joins into meets. We introduce more general kinds of tensor products for closure spaces and for posets. They have the expected universal property for bimorphisms (separately continuous maps or maps preserving restricted joins {{in the two}} components) into complete lattices. The appropriate ingredient for quantale constructions is here distributivity at the bottom, a generalization of pseudocomplementedness. We show that the truncated tensor product of a complete lattice B with itself becomes a quantale with {{the closure of the}} relation product as multiplication iff B is pseudocomplemented, and the tensor product has a unit element iff B is atomistic. The pseudocomplemented complete lattices form a semicategory in which the hom-set between two objects is their tensor <b>product.</b> The largest <b>subcategory</b> of that semicategory has as objects the atomic boolean complete lattices, which is equivalent to the category of sets and relations.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to propose}} models that capture the own effect of price {{promotions}} of virtue and vice products on sales and cross effects within the subcategory, between subcategories and between periods. The hypotheses assume that, due to reverse consumption self-control, {{the demand for}} vice products is more price-sensitive than demand for virtue products, but the demand for vice products is less price-sensitive between periods than demand for virtue products; furthermore, due {{to the degree of}} impulse-buying and to licensing, the demand sensitivity of the <b>products</b> of a <b>subcategory</b> and of those of other subcategories varies according to the type of promoted product (vice or virtue). Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is based on different econometrical models that estimate the total net effect of price promotions of virtue and vice products on sales. Findings: The results show a greater own effect for price promotions of vice products than for virtue products. However, the complementary sales effect between <b>subcategories</b> for virtue <b>products</b> facilitates greater expansion of the <b>subcategory</b> in virtue <b>products</b> than in vice products. Originality/value: Although price promotions of virtue products (light) and vice products (regular) have proliferated in recent years, researchers have only estimated their own sales effect. Alternatively, the paper contributes by considering own and cross effects.

This study aimed to assess and compare the contents of supermarket marketing circulars from a range of countries worldwide from an obesity prevention perspective. METHODS: The contents of supermarket circulars from major supermarket chains in 12 non-random countries were collected and analysed over an eight week period from July to September 2014 (n= 89 circulars with 12, 563 food products). Circulars were largely English language and from countries representing most continents. Food products in 25 sub-categories were categorised as discretionary or non-discretionary (core) food or drinks based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. The total number of <b>products</b> in each <b>subcategory</b> in the whole circular, and on front covers only, was calculated. RESULTS: Circulars from most countries advertised a high proportion of discretionary foods. The only exceptions were circulars from the Philippines (no discretionary foods) and India (11 % discretionary food). Circulars from six countries advertised more discretionary foods than core foods. Front covers tended to include a much greater proportion of healthy products than the circulars overall. CONCLUSIONS: Supermarket circulars in most of the countries examined include a high percentage of discretionary foods, and therefore promote unhealthy eating behaviours that contribute to the global obesity epidemic. A clear opportunity exists for supermarket circulars to promote rather than undermine healthy eating behaviours of populations. Governments need to ensure that supermarket marketing is included as part of broader efforts to restrict unhealthy food marketing...|$|R
40|$|Self-medication is {{a process}} through which the {{individual}} assumes {{a greater degree of}} responsibility for the management of a minor health problem, by acquiring a medicine that is accessible without the need to obtain a medical prescription. Access to health care is undergoing important changes in the European Union. In the presence of factors such as aging populations and economic constraints on health systems, greater emphasis to the efficient use of health resources has been given. Self-care, which comprises self-medication assumes, in this context, an important role by encouraging individuals to take greater responsibility for their own health and wellbeing, choose healthy life choices, consult the pharmacist when appropriate and to establish whether and when medical treatment should be sought. In order to promote the rational use of medicinal <b>products,</b> the <b>subcategory</b> of non-prescription medicinal products exclusively dispensed in pharmacies has gained expression in different European countries. As the name implies, this category includes medicines that, by their nature and given the framework of the condition for which they are intended, are considered safe for dispensing without the requirement of a prescription, possess some attribute that makes them elective for dispensing under the supervision of a health professional, in this case the pharmacist, in order to promote safety and efficiency in their use. The different Member States have advanced at different times with the implementation of this category of classification regarding the dispensing to the public of medicines. Portugal introduced in 2013 this category of medicines in its legal framework. If, on one hand, the big drivers for the classification of more medicines in categories non-prescription medicinal products and non-prescription medicinal products exclusively dispensed in pharmacies have been the greater empowerment of the patient regarding the management of his health and the reduction of expenditure on medicines by health systems, the rational and safe use of medicines has conditioned the progress in this area at European level. The reclassification of a medicine and / or the corresponding indication is associated with several benefits and risks, which affect not only the consumer, also having an impact on health professionals, doctors and pharmacists, insurance companies and institutions / state authorities. The need for the discussion of this issue in our country, with the participation of the different stakeholders involved: the regulatory authority, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry and patients should be emphasized...|$|R

30|$|The “preparation” {{category}} encompasses all use {{errors that}} can occur while setting up a device for an injection. This includes required checks on the device and liquid contained therein. For the “incorrect needle attachment” subcategory, two types of errors were defined. Six publications stated that users did not attach a needle to the auto-injection device (Stauder et al., 2014) or did not attach the needle correctly (Stauder et al., 2014; Fujioka et al., 2015; Lange et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011; Pfützner et al., 2012; Pfützner et al., 2010). With {{the exception of one}} publication (which reported that the needle was attached at the wrong angle (Lange et al., 2014)), no further information about these use errors was provided. The other error in this subcategory is related to the fact that users failed to hold the device in the required upright position during the needle attachment (Phillips et al., 2011). The “incorrect priming” subcategory refers to use errors related to checking for and removing air bubbles or performing a flow check. Four publications reported that users did not check for or remove an air bubble when present (Fujioka et al., 2015; Jeannerot et al., 2016; Lange et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011). One of those publications mentioned that participants did not set the device to the minimum dosage, as recommended for the priming process (Jeannerot et al., 2016). Another publication stated that the cartridge of the used device was not tapped before priming or that the needle was pointing downwards during priming (Lange et al., 2014). Furthermore, one publication reported that users primed the device twice (Stauder et al., 2014). In the latter study, participants had to perform several injections; the error was related to the fact that users unnecessarily primed the device again after the first injection. This publication also reported that users primed directly into the injection pad, rather than into a cup as recommended. With regard to the “incorrect device selection” subcategory, two publications mentioned that participants used the wrong device. In one study, participants had to pick up the correct auto-injector from a fridge containing several comparator product boxes (Fujioka et al., 2015). In the other study, participants used a training device instead of the real auto-injector (Raffa et al., 2017). The “failure to check device integrity” subcategory refers to cases in which users did not check whether the auto-injector was damaged (Schiff et al., 2016) or whether the tamper-evident seal was intact (Hudry et al., 2017). Two publications reported that users failed to check the integrity of the outer needle cap (Schertz et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2012). With regard to the “failure to check <b>product</b> validity” <b>subcategory,</b> three publications mentioned that users failed to check the indicated expiration date (Schiff et al., 2016) or were carrying devices that had expired (Sicherer et al., 2000; Schmid et al., 2013). Furthermore, two publications reported that users failed to check the liquid (Hudry et al., 2017; Schiff et al., 2016). The last subcategory (“tampering with device”) refers to a publication that stated that users could not activate an injection because they had tampered with the device during its preparation (Andre et al., 2017).|$|R
40|$|Purpose In recent years, {{crowdfunding}} {{has emerged}} as a popular method to finance entrepreneurial ventures. Entrepreneurs appeal directly to the general public, e. g. the crowd, for help getting their innovative ideas off the ground. Within the world of reward-based crowdfunding, the authors of how to -literature (practitioners) and the authors of theoretical reward-based crowdfunding literature (theoreticians) disagree on strategies for setting the external (i. e. public) funding goal. Theoreticians state that potential backers are less likely to contribute once a project reaches its goal and that crowdfunding projects fail by large amounts and succeed by small, while practitioners state that reaching the funding goal as fast as possible, {{to be seen as a}} success and to more securely pre-sell your product, generates success. Research on the field has been very limited, and is also quickly outdated, as the world of reward-based crowdfunding is fast evolving. This study targets the contradicting statements of theoreticians and practitioners and uses a new approach to shed light on the topic of funding goal setting within reward-based crowdfunding, with the goal of providing valuable insights that could help entrepreneurial ventures raise capital through reward-based crowdfunding. Theory 	It is agreed that projects with lower external goals are more likely to reach that external goal. Some researchers argue that potential backers are less likely to contribute once a project reaches its goal, explaining this with crowding out and the goal gradient hypothesis. Thus recommending reaching the external goal at the end of your campaign. Others claim that one should hit the external goal as fast as possible, and that reaching the goal fast brings more practical advantages than theoretical disadvantages. After a thorough literature review we provide a definition of private good-type of RBCF projects, and suggest focusing research on these types of projects to shed light on the conflicting findings in current theory. Private good-type project: A reward-based crowdfunding project that involves pre-selling of a consumer product. There must be a physical product that is manufactured and delivered to each individual backer. 					 Research questions We focus our research on the contradicting views on external goal setting within the field of crowdfunding. With the aim of developing a better understanding of how external goals are set in private good type projects, we ask the following research questions: RQA: How do private good-type crowdfunding projects set external goals? RQ 1 :		Are there external goals that are substantially lower than internal goals? RQ 2 :	How are external goals determined? RQ 3 :	What are the founders reasons for setting the external goal lower than the internal goal? RQ 4 : 	Based on their external goal setting approach, how can private good-type crowdfunding projects be grouped and what are the common traits within each group? Methodology/approach - The thesis is based on ten case studies of successfully launched projects within the <b>Product</b> Design <b>subcategory</b> on Kickstarter (KS). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the founders using Skype. The multiple case study is confirmatory, in the sense that earlier theories are reviewed, and at the same time inductive due to unexpected findings that has not previously been explained in existing literature. 				 Findings Our findings from the in-depth interviews with the ten founders, related to the research questions, are summarized below: 1. 	Founders set their external goals lower than their internal goals. 2. 	Founders use a bottom-up or top-down approach when determining their external goal. 3. 	Reasons for setting the external goal lower than the internal is either related to founders playing it safe or a strategy to get funded fast. There are four main reasons why getting funded fast is good: 	a. 	KS exposure 	b. 	Media attention 	c. 	Internal motivation 	d. 	Promoting backer consumerism 4. 	Looking at goal setting the founders can be grouped based on their mindset and approach to KS: 	a. 	Inventor 	b. 	Marathoner 	c. 	Sprinter 	d. 	Extreme Sprinter In addition, we had an unexpected finding on a recent transition of Kickstarter as a platform for inventor type projects to an established retail marketplace with its own customer base and following. This might indicate a shift in reward-based crowdfunding, towards consumerism and traditional sales and marketing theory. 					 Originality/value - We contribute to crowdfunding theory by acknowledging and defining external and internal goals, explaining founders reasoning in external goal setting, our categorization of founders based on their attributes, the provision of a founder s perspective in the reward-based crowdfunding space, the explicit acknowledgement of Kickstarter as an online marketplace and the definition of private good-type projects. We disprove theories stating that potential backers are less likely to contribute once a project reaches its goal (Kuppuswamy and Bayus, 2013), proving the opposite, for a subsample on the same crowdfunding platform they used as data sample, Kickstarter. Thus implying that future research should consider constraining and narrowing their scope when studying reward-based crowdfunding. In addition, our research can help entrepreneurial ventures set the correct external funding goal, and strategize accordingly, to increase their funding amounts and chances of success.
