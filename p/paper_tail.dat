40|$|Evidence {{of heavy}} tails {{presence}} in financial asset return distributions are plentiful since {{the seminal work}} of Mandelbrot (1963) on cotton prices. He advanced the hypothesis of an underlying stable class distribution {{on the basis of}} observed invariance of the return distribution across different frequencies and the apparent heavy tails of the distribution. Recent developments in the statistical analysis of return distributions have allowed a much deeper investigation of tail shapes of empirical distributions. For instance a number of papers have investigated the tail behavior of the empirical distribution of foreign exchange rate returns and, as well as assessing how fat-tailed returns are, they also analyze the stability of the distributions across different exchange rate regimes. In this <b>paper</b> <b>tail</b> index estimation of TL exchange rate vis-à-vis several foreign currencies is performed for both the periods preceding and following free float regime implemented after the financial crisis of February 2001.

We measure these spillovers by evaluating the number of joint occurrences of extreme negative returns in a nonfinancial firm conditional on an extreme negative return in the financial sector. Such spillovers increased dramatically in the 2007 – 2009 crisis. We also examine whether cash holdings act as a buffer in mitigating these spillovers. Our results indicate that greater cash holdings are associated {{with lower levels of}} tail risk spillovers for financially constrained firms and more strongly so among constrained firms with high hedging needs and no ratings (i. e., firms with restricted external financing sources). Overall, our findings support the view that the greater cash holdings of constrained firms act as a shock absorber against costly external financing...|$|R
50|$|Certain breeds {{use their}} tails as rudders when swimming, and {{possibly}} for balance when running, so active dogs with docked tails {{might be at}} a disadvantage compared to their tailed peers. In 2007, Stephen Leaver, {{a graduate student at}} the University of Victoria, published a <b>paper</b> on <b>tail</b> docking which found that tail length was important in the transmission of social cues. The study found that dogs with shorter tails (docked tails) would be approached with caution, as if the approaching dog was unsure of the emotional state of the docked dog. The study goes on to suggest that dogs with docked tails may grow up to be more aggressive. The reasoning postulated by Tom Reimchen, UVic Biologist and supervisor of the study, was that dogs who grew up without being able to efficiently transmit social cues would grow up to be more anti-social and thus more aggressive.|$|R

40|$|Dependencies between extreme events (extremal dependencies) are {{attracting}} {{an increasing}} attention in modern risk management. In practice, {{the concept of}} tail dependence represents the current standard to describe the amount of extremal dependence. In theory, multi-variate extreme-value theory {{turns out to be}} the natural choice to model the latter dependencies. The present <b>paper</b> embeds <b>tail</b> dependence into the concept of tail copulae which describes the dependence structure in the tail of multivariate distributions but works more generally. Various non-parametric estimators for tail copulae and tail dependence are discussed, and weak convergence, asymptotic normality, and strong consistency of these estimators are shown by means of a functional delta method. Further, weak convergence of a general upper-order rank-statistics for extreme events is investigated and the relationship to tail dependence is provided.

Hill (1975) tail index estimator for dependent, heterogeneous data. Under mild assumptions regarding the tail fractile sequence, memory and heterogeneity, choosing the sample fractile by non-parametrically minimizing the mean-squared-error leads to a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator. A broad simulation study demonstrates {{the merits of the}} resulting minimum MSE estimator for autoregressive and GARCH data. We analyze the distribution of a standardiz ed Hill-estimator in order to asses the accuracy of the kernel e stimator of the asymptotic variance, and the distribution of the minimum MSE estimator. Finally, we apply the estimators to a small study of the tail shape of equity markets returns.

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of tail dependencies invalidates the multivariate normality assumptions in portfolio risk management. The identification of tail (in) dependencies has drawn major attention in empirical financial studies. Yet {{it is still}} a challenging issue both theoretically and practically. Previous studies based on either a restrictive model or the null hypothesis of tail (perfect) dependence does not well describe or interpret extreme co-movements in financial markets. This <b>paper</b> examines <b>tail</b> dependence structures underlying a broad range of financial asset classes employing the newly developed tail quotient correlation coefficients. In theory, the original tail quotient correlation coefficient proposed in (Zhang 2008) is adapted to incorporate cases with varying data driven random thresholds. Our empirical results demonstrate different tail dependence structures underlying various global financial markets. Either omission or unanimous treatment of the tail dependence structures for different financial markets will lead to erroneous conclusions or suboptimal investment choices. The multivariate extreme value theory framework in this study has the potential to serve as an useful tool in exploiting arbitrage opportunities, optimizing asset allocations, and building robust risk management strategies...|$|R
