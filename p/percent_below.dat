5|$|Paris {{is a city}} {{of books}} and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language {{publishing}} houses were found in Paris, almost all on the Left Bank in the 5th, 6th and 7th arrondissements. Since that time, because of high prices, some publishers have moved out to the less expensive areas. It is also a city of small bookstores; There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> their publisher's cover price.|$|E
5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Taraki {{attended}} {{a conference of}} the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, Cuba. On his way back he stopped in Moscow on 20 March and met with Brezhnev, foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal {{was present at the}} meeting in an attempt to reconcile Taraki's Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet-Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists, and the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> the original price. However, the Soviets were not pleased about the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.|$|E

These program cuts are part of Rendell's proposal to cut state expenditures to a level 1 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> the 2002-2003 budget in response to an expected 2.3 billion dollar budget shortfall. As a result of the budget crisis, Rendell spokesman Chuck Ardo resigned.|$|E
25|$|Transwede {{applied in}} June 1990 {{to operate a}} {{scheduled}} service from Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö to London Gatwick Airport. International routes out of Scandinavia had since the 1940s been the domain of Scandinavian Airlines System, but in 1990 the Danish authorities granted domestic carrier Maersk Air the right to start a Gatwick service out of Copenhagen. Transwede used this as leverage to secure itself a similar {{right out of the}} Swedish capital. Transwede started the service eight times per week, using a single-class MD-83, offering prices 32 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> SAS and British Airways.|$|E

25|$|AJWright (formerly {{formatted}} as A.J. Wright until 2009) was a {{chain of}} about 129 American retail/outlet stores established in 1998 and owned by TJX Companies. Like its sister company T.J. Maxx, AJWright sold clothing, domestics, giftware, footwear, accessories, and fragrances at prices between twenty and seventy <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> regular prices. AJWright differed from other TJX chains by refreshing its merchandise on a regular basis. For most stores, new shipments arrived every weekday. In early 2011, TJX closed the chain's remaining stores and converted some stores to other TJX brands.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} actually {{succeeded in}} generating a small surplus {{in the budget}} during {{the second quarter of}} 1994, mainly as a result of higher taxes, after running a deficit of 17 percent of GDP in the first quarter. The slowdown in government spending, a sharp loss in business confidence, and the resulting decline in economic activity reduced tax revenues, however. The fiscal crisis resulted in a decline in real GDP of 5 percent in 1994 after the economy had grown briskly in 1992 and 1993. Real wages also fell in 1994: average nominal wage increases of 65 percent were about 20 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> the rate of consumer price inflation.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{demand has}} been held down by the {{combination}} of the price shock {{at the start of the}} stabilization program, steeply falling real wages, reduced government deficits, and much tighter restraint of credit. All these were deliberate measures to stop inflation, accepting the likely costs of higher unemployment and restraint of production as necessary to that end. In 1990 GNP fell 3.9 percent, aggravating the plunge of 19 percent between 1988 and 1990. In 1991 production turned up slightly, with a gain of 2.9 percent in GNP. That situation left output per capita essentially unchanged from 1990 and at 29 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> its level a decade earlier.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in office, Gabriel {{promoted}} the International Renewable Energy Agency. He also led the German delegation to the 2006 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Nairobi. In 2007, when Germany held {{the presidency of the}} Council of the European Union, he led the negotiations between European Union environment ministers on an ambitious effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> 1990 levels. That same year, he accompanied Merkel on a two-day visit to Greenland to see the Ilulissat Icefjord, a UNESCO world heritage site, and the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier {{in order to get a}} firsthand look at the effects of global warming.|$|E
25|$|When Cruzado {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} of Montana State University, the Board of Regents {{expressed concern about the}} faculty. Faculty generally taught 23 percent more courses than their peers elsewhere in the nation (although classes were generally small, just 10 to 29 students), spending on students was 17.7 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> the national average of $15,094 per student, just 72 percent of its freshmen returned for their sophomore year, and more than half its students failed to graduate. A troubling trend, the regents said, was MSU's over-reliance on adjunct faculty. in the 2009-2010 school year, MSU had 469 tenured or tenure-track faculty, but its 345 adjunct faculty accounted for 42 percent of all faculty.|$|E

25|$|On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger {{signed the}} Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, {{creating}} the nation's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations {{on the amount}} of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 <b>percent</b> <b>below</b> 1990 levels by 2050.|$|E
25|$|The {{addictive}} alkaloid nicotine is a stimulant, and {{popularly known}} as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco. Nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of enforcement value. Nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids on drug effect questionnaire liking scales, which are a rough indicator of addictive potential. Users may develop tolerance and dependence. Thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzopyrene), formaldehyde, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and phenols contribute to {{the harmful effects of}} smoking.
