The World Cup is always held in the European off-season in June and July and during this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar is in excess of 40°C (104°F), with the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30°C (86°F). Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, responded saying [...] "the event has to be organised in June or July.

A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the <b>problem.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> other plans up our sleeves as well."

Additionally, the upper tiers of the stadiums will be dis-assembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.|$|E

This is the question upon which our attitude must turn towards what may be called materialism. One sense of materialism is the view that all mental phenomena are causally dependent upon physical phenomena in the above-defined sense of causal dependence. Whether this is the case or not, I do not profess to know. The question seems to me the same as the question whether mnemic causation is ultimate, which we considered without deciding in Lecture IV. But I think the bulk of the evidence points to the materialistic answer as the more probable.|$|E

60|$|Now these anticipations are to a {{considerable}} extent justified. Remoteness on the earth's surface is usually an indication of diversity in the fauna and flora, while strongly contrasted climates are always accompanied by {{a considerable}} contrast in the forms of life. But this correspondence {{is by no means}} exact or proportionate, and the converse propositions are often quite untrue. Countries which are near to each other often differ radically in their animal and vegetable productions; while similarity of climate, together with moderate geographical proximity, are often accompanied by marked diversities in the prevailing forms of life. Again, while many groups of animals--genera, families, and sometimes even orders--are confined to limited regions, most of the families, many genera, and even some species are found in every part of the earth. An enumeration of a few of these anomalies will better illustrate the nature of the <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to solve.|$|E
60|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to discuss}} {{is whether there}} is any reason for believing in what is called 'the {{uniformity}} of nature'. The belief in the uniformity of nature {{is the belief that}} everything that has happened or will happen is an instance of some general law to which there are no exceptions. The crude expectations which we have been considering are all subject to exceptions, and therefore liable to disappoint those who entertain them. But science habitually assumes, at least as a working hypothesis, that general rules which have exceptions can be replaced by general rules which have no exceptions. 'Unsupported bodies in air fall' is a general rule to which balloons and aeroplanes are exceptions. But the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, which account for the fact that most bodies fall, also account for the fact that balloons and aeroplanes can rise; thus the laws of motion and the law of gravitation are not subject to these exceptions.|$|E

60|$|The <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to {{consider}} is this: Granted that we are certain of our own sense-data, have we any reason for regarding them as signs {{of the existence of}} something else, which we can call the physical object? When we have enumerated all the sense-data which we should naturally regard as connected with the table, have we said all there is to say about the table, or is there still something else--something not a sense-datum, something which persists when we go out of the room? Common sense unhesitatingly answers that there is. What can be bought and sold and pushed about and have a cloth laid on it, and so on, cannot be a mere collection of sense-data. If the cloth completely hides the table, we shall derive no sense-data from the table, and therefore, if the table were merely sense-data, it would have ceased to exist, and the cloth would be suspended in empty air, resting, by a miracle, in the place where the table formerly was. This seems plainly absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.|$|E
60|$|Having thus briefly {{indicated}} the general {{character of the}} more complex adaptations for cross-fertilisation, the details of which {{are to be found}} in any of the numerous works on the subject,[146] we find ourselves confronted with the very puzzling question--Why were these innumerable highly complex adaptations produced, when the very same result may be effected--and often is effected--by extremely simple means? Supposing, as we must do, that all flowers were once of simple and regular forms, like a buttercup or a rose, how did such irregular and often complicated flowers as the papilionaceous or pea family, the labiates or sage family, and the infinitely varied and fantastic orchids ever come into existence? No cause has yet been suggested but the need of attracting insects to cross-fertilise them; yet the attractiveness of regular flowers with bright colours and an ample supply of nectar is equally great, and cross-fertilisation can be quite as effectively secured in these by any of the four simple methods already described. Before attempting to suggest a possible solution of this difficult <b>problem,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> yet to pass in review a large body of curious adaptations connected with insect fertilisation, and will first call attention to that portion of the phenomena which throw some light upon the special colours of flowers in their relation to the various kinds of insects which visit them. For these facts we are largely indebted to the exact and long-continued researches of Professor Hermann Müller.|$|E
