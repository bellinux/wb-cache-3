50|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>weave</b> {{is a form}} of textile {{created by}} weaving. Pile fabrics used to be made on {{traditional}} hand weaving machines. The warp ends that are used for the formation of the pile are woven over metal rods or wires that are inserted in the shed (gap caused by raising alternate threads) during weaving. The pile ends lie in loops over the inserted rods. When a rod is extracted the pile ends remain as loops on top of the base fabric. The pile ends lying over the rod may be left as 'loop pile', or cut to form 'cut pile' or velvet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>weave</b> or knotted weave is {{the method}} of weaving used in most rugs. In this {{technique}} the rug is woven by creation of knots. A short piece of yarn is tied by hand around two neighboring warp strands creating a knot {{on the surface of}} the rug. After each row of knots is created, one or more strands of weft are passed through a complete set of warp strands. Then the knots and the weft strands are beaten with a comb securing the knots in place. A rug can consist of 25 to over 1,000 knots per square inch.|$|E

50|$|Pliny the Elder {{wrote in}} (nat. VIII, 48) that carpets (“polymita”) were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or <b>pile</b> <b>weaves,</b> as no {{detailed}} technical information {{is provided in}} the texts.

50|$|Knotted <b>pile</b> <b>woven</b> carpets {{were likely}} {{produced}} {{by people who}} were already familiar with extra-weft wrapping techniques. The different knot types in carpets from locations as distant from each other like the Pazyryk carpet (symmetric), the East Turkestan and Lop Nur (alternate single-weft knots), the At-Tar (symmetric, asymmetric, asymmetric loop kots), and the Fustat fragments (looped-pile, single, asymmetric knots) suggest that the technique as such may have evolved at different places and times.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>woven</b> Turkish carpets {{were found}} in Konya and Beyşehir in Turkey, and Fostat in Egypt, and were dated to the 13th century, which {{corresponds}} to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243-1302). Eight fragments {{were found in}} 1905 by F.R. Martin in the Alâeddin Mosque in Konya, four in the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir in Konya province by R.M. Riefstahl in 1925. More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb {{of the city of}} Cairo.|$|R
50|$|Turkmen tribes {{inhabited}} {{the area between}} the Amu Darya river, the Caspian Sea, Aral Sea and towards the borders of modern-time Iran and Afghanistan. They produced rugs and smaller <b>pile</b> <b>woven</b> textiles in various sizes, including main carpets (halı), tent door hangings (ensi), and other household items like tent door decorations (khalyk or kapunuk), tent bags (torba), large bags (chuval), smaller bags (mafrash), saddle bags (Khordjin), animal covers (asmalyk), and tent bands.|$|R

50|$|Oriental carpets can be <b>pile</b> <b>woven</b> or flat <b>woven</b> without <b>pile,</b> using various {{materials}} such as silk, wool, and cotton. Examples {{range in size from}} pillow to large, room-sized carpets, and include carrier bags, floor coverings, decorations for animals, Islamic prayer rugs (sajjadah), Jewish Torah ark covers (parochet), and Christian altar covers. Since the High Middle Ages, oriental rugs have been an integral part of their cultures of origin, {{as well as of the}} European and, later on, the North American culture.|$|R
50|$|Some carpets include symbols {{which serve}} as a tribal crest and {{sometimes}} allow for {{the identification of the}} weaver's tribe. This is especially true for Turkmen <b>pile</b> <b>woven</b> textiles, which depict a variety of different medallion-like polygonal patterns called Gul, arranged in rows all over the field. While the origin of the pattern {{can be traced back to}} Buddhist depictions of the lotus blossom, it remains questionable if the weaver of such a tribal symbol was aware of its origins.|$|R

50|$|Due to its {{geographical}} position, Transylvania {{has been}} an important trade center between East and West during the 15th-17th century. <b>Pile</b> <b>woven</b> carpets from Anatolian manufacturers were part of the merchandise, and were traded in large numbers. Anatolian carpets were also appreciated as objects of high value and prestige, and collected as such by Transylvanian municipalities and individual persons. Inscriptions on the rugs and church records prove that rugs and carpets were donated as decorative wall and pew furnishings to Protestant churches. By their preservation in Christian churches, the rugs were protected from wear and the changes of history, and often remain in excellent condition today.|$|R
50|$|Rugs exist {{which are}} known to be woven in European manufactories as early as the mid sixteenth century, imitating the {{technique}} and, to some extent, the designs of Oriental rugs. In Sweden, flat and <b>pile</b> <b>woven</b> rugs (called “rya”, or “rollakan”) became part of the folk art, and are still produced today, mostly in modern designs. In other countries, like Poland or Germany, the art of carpet weaving did not last long. In the United Kingdom, Axminster carpets were produced since the mid-eighteenth century. In France, the Savonnerie manufactory began <b>weaving</b> <b>pile</b> carpets by the mid-seventeenth centuries, but turned to European-style designs later on, which in turn influenced the Anatolian rug production during the “mecidi”, or “Turkish baroque” period. The Manchester-based company Ziegler & Co. maintained workshops in Tabriz and Sultanabad (now Arak) and supplied retailers such as Liberty & Company and Harvey Nichols. Their designs were modifications of the traditional Persian. A. C. Edwards was the manager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers' operations in Persia from 1908 to 1924, and wrote one of the classical textbooks about the Persian carpet.|$|R

25|$|Flat weaving and {{embroidery}} {{were known}} during the Sasanian period. Elaborate Sasanian silk textiles were well preserved in European churches, {{where they were}} used as coverings for relics, and survived in church treasuries. More of these textiles were preserved in Tibetan monasteries, and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the Chinese cultural revolution, or excavated from burial sites like Astana, on the Silk Road near Turfan. The high artistic level reached by Persian weavers is further exemplified by {{the report of the}} historian Al-Tabari about the Spring of Khosrow carpet, taken as booty by the Arabian conquerors of Ctesiphon in 637 AD. The description of the rug's design by al-Tabari makes it seem unlikely that the carpet was <b>pile</b> <b>woven.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kilims are {{produced}} by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no <b>pile.</b> Kilim <b>weaves</b> are tapestry weaves, technically weft-faced plain weaves, that is, the horizontal weft strands are pulled tightly downward so that they hide the vertical warp strands.|$|R

25|$|Beginning at latest {{with the}} Seljuq invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a {{distinct}} Turko-Persian tradition emerged. Fragments of woven carpets {{were found in}} the Alâeddin Mosque in the Turkish town of Konya and the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir, and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302). More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. These fragments at least give us an idea how Seluq carpets may have looked. The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of <b>pile</b> <b>weaving</b> itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.|$|R
50|$|Amongst Oriental rugs, the Turkish carpet is {{distinguished}} by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the Turkish, or symmetrical knot. The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets {{date from the}} thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, {{as well as in}} villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool, cotton, and silk. <b>Pile</b> <b>woven</b> as well as flat woven carpets (Kilim, Soumak, Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.Following a decline which began {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century, initiatives like the DOBAG Carpet Initiative in 1982, or the Turkish Cultural Foundation in 2000, started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.|$|R

This country {{produces}} the six domestic animals horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs and pigs, which are all said to come from the water. It is said that they not only use sheep's wool, but also bark from trees, or the silk from wild silkworms, to make brocade, mats, <b>pile</b> rugs, <b>woven</b> cloth and curtains, all of them of good quality, and with brighter colours than those made in the countries of Haidong (“East of the Sea”).|$|R
50|$|The {{knotting}} {{method used}} in Tibetan rug making {{is different from}} that used in other rug making traditions worldwide. Some aspects of the rug making have been supplanted by cheaper machines in recent times, especially yarn spinning and trimming of the <b>pile</b> after <b>weaving.</b> However, some carpets are still made by hand. The Tibetan diaspora in India and Nepal have established a thriving business in rug making. In Nepal the rug business {{is one of the largest}} industries in the country and there are many rug exporters. Tibet also has weaving workshops, but the export side of the industry is relatively undeveloped compared with Nepal and India.|$|R
50|$|Moquette, {{derived from}} the French word for carpet, {{is a type of}} <b>woven</b> <b>pile</b> fabric in which cut or uncut threads form a short dense cut or loop pile. As well as giving it a {{distinctive}} velvet-like feel, the pile construction is particularly durable, and ideally suited to applications such as public transport. Its upright fibres form a flexible, non-rigid surface, which are constantly displaced to give durability and anti-stain benefits. Traditional moquette fabrics are made from a wool nylon face with an interwoven cotton backing.|$|R
