5000|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> is an {{enhanced}} master cylinder setup {{used to reduce}} the amount of pedal pressure needed for braking. It employs a booster set up to act with the master cylinder to give higher hydraulic pressure to the brakes and/or lower force applied on the brake pedal through a <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> push-rod. The <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> usually uses vacuum from the engine intake to boost the force applied by the pedal on to the master cylinder, or may employ an extra vacuum pump to enable it. Without the engine running the brake pedal feels very hard and ineffective on the braking capability. An [...] "active" [...] booster is a non [...] "conventional" [...] booster where a solenoid is used to open the booster air valve to automatically push the master cylinder forward to perform some forms of dynamic stability control. <b>Brake</b> <b>boosters</b> come in either a single diaphragm or tandem diaphragm (which is generally used for bigger vehicles and trucks). They can be [...] "cabin-breathers" [...] (taking clean filtered air from inside the cabin thus may be more noisy) or [...] "engine-breathers" [...] (less noisy but more at risk for becoming clogged with mud/ice if not protected properly).|$|R

50|$|A vacuum servo is a {{component}} used on motor vehicles in their braking system, {{to provide assistance}} to the driver by decreasing the braking effort. In the US it is commonly called a <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brakes {{were also}} changed, {{with the front}} brakes {{increasing}} in diameter from 280 mm to 325 mm two pot calipers, and changes {{had been made to}} the <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> calibration, <b>brake</b> bias and pedal ratio.|$|R
50|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> {{is used on}} {{virtually}} all vehicles which use hydraulic brakes for their primary braking circuit. Vacuum servos are not used on vehicles which use cables, rods (or other mechanical linkages), or pressurized air systems for their primary brake circuits.|$|R
5000|$|Emergency Braking System : The EBS slowed KITT {{down from}} Super-Pursuit speeds. It {{consisted}} of a forward <b>braking</b> <b>booster</b> and air panels that popped out to create air friction (air brakes). First used in Episode 70, [...] "Knight of the Juggernaut, Part II".|$|R
5000|$|In late 1983, the [...] "84" [...] Giulietta (Series 3) was presented, {{with minor}} {{differences}} in appearance, bumpers were redesigned and the dashboard was significantly re-designed, the instruments changed slightly and {{the rear seat}} in some versions changed its form.

50|$|The mini monster trucks have custom {{braking systems}} with <b>brake</b> <b>boosters</b> to assist child drivers, {{adjustable}} pedal systems {{to allow for}} the movement of the controls for various ages and sizes, custom five point safety harness systems that are adjustable, and movable control panels {{to allow for the}} different arm lengths to adapt to a child’s age, weight, and height.|$|R
50|$|The Spec-R {{differed}} from previous Silvia models by featuring a 6-speed manual gearbox {{as well as}} a 4-speed automatic transmission. The Spec-R also included extensive chassis and suspension strengthening via the use of larger anti-roll bars and strut bracing. The S15 featured the same 4-piston front brake calipers that were found in the Z32 300ZX but included a larger <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b>|$|R
50|$|An S-cam {{is part of}} a {{braking system}} used in heavy {{vehicles}} such as trucks and wheeled machinery. It consists of a shaft, usually around 4 to 25 inches long, turned at one end by means of an air-powered <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> and lever with an 'S' shaped cam at the wheel end. Turning the shaft pushes the brake shoes against the drum, producing friction.|$|R
5000|$|All models now {{came with}} disc brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the back, {{controlled}} using a dual circuit system and <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b> This was a progression from the situation with the Rekord A, in respect of which only had servoassisted discbrakes, not the rear drums.

25|$|The {{braking system}} {{includes}} four-channel ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep aid system {{to prevent the}} car from rolling on a hill. A <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during Idle Stop mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding caliper with a one-piece ventilated rotor. Drum brakes {{are used in the}} rear.|$|R
50|$|The Spec-S {{featured}} a 5-speed manual transmission (in {{addition to a}} 4-speed automatic available on both the Spec-S and the Spec-R). It lacked the additional chassis support of the Spec-R; featured 4-piston front brake caliper and a slightly smaller <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b> The Spec-S came only with an open differential. Australian-delivered Spec-S models featured the same helical differential, chassis bracing and 6 speed manual transmission as the Australian market Spec-R models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971 {{the factory}} {{version of this}} package was introduced, simply called the 55 Marathon. This did not feature an {{upgraded}} suspension, and had a [...] 1108 cc engine, the BR110. This raised the top speed to 145 km/h. The 55 Marathon featured wider steel wheels, exterior striping and a <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> was added for safety and comfort. The Marathon was available as a saloon or a coupe.|$|R
50|$|Because of low vacuum at high RPM, {{reports of}} {{unintended}} acceleration are {{often accompanied by}} complaints of failed or weakened brakes, as the high-revving engine, having an open throttle, is unable to provide enough vacuum to power the <b>brake</b> <b>booster.</b> This problem is exacerbated in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions as the vehicle will automatically downshift upon application of the brakes, thereby increasing the torque delivered to the driven-wheels {{in contact with the}} road surface.|$|R
50|$|The car sold well in {{both the}} USSR and other Eastern Bloc {{countries}} and was sold for export. In the USSR, the M-408/412 was the second best selling Moskvitch for the whole 1970s decade, bested only by its successor, the 2140. In {{order to make it}} more competitive, the car was often upgraded during the time of its production and equipped with better gearboxes, more powerful 75 h.p. motors, hydrovacuum <b>brake</b> <b>boosters,</b> etc.|$|R

50|$|In May 1999, the AU range {{received}} a minor update, introducing a bigger <b>brake</b> <b>booster,</b> front power windows for the Forté and XR6 and lowering the rear suspension of non-XR variants by 24 mm. To heighten its interior quality, the Forté was offered with 'medium graphite' interior trim (slightly darker than originally) and the patterned seat material was {{changed from the}} bolsters to the seat centres. Buyers were also able to order the darker 'warm charcoal' colour scheme of other Falcon variants.|$|R
50|$|Albert Dewandre (Liege, Belgium), an {{engineer}} and business owner, was the inventor of servo-brake or <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> system “Dewandre” in 1927. It is a brake boosting system that uses the depression caused by the suction in the intake manifold of an internal combustion engine to reduce {{the pressure on the}} brake pedal. The advantage of the Dewandre system is twofold: a softer push on the brake pedal, but also a notably shorter braking distance. His invention was manufactured and sold through the Robert Bosch company.|$|R
50|$|In October 2010, it is {{reported}} that Brake Defect from Honda Honda Legend were delivered to customers before the problem is discovered.

50|$|While styling {{changes to}} the 2003 Grand Marquis were evolutionary, the {{changes to the}} Panther {{platform}} were far more extensive. To improve chassis rigidity, an all-new frame was introduced with fully boxed and hydroformed frame rails. In an effort to improve handling, {{the front and rear}} suspension were redesigned along with the brakes. A quiet EBD <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> with a mechanical panic assist system was added. The new suspension changes required changing wheel designs to those with a high positive offset. Rack and pinion steering replaced the old recirculating ball system in an effort to increase steering precision and reduce costs.In standard versions of the Grand Marquis, the rear-axle ratio was 2.73:1; in LSE and versions with the handling suspension, a 3.27:1 rear-axle ratio was used. The handling package was standard equipment on LS-trim export models.|$|R
50|$|The 2WD models {{feature the}} new Electronic Braking Force Distribution (EBD) system that uses {{electronic}} control to optimally distribute braking {{force to the}} front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the Braking Assist system (a <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (Braking Assist). As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload. The 4WD models also provide the nearly same high level of braking performance by adopting a load sensing valve (LSV) as a mechanical braking force distribution system in a set with the Braking Assist system.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} braking system characteristics, brake system performance and brake system component design parameters that influence brake pedal force / displacement characteristics as ‘felt’ by the driver in a passenger car. It includes detailed studies of individual brake system component design parameters, operation, and the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components through experimental study and simulation modelling. The prediction of brake pedal ‘feel’ in brake system simulation has been achieved using the simulation modelling package AMESim. Each individual brake system component was modelled individually before combining them into the whole brake system {{in order to identify}} the parameters and the internal components characteristics that influence the brake pedal ‘feel’. The simulation predictions were validated by experimentally measured data and demonstrated the accuracy of simulation modelling. Axisymmetric Finite Element Analysis (using the ABAQUS software) was used to predict the behaviour of nonlinear elastomeric internal components such as the piston seal and the booster reaction disc which was then included in the AMESim simulation model. The seal model FEA highlighted the effects of master cylinder and caliper seal deformation on the brake pedal ‘feel’. The characteristics of the <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> reaction disc were predicted by the FEA and AMESim simulation modelling and these results highlighted the importance of the nonlinear material characteristics, and their potential contribution to brake pedal ‘feel’ improvement. A full brake system simulation model was designed, prepared, and used to predict brake system performance and to design a system with better brake pedal ‘feel’. Each of the brake system component design parameters was validated to ensure that the braking system performance was accurately predicted. The critical parameter of <b>brake</b> <b>booster</b> air valve spring stiffness was identified to improve the brake ‘pedal ‘feel’. This research has contributed to the advancement of automotive engineering by providing a method for brake system engineers to design a braking system with improved pedal ‘feel’. The simulation model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of brake system performance at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|R
