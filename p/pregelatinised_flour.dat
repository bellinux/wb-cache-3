40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find innovative approaches for the production of iron fortified noodles that are natural and economically feasible. The functional food was produced using different combinations. The investigated variables were the ratio of sorghum to white bean flour, pre-gelatinized flours (drum dried or extruded) and guar gum addition while the emulsifier added was kept constant. Investigated parameters were the iron content and its bioavailability, as well as the functional properties (cooking weight, cooking time, cooking loss and texture) of the noodles. Results of the study showed that the content of white bean in the noodles had a direct influence on the iron content and bioavailability. As expected, the iron content and bioavailability was higher the higher the amount of white bean added. Additionally, the iron content and bioavailability was affected by the addition of guar gum and the pregelatinised flours. Iron content of noodles decreased with the increase of guar gum content while the addition of white bean <b>pregelatinised</b> <b>flour</b> showed an increase in the iron content and bioavailability. On examination of the functional properties, the 50 % white bean noodles gave the best results in terms of texture, cooking loss, cooking time and cooking weight. Cooking time, cooking weight and cooking loss were comparable to that of durum wheat noodles. Noodles prepared with 50 % white bean flour and pregelatinized flours (extruded or drum dried) received the best rankings in the sensory evaluation. The result of this study showed that the higher the amount of white bean added, the superior was the noodle quality, therefore fulfilling the requirements of the objectives i. e. good quality noodles with high iron content and bioavailability.

40|$|Broken rice {{was used}} for the {{production}} of dry-milled flour by grinding on Pin Mill. Particle sizes distribution of the resulting flour shown that major portion was coarse flour. Physicochemical properties of the flour with differing particle sizes were investigated and utilized as raw material in rice noodle production; Sen Yai and Sen Mee. The protein content decreased whereas the ash content increased with decreasing particle size. The amylose content of each fraction was similar. Water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI) were greater for fine flour. Fine flour also possessed high value of lightness (L*) and low yellowness (b*). Rapid visco analysis indicated that fine flour had lower gelatinization temperature while higher peak viscosity, breakdown and final viscosity than coarse flour. Thxtural characteristics of Sen Yai prepared from dry-milled rice flour were affected by particle sizes, flour slurry concentration, flour soaking and steaming time. Good qualities of Sen Yai were obtained from the finest flour (< 200 mesh) with 33 % flour concentration, 3 hrs soaking and 5 min steaming. Increasing in soaking time and steaming time improved the noodle qualities. A process for production of Sen Mee from dry-milled rice flour comprised a) mixing rice flour with 35 - 40 % <b>pregelatinise</b> <b>flour,</b> added some water then kneaded to obtain a dough b) extruding the dough to form the noodle c) steaming the noodles d) drying the noodle at 45 - 48 Â°C to a moisture content below 12 % by weight. Noodle quality was examined by cooking yield, cooking loss, tensile strength, break distance, hardness and stickiness. The results indicated that Sen Mee prepared from dry-milled rice flour gave rougher texture and easier to break up on cooking than the ones in the market...|$|R
