The data help assess {{the use of}} these proxies for <b>palaeo-oceanography.</b> Samples are from Dorset, UK (Pliensbachian; 5 species); Cambridgeshire, UK (Callovian; 1 species); and the Vocontian Basin, SE France (Valanginian; 4 genera). In none of these belemnite populations (at species or genera level) does Mg/Ca correlate with δ 18 O.

40|$|Coral reefs {{constitute}} real oasis sheltering {{for about}} {{one third of the}} identified fishes, representing a major advantage for the economy and tourism of many tropical countries. However it is paradoxical to notice that their formation at the cellular level or even at the scale of the organism is still poorly known. Effectively, biomineralisation, the process that is at the basis of their edification, is always the subject of numerous researches. Two combined mechanisms lead to the formation of a biomineral, the synthesis/secretion of macromolecules referred to as ‘organic matrix’, and the transport of ions (calcium, bicarbonates and protons in the case of calcification) to the mineralising site. This review shows a view of the works carried out on biominerali-sation in scleractinian corals, including some aspects on the control of calcification by environmental parameters. It also gives insights into the biological basis of the use of coral skeletons as environmental archives in <b>palaeo-oceanography.</b> To cite this article: D. Allemand et al., C. R.

40|$|On a long {{geological}} timescale, first-order {{changes in}} palaeo-climate, <b>palaeo-oceanography</b> and marine sedimentation {{are controlled by}} plate tectonics through the distribution of land masses and ocean basins (geometry and geography), the opening and closing of oceanic gateways, and changes in topography both on land and at sea. The oceanic crustal age and distribution south, southeast and east of Australia illustrates the complex kinematics of major tectonic plates (Australia, Antarctica and Pacific), microplates (several blocks of the Lord Howe Rise, Campbell Plateau and Chatham Rise), and the intervening triple junctions {{that led to the}} formation of ridge jumps, long fracture zones and transform faults, and trenches. Several up-to-date models for the evolution of individual oceanic basins in this region have been merged with a South Pacific high-resolution tectonic model in order to document a detailed tectonic history of this region. Densely spaced isochrons (1 million years) are derived from the kinematic model and refined using satellite-derived free-air gravity anomalies and bathymetry, and magnetic anomalies from ship track data. The isochrons are used to construct polygons that depict the amount of oceanic lithosphere attached to the active tectonic plates at a certain geological time. Palaeo-age and palaeo-bathymetric grids are calculated based on the new dense set of isochrons. We present animated reconstructions and use them to highlight the importance of bathymetric features and the distribution of land and sea in the opening of the Tasman gateway and subsequent development of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the genetic {{structure of the}} European sprat (Sprattus sprattus) {{by means of a}} 530 -bp sequence of the mitochondrial control region from 210 fish originating from seven sampling localities of its distributional range. Phylogeographical analysis of 128 haplotypes showed a phylogenetic separation into two major clades with the Strait of Sicily acting as a barrier to gene flow between them. While no population differentiation was observed based on analysis of molecular variance and net nucleotide differences between samples of the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay nor between the Black Sea and the Bosporus, a strong population differentiation between these samples and two samples from the Mediterranean Sea was found. Further, the biggest genetic distance was observed within the Mediterranean Sea between the populations of the Gulf of Lyon and the Adriatic Sea, indicating genetic isolation of these regions. Low genetic diversities and star-like haplotype networks of both Mediterranean Sea populations point towards recent demographic expansion scenarios after low population size, which is further supported by negative FS values and unimodal mismatch distributions with a low mean. Along the northeast Atlantic coast, a northwards range expansion of a large and stable population can be assumed. The history of a diverse but differentiated Black Sea population remains unknown due to uncertainties in the <b>palaeo-oceanography</b> of this sea. Our genetic data did not confirm the presently used classification into subspecies but are only preliminary in the absence of nuclear genetic analyses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{measured}} the magnesium (Mg) isotope ratios in 45 rivers including 16 {{of the largest}} rivers in the world, covering a range of geologic, tectonic and climatic drainage basin environments. The range in riverine δ 26 Mg is 2. 5 ‰, half the variation in terrestrial rock. Although the Mg isotopic composition of the source rock is important for small rivers, at a global scale lithology is of limited significance for Mg isotope ratios in rivers. Part of the variability at a global scale {{may be attributed to}} fractionation in the weathering environment. The rivers analysed constitute 30 % of the global Mg riverine flux to the oceans and a flux weighted Mg isotope composition of global runoff has been estimated at − 1. 09 ‰. Even taking into account uncertainty, this is distinct from seawater at − 0. 82 ‰. This difference arises either from the fractionation of Mg isotope ratios in the ocean and/or a Mg budget which is not at steady state. The difference is consistent with fractionation by carbonate precipitation. In the simplest steady state scenario, where the oceanic mass balance is maintained by riverine input and hydrothermal and dolomite output, Mg isotope ratios imply a minimum dolomite Mg flux of 9 % of the total output Mg flux. The implications of the distinct isotopic composition of the riverine flux from modern seawater, is that the Mg isotope ratio of seawater has probably varied outside of current analytical uncertainty. Mg isotope ratios may therefore provide a valuable new tracer in <b>palaeo-oceanography...</b>|$|E
