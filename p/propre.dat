25|$|The {{question}} concerning corporeity connects {{also with}} Merleau-Ponty's reflections on space (l'espace) and {{the primacy of}} the dimension of depth (la profondeur) as implied in the notion of being in the world (être au monde; to echo Heidegger's In-der-Welt-sein) and of one's own body (le corps <b>propre).</b>|$|E
25|$|Lallemant is {{also the}} author of “Le Sens <b>propre</b> et littéral des Psaumes de David” (Paris. 1709) and of “L’Imitation de Jésus-Christ, traduction nouvelle” (Paris, 1740), of which there have been countless editions and translations. The Mémoires de Trévoux (August, 1713, and May, 1714) contain several {{dissertations}} with Lallemant's initials, and the Jansenists attributed to him several writings like the “Mandement of M. de Vintimille contre les Nouvelles Ecclésiastiques” (1732) and the supplement to the “Nouvelles Ecclésiastiques”(1734-8).|$|E
25|$|Taking {{the study}} of {{perception}} as his point of departure, Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that one's own body (le corps <b>propre)</b> {{is not only a}} thing, a potential object of study for science, but is also a permanent condition of experience, a constituent of the perceptual openness to the world. He therefore underlines {{the fact that there is}} an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account. The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience, so to speak, insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.|$|E

500|$|Up to , {{continental}} Arthurian romance {{was expressed}} primarily through poetry; after this date the tales {{began to be}} told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written {{in the first half}} of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot <b>propre</b> (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (...) , of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.|$|E

2500|$|A {{charge that}} is {{coloured}} as it naturally appears is blazoned proper (Fr. <b>propre),</b> or [...] "the colour of nature". [...] Strictly speaking, proper {{is not a}} tincture in itself, and if, as is sometimes the case, a charge {{is meant to be}} depicted in particular colours that are not apparent from the word [...] "proper" [...] alone, they may be specified in whatever detail is necessary. [...] Certain charges are considered [...] "proper" [...] when portrayed with particular colours, even though a range of different colours is found in nature; for instance, a popinjay proper is green, even though wild parrots occur in a variety of colours. [...] In some cases, a charge depicted in a particular set of colours may be referred to as [...] "proper", even though it consists entirely of heraldic tinctures; a rose proper, whether red or white, is barbed vert and seeded or.|$|E
2500|$|For the 2004 {{election}} the Bloc {{adopted the}} slogan Un parti <b>propre</b> au Québec, {{a play on}} words that can be translated either as [...] "A party of Quebec's own" [...] ("a party proper to Quebec") or as [...] "A clean party in Quebec". The Bloc won 54 seats in the House of Commons, tying its previous record from the 1993 campaign. For the 2006 election, the Bloc used the slogan Heureusement, ici, c'est le Bloc! ("Fortunately, the Bloc is here!"). The Bloc were expected to easily win more than 60 seats {{at the start of}} the campaign, and they did in fact take six seats from the Liberals. However, the unexpected surge of the new Conservative Party of Canada in parts of Quebec, particularly in and around Quebec City, led to the Bloc losing eight seats to the Tories. Coupled with an additional loss to André Arthur, an independent candidate, the Bloc recorded a net loss of three seats.|$|E
2500|$|In his Phenomenology of Perception (first {{published}} in French in 1945), Merleau-Ponty developed {{the concept of}} the body-subject (le corps <b>propre)</b> {{as an alternative to the}} Cartesian [...] "ego cogito." [...] This distinction is especially important in that Merleau-Ponty perceives the essences of the world existentially. Consciousness, the world, and the human body as a perceiving thing are intricately intertwined and mutually [...] "engaged." [...] The phenomenal thing is not the unchanging object of the natural sciences, but a correlate of our body and its sensory-motor functions. Taking up and [...] "communing with" [...] (Merleau-Ponty's phrase) the sensible qualities it encounters, the body as incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within an ever-present world frame, through use of its pre-conscious, pre-predicative understanding of the world's makeup. The elaboration, however, is [...] "inexhaustible" [...] (the hallmark of any perception according to Merleau-Ponty). Things are that upon which our body has a [...] "grip" [...] (prise), while the grip itself is a function of our connaturality with the world's things. The world and the sense of self are emergent phenomena in an ongoing [...] "becoming." ...|$|E
