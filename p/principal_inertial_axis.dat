The {{interaction}} {{of a nuclear}} magnetic moment situated on an internal top with the magnetic fields produced by the internal as well as overall molecular rotation has been derived following the method of Van Vleck for the spin-rotation interaction in rigid molecules.

The F 19 nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1) of benzotrifluoride and several chemically substituted benzotrifluorides, have been measured both neat and in solution, at room temperature by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance.

Part II. The radiofrequency spectrum corresponding to the reorientation of the F 19 nuclear moment in flurobenzene has been studied by the molecular beam magnetic resonance method. A molecular beam apparatus with an electron bombardment detector was used in the experiments. The F 19 resonance is a composite spectrum with contributions from many rotational states and is not resolved.

40|$|Rockfall {{threaten}} {{infrastructure and}} {{people throughout the}} world. Estimating the runout dynamics of rockfall is commonly performed using models, providing fundamental data for hazard management and mitigation design. Modelling rockfall is made challenging by the complexity of rock-ground impacts. Much {{research has focused on}} empirical impact laws that bundle the rock-ground impact into a single parameter, but this approach fails to capture characteristics associated with the impact configuration and, in particular, the effects of rock-shape. While it is apparent that particular geological settings produce characteristic rock-shapes, and that different rock-shapes may produce characteristic runout dynamics, these aspects of rockfall are poorly understood. This study has focused on investigating the mechanics behind the notion that different rock-shapes produce characteristic runout dynamics and trajectories. The study combines field data on rockfall runout, trajectory and dynamics, laboratory analogue testing in controlled conditions, and numerical modelling of the influence of rock-shape. Initially rock-shape, deposition patterns and rockfall dynamics were documented at rockfall sites in Switzerland and New Zealand. This informed a detailed study of individual rock-ground impacts on planar slopes in which laboratory-scale and numerical rockfall experiments were combined to isolate the role of rock-shape on runout. Innovatively, the physical experiments captured the dynamics of impacts and runout paths using high speed video tracking and a sensor bundle with accelerometers and gyroscopes. Numerical experiments were performed using a 3 -D rigid-body rockfall model that considers rock-shape, and has allowed the variability of rockfall behaviour to be explored beyond the limitations of physical experimentation. The main findings of the study were on understanding rockfall-ground impacts, the influence of rock-shape on rockfall dynamics, and influence of rock sphericity. By measuring velocity, rotational speed, impact and runout character, it has been possible to quantify the variability of individual rock-ground impacts as a function of rock-shape. Investigation of single rebounds reveals that if classical restitution coefficients are applied, R_n values greater than unity are common and rebounds are highly variable regardless of constant contact parameters. It is shown that this variability is rooted in the inherent differences in the magnitudes of the principal moment of inertia of a rock body brought about by rock-shape. Any departure from a perfect sphere induces increased range and variability in rock-ground rebound characteristics. In addition to the popular description of a rock bouncing down slope, rebounds involve the pinning of an exterior edge point on the rock, creating a moment arm which effectively levers the rock into ballistic trajectory as it rotates. Observations reveal that the angle of the impact configuration {{plays a key role in}} the resulting rebound, whereby low angles produce highly arched rebounds, while large impact angles produce low flat rebounds. The type of rebound produced has a strong bearing on the mobility of the rocks and their ability to maintain motion over a long runout. The mobility of rocks is also shown to be related to rotation, which is governed by the differences in the principal inertial axes as a function of rock-shape. Angular velocity measurements about each <b>principal</b> <b>inertial</b> <b>axis</b> indicate that rocks have a tendency to seek rotation about the axis of largest inertia, as the most stable state. Rotations about intermediate and small axes of inertia and transitions between rotational axes are shown to be unstable and responsible for the dispersive nature of runout trajectories, which are inherent characteristics of different rock-shapes. The findings of this research demonstrate the importance of rock-shape in rockfall runout dynamics and illustrate how it is essential that the rock-shape is included in rockfall modelling approaches if the variability of rockfall behaviour is to be simulated...|$|E

It {{consists of a}} gimbal and a high-speed rotor suspended by magnetic bearings (MBs). The imbalance vibration due to the high-speed rotor can cause a velocity ripple to the gimbal and be transmitted to the spacecraft to decrease its attitude control precision. To suppress the imbalance vibration, this paper introduces an active control method in both the MBs and gimbal systems. Firstly, the structure and dynamics of the MSCMG system with the MBs and gimbal are described, and the transmission of the imbalance vibration is discussed. Then a notch filter with a phase shift and a feedforward controller are designed to prevent the MB system from generating the imbalance vibration by making the rotor rotate around its <b>inertial</b> <b>axis.</b> To correct the feedforward control errors resulting from power amplifiers, phase and gain compensations are made. Finally, another notch filter with a phase shift is employed to suppress the velocity ripple caused by the residual vibration from the MB system, and a constant-gain Kalman filter is adopted to obtain the best real-time estimate value of the gimbal velocity.

Numerous classic vibration - rotation perturbations were observed {{in the analysis of}} the 2 nu 9 and nu 4 bands. In addition large amplitude effects were observed for the 2 nu 9 and also, more surprisingly, the nu 4 bands. This results in splittings of the energy levels of about 0. 005 and 0. 0035 cm- 1 for the 9 ^ 2 and 4 ^ 1 states respectively. The theoretical model used to reproduce the experimental levels accounts for the classic vibration rotation resonances and of the large amplitude torsional (or bending) effects. The Coriolis resonances between the two torsional (or bending) substates are taken into account by {Jx,Jz} non orthorhombic terms in the v-diagonal blocks.

A method to find the optimal value is presented for two tool materials...|$|R
40|$|Ground {{and flight}} tests were {{conducted}} to investigate {{the problems associated with}} using a strapdown inertial flight data system. The objectives of this investigation were to develop a three <b>axis</b> <b>inertial</b> attitude reference system, to evaluate a self-alignment technique, and to examine the problem of time-sharing a general purpose computer for the several tasks required of it. The performance of the strapdown platform/computer system that was developed was sufficiently accurate for the tasks attempted. For flights on the order of 45 minutes duration, attitude angle errors of + or -. 035 radian (+ or - 2 deg) in all axes were observed. Laboratory tests of the self-alignment technique gave accuracies of + or -. 00075 radian in pitch and roll axes and + or - 0. 0045 radian in the yaw axis. Self-alignment flight results were inconsistent, since a stable solution was not obtained on windy days because of aircraft rocking motions...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{installation}} of Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) actuators in the new Two <b>Axis</b> <b>Inertial</b> Load Simulator (ILS) at MSFC. The new test stand will support the core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS). Because of the unique geometry of the new test stand standard actuator installation procedures will not work. I {{have been asked to}} develop a design on how to install the actuators into the new test stand. After speaking with the engineers and technicians I have created a possible design solution. Using Pro Engineer design software and running my own stress calculations I have proven my design is feasible. I have learned how to calculate the stresses my design will see from this task. From the calculations I have learned I have over built the apparatus. I have also expanded my knowledge of Pro Engineer and was able to create a model of my idea...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{show that}} the <b>principal</b> {{attitude}} and <b>inertial</b> dynamics of a quadrotor aircraft can be decomposed into a cascade of three passive and one interior conic subsystem such that a proportional digital feedback loop can effectively be applied to each subsystem in a nested manner. This proportional feedback architecture includes one saturation block nested between the attitude and inertial control systems to account for actuator saturation. Our architecture can control yaw independently of the desired inertial position. Stability of this architecture can be verified in both simulation and runtime through the following corollary derived from the sector stability theorem of Zames and later Willems. The corollary applies to the control of a dynamic system H 1 : x 1 → y 1 which is inside the sector [a 1,b 1], in which − ∞ a 1. It states that if a negative feedback controller with reference r 1 and control gain k 1 < − 1 a 1 is applied to H 1 : x 1 → y 1 such that x 1 = k 1 (r 1 −y 1) then the closed loop system Hcl− 1 : r 1 → y 1 is L m 2 (l m 2) stable. Simulations indicate the controller performs exceptionally well when applied to detailed STARMAC and Hummingbird aircraft models which includes blade flapping effects. I...|$|R
40|$|A novel, {{autonomous}} reconfigurable ultrasonic {{phased array}} inspection robot for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is presented. The robotic system significantly will reduce manual labor over current inspection regimes, {{as well as}} enabling inspection of inaccessible/hazardous areas such as {{those found in the}} nuclear and petrochemical industries. It will offer three quantitative benefits: improved inspection accuracy, improved safety and reduced inspection costs. The current major innovation is in embedding ultrasonic phased array technology into a small form-factor robotic vehicle, overcoming issues in ultrasonic coupling, miniaturized electronics and robot positioning. This paper presents an overview of the robot specification and system architecture along with details of a specific inspection scenario where the robot is required to inspect a saddle weld found in reheat bifurcation. This weld is formed from the intersection of two 60 mm thick steel pipes with diameters 500 and 300 mm. The robot will be capable of tracking the weld from either pipe, projecting an ultrasonic beam normal to the direction of travel. The design of a 2 MHz, 16 element embedded phased array controller is presented. A timing model of the controller details the throughput required to enable the robot to perform ultrasonic inspection while tracking the weld at 20 mm/s. The paper also considers robot positional estimation. The nature of the inspection prohibits the use of external positioning systems so the system is limited to on-board sensors, namely wheels encoders, a six <b>axis</b> <b>inertial</b> sensor and a surface feature tracking camera. The results section focuses on the characterization of inspection performance, driven in part by the ultrasonic phased array controller and robot positional estimation. A-Scans are presented to show the SNR of each array channel which was approximately 24 dB when measuring the back wall echo. It is shown that ultrasonic scan rate is limited by 802. 11 g wireless transmission from the robot to the host computer...|$|R
