5000|$|The Board of Ordnance & Fortifications held {{a meeting}} on March 15, 1913 to {{consider}} {{the adoption of a}} new type of machine gun… The Board convened for the competitive test of automatic machine guns at Springfield Armory on September 15, 1913. Seven makes of automatic machine guns were considered and tried out. The Lewis gun during the endurance test had 206 jams and malfunctions, 35 broken parts, 15 parts not broken but requiring replacement as against respectively 23, 0, 0, for the Vickers gun and 59, 7, 0 for the Automatic Machine Rifle [...]30, Model of 1909, Benét-Mercié. The Board is of the opinion that, {{with the exception of the}} Vickers gun, none of the other guns submitted showed sufficiently marked superiority for the military service, in comparison with the service Automatic Machine Rifle to warrant further consideration of them in the field test. The Board is of the unanimous opinion that the Vickers rifle caliber gun, light model, stood the most satisfactory test. As to the merits of the Vickers gun there is no question - it stood in a class by itself. Not a single part was broken nor replaced. Nor was there a jam worthy of the name during the entire series of tests. A better performance could not be desired. <b>Captain</b> John <b>S.</b> Butler, <b>Office</b> of the Chief of Ordnance ...|$|R
