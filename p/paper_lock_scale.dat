40|$|We present {{three new}} reader-writer <b>lock</b> {{algorithms}} that <b>scale</b> under high read-only contention. Many previous reader-writer locks suffer significant degradation when many readers attempt {{to acquire the}} lock concurrently, {{even though they are}} all allowed to hold the lock at the same time. In contrast, our <b>locks</b> <b>scale</b> almost perfectly when there is only read contention on a 4 -chip system with a total of 256 hardware threads. Two of the algorithms extend the MCS queue mutex to provide reader-writer synchronization with low overhead, and can be used when busy-waiting synchronization is appropriate. The third algorithm is an improvement on a production-quality reader-writer lock used in the Solaris TM kernel, which provides robust priority and flexible fairness guarantees. A key tool we developed to implement our reader-writer locks is the closable scalable nonzero indicator (C-SNZI), a variation on the SNZI object. C-SNZI objects allow us to significantly reduce the contention among reads when many readers try to acquire the lock concurrently, but keeps the acquisition overhead small in the absence of read contention. We present an algorithm for C-SNZI that achieves this goal, and show how it can be used by each of our lock algorithms to provide scalable reader-writer locks with different fairness guarantees...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of the toroidal flow velocity to the abrupt locking {{of it in the}} vicinity of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) tearing-mode- induced magnetic island is examined analytically and numerically using a diffusive transport model in a cylindrical plasma model. The resultant toroidal momentum confinement is shown to degrade significantly after mode locking, as is often observed on many tokamaks and reversed field pinches (RFPs). The degraded toroidal momentum confinement time in the core and edge regions of the plasma are evaluated and compared to experimental observations, The mode <b>locking</b> time <b>scale</b> itself is also investigated by using a model toroidal torque balance equation. The decrease of mode frequency during mode locking seems to be governed mainly by the electromagnetic torque exerted on the resistive layer. For tokamak plasmas, the mode <b>locking</b> time <b>scale</b> is found to be much shorter than the diffusion time scale, which is in general agreement with experimental observations...|$|R

30|$|We {{have shown}} in this paper that Reed-Solomon codes are good {{candidates}} for designing efficient steganographic schemes. They enable to mix wet <b>papers</b> (<b>locked</b> positions) and simple syndrome coding (small number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens. If we compare them to the previous studied codes, as binary BCH codes, Reed-Solomon codes improve the management of locked positions during embedding, hence ensuring a better management of the distortion; {{they are able to}} lock twice the number of positions. Moreover, they are optimal {{in the sense that they}} enable to lock the maximal number of positions. We first provide an efficient way to do it through Lagrange interpolation. We then propose a new algorithm based on Guruswami-Sudan list decoding, which is slower but provides an adaptive tradeoff between the number of locked positions and the average number of changes.|$|R

First, a simple and efficient scheme based on Lagrange interpolation is provided to achieve the optimal number of locked positions. We also consider a new and more general problem, mixing wet <b>papers</b> (<b>locked</b> positions) and simple syndrome coding (low number of changes) in order to face not only passive but also active wardens. Using list decoding techniques, we propose an efficient algorithm that enables an adaptive tradeoff between the number of locked positions and the number of changes.|$|R

40|$|Large scale {{structure}} and mixing processes are investigated in chemically reacting wakes and shear layers {{to which a}} periodic disturbance is applied. The experiments employ a diffusion-limited acid-base reaction to directly measure the extent of mixing. Optical diagnostics used include laser absorption and laser induced fluorescence. Absorption of laser light by reacted product provides a measure of cross-stream average product. Fluorescence was measured by a self-scanning linear photodiode array using high speed computer data acquisition to obtain the product distribution across the layer. Previous results showing that forcing alters the {{structure and}} growth rate of shear layers are confirmed. Forcing artificially extends the lifetime of vortices whose size {{is consistent with the}} disturbance wavelength. Amalgamation of smaller vortices is enhanced over that in the natural layer until the frequency <b>locked</b> <b>scale</b> is achieved. At high Reynolds number product measurements show reduction of product with forcing. At moderate Reynolds numbers, on the other hand, there is an increase in product when forced. In one case a five fold increase in product was observed. The differences are related to the different effects of forcing on entrainment, composition ratio and secondary structure. A dramatic, order of magnitude increase in mixing was discovered for certain forced wake flows. This effect is strongly associated with an interaction between the spanwise organized wake vortices and the test-section side walls. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the gateway role that the {{pleading}} standard can play in our civil litigation system, measuring the empirical effects of pleading policy changes embodied in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s controversial Twombly and Iqbal cases is important. In my earlier <b>paper,</b> <b>Locking</b> the Doors to Discovery, I argued that in doing so, special care is required in formulating the object of empirical study. Taking party behavior seriously, as Locking the Doors does, leads to empirical results suggesting that Twombly and Iqbal have had substantial effects among cases that face Rule 12 (b) (6) motions post-Iqbal. This paper responds to potentially important critiques of my empirical implementation made by the FJC 2 ̆ 7 s Joe Cecil and Professor David Engstrom. An additional contribution of the present paper is to elucidate some important challenges for empirical work in civil procedure. First, researchers should carefully consider which covariates belong in statistical models, while also taking care in assessing the empirical importance of controlling for covariates. Second, data collection protocols should be designed with behavioral assumptions in mind. But third, researchers should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good: even data protocols that are less than perfectly designed may be broadly useful...|$|R
