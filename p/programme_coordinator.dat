500|$|A man-eating lion {{was killed}} by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is {{believed}} to have killed and eaten at least 35people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the Rufiji Delta coastal region. Dr Rolf D. Baldus, the GTZ wildlife <b>programme</b> <b>coordinator,</b> commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large abscess underneath a molar that was cracked in several places. He further commented that [...] "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing." [...] GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. As in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.|$|E

One hundred and ninety two respondents were recruited from seventeen churches. Findings indicate that fear of HIV- and AIDS-related stigma and discrimination abound. The material and spiritual roles of church-based programmes in addressing the needs of people infected with HIV and affected by HIV and AIDS were stressed by the respondents. Whereas <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators</b> were well informed about HIV and AIDS, information that can dispel fears about stigma and correct myths about HIV-transmission should be tailored to reach ordinary men and women.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{strategies to}} facilitate the sustainability of a quality and safety improvement collaborative: the Safer Patients Initiative (SPI) and its successes. Design: A qualitative interview study with a repeated sample at two time points. Setting. Twenty organizations participating in the SPI programme in the UK. Participants: Twenty principal SPI <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators</b> took part in interviews {{towards the end of}} the supported phase of the programme, 12 of which were interviewed again a year later, along with another three replacement <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators,</b> totalling 35 interviewees across the two time points. Main Outcome Measures: Programme coordinators’ perceptions of facilitating strategies to the sustainability of the collaborative and its gains. Results: Qualitative analysis identified three overarching factors for the sustainability of SPI: (i) using programme improvement methodology and measurement of its outcomes; (ii) organizational strategies to ensure sustainability and (iii) alignment of goals with external requirements. Within these were eight themes identified by the coordinators as helping to sustain the efforts of the SPI programme and its successes. Conclusions: This study has presented what principle <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators</b> across 20 NHS organizations considered to be the key strategies to sustain their own improvement programme and its successes, during the supported phase of the programme and 1 year on. Recommendations are to consider these practical strategies in order to improve chances of maintaining changes and continuing a quality improvement programme beyond the formal cessation of the intervention...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} professionals' {{perceptions of}} factors that facilitate or hamper the implementation and continuation of a physical activity promotion programme in rehabilitation. Design: This study used a qualitative design. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 22) were conducted with rehabilitation professionals (n = 28) involved {{in the implementation of}} a physical activity promotion programme. Two additional interviews were conducted with the <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators</b> (n = 2). The study involved 18 rehabilitation organizations implementing the programme that targets people with disabilities or chronic diseases. Organizations were supported in the implementation process by the <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators.</b> Results: Commonly perceived facilitating factors were: involvement of committed and enthusiastic professionals; agreement with their organizations' vision/wishes; the perceived additional value of the programme; and opportunities to share knowledge and experience with professionals from other organizations. Commonly perceived hampering factors were: uncertainty about continuing the programme; limited flexibility; and lack of support from physicians and therapists to implement the programme. Conclusion: Professionals perceived a heterogeneous set {{of factors that}} facilitate and/or hamper the implementation and continuation of a physical activity promotion programme in rehabilitation.

This has {{a negative impact on}} the development of the country more especially on the socioeconomic improvement of the lives of its citizens. The Gauteng HIV/AIDS strategy and a Multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS are considered as a positive step to responding to the high prevalence rate that is evident across all age groups. The HIV/AIDS workplace programme is seen as a way of preventing or lessening the loss of skilled personnel due to ailments and deaths related to HIV/AIDS. However, there is inadequate information on the effectiveness of the implementation of the HIV/AIDS at workplace programme, in terms of codes of good practice. The aim and purpose of the research study was to explore leadership challenges facing <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators</b> in implementing the workplace programme during the 2006 / 7 financial year and to find out what solutions or alternatives can be implemented in achieving the expected service delivery outputs/targets. There were three main research questions that the study seeks to answer, that is, has leadership, with commitment and focus, been a contributing factor to effective responses in the implementation of HIV/AIDS workplace programme in GPG departments; what are the common problems or challenges that are experienced by <b>programme</b> <b>coordinators</b> in implementing the programme and what creative ways can be administered to improve the present situation? Both quantitative and qualitative research was undertaken and a self-administered questionnaire was developed and administered by the researcher for data collection. The study finds that, though there is general agreement on leadership commitment by the ten departments that participated in the study, there are some departments that require support and dedicated leaders for the effectiveness of the HIV/AIDS workplace programme. Recommendations are made in the last chapter. This study, in not so many words, calls for a policy review of the HIV/AIDS workplace programme in the Gauteng Province...|$|R
