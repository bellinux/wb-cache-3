5|$|By 1300, the Levant {{was entirely}} in Mamluk hands and divided into several {{province}}s. Lajjun {{became the center}} of a nahiya (subdistrict) in the province of Safad, encompassing the villages of al-Ashir, Kawkab al-Hawa, and Jenin. The Mamluks fortified it in the 15th century and the town became a major staging post on the <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> (braid) between Egypt and Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} troops escorting Choe and his Korean party reached Jiantiao Battalion on March 8; on {{the next}} day, they travelled by boat across Sanmen Bay to reach the Yuexi Police Station and Post House. On March 10, the party travelled along the <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> to Baiqiao Station, a courier centre between Taizhou and Ningbo prefectures. The courier officials were eager to see the Koreans off, since a party of 43 was a somewhat large group for a courier station to provide sudden accommodations for.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, the current {{fortress}} was built {{close to the}} desert edge by the Zengid–Ayyubid lord Shirkuh. The latter's descendants held al-Rahba as a hereditary fief granted by Saladin until 1264. One of them, Shirkuh II, oversaw a third major reconstruction in 1207. Through the early Mamluk era (late 13th–14th centuries), the fortress was continuously restored and strengthened {{as a result of}} frequent sieges by the Ilkhanid Mongols of Iraq. Al-Rahba was the most important Mamluk fortress along the Euphrates, an administrative center and the terminal stop on the sultanate's <b>postal</b> <b>route.</b> It fell into disuse during Ottoman rule (1517–1918) and from then until the early 20th century, the fortress primarily served as a shelter for local shepherds and their flocks. Excavations were carried out at the site between 1976 and 1981.|$|E
50|$|Up to 1895 <b>postal</b> <b>routes</b> were {{composed}} mainly of the Oruro-Antofagasta railway, riders on horseback and river boats. Internal <b>postal</b> <b>routes</b> remained poor until {{the introduction of}} airmail in the 1920s.|$|R

5|$|In 1264, the Mamluk sultan Baybars (r. 1260–1277) {{replaced}} the Ayyubid governor of al-Rahba {{with one of}} his mamluk officers from Egypt. Al-Rahba's garrison and its commander held a high place in the Mamluk military hierarchy. The fortress, along with and al-Bira to the north, emerged as the principal Mamluk bulwark against Mongol invasions of Syria's eastern frontier. It was the Mamluks' most important fortress along the Euphrates, supplanting Raqqa, which had been the traditional Muslim center in the Euphrates valley since the 10th century. A large population of refugees from areas ruled by the Mongols settled in al-Rahba as did many people from the adjacent, unfortified town of Mashhad al-Rahba (former site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk, modern-day Mayadin). It was also the terminal stop of the Mamluk barid (<b>postal</b> <b>route)</b> and an administrative center.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian Air Lines {{carried out}} a trial <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> from Ålesund to Tromsø for four weeks in 1934, using a Junkers W 34 from 7 June to 3 August. The trials were {{successful}} and the following year the airline commenced flights with the larger Junkers Ju 52. The routes were summer-only; for instance in 1938 they lasted from 4 April to 30 September. These services continued until 4 September 1939, when all commercial flights were banned.|$|E
25|$|As one of {{his many}} {{responsibilities}} as clerk to the postmaster general, Bradley began to compile information for a complete postal service map, including routes, stations, and distances between each.

25|$|The public {{postal service}} in Poland is {{operated}} by Poczta Polska (the Polish Post). It was created on 18 October 1558, when King Sigismund II Augustus established a permanent <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> from Kraków to Venice. The service was dissolved during the foreign partitions in the 18th century. After regaining independence in 1918, Poland saw the rapid {{development of the}} postal system as new services were introduced including money transfers, payment of pensions, delivery of magazines, and air mail. The government-owned enterprise of Polish Post, Telegraph and Telephone (Polska Poczta, Telegraf i Telefon) was established in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{component}} to Baybar's rule was intrastate communication. To accomplish this, he instituted a postal network that extended across {{the cities of}} Egypt and Syria. The need for smooth delivery of correspondence also led to the large scale repair or construction of roads and bridges along the <b>postal</b> <b>route.</b> Baybars attempted to institute dynastic rule by assigning his four-year-old son al-Said Barakah as co-sultan, thereby ending the Mamluk tradition of electing a leader, but this effort was ultimately unsuccessful, at least for his Zahirid household; successful rulership became highly dependent on Baybars' personal qualities. However, Baybars success in establishing centralized rule resulted in the consolidation of the Mamluk Sultanate. Through opening diplomatic channels with the Mongols, Baybars also sought to stifle a potential alliance between the Mongols and the Christian powers of Europe, while also sowing divisions between the Mongol Ilkhanate and the Mongol Golden Horde. In addition, his diplomacy was also intended to maintain the flow of Turkic mamluks from Mongol-held Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|During Mamluk rule, the Bedouin of Syria {{were used}} as {{auxiliaries}} in the Mamluks' wars with the Mongols based in Iraq and Anatolia. In central and northern Syria, the Bedouin came {{under the authority of}} the Al Fadl emirs in their capacity as the hereditary officeholders of the amir al-ʿarab (commander of the Bedouin) post, beginning with Emir Isa ibn Muhanna (r. 1260–1284). The Al Mira emirs held a similar, but lower-ranking office, in southern Syria, and its preeminent emir was known as malik al-ʿarab (king of the Bedouin). In al-Sharqiyah, the Tha'laba, whose encampments were close to the Mamluk seat of government, were tasked with maintaining and protecting the barid (<b>postal</b> <b>route)</b> in their district and were occasionally appointed to government posts. The Tayy in Syria and Egypt were both required to supply Arabian horses to the Mamluks for use in the army and barid. Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad had a special affinity for the Bedouin and maintained strong relations with the tribes of Syria and Egypt. However, following his death, the state's relations with the Bedouin deteriorated. The Tha'laba left their semi-permanent camp in al-Sharqiya to maraud across the country and joined the revolt of the al-A'id tribe in the mid-14th century.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, lucrative <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> {{contracts}} {{were given to}} local contractors on the Pacific coast and southern regions of the United States. [...] These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was placed on official Post Office documents. [...] These remote routes were hundreds of miles long {{and went to the}} most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. [...] Previously inaccessible areas on the Pacific coast received weekly, semi-weekly, and daily mail because of these routes. [...] However, corruption ensued, with contractors paid exorbitant fees for fictitious routes and for providing low quality postal service to the rural areas. One contractor, F.P. Sawyer, made $500,000 a year on routes in the Southwest.|$|E
500|$|Deir al-Balah {{dates back}} to the Late Bronze Age when it served as a {{fortified}} outpost for the New Kingdom of Egypt. A monastery was built there by the Christian monk Hilarion in the mid-4th century AD and is currently believed to be the site of a mosque dedicated to Saint George, known locally as al-Khidr. During the Crusader-Ayyubid wars, Deir al-Balah was the site of a strategic coastal fortress known as [...] "Darum" [...] which was continuously contested, dismantled and rebuilt by both sides until its final demolition in 1196. Afterward, the site grew to become a large village on the <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> of the Mamluk Sultanate (13th-15th centuries). It served as an episcopal see of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem in Ottoman times until the late 19th century.|$|E
500|$|During Sultan Baybar's reign (1260–1277), a barid (<b>postal</b> <b>route)</b> {{was created}} between Egypt and Syria, which enabled the sultan to remain {{constantly}} notified of {{developments in the}} provinces. It served as a major centralizing factor in the Mamluk state, and each postal station required transport horses, which the tribes provided. According to Sato, the tribes' supply of horses and camels was [...] "indispensable for the maintenance" [...] of the barid. Noble horses and young camels were also provided by the amir al-ʿarab to the royal stables of the Mamluk sultans on an annual basis. Under the early Ottomans, the amir al-ʿarab was required to provision the sultan's stables with 1,050 young camels and 30 young horses, the collective annual value of which was 240,000 akçe. This formed part of the sultan's revenue from the Damascus Eyalet.|$|E

500|$|Lajjun ( [...] , al-Lajjûn) was a Palestinian Arab village located [...] in Mandatory Palestine, {{northwest}} of Jenin and [...] {{south of the}} remains of the biblical city of Megiddo. Named after an early Roman legion camp in Syria Palaestina province called [...] "Legio", predating the village at that location, Lajjun's history of habitation spanned some 2,000 years. Under Abbasid rule it was the capital of a subdistrict, during Mamluk rule it served as an important station in the <b>postal</b> <b>route,</b> and during Ottoman rule it was the capital of a district that bore its name. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire towards the end of World War I, Lajjun and all of Palestine was placed under the administration of the British Mandate. The village was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when it was captured by Israel. Most of its residents subsequently fled and settled in the nearby town of Umm al-Fahm.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1870s during the Grant Administration, lucrative <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> {{contracts}} {{were given to}} local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States. [...] These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents. [...] These remote routes were hundreds of miles long {{and went to the}} most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts, an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office; the ring consisted of contractors, postal clerks, and various intermediary brokers. Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell, Grant's 1869 appointment, was Postmaster-General. An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell, but he was censured by the minority House report. [...] A $40,000 bribe to the 42nd Congress by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation. In 1876, another congressional investigation under a Democratic House shut down the postal ring for a few years.|$|E

2500|$|Abraham Bradley Jr. (February 22, 1767 [...] May 7, 1838) was an American lawyer, judge, and {{cartographer}} who was {{assistant postmaster}} general for 30 years during the earliest {{history of the}} United States Post Office Department. Bradley was responsible for moving the federal government's post office from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the new capital at Washington, D.C., hosting the national post office {{in his own home}} for a period. The continuity brought by Bradley's long employment during the tenure of five different United States postmasters general helped establish the budding postal service as a reliable provider; Bradley drew detailed and innovative <b>postal</b> <b>route</b> maps which contributed significantly to the office's efficiency.

The longest stretch included part of the current Old Albany Post Road. The colony eventually became the English Province of New York, and in 1703 its legislative body provided for the postal road to be a [...] "public and common general highway" [...] along the same route, starting in Kingsbridge and ending at a ferry landing in present-day Rensselaer. That legislation authorized the road to be as much as four rods (...) wide where necessary.
