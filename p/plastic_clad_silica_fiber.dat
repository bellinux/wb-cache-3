40|$|Evanescent wave {{absorption}} based PCS (<b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> <b>silica)</b> <b>fiber</b> optic pH sensor {{is constructed}} by encapsulation of indicator dyes in the heterogeneous inorganic hybrid silica-titania nanomatrix {{in the presence}} of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant by sol-gel method. A nanoporous multilayers (triple layer and six layers) of silica-titania hybrid is deposited on 5 cm uncladed middle portion of the fiber by dip-coating sol-gel technique. The CTAB surfactant expressively improved the host matrix structure and enhanced its porosity. Thermally stable, adhesive and smooth thin nanocladding has been examined using microscopic and thermal analysis. Indicators encapsulated nanomatrices are highly sensitive to pH and show optical output signals in terms of intensity. Therefore, it provides confirmation that interactions between the host matrix and pH-indicator molecules are in good assistance. Furthermore, experimental findings reveal that the sensing species are probably better encapsulated in the matrix and show no leaching of sensing molecules. The prepared nanosensors exhibit a much faster response time because of the material to be sensed diffuses faster into the triple-layer sensors < 2 s. These pH sensors are found to have 60 days (2 months) age stability and high reproducibility. A repeatable response over a wide range of pH values between 3 and 11 is obtained...|$|E

The two different set-up being proposed here {{has the potential to}} detect concentration changes in a liquid to a good degree of precision [...] Important characteristics of the proposed sensors are that they utilize inexpensive materials like multimode plastic optical fiber and are applicable for various solutions at normal temperatures.

40|$|New {{formulations}} of cladding materials have become available {{in recent times}} for Hard <b>Plastic</b> <b>Clad</b> <b>Silica</b> (HPCS) <b>fibers,</b> Initial data showed gains in some properties, particularly dynamic strength, especially for high numerical aperture (NA) fibers. A systematic study has been undertaken to determine the full strength and fatigue behavior of these HPCS fibers and to make comparisons to earlier HPCS fibers. Preliminary results, now confirmed, has shown improved median dynamic strength and higher Weibull slope. Full results are presented below including fatigue behavior and optical properties. These fibers have many applications and benefits in the high power delivery and medical laser uses as highlighted below. High power diode laser systems with their laser diode bars and arrays not only require special fibers to couple directly to the diode emitters, but also require special fibers to couple from the laser to application sites. These latter power delivery fibers are {{much larger than the}} internal fibers but still must be flexible, and have not only good strength but also good fatigue behavior. This particularly important industrial systems using robotic arms to apply the high power laser energy at a treatment site. The optical properties of HPCS fibers are well suited for the needs of the delivery of high power from diode laser bars and arrays to an application site. Benefits of strong median dynamic strengths and tighter flaw distributions in such cases will be discussed. Many medical applications, especially endoscopic ones, can benefit from the use of highly flexible, high NA, cost effective, HPCS optical fibers. Benefits of high strength and good fatigue behavior for such fibers in endoscopic procedures, including laser surgery, are discussed briefly including implications for mechanical reliability in medical and industrial settings...|$|R

40|$|This Letter {{reports a}} lead (II) ion sensor {{composed}} of a tapered multimode fibre (MMF) coated with chitosan. The diameter and length of the tapered fibre region is 20 Î¼m and 1 cm, respectively. Tapered MMF is used {{because it is more}} flexible and compact compared with <b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> <b>silica.</b> Chitosan is chosen as the sensing layer because it can absorb heavy metal ions due to its unique properties as polyelectrolyte and chelating agent. The refractive index of the chitosan layer changes as it absorbs lead (II) ion and this leads to an increase in the absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer. This is tested by immersing the sensor in a solution that contains lead (II) ion with different concentrations, from 0. 2 to 1 ppm. The results show that the absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer increased as the concentration of the lead (II) ion increased. The sensor's average sensitivity is measured as 40. 554 abs/ppm. This sensor is simpler compared with surface plasmon resonance-based lead (II) ion sensor because it does not require metal coating prior to the sensing layer coating...|$|R

40|$|A double <b>clad</b> solid <b>silica</b> <b>fiber</b> is newly {{designed}} for applications which need the high efficiency operation of two colors of light. Ultrashort pulses {{with a central}} wavelength of 800 nm are delivered by {{the core of the}} double clad fiber which can realize the transmission of the optical pulses with a net chromatic dispersion of zero. This is achieved by integrating the double clad fiber with a pair of long period gratings, which allows optical pulses to propagate in a higher order mode (LP 02) {{in the middle of the}} fiber as well as in a fundamental mode (LP 01) at the beginning and end of the fiber. The index profile of the double clad fiber is engineered so that the higher order mode has high anomalous dispersion that can be used to compensate for normal dispersion of the fundamental mode. By controlling the lengths of the fiber where pulses are in a fundamental and in a higher order modes, the fiber with total zero dispersion can be realized. The double clad fiber can collect 100 % of visible light within the numerical aperture of 0. 21 with a loss of the optical pulses less than 1 %.
