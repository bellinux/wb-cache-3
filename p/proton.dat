5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a <b>proton,</b> or a <b>proton</b> into a neutron. The neutron to <b>proton</b> transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while <b>proton</b> to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a <b>proton</b> changes to a neutron.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{interstellar}} pickup <b>protons</b> and turbulence on the structure and dynamics of the solar wind, we have developed a fully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic solar wind model that treats interstellar pickup <b>protons</b> as a separate fluid and incorporates the transport of turbulence and turbulent heating. The governing system of equations combines the mean-field equations for the solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and pickup <b>protons</b> and the turbulence transport equations for the turbulent energy, normalized cross-helicity, and correlation length. The model equations account for photoionization of interstellar hydrogen atoms and their charge exchange with solar wind <b>protons,</b> energy transfer from pickup <b>protons</b> to solar wind <b>protons,</b> and plasma heating by turbulent dissipation. Separate mass and energy equations are used for the solar wind and pickup <b>protons,</b> though a single momentum equation is employed under the assumption that the pickup <b>protons</b> are comoving with the solar wind <b>protons.</b> We compute the global structure of the solar wind plasma, magnetic field, and turbulence in the region from 0. 3 to 100 AU for a source magnetic dipole on the Sun tilted by 0 deg -. 90 deg and compare our results with Voyager 2 observations. The results computed with and without pickup <b>protons</b> are superposed to evaluate quantitatively the deceleration and heating effects of pickup <b>protons,</b> the overall compression of the magnetic field in the outer heliosphere caused by deceleration, and the weakening of corotating interaction regions by the thermal pressure of pickup <b>protons...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Atomic nuclei {{consist of}} <b>protons</b> and {{neutrons}} bound {{together by the}} residual strong force. Because <b>protons</b> are positively charged, they repel each other. Neutrons, which are electrically neutral, stabilize the nucleus in two ways. Their copresence pushes <b>protons</b> slightly apart, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the <b>protons,</b> and they exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on <b>protons.</b> For this reason, one or more neutrons are necessary for two or more <b>protons</b> to be bound into a nucleus. As the number of <b>protons</b> increases, so does the ratio of neutrons to <b>protons</b> necessary to ensure a stable nucleus (see graph at right).
