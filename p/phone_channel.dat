40|$|Abstract. Application domains such as in-car human-machine {{interaction}} require noise-robust front-ends {{in order}} {{to cope with the}} noisy situations encountered in practice. Moreover, when speech is captured through a cellphone, the <b>phone</b> <b>channel</b> characteristics are often unknown. It is thus desirable to estimate and remove both <b>phone</b> <b>channel</b> characteristics and ambient noise, in an online manner. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, a novel channel normalization method is proposed, that is used before noise reduction, at the magnitude spectrogram level. It removes the convolutive channel, and reduces the stationary part of the ambient noise. Second, an alternative to classical spectral subtraction is proposed, called “Unsupervised Spectral Subtraction ” (USS), which does not require any parameter tuning. Channel normalization followed by USS (two steps) permit to reach an ASR performance very {{similar to that of the}} ETSI Advanced Front-End (Wiener filtering, with many steps and parameters). The computational cost of the proposed approach is very low, which makes it fit for real-time applications. Furthermore, channel normalization followed by the ETSI Advanced Front-End leads to a major improvement in noisy conditions, and best overall results. 2 IDIAP–RR 06 - 09 s(t) h(t) x(t) n(t) Figure 1 : Model of the problem: recognize speech from the observed signal x(t) = h(t) ∗ (s(t) + n(t)), where n(t) is the additive acoustic noise and h(t) is the transmission channel (e. g. cellphone). ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} {{previous}} techniques for efficient causality logging in mobile networks and presents a lighter logging mechanism. The technique {{is based on}} a particular partial order that is generated by the interleaving of events on mobile hosts that are mediated by the same support station. I. Introduction Mobile computing systems are frequently designed as a network of fixed nodes, mobile support stations (MSS), that give connectivity to a set of mobile hosts (MH) [1]. The MSSs are interconnected by a high bandwidth wire-line network where communication costs are inexpensive. In contrast, the MHs always communicate with the mediation of a hosting MSS using a low-bandwidth wireless or <b>phone</b> <b>channel</b> where costs are at issue. This class of mobile computing systems, although excluding direct communication among MHs, models a vast range of existing systems that include wireless networks of MHs bound to local cells, and nomadic MHs that bind to different MSSs as access points to a wide area network. Distributed applications that build on this class of mobile computing systems are often modeled as a set of concurrent activities distributed among different MHs. Tracking the causal relationships among these concurrent activities is a basic mechanism for the analysis and debugging of distributed applications and a step towards the design of message delivery and replica consistency policies. It is well established [7] that in a distributed system the causal dependency can be fully characterized by the use of vector clocks [7, 2, 5]. However vector clocks are very sensitive to scalability issues since the vector size is bound to the number of activities, which are here bound to the number of MHs. Clearly, a dependency tracking mechanism that is bound to the number of MSSs an [...] ...|$|E

The tactics used by these scammers have evolved {{over time and}} they have targeted an ever increasing number of technology brands. Although recent research has provided insights into TSS, these scams have now evolved to exploit ubiquitously used online services such as search and sponsored advertisements served in response to search queries. We use a data-driven approach to understand search-and-ad abuse by TSS to gain visibility into the online infrastructure that facilitates it. By carefully formulating tech support queries with multiple search engines, we collect data about both the support infrastructure and the websites to which TSS victims are directed when they search online for tech support resources. We augment this with a DNS-based amplification technique to further enhance visibility into this abuse infrastructure. By analyzing the collected data, we demonstrate that tech support scammers are (1) successful in getting major as well as custom search engines to return links to websites controlled by them, and (2) {{they are able to}} get ad networks to serve malicious advertisements that lead to scam pages. Our study period of 8 months uncovered over 9, 000 TSS domains, of both passive and aggressive types, with minimal overlap between sets that are reached via organic search results and sponsored ads.

Moreover, we found little overlap with domains that are reached via abuse of domain parking and URL-shortening services which was investigated previously. Thus, investigation of search-and-ad abuse provides new insights into TSS tactics and helps detect previously unknown abuse infrastructure that facilitates these scams.

40|$|When {{studying}} channel {{properties in}} cellular networks two key parameters are the delay spread {{and the type}} of fading. The delay spread holds information about the time dispersion the channel induces, whereas the effect the channel has on the power of propagating waves is reflected in the fading. Line-of-sight communications results in Rician fading whereas non-line-of- sight means Rayleigh fading. Measurements and classification of channel environments have, to the writer's knowledge, so far only been done with the use of complex sounding devices. In this work, channel classification is performed using low-level data from a regular cell phone. Measurements were performed with a real cell phone in a controlled milieu where different radio environments were emulated. With the use of channel estimates from the cell phone, probability density function parameter estimations were performed with both maximum likelihood and method of moments techniques. The Rician K-factor, which expresses the ratio of line- of-sight components to scattered waves, was calculated with the results from the estimation. The K-factor calculations showed, as expected, obvious differences between various simulated environments. The K-factor increases with stronger line-of- sight component, which is in line with theory. For weak direct waves, the estimate often becomes zero which is due to the difficulty of detecting a weak direct wave in lots of scattered waves. To achieve better results, other estimation techniques might therefore be necessary. For repeated measurements with the same settings the variance of the K- factor estimates is quite high. Also, the variance increases with stronger direct wave. This might be due to additive noise during measurement. The mean of the K-factor estimates seems to be 3 dB higher than expected. This offset is possibly due to the difference in the noise power between complex and real noise, which is exactly 3 dB, or internal differences in the power level of the channel simulator. The reason for the difference is not clear but power measurements confirms it. With compensation for this, the calculated K-factors aligns much better to the expected K-factors. Although they are not exactly the same, they are so close that with further studies, classification of radio channels with the use of cell <b>phone</b> <b>channel</b> estimates should be possible.

40|$|Griffith University’s Division of Information Services {{provides}} integrated library, {{information technology}} and flexible learning services to Griffith’s community of approximately 30, 000 staff and students. A Division-wide restructure in 2001 {{led to the creation}} of InfoServices, a new organisational unit created from members of library and information technology front-line staff. This unit was presented with the challenge of answering the majority of customer inquiries related to the Division’s products and services. InfoServices seeks to resolve 80 % of all customer inquiries at first contact, regardless of product. In order to meet this demand, InfoServices implemented a multi-channel multi-tier service delivery model. InfoServices’ model comprises of three channels; the face-to-face service provided from each of the six campus libraries, a <b>phone</b> <b>channel,</b> delivered via a purpose-built 20 seat contact centre at the Nathan (Brisbane, Queensland) campus, and a digital channel, comprising web, e-mail and live electronic assistance. This multi-tier structure consists of Tier Zero, consisting of web-based and other self-help materials such as knowledge bases, frequently asked questions, and web forms. These resources empower clients to resolve their issues without intervention from InfoServices. Tier One encompasses the Library information desks, the contact centre and the e-mail answer service. Tiers Two and Three are specialist support groups such as Network Administrators and Information Literacy Specialists. To ensure the highest standards of customer service, InfoServices has standardised its service offerings, procedures and branding across all three channels, in addition to developing robust protocols for escalation and resolution of customer issues. Providing resolution to 80 % of all customer enquiries has required a large amount of staff training and development. The three major directions of the training have been cross-skilling the staff across both library and information technology support, the ongoing development of best practice work methods for each of the products InfoServices supports, and a program of customer service training, designed and delivered in-house. Each of these training opportunities has been developed and provided for all InfoServices staff - regardless of campus or channel; further strengthening the consistency of InfoServices service. The paper further discusses the change management implications of bringing together Library and Information Technology staff to provide an integrated service, in particular the issues related to providing an effective service during periods of great internal change.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{explosive}} growth and adoption of mobile phones has become commonplace in our everyday lives (Haghirian, Madlberger & Tanuskova 2005). In 1997, there were only 215 million people worldwide who used mobile phones as communication devices (Bauer, Barnes, Reichardt & Neumann 2005). Today, {{it is estimated that}} 2 billion people own a mobile phone worldwide and this number makes up a third of the entire human population (Wireless Intelligence 2005). Mobile phones are no longer thought of as mere personal communication tools (Cheong & Park 2005; Ito & Okabe 2005). They have become a fashion symbol for teenagers and young adults (Katz and Sugiyama 2005). Personalised ring tones, colours, display logos and accessories are individualised accordingly to suit individuals’ preferences (Bauer, Barnes, Reichardt & Neumann 2005). Furthermore, mobile phones are no longer just a platform for voice calls and sending and receiving text messages such as Short Messaging Service (SMS). Photos, pictures and video clips can be attached as a Multimedia Message Service (MMS) for communication purposes too (Okazaki 2005 a). With the recent introduction of 3 G mobile technology, mobile phone users are able to perform more activities via their 3 G enabled phone sets. They are able to browse the Internet fairly quickly, access online banking, play video games wirelessly, watch television programs, check for weather forecasts, allow instant messaging, and perform live video-conferencing (Okazaki 2005 b). The rapid growth of the mobile industry has created a foundation for mobile commerce (m-commerce). M-commerce facilitates electronic commerce via the use of mobile devices to communicate and conduct transactions through public and private networks (Balasubramanian, Peterson & Jarvenpaa 2002). The current emerging set of applications and services that m-commerce offers include mobile financial applications, mobile entertainment and services, product locating and shopping, wireless engineering, mobile auctions, wireless data centres and mobile advertising (Malloy, Varshney & Snow 2002). Commercial research has indicated that consumers’ interest in m-commerce services and mobile payments have increased from 23 % in 2001 to 39 % in 2003 (Harris, Rettie & Cheung 2005). It is projected that by 2009 the global mobile commerce market will be worth at least US$ 40 billion (Juniper Research 2004). 2 Considering the projected worth of mobile commerce and the number of mobile subscribers, mobile marketing is increasingly attractive as companies can now directly convey their marketing efforts to reach their consumers without time or location barriers (Barnes 2002). The potential of using the mobile medium to market is now more attractive than before (Karjaluoto 2005), as it can assist companies in building stronger relationships with consumers (Barwise and Strong 2002), and {{can be used as a}} promotional channel to reach consumers directly (Barnes 2002; Kavassalis,, Spyropoulou, Drossos, Mitrokostas, Gikas, & Hatzistamatiou 2003; Okazaki 2004) anywhere and anytime. However many aspects of mobile marketing are still in its infancy (Bauer, Barnes, Reichardt & Neumann 2005; Haghirian, Madlberger & Tanuskova 2005; Okazaki 2004, 2005 b; Tsang, Ho & Liang 2004). Research into mobile marketing is currently lacking as this is a relatively new phenomenon. Very few studies have been conducted to demonstrate how the mobile <b>phone</b> <b>channel</b> can be successfully integrated into marketing activities of companies (Balasubramanian, Peterson & Jarvenpaa 2002; Haghirian, Madlberger & Tanuskova 2005). Furthermore, no studies to date have compared the effectiveness of this mobile medium in delivering advertising and sales promotion with other more established media such as the print medium (Lee and Brown 2005). The fundamental question that remains unresolved is, “What is the difference between mobile marketing and traditional marketing?” Will this new form of marketing be effective? How will consumers respond to this form of marketing? What will be the benefit to marketers when consumers receive this type of advertising? These are just some of the issues that marketers are concerned with in order to evaluate the mobile channels for marketing purposes and are questions that are core to Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and technology intervention research...|$|E
