5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> some other breeds. The fold {{of the ear}} can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|Technical {{difficulties}} {{included the}} very high transistor counts needed to support the wide instruction words and the large caches. There were also structural problems within the project, as the {{two parts of the}} joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities that had never been implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> occur with rear projection.|$|E

5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis {{were more likely to have}} eye <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> the Cardigan breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> it solves.|$|E
5|$|VR {{has given}} mixed {{statements}} about the fault-sensitivity of the train. Pentti Kuokkanen, project coordinator of VR Engineering downplayed the problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit, the Sm4, in 1999. According to him, the Pendolino had been VR's most reliable passenger train during winter 1998–1999. In 2006, VR's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group. In 2010, the company's head of traffic control Mauno Haapala stated that the Sm3 was not more fault-sensitive than their other trains. However during winter 2011, VR Group's head of service and production department Pertti Saarela gave a totally different answer, saying that Pendolinos {{are more prone to}} failures especially during winter. It is impossible to know if the train has more <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> VR's other rolling stock, as the company does not give out punctuality statistics for specific train types.|$|E

5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration <b>problems</b> <b>than</b> the fire.|$|E
