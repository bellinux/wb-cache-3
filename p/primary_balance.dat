After optimizing, the effect of <b>primary</b> <b>balancing</b> is validated. After <b>primary</b> <b>balancing,</b> the vibration is measured on the engine at various locations. Balancer shaft is designed for the unbalanced forces exist after <b>primary</b> <b>balancing.</b> Balancer shaft is introduced into the simulation model and simulated the running at 6000 rpm and unbalanced forces on the crankshaft are measured.

40|$|This paper calculates {{structural}} balances for EU-countries and relates them to fiscal sustainability. Although the Stability Pact implicitly {{accepts the}} need {{to distinguish between the}} structural and the cyclical component of net deficits, the issue of long-term sustainability is only covered by the need not to exceed a certain threshold value of the net lending. While the OECD and the European Commission (EU) assume constant elasticities when calculating cyclical budget components to derive structural deficits from the net deficits, the present paper choses time series technique to extract the structural balances directly. = Structural balances are calculated on a disaggregated level considering five different government receipts and expenditure components. With the same method, structural <b>primary</b> <b>balances</b> are estimated to analyse long-term sustainability of fiscal policy in the EU. Therefore, we set the structural primary surpluses against those <b>primary</b> <b>balances,</b> necessary to stabilise the debt to GDP ratio.

40|$|The {{sizeable}} {{fiscal consolidation}} required {{to stabilize the}} debt-to-GDP ratios in several countries {{in the aftermath of}} the global crisis raises a crucial question on its feasibility. To answer this question, we rely on historical evidence from a sample of 91 adjustment episodes of countries during 1945 – 2012 that needed and wanted to adjust in order to stabilize debt to GDP. We find that, in at least half the cases, countries improved their cyclically adjusted <b>primary</b> <b>balances</b> by close to 5 percent of GDP. We also observe that, while countries typically make substantial efforts to stabilize debt, once this objective is achieved, they tend to ease their <b>primary</b> <b>balances</b> and do not necessarily get back to their initial lower debt-to-GDP ratio. We find that consolidations tended to be larger when the initial deficit was high and adjustment efforts were sustained over time. Fiscal adjustments also tended to be larger when accompanied by an easing of monetary conditions and, to a lesser extent, by an improvement in credit conditions...|$|R
