40|$|While it is {{well known}} that the U. S. Constitution prohibits the {{government}} from taking private property for public use without fair compensation, few realize that potential claimants have six years from the date the taking accrues to file a claim for damages. A six-year time limit, even strictly applied, may seem sufficiently lenient on its face. However, in 1994 the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently ruled, in interpreting this time limit, that plaintiffs who suffered severe erosion damage from a government channeling and port project constructed in the early 1950 s were not barred from filing suit in 1992 -over forty years after the erosion began. In Applegate v. United States, the court concluded that the date the governmental act became a permanent taking, or when the taking 2 ̆ 2 accrued, 2 ̆ 2 was not the date the government 2 ̆ 2 invaded 2 ̆ 2 the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 property, or the date the plaintiffs first noticed property damage. Instead, the court used the date on which the government last pledged to repair the damage to determine whether the plaintiffs met the six-year statute of limitations. Because the government initiated plans to restore the damage as late as 1988, the court found that the statute of limitations had not run in 1992, the year the plaintiffs filed their claim. The Applegate decision, therefore, permits courts to use one governmental act to determine whether the <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is met, and another to determine the substantive legal issue of whether a taking occurred. In light of the fact that courts must first consider the <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> issue before reaching the merits of a particular claim, the Applegate decision will provide more opportunities to sue the government for a taking. Although it may appear that the Applegate court stretched the six-year statute of limitations beyond its limits, this Note will demonstrate that the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision conforms with takings case law and upholds the principles of fairness that underlie statutes of limitations. This Note will also demonstrate that if the court had ruled that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 claim, it would effectively relieve the federal government of its responsibility to repair government-caused damage or to compensate owners for taking their property, not only for the Applegate plaintiffs, but also for most other takings victims as well. Part II of this Note describes the procedure a property owner must follow to sue the government for taking her property, and the additional burdens coastal property owners face when they claim a government act caused flooding or erosion damage. Part III summarizes the Applegate decision. Part IV discusses the conflict between procedural time limits and the long periods that may elapse from the time of the governmental act to the time the act damages the property. Part V also describes methods courts have developed to ensure that time limits do not unjustly prevent a plaintiff from pursuing her claim in court. Part VI concludes that by requiring the government to consider the long-term impact of its acts on private property, the Applegate decision will help to preserve notions of individual justice and responsibility on the part of the government...|$|E

40|$|The {{judicial}} Zeitgeist towards delay on {{the part}} of claimants has undergone a radical shift in England in recent years. In the not too distant past, delay in prosecuting an action, no matter how inordinate and inexcusable, was not grounds for dismissal unless the delay prejudiced the defendant. Furthermore, where the limitation period was still extant, a f 3 i. lure to comply with <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> set by the court would not result in dismissal as this would merely aggravate the delay, as claimants, save in exceptional cases, could simply bring fresh proceedings. However, in light of bourgeoning courts lists, the courts gradually retreated from this relaxed attitude toWards dilatoriness. The turning point is often regarded as the decision of the House of Lords in Grovit v Doctor. In this case, Lord Woolf, with whom the other law lords agreed, held that the court may strike out proceedings as an abuse of process if the claimant has no intention of bringing the proceedings to a conclusion. Importantly, Lord Woolf indicated that delay itself is evidence of. the absence of such an intention...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study {{sought to}} define the {{additional}} effective radiation dose, <b>procedural</b> <b>time,</b> and contrast medium needed to obtain fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements after a diagnostic coronary angiogram. Background The FFR measurements performed {{at the end of}} a diagnostic angiogram allow the obtaining of functional information that complements the anatomic findings. Methods In 200 patients (mean age 66 ± 10 years) undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography, FFR was measured in at least 1 intermediate coronary artery stenosis. Hyperemia was achieved by intracoronary (n = 180) or intravenous (n = 20) adenosine. The radiation dose (mSv), <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> (min), and contrast medium (ml) needed for diagnostic angiography and FFR were recorded. Results A total of 296 stenoses (1. 5 ± 0. 7 stenoses per patient) were assessed. The additional mean radiation dose, <b>procedural</b> <b>time,</b> and contrast medium needed to obtain FFR expressed as a percentage of the entire procedure were 30 ± 16 % (median 4 mSv, range 2. 4 to 6. 7 mSv), 26 ± 13 % (median 9 min, range 7 to 13 min), and 31 ± 16 % (median 50 ml, range 30 to 90 ml), respectively. The radiation dose and contrast medium during FFR were similar after intravenous and intracoronary adenosine, though the <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> was slightly longer with intravenous adenosine (median 11 min, range 10 to 17 min, p = 0. 04) than with intracoronary adenosine (median 9 min, range 7 to 13 min).

40|$|Background: The use of radial {{access in}} cardiac {{interventions}} {{is associated with}} reduced vascular complications, however it demands a longer learning curve and may increase fluoroscopy time. This study aimed to evaluate the fluoroscopy time as {{a surrogate marker of}} radiation exposure, during diagnostic cardiac catheterization by radial and femoral routes. Methods: Retrospective observational study including patients who under-went cardiac catheterization from July 2013 to October 2014. Radial and femoral groups were compared for total <b>procedural</b> <b>time,</b> fluoroscopy <b>time,</b> fluoroscopy to <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> ratio and vascular complications. Results: The study included 1, 915 procedures, 11. 2 % of which performed by radial approach and 88. 8 %, by femoral approach. A male prevalence was found in the radial group (80 % vs. 54. 1 %, p <  0. 01), but age (61. 6 ± 9. 7 years vs. 62. 4 ± 11. 6 years, p  =  0. 13), total <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> (8. 7 ± 3. 8 vs. 8. 1 ± 4. 1  minutes, p  =  0. 91), fluoroscopy time (4. 8 ± 2. 7 vs. 4. 1 ± 2. 6  minutes, p  =  0. 89), fluoroscopy/ procedure time ratio (0. 56 ± 0. 24 vs. 0. 49 ± 0. 32, p  =  0. 89), and major complications (0. 0 % vs. 0. 3 %, p  =  0. 55) were similar between groups.

Materials and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 50 cases involving software-assisted TACE (September 2011 –February 2013) and 84 cases involving TACE without software assistance (January 2010 –August 2011). We compared {{the number of}} image acquisitions, the overall <b>procedural</b> <b>time,</b> and the therapeutic efficacy in both groups. Results. Angiography acquisition per session reduced from 6. 6 times to 4. 6 times with software assistance (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Rationale and Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{conventional}} two-dimensional (2 D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with three-dimensional (3 D) rotational DSA in the investigation of intracranial aneurysm in terms of detection, size measurement, neck diameter, neck delineation, and relationship with surrounding vessels. A further aim was to compare radiation dose, contrast volume, and <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> between the two protocols. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients who presented with subarachnoid bleeds on computed tomography and were suspected of having intracranial aneurysms underwent conventional 2 D DSA followed by 3 D DSA. The 3 D digital subtraction angiographic images were displayed as surface shaded display images. Aneurysm detection, sac size, neck diameter, neck delineation, and relationship of aneurysm to the surrounding vessels analyzed from the two protocols were compared. Radiation dose, contrast volume, and <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> for both examinations were also compared. Results: Three-dimensional DSA detected 44 aneurysms in 31 patients, with negative findings seen in four patients. A false-negative detection rate of 6. 8 (three of 44) for 2 D DSA was noted. There was no significant difference in aneurysm size between 3 D and 2 D DSA. The sizes of aneurysm necks were found to be significantly larger in 3 D DSA than on 2 D DSA. The aneurysm neck and relationship to surrounding vessels were significantly better demonstrated on 3 D DSA than on 2 D DSA. Radiation dose (entrance surface dose), contrast use, and <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> with 3 D DSA were significantly less than with 2 D DSA. Conclusions: Three-dimensional DSA improves the detection and delineation of intracranial aneurysms, with lower radiation dose, less contrast use, and shorter <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> compared to 2 D DSA. The size of the aneurysm neck on 3 D DSA tended to be larger than on 2 D DSA...|$|R

30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{in a previous}} serious of patients, that combining realtime ultrasound guidance and balloon dilatational technique in performing BPT is easily feasible and safe. By inserting a LMA before the BPT – instead of keeping the ETT in place - we successfully further improved this concept by adding additional beneficial features such as <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> reduction and improved ultrasound imaging of sublaryngeal anatomical structures. These additional advantages were achieved without compromising the already established patient safety features of the previous technique. In our practise, this technique has become the standard BPT strategy due to its combination of excellent features, e.g. avoidance of intraprocedural tube misplacement and hypoventilation, improved assessment of sublaryngeal anatomical structures, elimination of accidental bronchoscope damage and minimization of <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> even in technically challenging patients with obesity and difficult neck anatomy.|$|R

40|$|Background: With the {{increasing}} prevalence of morbid obesity and healthcare costs in general, interest {{is shown in}} safe, efficient, and cost-effective bariatric care. This study describes an Enhanced Recovery After Bariatric Surgery (ERABS) protocol {{and the results of}} implementing such protocol on <b>procedural</b> <b>times,</b> length of stay in hospital (LOS), and the number of complications, such as readmissions and reoperations. Methods: Results of implementing an ERABS protocol were analyzed by comparing a cohort treated according to the ERABS protocol (2012 – 2014) with a cohort treated before implementing ERABS (2010 – 2012). Differences between both cohorts were analyzed using independent t tests and chi-squared tests. Results: A total of 1. 967 patients (mean age 43. 3 years, 80 % female) underwent a primary bariatric procedure between 2010 and 2014, of which 1. 313 procedures were performed after implementation of ERABS. A significant decrease of <b>procedural</b> <b>times</b> and a significantly decreased LOS, from 3. 2 to 2. 0 nights (p < 0. 001), were seen after implementation of ERABS. Significantly more complications were seen post-ERABS (16. 1 vs. 20. 7 %, p = 0. 013), although no significant differences were seen in the number of major complications. Conclusion: Implementation of ERABS can result in shorter <b>procedural</b> <b>times</b> and a decreased LOS, which may lead to more efficient and cost-effective bariatric care. The increase in complications was possibly due to better registration of complications. The main goal of an ERABS protocol is efficient, safe, and evidence-based bariatric care, which can be achieved by standardization of the total process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a time-efficient tilt table test. BACKGROUNDCurrent protocols of tilt table testing are quite time-consuming. This study was designed to assess the diagnostic value, tolerance and <b>procedural</b> <b>time</b> of a single-stage isoproterenol tilt table protocol. METHODSA single-stage isoproterenol tilt table test was compared with the passive tilt table test. The study was prospectively designed in a randomized and crossover fashion. RESULTSThe study population consisted of 111 patients with a history of syncope (mean age 55 ± 20 years). Of the total, 62 patients (56 %; 95 % confidence interval, 46 % to 65 %) had a positive vasovagal response during isoproterenol tilt table testing and 35 (32 %; 23 % to 41 %) during passive tilt table testing (p = 0. 002). The mean <b>procedural</b> <b>times</b> of the study population were 11. 7 ± 3. 6 min and 36. 9 ± 13. 3 min for isoproterenol and passive tilt table testing, respectively (p < 0. 001). All patients tolerated single-stage isoproterenol testing. In the 23 control subjects (mean age 34 ± 11 years), the apparent specificities were 91 % (72 % to 99 %) and 83 % (61 % to 99 %) for passive and single-stage tilt table testing, respectively. CONCLUSIONSThe single-stage isoproterenol tilt table test was more effective in inducing a positive vasovagal response in an adult population than the standard passive tilt table test, and it significantly reduced the <b>procedural</b> <b>time.</b> The increase in positive yield was associated with a moderate decrease in apparent specificity.

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax.

40|$|A {{study focused}} on results from seven of the {{earliest}} state welfare reform initiatives with some form of welfare <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> Four programs [...] Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, and Wisconsin [...] - included benefit-termination <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> triggering cancellation of a family's entire welfare grant. Arizona and Indiana imposed benefit-reduction <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> in which only the adult's portion of the welfare grant was canceled at the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> Vermont imposed a work-trigger model in which recipients who reach the limit must work but benefits are not reduced or canceled.
