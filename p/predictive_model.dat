25|$|Class {{prediction}} analysis: This approach, called supervised classification, {{establishes the}} basis for developing a <b>predictive</b> <b>model</b> into which future unknown test objects can be input in order to predict the most likely class membership of the test objects. Supervised analysis for class prediction involves use of techniques such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, learning vector quantization, decision tree analysis, random forests, naive Bayes, logistic regression, kernel regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, mixture of experts, and supervised neural gas. In addition, various metaheuristic methods are employed, such as genetic algorithms, covariance matrix self-adaptation, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony optimization. Input data for class prediction are usually based on filtered lists of genes which are predictive of class, determined using classical hypothesis tests (next section), Gini diversity index, or information gain (entropy).|$|E

Furthermore, an attempt is made to reconcile the worlds of expert judgment and quantitative analysis by means of multicriteria decision making techniques and Bayesian statistics.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Most <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> are not {{sufficiently}} validated for prospective use. We performed independent external validation of published <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> for urinary dysfunctions following radiotherapy of the prostate. Materials/Methods: Multivariable models developed to predict atomised and generalised urinary symptoms, both acute and late, were considered for validation using a dataset representing 754 participants from the TROG 03. 04 -RADAR trial. Endpoints and features were harmonised {{to match the}} <b>predictive</b> <b>models.</b> The overall performance, calibration and discrimination were assessed. RESULTS: 14 models from four publications were validated. The discrimination of the <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> in an independent external validation cohort, measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, ranged from 0. 473 to 0. 695, generally lower than in internal validation. 4 models had ROC > 0. 6. Shrinkage was required for all predictive models' coefficients ranging from - 0. 309 (prediction probability was inverse to observed proportion) to 0. 823. <b>Predictive</b> <b>models</b> which include baseline symptoms as a feature produced the highest discrimination. Two models produced a predicted probability of 0 and 1 for all patients. Conclusions: <b>Predictive</b> <b>models</b> vary in performance and transferability illustrating the need for improvements in model development and reporting. Several models showed reasonable potential but efforts should be increased to improve performance. Baseline symptoms should always be considered as potential features for <b>predictive</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

500|$|In 2011, Graziano and Kastner {{proposed}} the [...] "attention schema" [...] theory of awareness.

The same cortical machinery {{is also used to}} attribute awareness to oneself. Damage to these cortical regions can lead to deficits in consciousness such as hemispatial neglect. In the attention schema theory, the value of explaining the feature of awareness and attributing it to a person is to gain a useful <b>predictive</b> <b>model</b> of that person's attentional processing. Attention is a style of information processing in which a brain focuses its resources on a limited set of interrelated signals. Awareness, in this theory, is a useful, simplified schema that represents attentional states. To be aware of X is explained by constructing a model of one's attentional focus on X.|$|E

A set of 35 teenagers were tested for IQ and were fMRI scanned over the course of 3.5 years, and had their IQ predicted by the level of grey matter localization. This study was well-conducted, but studies of this sort frequently suffer from [...] "double-dipping," [...] where a single dataset is used both to identify the brain regions of interest and to develop a <b>predictive</b> <b>model,</b> which leads to overtraining of the model and an absence of real predictive power.|$|E

The study also observed the previously-reported phenomenon that a ranking of young subjects by IQ does not stay constant as the subjects age, which confounds any measurement of the efficacy of educational programs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Predictive</b> <b>modeling</b> {{reflects}} {{the process of}} using data and statistical or data mining methods for predicting new observations. The <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> that are created out of this process could be reused in different applications {{in the same sense}} that open data is reused. Towards this end, a few standards have been proposed in order to enable transfer of <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> across platforms and applications. In this paper we suggest the need for incorporating <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> into the Linked Data Web. Towards this end, we propose an RDF Schema vocabulary that will enable the creation of <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> descriptions adhering to the Linked Data principles. The incorporation of these descriptions into the Linked Data Web could create new potentials beyond cross-platform model reuse. In particular, it will enable (a) easy discovery and reuse of appropriate models at a Web Scale and (b) creation of more accurate models exploiting connections of models to other models, datasets and other resources on the Web...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} about archaeological <b>predictive</b> <b>modelling</b> and its possible application {{as a tool}} for cultural heritage management in the UK. The research is focused on four main questions using East Anglia during the late Anglo-Saxon period as a case study: what would be the best way of developing an archaeological predictive model; how would such a model compare with other models from around the world; how would archaeological <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> compare with the existing system of cultural heritage management in the UK; and what would be the implications of employing the technique in the UK?. Published reports of other archaeological <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> are examined in order to determine what lessons can be learnt, and what techniques might be appropriate for <b>predictive</b> <b>modelling</b> in East Anglia, given the terrain and the character of the archaeological data available. The thesis argues that inductive techniques, using binary logistic regression analysis, are the optimum choice for the modelling process. However, due to statistical problems of modelling across modern administration boundaries, it was decided to concentrate on the county of Norfolk alone. The <b>predictive</b> <b>models</b> produced for this county correctly predicted between 22 % and 32 % above chance. These results have been verified and are roughly comparable with other archaeological <b>predictive</b> <b>models,</b> taking into account issues such as terrain, available data, etc. The cultural heritage management systems of countries that incorporate archaeological <b>predictive</b> <b>modelling</b> were investigated to determine how well those systems worked, what the legal aspects were, how these models were regulated, how much they cost and how they compare with the current system of heritage management in the UK. Archaeological <b>predictive</b> <b>modelling</b> works well in certain circumstances and can save time and money because, as it predicts archaeological data, archaeological investigation can be targeted to specific areas. For example, within the UK it is envisaged that archaeological <b>predictive</b> <b>modelling</b> could be a viable technique in advance of mineral extraction, new pipelines, road and rail schemes, etc. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Applying GIS and agent based modelling tools to a project area in southeaster New Mexico this new methodology explored possible behaviours that resulted in site formation such as access to water resources, travel routes and resource exploitation.
