40|$|Plasticised poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC-P) {{remains the}} most widely used blood-contacting biomaterial. With respect to the blood {{compatibility}} of PVC-P,the <b>plasticiser</b> plays a more important role than the PVC polymer itself, since the blood contacting surface is highly distributed with <b>plasticiser.</b> Therefore, the objective of this project was to study the significance of the <b>plasticiser</b> on protein adsorption onto PVC-P, where the features of <b>plasticiser</b> considered were <b>plasticiser</b> selection (nature of <b>plasticiser),</b> the <b>plasticiser</b> surface level and <b>plasticiser</b> surface distribution. To evaluate this, three types of medical grade PVC-P, plasticised with 2 -diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), tri-(2 -ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM) and n-butyryl-tri-n-hexyl citrate (BTHC) respectively in sheet form with the same softness, were selected. Protein adsorption was carried out using " 1 " 2 " 5 l-radiolabelled human fibrinogen and bovine serum albumin. The in vitro protein /material contact was achieved with a modified 24 -well incubation test cell. A reduced <b>plasticiser</b> surface level was obtained with methanol surface treatment. Surface characterisation was carried out using ATR-FTIR and UV-spectrophotometer. Results obtained indicate that fibrinogen adsorption on PVC-P strongly correlates with the <b>plasticiser</b> surface level. A reduced <b>plasticiser</b> level can reduce fibrinogen adsorption and increase albumin adsorption. However, excess surface washing might lead to a surface topographical change, initiating an increased fibrinogen adsorption. Protein adsorption is also dependent on the <b>plasticiser</b> nature and <b>plasticiser</b> surface distribution. A high level of <b>plasticiser</b> does not necessarily mean a high reactivity towards fibrinogen adsorption. Based on this study, surface modification of PVC-P was carried out using cyclodextrins (CDs) by blending. The combination of CDs with polyethylene oxide (PEO) or polyethylene (PEO) -poly(propylene oxide) (PRO) triblock copolymer (Pluronic surfactant) was also studied. Protein adsorption results indicate that the surface enriched CDs, CD/PEO, CD/Pluronic physical mixture or CD inclusion complex (CIC) can achieve a reduced protein adsorption. Finally, a possible mechanism was hypothesised and a proposal was made for a novel form of surface modification.

When the <b>plasticiser</b> concentration in PVC was below 40 wt-%, HBPE showed better plasticisation efficiency than DOP, with enhanced impact strength and ultimate elongation.

40|$|The Young's Modulus of PVC {{plasticised}} {{with various}} dialkylphthalates at concentrations from 40 – 120 phr {{that has been}} subject to a short heat treatment at 100 °C, increases linearly with the logarithm {{of the time of}} storing at temperatures from 20 – 100 °C. Both the Young's Modulus and its rats of increase with time is found to increase with increasing size of <b>plasticiser</b> to increase with decreasing concentration of <b>plasticiser</b> and to pass through a maximum with changing temperature of storage at a temperature of about 38 °C. These effects can be explained if it is assumed that the elasticity results from a network linked by crystallites that can be melted on heating and reformed on storing at a lower temperature. The density of the <b>plasticiser</b> compositions is found to increase with time and this together with the development of endothermic DSC peaks support the hypothesis that changes in rigidity result from changes in crystallinity. The endothermic peak occurs at an almost constant temperature independent of <b>plasticiser</b> concentration or the size of the <b>plasticiser</b> molecule.

40|$|Introduction : Containers for {{the storage}} of {{platelets}} are made using polyvinyl chloride plasticised with di, (2 -ethyl hexyl) phthalate, n-butyryl, tri (n-hexyl) citrate and tri (2 -ethyl hexyl) mellitate or using special poly olefins without <b>plasticiser.</b> Of these, the first two have disadvantages such as <b>plasticiser</b> leaching and impairment of platelet function.

Concern over the {{migration}} of low molecular weight <b>plasticiser</b> from flexible PVC used in toys and medical products has lead to the commercialisation {{of a number of}} plasticising polymers. In this study the plasticising behaviour of an ethylene/vinyl acetate/carbon monoxide terpolymer (Elvaloy® from Du Pont) was investigated. Blends of PVC, Elvaloy 742 and Di-octyl phthalate (DOP) were processed on a twin-roll mill and compression moulded into plaques. These materials were characterised in terms of their hardness, Tg, clarity, mechanical properties and <b>plasticiser</b> migration behaviour.

[...] Melting points and glass transition temperatures for most polymers are available from standard compilations, and the method can show polymer degradation by the lowering of the expected melting point, Tm, for example.

This high green density led to high sintered density too. But the compositions having more than 0. 5 % PEG in spite of high green density, showed poor sintered density indicating that, as PEG vaporised out, it left pores, and even some residues which hindered densification while sintering. Therefore, the final density of the product depended on two mutually opposite factors: the high green density and the high amount of impurity left after PEG vaporised. Fired strength (like fired density) was the best for unplasticised sample. Still, highest green strength corresponded to 0. 25 % and 0. 5 % <b>plasticiser</b> (PEG) necessitating its use in green products.

For minimising the additional effect of processing, a simple compression moulding process (which involves minimal shear) was used for preparation of starch-based films. The results show that [Emim][OAc] was favourable for plasticisation, i. e., disruption of starch granules (by scanning electron microscopy), and could result in a more amorphous structure in the starch-based materials (by X-ray diffraction and dynamic mechanical analysis). 13 C CP/MAS and SPE/MAS NMR spectroscopy revealed that not only was the crystallinity reduced by [Emim][OAc], but also the amorphous starch present was plasticised to a more mobile form as indicated by the appearance of amorphous starch in the SPE/MAS spectrum. Mechanical results illustrate that, when either glycerol or [Emim][OAc] was used, a higher <b>plasticiser</b> content could contribute to higher flexibility. In spite of the accelerated thermal degradation of starch by [Emim][OAc] as shown by thermogravimetric analysis, the biodegradation study revealed the antimicrobial effect of [Emim][OAc] on the starch-based materials.

Plasticised polyvinyl chloride (PPVC) compounds were biaxially stretched, annealed in the drawn state and subsequently exposed to electron beam irradiation. During sample irradiation the crosslinking reaction was promoted by a radiation sensitising monomer, trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate (TMPTMA), included in the PVC compound formulations. The influence of stabiliser type and level, TMPTMA level and irradiation dose on the network structure produced was investigated. A tin stabiliser, Stanclere TL, was selected for this study as it promoted the crosslinking reaction and it showed no interfering peaks in the wide angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD) traces which were used to follow the development of structural order. The appearance of gel, the material insoluble in THF, in irradiated oriented samples proved that a crosslinked structure was created. The gel formation increased with TMPTMA level and irradiation dose. The gel content was found to affect mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and produced {{an increase in the}} area shrinkage temperature. Sample thickness and the <b>plasticiser</b> content were found to have a major effect upon gel formation. The thicker the sample was, the smaller the quantity of gel that was formed.
