50|$|Lankensperger invented his {{steering}} mechanism in 1816 as Hofwagner (Head waggoner) in Munich, {{to allow the}} front wheels of a carriage to individually follow the natural arc of its turning circle, rather than skidding and slipping when {{they are forced to}} each share a common arc with the conventional <b>pivoted</b> <b>axle.</b> It continues to be used in horse-drawn carriages and passenger cars to this day..|$|E
50|$|The tail-skid was {{designed}} for use on sand; it consisted of a lower horizontal 'shoe' which was fitted to a vertical wooden support by a single <b>pivoted</b> <b>axle,</b> the whole assembly being free to swivel about its vertical axis. The horizontal 'shoe' was rounded upwards at front and rear {{to allow it to}} ride over small undulations in the landing strip, its rotation about its axle being dampened at the rear by a length of steel spring and in front by elastic strip.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles in the Urbos AXL series have larger modules and railway-style <b>pivoting</b> <b>axle</b> bogies. With {{a maximum}} speed of 90 km/h, it is {{designed}} for high-capacity, mass rapid transit systems.|$|R
500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were mounted {{together on the}} swingarm {{in front of the}} <b>pivot</b> <b>axle</b> {{at the bottom of the}} spine frame. The near-horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a [...] "power egg" [...] style which would later be used by Benelli and Motobi. The tubular swingarm also served as the exhaust pipe. Behind the <b>pivot</b> <b>axle,</b> the swingarm, the reinforced rear fender, and the supports for the rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported the rear spring. This suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft spring rate. Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping. Friction dampers were added.|$|R
50|$|As an {{original}} invention for the clarinette à anneaux mobiles, Buffet utilized needle springs {{in order to}} control the opening and closing of keys mounted on axles. Needle springs are mounted on posts screwed directly into the wooden body of the clarinet and are used for all keys other than those with extremely short <b>pivoting</b> <b>axles,</b> which continue to make use of simple leaf springs attached longitudinally to the underside of each separate key. This is the method of operation of the keys on pre-Boehm woodwind instruments.|$|R
40|$|The {{at least}} one contact sensor (86, 88) is {{recessed}} inside the ring of bristles (66) and turns with the brush roller (46). The contact sensor has a threshold limit switch adjustable to a radial operating force, for releasing an emergency off signal. The sensor bristle holder {{is in the form}} of a lever with restricted movement, and extending over part of the brush roller's (58) periphery. The holder rotates on an axle parallel to the <b>pivot</b> <b>axle</b> of the brush roller against the adjustable force of a counter holding spring. ADVANTAGE - The brush head activates an emergency off switch for critical situations to avoid damaging the surface being cleaned...|$|R
50|$|Most house-built engines were early beam engines. A 'bob wall' in {{the engine}} house {{supported}} the <b>pivot</b> <b>axle</b> of the beam or 'bob'. This wall could be an internal wall, with {{both ends of the}} beam inside the house, but it was commonly the end wall of the house and so the beam projected to the outside. For a heavy beam, the bob wall was required to be extremely substantial. Early engines were used for pumping mines or wells, so as well as the weight of the beam, the house had to also support the weight of the long pump rod, reaching down to the depths of the mine.|$|R
50|$|The current Opinel knife {{consists}} of a blade, wooden handle, stainless steel metal clamping band, stainless <b>pivot</b> pin (<b>axle),</b> and (except {{in the case of}} the smaller models) a stainless steel Virobloc locking collar, which locks the blade open or closed.|$|R

5000|$|To {{ameliorate}} these faults, Arnoux {{proposed a}} system of [...] ("Articulated axles") whereby the yaw angle of the wheels was reduced essentially to zero. Arnoux adapted the system used on horse-carts, which <b>pivoted</b> each <b>axle</b> at its centre, to be applied equally over the two axles together.|$|R

50|$|Coiled pins {{are used}} {{extensively}} in cosmetic cases, automotive door handles and locks, and latches as hinge pins. They {{are also used}} as <b>pivots</b> and <b>axles,</b> for alignment and stopping, to fasten multiple components together—such as a gear and shaft—and even as ejector pins to remove motherboards from PCs. The automotive and electrical industries use coiled pins in such products as steering boxes and columns, pumps, electric motors and circuit breakers.|$|R
50|$|NoSno trucks use two 'kingpin'-type bolts {{to create}} a {{floating}} <b>pivot,</b> an <b>axle</b> with a plate into which the bolts go, an angled base plate that attaches to the deck, and polyurethane bushings to dampen the turn. The amount of turn available in the trucks can be adjusted by tightening the bolts or by using bushings of different hardness. A similar design was adopted by Howla Mountainboards for the limited time that they manufactured boards.|$|R

50|$|A <b>pivoting</b> front <b>axle</b> changes a carriage’s {{base from}} a {{rectangle}} to a triangle because the wheel {{on the inside}} of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin proposed to fix these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented as Ackerman Steering. Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.|$|R
50|$|Antique penny knives have {{increased}} significantly in value and can sell {{for as much}} as $500(US). In modern production, the smallest models of the Opinel, an early 20th-century peasant's knife, continue to utilize this basic design, consisting of a folding blade <b>pivoting</b> on an <b>axle</b> mounted through a steel-bolstered wooden handle.|$|R
50|$|A compass was {{standard}} equipment on all Wagoneers while seat belts were optional. Warn hubs were utilized to engage or disengage front wheels and drive train while in two-wheel drive mode. A four-wheel-drive {{independent front suspension}} was $135 extra replacing the standard Dana 27AF solid front axle, and this option was supposed to offer the Wagoneer more car-like handling and ride. This was a single <b>pivot</b> front <b>axle</b> design that allowed the differential to swing with curb-side half while short upper A-arms tie into torsion bars at their inner pivot points and the axles are located fore and aft by control links.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} the 18th century that {{steering}} systems were truly improved. Erasmus Darwin was a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England. Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage. First, the front wheels were turned by a <b>pivoting</b> front <b>axle,</b> which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road. Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.|$|R
50|$|The rear tandem beam {{assembly}} was {{a center}} <b>pivot</b> type, with <b>axles</b> {{on both ends}} of the beam. A dual tire wheel was {{on both ends of}} both axles, with a beam on each side there were also 4 wheels per axle line. Twenty-four 8.25x15” tires on demountable rims were used, two on each wheel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{competitors}} for the DB Class 121 {{included two}} of the forerunners of Bombardier Transportation: German locomotive manufacturer AEG Schienenfahrzeuge, a part of AEG which was controlled by Daimler-Benz at the time; and ABB Henschel, a German locomotive manufacturing branch of Swedish-Swiss company ABB. Components of both the AEG and ABB concepts were built into the prototypes of the DB Class 120 for trials from late 1991. AEG followed up its development effort by building an experimental universal locomotive, the 12X. This locomotive can be considered the predecessor of the TRAXX family. The 12X was delivered in June 1994 and, although owned by AEG, was designated Class 128 by DB. The 12X featured several innovations compared to the Class 120, including water-cooled inverters based on GTO thyristors, a new final drive concept with <b>pivot</b> <b>axle</b> bearings on both sides, and a new bogie concept with a short wheelbase of [...] The locomotive also had a modular design, allowing the derivation of different versions for different operational needs, and thus it formed AEG's basis {{to compete for the}} new orders of Deutsche Bahn's business areas. [...] Meanwhile, ABB developed its own design of a modular electric locomotive platform, the Eco2000 concept. ABB's concept included a version of its Flexifloat high-speed bogie family with a wheelbase of and biodegradable ester cooled inverters with GTO thyristors and an also ester cooled main transformer, which can be considered the origin of the inverters and transformer of the first generation of TRAXX locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} {{vehicles}} {{was designed to}} be complementary to a model railway set, and for instance included a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, a Humber Super Snipe, an AEC Routemaster bus, a Shell petrol tanker and a towtruck. The most remarkable vehicle was a Road-Railer, an articulated lorry with a pair of <b>pivoting</b> rear <b>axles,</b> one bearing road wheels and the other rail wheels. The semi-trailer could be remotely uncoupled and then collected by a bogie wagon on the Tri-ang railway system. These could in theory be chained together to compose a train. This vehicle suffered from being underpowered. Vehicles could also be driven aboard a car-carrying wagon in the Tri-ang railway system.|$|R
40|$|The Roboscooter is an electric, folding scooter {{designed}} for use in dense urban areas where congestion and pollution is a problem. Already heavily used in most European cities, scooters provide cheaper, faster transportation than cars, but parking can still be difficult. By allowing the scooter to fold - reducing its footprint by more than half- and by implementing a one-way user share model that does not require scooter ownership, many of the current issues involving transportation in dense urban areas can be addressed. As an electric vehicle, the Roboscooter's range {{is limited by the}} amount of energy it uses during travel and the current technological limitations on battery energy density. Analysis of the elements of the scooter that experience the most stress can give insights on ways to redesign key structural elements in order to make them lighter while maintaining the strength necessary for long life in a consumer environment. The structural elements that make up {{the main body of the}} scooter are subject to cyclic fatigue due to riding conditions such as bumps, which aside from decreasing the life of structural elements, also cause the largest forces on the scooter's frame. The Roboscooter was analyzed under maximum load conditions to determine the safety factor of two of the frame components that experience the most stress: the front fork and the main folding <b>pivot</b> <b>axle.</b> Both elements were found to have a safety factor of two in their current design configurations, implying that design changes will be needed to reduce the overall weight. by Arthur J.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of the rollover limit of a farm tractor. The rollover phenomenon is investigated by considering the static stability of the farm tractor on a sloped surface. Three mathematical models are derived to understand the basic features of the rollover mechanism. The models are able to predict the (static) rollover limit for any orientation of the farm tractor {{with respect to the}} slope. The effects of tyre stiffness (vertical and lateral) and nonsymmetric implement positioning are analysed. The classical architecture of the farm tractor equipped with a <b>pivoting</b> front <b>axle</b> is compared with the adoption of a passively suspended front axle. In case of a front axle suspension, the rollover limit of the vehicle can be improved, especially when employing non-symmetric implements...|$|R

50|$|The Hillman Imp {{designers}} {{learned from}} {{the problems with the}} Corvair, having crashed one at a relatively low speed, and designed their rear-engined car with semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear. To attain correct handling balance, they actually used swing axle geometry at the front, with the steering pivots mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones. These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the positive camber of the front wheels by lowering the swing <b>axle</b> <b>pivot</b> points. Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone.|$|R
5000|$|The harp {{mechanism}} was {{a simple}} lever which <b>pivoted</b> on an <b>axle</b> pin located midway up the main body (the [...] "frame") of the stand. The {{upper part of the}} lever passed through a slot atop the stand. A signal target was usually attached {{at the top of the}} lever. The lower end of the lever extended below the main body of the stand where it attached to a bar. Pulling on the lever would pull this bar which in turn would move the rail into the desired position.

50|$|The {{suspension}} {{changes to}} the car were quite extensive; the car received shorter struts up front, forged track control arms and 5.5J by 13 steel wheel rims. The rear was even more radical with vertical coil spring/dampers replacing the leaf springs and two trailing arms with a A- bracket (which connected to the differential housing and brackets near the trailing arm <b>pivots)</b> sorting out <b>axle</b> location. To support this set-up, further braces were put behind the rear seat and from the rear wheelarch down to chassis in the boot. The stiffening braces meant that the spare wheel had to be moved from the standard Cortina's wheel well and was bolted {{to the left side}} of the boot floor. The battery was also relocated to the boot, behind the right wheelarch. Both of these changes made big improvements to overall weight distribution. Another improvement the Cortina Lotus gained was the new braking system (9.5 in front discs) which were built by brake specialist Girling. This system also was fitted to Cortina GTs but without a servo, which was fitted in the Cortina Lotus engine bay.|$|R
50|$|During development, the {{anticipated}} {{weight of the}} He 177 increased so much that a main undercarriage design sufficient to handle the 32 MT loaded weight, was difficult to achieve. The engine nacelles and wings had little room for the main undercarriage members, which needed to be longer than usual, for ground clearance for the large diameter four-blade propellers. After several extremely complex arrangements had been considered during initial design, a novel system was adopted. Instead of a wheel leg under each engine nacelle, two wheel legs were attached to the main spar at each nacelle, the outboard legs retracting upward and outward into shallow wing wells and the inboard legs swinging upward and inward into similar wells in the wing roots, with all units enclosed by flush fitting wheel and strut doors, which almost met under each engine nacelle when fully extended. During the retraction cycle, the forward-oriented lever-action lower gear strut sections, on which the wheels were mounted onto their <b>axles,</b> <b>pivoted</b> to a 90° angle from 120° when fully extended to the main gear leg, {{to be able to}} fit into the wheel wells. A conventional rearwards-retracting single-leg twin wheel arrangement for each main gear was used on the two prototypes built (one during the war, one post-war) of the He 274 in France. Drawings were made for a tricycle gear arrangement for the Amerika Bomber entry version of the proposed He 277, which was also depicted with single main gear struts with twin wheels. For the He 177A's own landing gear maintenance needs, some two hours were required just to change a main gear tire, using special Heinkel-designed 12 MT capacity main gear jacks and blocks.|$|R
40|$|PMC Harvesters Ltd is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for the pea {{and bean}} market. Their primary product {{line is a}} self {{propelled}} harvester known as the 979 CT harvester. The 979 CT is of considerable proportions being 4 m x 4 m x 12 m in overall dimensions, six wheel drive and weighs 29, 620 kg GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) when fully laden. The aim of this work was to identify and outline possible solutions for the support system (tyre or track and undercarriage), quantify the performance of each system, produce a design and evaluation method to determine an optimal structural specification and to produce a design recommendation for the application. Analysis of the current 979 CT harvester wheel configuration highlighted many constraining factors in tyre choice. The most pertinent of these was that the wheels have a very limited operating space and following {{a study of the}} possible tyre options it became apparent only two manufactures, Michelin and Trelleborg, could provide tyres which met the vehicle parameters. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the three chosen tyre options. From the findings of these tests {{it was clear that the}} optimal tyre for the PMC configuration was the Trelleborg Twin Radial tyre, operating at minimum road inflation pressure (1. 6 bar) as designated by Trelleborg. When operating the harvester in its normal working environment the tyre pressure should be set at minimum road inflation for in-field conditions with a DBD (Dry Bulk Density) of > 1. 3 g/cm 3, as excess damage caused by operating above minimum field operating pressure is superficial. The use of low compaction equipment such as CTIS (Central Tyre Inflation System) or tracks would not be beneficial to the PMC application. The track tested created a hardened track pan, thus requiring more effort to rectify post harvest. A CTIS increases the consumption of diesel and offered no reduction in soil compaction below plough depth as shown by the findings from operating the optimal tyre at minimum field inflation pressure (1. 2 bar). The primary objective of this project was to offer solutions to reduce the effects of the PMC harvester’s weight on its operating medium. The first natural step was to assess the vehicles main structure in order to improve its performance to weight ratio. The initial phase of this process was to validate the modelling and analyses techniques used to assess the structure. This was done within a controlled test environment at CU@S and from this work a factor of safety of 10 % was designated to be applied to all analysis in order to authenticate results and generate a “worst case” answer. Revisions of the main chassis, main <b>pivot</b> and rear <b>axle</b> assemblies were created and analysed. Test metrics were defined which represented operating patterns of the harvester. The findings from these tests saw a 22. 6 % weight reduction, 43. 1 % increase in life expectancy and 10. 2 % reduction in peak stress in the main chassis and main pivot. Unlike the other two key assemblies, the rear axle was deemed fit for purpose and would not benefit from any further design changes...|$|R
