5|$|In July 1978, Lucas {{revealed}} that Radioland Murders {{was still in}} development, and that both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was early 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, Radioland Murders remained in development hell. Between this time, Lucas commissioned Theodore J. Flicker to perform a rewrite. In early 1993 Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 15 April {{was pushed}} {{back when the}} Italians had problems moving to their start positions and later had trouble providing transport to establish lines of communication across the Adriatic. The operation was rescheduled to 25 April. Prior to the Ljubljana conference, the Ustaše authorities were concerned about negotiations between the German and Italian commanders and Dangić, and were particularly worried that the Germans would permit the Italians and Chetniks to use Sarajevo as a base. On 31 March {{the commander of the}} Ustaše Black Legion, Jure Francetić, launched a pre-emptive offensive primarily against Dangić's Chetniks. Francetić captured Vlasenica, Bratunac and Srebrenica, meeting limited resistance from the Partisans, and then scattered the more numerous Chetniks while inflicting significant losses.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all of the}} German units, {{which had}} to be {{reinforced}} across the bridges at Stettin were ready on the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of February 15. Nevertheless, a part of the central corps, the SS Division Nordland, attacked towards Arnswalde that day. Initially the offensive was successful; the opposing forces of 61st Army were taken by surprise and the German spearhead reached the besieged outpost of Arnswalde and relieved its garrison.|$|E
5000|$|December 2004: ETCS Level 2 {{is to be}} {{installed}} on the Mattstetten-Rothrist new line, a high-speed line opened in 2004 between Bern and Zürich for train speeds of 200 km/h. This ETCS Level 2 installation was the pioneering ETCS installation in Switzerland. Technical problems with the new ETCS technology caused ETCS operation to be put off past the <b>planned</b> <b>starting</b> <b>date.</b>|$|R
50|$|The line {{producer}} functions like a chief {{operations officer}} {{in running the}} production company. During pre-production, responsibilities include supervising the assembly of the shooting company, recruitment of key personnel and services, and production organization for how to shoot the script and transform it into a movie. The line producer <b>plans</b> <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> for everyone and everything, and monitors the budget in the lead up to picture. Film production generally follows a rigorous schedule. The line producer facilitates casting, location scouting, set building and decorating, offices and stages, wardrobe, props, stunts, physical and visual effects, camera, lighting, rigging, transportation, cast, crew and union relations, travel, cast and crew accommodation, contracting of legal permissions and agreements, safety and risk management, prep and shooting schedule. In short, the line producer oversees the joint planning, negotiations, implementation and accounting for production.|$|R
50|$|The second {{cancellation}} came {{three years}} later in 2012 when Riot Fest East in Philadelphia was again postponed, this time one week before the show's <b>planned</b> July 19 <b>start</b> <b>date.</b> Though a reschedule was initially promised a follow up never emerged.|$|R
500|$|The Wildlife Center at {{the refuge}} was finally {{completed}} and opened in January 2008. [...] A dedication ceremony {{was held at}} the Wildlife Center on March 29, 2008; 500 people attended the event including Congressman David Wu and author Richard Louv. [...] In 2008, the refuge had attracted 50,000 birds in a single day, with 20,000 birds wintering in the refuge. As of December 2008, the federal government had spent $10.4 million on the refuge and it had grown to [...] The refuge submitted a proposal to start collecting user fees in February 2009, with a <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of August 2009.

2500|$|Since {{the autumn}} of 2016 a 24-hour [...] "Night Tube" [...] service runs on Friday and Saturday nights from Edgware and High Barnet to Morden via Charing Cross; other {{sections}} of the line do not operate the 24-hour service. One train runs every 8 minutes between Morden and Camden Town and a train every 15/16 minutes between Camden Town and Edgware/High Barnet. Labour disputes delayed the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of September 2015.|$|E
2500|$|German {{intelligence}} {{had warned}} Rommel of {{the arrival of}} a [...] convoy bringing new vehicles for the Allies in Egypt. Realizing that time was against him, and that the arrival of reinforcements for the British would tilt the balance in their favour, he decided to attack. He informed the Italian Comando Supremo in Rome that he would need [...] of fuel and [...] of ammunition before the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> {{at the end of the}} month. By 29 August, over 50 percent of the ships sent had been sunk and only [...] of fuel had arrived at Tobruk. Rommel could not postpone the attack because of his enemy's growing strength and so decided to take a chance on gaining a quick success. At the start of the battle, after Albert Kesselring had agreed to lend some of the Luftwaffes fuel stock, Rommel had enough fuel for [...] per vehicle with the troops and [...] for other vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the western}} segment of the beltway was to begin in 1999, but was delayed by a lawsuit aimed at the Environmental Impact Statement. After the legal {{situation}} was resolved, the NCDOT then announced construction would begin in 2006; however, in March 2005, the department postponed the <b>start</b> <b>date</b> again until at least 2012, due to budget shortfalls. Funds once allocated to the western segment were then reapportioned {{to the construction of}} the eastern segment, which had a <b>planned</b> construction <b>start</b> <b>date</b> in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel {{is planned}} as a 27 km long roadway which will run below the Boknafjorden and Kvitsøyfjorden. A spur {{connection}} to the island municipality of Kvitsøy will also be added. The cost of the project is calculated to be [...] (about [...] ). The project has {{been approved by the}} Norwegian Parliament, and the <b>planned</b> construction <b>start</b> <b>date</b> is the fall of 2016 and it is planned to be finished in 2025-26.|$|R
40|$|Critical Path Method (CPM) {{scheduling}} {{is currently}} the dominant scheduling system in use in construction. Location Based Management System (LBMS) is increasingly being used as an alternative in the US, particularly in hospital construction. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide a critical evaluation of one such LBMS implementation by comparing it to a CPM implementation run in parallel. Three hypotheses drove this research. First, LBMS requires more person-hours than CPM to manage the schedule. Second, LBMS provides real-time information to make educated decisions about production control. Third, the subcontractors' <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> are controlled better than their production rates. Both systems are currently being used on a 1 million GSF OSHPD hospital in Northern California. Standard task lists were used to compare the different scheduling time requirements. CPM and LBMS reports were then compared to analyze the different deliverables. Finally, LBMS production data was reviewed against CPM actuals and <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> to evaluate the most effective method of subcontractor scope management. The results indicate that more time is required to update the CPM compared to the LBMS schedule on the standard task list. However, CPM supports many legacy processes such as change management. Production rates were controlled better than <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> in this project, contrary to our hypothesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of December 2006 for {{the open}} access {{operator}} Grand Central Railway was delayed {{in part due to}} the franchised operator GNER taking the Rail Regulator to Court over his decision to grant access rights.|$|E
50|$|The newscasts, titled Noticiero Telemundo 62 {{began on}} January 13, 2014, one week from the {{original}} <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date.</b> The newscast name was later changed to WWSI Telemundo News for unknown reasons in late January. WWSI maintains its own control room, which then runs through WCAU's main Digital Operations Center.|$|E
50|$|Grand Central, on the {{announcement}} of its planned open-access operation to Sunderland {{in the summer of}} 2006, planned to run its services using five Class 222 units, with the intention of starting {{by the end of that}} year. However, this never happened, pushing back the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> while the company looked for alternatives. Grand Central finally started operating in December 2007 using three High Speed Trains.|$|E
50|$|During further {{pre-operational}} testing, severe vibration of {{the fuel}} channel gags was detected. The fuel channel gags are valves which are gradually closed to restrict the flow of gas through a fuel channel {{in order to maintain}} the channel gas outlet temperature as the nuclear fuel is used up. Modifications to produce a fluidically generated bias force to stop the gags vibrating took time to design, test and implement, delaying the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> up <b>date.</b> The station began generating electricity on 5 February 1976.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2013, it was {{announced}} that race organizer Leo Hindery had signed a new, 15-year contract with F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone after all permits had been secured.

50|$|After some {{discussion}} {{it was agreed}} that the airline was not ready. It had a name, some excellent pilots, and some aircraft, but no ground facilities, no sales staff, no documentation, not even tickets. With a great deal of effort, {{it should be possible to}} make the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 7 October. With the discussion complete, Coles said I have news for you.

5|$|In October 1992, TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment were <b>planning</b> to <b>start</b> {{production}} on Zorro the following year, and hired Joel Gross {{to rewrite the}} script after they were impressed with his adaptation of The Three Musketeers. At the time, Spielberg was producing Zorro {{with the potential to}} direct. Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993, and TriStar entered pre-production, creating early promotion for the film that same month at the ShoWest trade show. By December 1993, Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg, and Mikael Salomon was attached as director. In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated {{that the rest of the}} major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a <b>planned</b> April 1995 <b>start</b> <b>date.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1978, {{he succeeded}} Max Euwe as President of the {{international}} chess governing body FIDE. During the tenure he presided over the 1981 Karpov-Korchnoi World Championship match. Since Korchnoi defected from the Soviet Union in 1976, the Soviets were holding Korchnoi's son, Igor. Olafsson delayed the <b>planned</b> September 19 <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of the match {{in a bid to}} get the Soviets to release Victor's son. For this attempt, Olafsson drew the wrath of the Soviets, who then backed the FIDE Vice-President, Florencio Campomanes for Presidency of FIDE. After losing the election in 1982, Olafsson was appointed Secretary to the Icelandic Parliament. Friðrik continued to play occasionally into the 21st century, winning a rapid match against fellow veteran Bent Larsen in 2003 by a score of 5-3.|$|R

50|$|The New Zealand {{government}} decided in 1987 to restore Akarana {{and give her}} to Australia as the county's gift to celebrate the Australian Bicentennial in 1988. The government purchased her from her existing owner, Andrew Bishop. Instead of the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 14 May 1987, delays meant she did not arrive back to New Zealand until 24 July 1987. Overseen by the Ministry of Transport {{in conjunction with the}} Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the restoration of the hull was undertaken by Salthouse Boatbuilders at Greenhithe, while the Navy Dockyard at Devonport were responsible for the masts, spars and rigging.|$|E

50|$|Arvind Swamy and {{director}} Selva discussed collaborations in early 2014 and during May 2014, Selva {{announced that the}} pair would work on a film titled Vanangamudi, where Arvind Swamy would portray a police officer. Despite <b>planning</b> an initial <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of July 2014, the film was delayed as Arvind Swamy prioritised other commitments. In early 2017, Arvind Swamy confirmed that the pair would begin work on the film soon, with Ritika Singh selected to play the lead actress. Magicbox Films agreed to produce the film, while D. Imman was signed as the film's music composer. For two further female lead roles of a journalist and a police officer, the team signed Chandini Tamilarasan and Nandita Swetha. Daniel Balaji was also briefly attached to the project but opted out citing date issues with his work for Ippadai Vellum (2017). Balaji was subsequently replaced by Harish Uthaman.|$|R
5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the <b>planned</b> production <b>start</b> <b>date.</b> Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|R

50|$|In November it was {{announced}} that plans for the competition were paralysed by legal disputes between PBS and Grace Borg. Despite this the Maltese Head of Delegation, Joe Dimech, has denied that the whole national selection process was in danger, and that PBS were consulting legal advice. New dates for the national selection were to be made after missing their <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 9 November for the first stage of the contest. On 18 November a Maltese court ruled in favour of PBS, in that they could prohibit foreign composers from competing in the GO Malta EuroSong 2010, finally allowing the Maltese selection process to continue.|$|E
