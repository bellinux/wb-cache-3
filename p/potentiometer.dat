25|$|The first guitar {{amplifier}} with a tremolo {{effect was}} produced by Fender in 1955. In that amplifier, the tremolo generator controlled the bias of an amplifier cascade located near the output circuit, and its harmonics were leaking to the output signal. In the early 1960s, Fender and Gibson used a RO as a modulator. Its photoresistor was connected via a blocking capacitor and a controlling <b>potentiometer</b> between {{the output of the}} preamplifier and the earth, and shunted the preamplifier when triggered. In this scheme, the control signal did not leak to the output. Modulation depth was regulated by a low-impedance <b>potentiometer</b> placed on the front panel. The <b>potentiometer</b> significantly reduced the gain of the previous stage, and thus the preamplifier had to have reserves by amplification.|$|E

25|$|The name {{varistor}} is a portmanteau {{of varying}} resistor. The term is only used for non-ohmic varying resistors. Variable resistors, {{such as the}} <b>potentiometer</b> and the rheostat, have ohmic characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The X-axis of {{the system}} was fed by a time base {{generator}} that pulled the beam {{from left to right}} across the screen. Normally a time base is triggered to start its sweep as soon as the signal from the transmitter is seen, but as noted above, this would not provide the accuracy required for this role. Instead, the time base was set to span the screen at a much faster rate, representing only a portion of the signal's overall flight time. Triggering the time base was accomplished using a very accurate oil-filled <b>potentiometer</b> which exponentially increased the charge in a capacitor bank until it reached a trigger value. A very complex grounding system was needed to ensure the accuracy of the voltages leaving the <b>potentiometer</b> system, as any stray voltages could overwhelm the signal.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{variable}} speed AC motors became available at reasonable prices. These motors allow the adjustment of the rotating speed via a <b>potentiometer</b> {{mounted on a}} control panel near the motor. They typically support rotation rates from about 1–12Hz. These motors remained the preferred solution until the 1990s, and are still in use.|$|E
5000|$|At {{its most}} basic, an analog {{sequencer}} {{consists of a}} bank of <b>potentiometers</b> and a [...] "clock" [...] (pulse generator) connected to a sequencer, which steps through these <b>potentiometers</b> {{one at a time}} and then cycles back to the beginning. The output of the sequencer is fed (as a control voltage and gate pulse) to a synthesizer.

The pitch bend wheel is usually on the left of the keyboard and is a spring-loaded <b>potentiometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{end point}} of most titrations is {{detected}} {{by the use}} of visual indicator but the method can be inaccurate in very dilute or colored solutions. However under the same conditions, a potentiometric method for the detection of the equivalence point can yield accurate results without difficulty. The electrical apparatus required consists of a <b>potentiometer</b> or pH meter with a suitable indicator and reference electrode. The other apparatus consists of a burette, beaker and stirrer.|$|E
25|$|A re-amping device {{commonly}} {{employs a}} reversed Direct Inject (DI) transformer with some resistors added for level and impedance shift. Level and impedance adjustment {{can be achieved}} by adding a <b>potentiometer</b> or adjustable resistor. A proper re-amping device converts a balanced signal to an unbalanced signal, reduces a high studio-level (line-level) signal down to a low guitar-level signal, and shifts the output to a high instrument-level impedance (typically a guitar pickup impedance).|$|E
50|$|The {{resistive}} element of inexpensive <b>potentiometers</b> is often made of graphite. Other materials used include resistance wire, carbon particles in plastic, and a ceramic/metal mixture called cermet.Conductive track <b>potentiometers</b> use conductive polymer resistor pastes that contain hard-wearing resins and polymers, solvents, and lubricant, {{in addition to}} the carbon that provides the conductive properties.|$|R

25|$|To make a range measurement, the {{operator}} {{would turn the}} <b>potentiometer</b> dial {{in an effort to}} get the leading edge of the target blip to line up with a vertical line on the CRT. The range was not read off the CRT, but the dial. The dial also turned a magslip, or selsyn as it is more commonly known today. The output of the magslip was used to directly turn the controls on the predictor, allowing the radar to continually update the range measurement.|$|E
25|$|Vactrols {{have been}} used as {{remote-controlled}} resistors for precise ground termination of Beverage and Ewe type antennae. In a typical ham radio setup, the vactrol is placed in the termination box at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies total resistance between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his radio shack by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a <b>potentiometer.</b> Tuning with vactrols improves directional cardioid pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols are superior to traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of neon lamps acting as gas dischargers.|$|E
25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the <b>potentiometer</b> with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E
50|$|User-actuated <b>potentiometers</b> {{are widely}} used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of {{equipment}} functions. The widespread use of <b>potentiometers</b> in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with rotary encoders, up/down push-buttons, and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors.|$|R
50|$|String <b>potentiometers</b> {{are used}} to measure the {{position}} of a moving object. The measurement cable can be connected directly to the moving part, giving a constant measurement of its linear position. This simple type of measurement device has been in use by engineers and designers for about 40 years. String <b>potentiometers</b> are generally durable, simple to use, and inexpensive.|$|R

25|$|Bode {{designed}} the velocity computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a {{finite difference method}} instead of differentiation. Under this scheme the target positional coordinates were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a <b>potentiometer</b> or a cam. The velocity was then calculated by taking {{the difference between the}} coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times. This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to random signal impulses (spikes). It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern digital signal processing theory rather than to the classical Calculus-based analog signal processing approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it {{is an integral part of}} modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm. In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating coordinate transformation-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.|$|E

On {{the left side of}} the front panel, a plastic volume knob is adjacent to a small-diameter rotating <b>potentiometer</b> that controls the balance. Then follows a bank of three press-button selector switches [...] for each of phono, tuner, tape [...] then a power on–off button. On the right side is a light-emitting diode (LED) indicating activity status. Sam Tellig of Stereophile said that the NAIT was [...] "a profoundly anarchistic, almost subversive product".|$|E
500|$|Released in 1994, the PlayStation {{control pad}} {{was the first}} {{controller}} made for the original PlayStation.

'Shoulder buttons' are also featured on the top [...] (named by the side [...] and 1 and 2 [...] ). In 1996, Sony released the PlayStation Analog Joystick for use with flight simulation games. The original digital controller was then replaced by the Dual Analog in 1997, which added two analog sticks {{based on the same}} <b>potentiometer</b> technology as the Analog Joystick.

30|$|The lateral and {{vertical}} deflections, {{combined with a}} twisting rotation of the beam, cannot be obtained directly from the measurement values of the <b>potentiometers.</b> Thus, a modified measurement method using two vertical <b>potentiometers,</b> which would be easier and more useful for instrumentation and data processing, was presented to determine the lateral {{and vertical}} deflections and rotation from the coupled measurements.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>potentiometer</b> or pot is a {{three-terminal}} resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider. [...] It {{is called a}} <b>potentiometer</b> {{because it can be}} connected as an adjustable voltage divider to provide a variable potential at the terminal connected to the tapping point. A volume control for an audio device is a common use of a <b>potentiometer.</b> [...] A typical low power <b>potentiometer</b> (see drawing) is constructed of a flat resistance element (B) of carbon composition, metal film, or conductive plastic, with a springy phosphor bronze wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "offset null" [...] pins {{may be used}} {{to place}} {{external}} resistors (typically {{in the form of the}} two ends of a <b>potentiometer,</b> with the slider connected to V'S–) in parallel with the emitter resistors of Q5 and Q6, to adjust the balance of the Q5/Q6 current mirror. The <b>potentiometer</b> is adjusted such that the output is null (midrange) when the inputs are shorted together.|$|E
2500|$|To {{provide a}} system {{able to make}} such an {{accurate}} measurement, and do so continually, Pollard developed a system that used the entire CRT display to provide a measurement showing only ranges a short distance {{on either side of}} a pre-selected range setting. The system worked by charging a capacitor at a known rate until it reached a threshold that triggered the time base. The time base was set to move across the screen in the time that represented less than a kilometre. A large <b>potentiometer</b> was used to control the charging rate, which provided a range offset. The range to the target was measured by using the <b>potentiometer</b> to move the blip until it {{was in the middle of}} the display, and then reading the range from a scale on the <b>potentiometer.</b> The basic system developed rapidly, and a test system was providing [...] accuracy for aircraft between [...] and [...] by the summer of 1937. By the end of the year this had improved to as accurate as [...]|$|E
