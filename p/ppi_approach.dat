In this work, we extend our recently proposed perturbed path-integral (<b>PPI)</b> <b>approach</b> for modeling NQE in molecular systems [I. Poltavsky and A. Tkatchenko, Chem. Sci. 7, 1368 (2016) ], which successfully combines the advantages of thermodynamic perturbation theory with path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), {{in a number of}} important directions. First, we demonstrate the accuracy, performance, and general applicability of the <b>PPI</b> <b>approach</b> to both molecules and extended (condensed-phase) materials. Second, we derive a series of estimators within the <b>PPI</b> <b>approach</b> to enable calculations of structural properties such as radial distribution functions (RDFs) that exhibit rapid convergence with respect to the number of beads in the PIMD simulation. Finally, we introduce an effective nuclear temperature formalism {{within the framework of the}} <b>PPI</b> <b>approach</b> and demonstrate that such effective temperatures can be an extremely useful tool in quantitatively estimating the “quantumness” associated with different degrees of freedom in the system as well as providing a reliable quantitative assessment of the convergence of PIMD simulations. Since the <b>PPI</b> <b>approach</b> only requires the use of standard second-order imaginary-time PIMD simulations, these developments enable one to include a treatment of NQE in equilibrium thermodynamic properties (such as energies, heat capacities, and RDFs) with the accuracy of higher-order methods but at a fraction of the computational cost, thereby enabling first-principles modeling that simultaneously accounts for the quantum mechanical nature of both electrons and nuclei in large-scale molecules and materials...|$|E
40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{for innovation}} {{is known as}} a powerful demandside instrument to be employed in addressing pertinent challenges. The Traditional procurement process is outdated and insufficient to stimulate the production of innovative results. However, while the Public Procurement of Innovation (<b>PPI)</b> <b>approach</b> addresses barriers of the Traditional procurement procedures regarding innovation, it also presents several barriers of its own. This thesis focuses on the particular case of PPI in Norway, where the account of the current state and usage of the <b>PPI</b> <b>approach</b> are described. Findings indicate a dominance of the traditional approaches in the current state of public procurement practices in Norway, with tendency towards exploitation rather than exploration, despite the country’s political ambitions. Several causes, other than the nature of “normal” routine purchases, seek to influence the procurer’s avoidance of more complex innovation-oriented tendering procedures. This study aims to explain this, and concludes with a discussion of potential improvements to stimulate the procurement of innovative products and services in Norway, based on the practical case of ICT procurements.

New approaches are required based on environmental information from in-situ, airborne and satellite observations. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing and geophysical techniques are two such approaches being pursued at the BGS to characterise mine waste and its host rocks and then to monitor its dispersal in the environment. This paper will report on two projects that have followed on from the successful completion of the MINEO project. MINEO applied hyperspectral remote sensing {{to a range of}} active and abandoned mining environments across Europe. Parys Mountain, on Anglesey, was the first site under investigation using HyMap data following MINEO. Here, the main task has been mapping the different tailings and characterising them mineralogically. Secondary investigations have involved the study of vegetation stress around the mine. Low-level airborne geophysical data already exist for the Bolsover area from the HiRES- 1 survey in 1998. HyMap data acquired during the NERC SAR and Hyperspectral Campaign (SHAC) over the Shirebrook mine within the HiRES- 1 area have been used to evaluate the use of airborne geophysical and hyperspectral data together to map open cast mines in the region. Mine site classifications were developed based on both field and image spectral interpretations. In all these projects, various techniques have been applied in order to classify mine sites in terms of mineralogy and contamination.

In this study we aimed to examine how task-related medial network activity and connectivity were affected by depression. Methods: Eighteen patients with major depressive disorder, aged 15 - to 24 -years-old, were matched with 19 healthy control participants. We characterised task-related activations and deactivations while participants engaged with an executive-control task (the multi-source interference task; MSIT). We used a psycho-physiological interactions (<b>PPI)</b> <b>approach</b> to examine functional connectivity changes with subgenual ACC. Voxelwise statistical maps for each analysis were compared between the patient and control groups. Results: There were no differences between groups in their behavioral performances on the MSIT task, and nor in patterns of activation and deactivation. Assessment of functional connectivity with the subgenual cingulate showed that depressed patients did not demonstrate the same reduction in functional connectivity with the ventral striatum during task performance, but that they showed greater reduction in functional connectivity with adjacent ventromedial frontal cortex. The magnitude of this latter connectivity change predicted the relative activation of task-relevant executive control regions in depressed patients.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{determining}} the main barriers for using Public Procurement for Innovation (<b>PPI)</b> as an <b>approach</b> to induce sustainable innovation {{in a national}} context. In order to do this, this thesis firstly examines the link between sustainability goals and innovation. It is concluded that, in order to change production and consumption patterns, innovation policy should aim at implementing approaches and instruments that induce sustainable development – thus effectively integrating the two goals of enhancing the innovativeness of a country and working towards a more sustainable society. Demand-driven innovation, and specifically Public Procurement for Innovation (PPI) seems to hold significant potential to reach this goal. However, as innovation policy traditionally focused on supply-driven innovation, this remains an underexplored field. Furthermore, the scope and status quo of different PPI schemes is largely unknown, which {{makes it difficult to}} determine the barriers to use PPI to induce sustainable innovation. Therefore, this research examines three countries’ PPI schemes {{in the context of their}} own innovation policy. The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK are all considered to be frontrunners in using demand-driven innovation and PPI. In order to provide context for the comparison and to determine the most important actors who influence the PPI policy, the innovation system approach is used. Through an examination of demand-oriented innovation policy theory, the PPI schemes are firstly categorised in terms of their PPI form and the rationales behind them, after which a capacity framework for successful innovation procurement is presented. This capacity framework is linked to several system failures that the PPI policy attempts to address – so as to establish a link between strong and weak points of the policy, and a solution to the system failures. The capacities that are identified in the framework are: coordination capacity, link with private demand, coping with complexity and procurement discourse, activating and enabling the procurement chain, and creating and maintaining a supporting innovation procurement culture. For all three countries, the development of innovation policy and the national innovation system is described. Secondly, through an examination of policy documents, scientific literature and in-depth interviews with a number of key actors, the PPI schemes of the three countries are reconstructed using a policy reconstruction method. Thirdly, some empirical evidence is provided in the shape of formal evaluations of practice and the revision of flagship cases. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of each country’s PPI schemes are determined using the capacity framework, after which conclusions are drawn regarding the PPI schemes’ ability to solve the system failures. In the comparative analysis, the main differences and similarities between the three countries are set forth. Then, the <b>PPI</b> <b>approaches</b> are compared in terms of their forms and rationales. Lastly, the countries’ strengths and weaknesses are compared, using the capacity framework again. It can be concluded that PPI has large potential to solve the system failures and as such facilitate innovation, especially in the environmental field or as a complementary asset to sustainable procurement. Ideally, a pre-commercial procurement scheme should aim at the development of R&D (especially through targeting SMEs), while a central procurement scheme should aim at integrating the innovation rationale throughout the government. Furthermore, sustainable procurement should be supplemented or integrated with innovation procurement, as both can enhance each other. The barriers for using PPI to induce sustainable innovation are found within all the capacities, although the capacity to create and maintain a supporting innovation procurement culture is least developed in all three countries: many existing rules as well as a lack of financial stimuli hamper the process. Furthermore, the capacity to activate and enable the procurement chain is also not very developed; although tender processes are increasingly based on functionalities rather than designs and a structure in which procurers have knowledge of the (future) needs of the public service is being developed, the incentive structure for procurers remains based on the lowest-cost rationale, and procurers are not sufficiently trained on an operative level. The capacity to cope with complexity and procurement discourse is moderately addressed, although the ambition level is not very high in all three countries. The coordination capacity is medium; most countries provide their departments with information and coordinate the policy from within the innovation department, but the commitment of other departments is mostly not sufficiently guaranteed. Lastly, the link with private demand is insufficient in all three countries, with the exception of sectoral <b>PPI</b> <b>approaches</b> in Sweden...|$|R

African governments and donors labored through the 1970 s and 1980 s to improve SOE performance through “commercialization”— —i. e., methods short of ownership change. These generally failed, giving rise, in the 1990 s, to much more heavy reliance on private sector participation and ownership. This approach produced some successes, but Africa’s private participation in infrastructure (PPI) initiatives have been comparatively few and weak. A number of those that have been launched have run into problems, to the point where both investor and African government interest in the approach has waned in the last few years. The reform is not popular—surveys of public opinion in 15 African countries reveal that only a third of respondents prefer private to state-owned firms.

While {{there is increasing}} consensus that results should be communicated to trial participants, {{there is a lack}} of evidence on the most appropriate methods of dissemination. This study within a trial (SWAT) aims to address this gap by using a public and patient involvement (<b>PPI)</b> <b>approach</b> to identify, develop and evaluate a patient-preferred method of receiving trial results of the Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Subclinical Hypothyroidism Trial (TRUST). Methods: An experimental (intervention) study will be conducted using mixed methods to inform the development of and evaluation of a patient-preferred method of communication of trial results. The study will involve three consecutive phases. In the first phase, focus groups of trial participants will be conducted to identify a patient-preferred method of receiving trial results. The method will be developed and then assessed and refined by a patient and public expert group. In the second phase participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention (patient-preferred method) and comparison groups (standard dissemination method as developed by the lead study site in Glasgow, Scotland). In the third phase, a quantitative questionnaire will be used to measure and compare patient understanding of trial results between the two groups.

40|$|Understanding the {{learning}} behavior of brain functional connectivity within motor sequence learning of foot tapping tasks {{is of great}} importance to help improving walking quality of elderly people. It is also {{of great interest to}} clinical and scientific communities. The role of functional connectivity in brain function has not yet been well understood. This study comprises of two parts; the first part is to investigate brain signal stationarity, while the other will look into brain interactions while performing motor learning sequence task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to acquire data from twelve healthy adult participants to study brain functional connectivity and interactions during a sequence of motor learning foot tapping tasks. Tasks were divided into: two different learning blocks, two control blocks, and five blocks of resting states. In this condition, 90 percent of the subjects developed awareness of the sequence. The stationarity of fMRI time series needs to be understood as it has important implications on the choice of appropriate approaches for the analysis of complex brain networks. The reverse arrangement test RAT was utilized to investigate the time series stationarity. Our analysis showed some non-stationary signals with a time varying first moment as a major source of non-stationarity. Next, we choose to apply psycho-physiological interactions (<b>PPI)</b> <b>approach</b> to our data and we revealed some information about the degree to which components of large-scale neural systems were functionally coupled together to achieve and perform the designed learning sequence task. In this work, we will introduce the idea of psycho-physiological interaction (PPI), which explains the responses in one cortical region in terms of an interaction between the effects of other regions and learning task parameter. We have found that the Thalamus was mostly involved and modulated with our predesigned motor learning task. We also found that the Middle frontal Gyrus and Left pre-central Gyrus were the most interacting regions with the above mentioned cluster. This interaction can only be related to the interactions that are based on the experimental factors which are the psychological and physiological interactions.

To understand the functional consequences and potential interactions of the associated loci, we explored large-scale data sets interrogating the human genome for evidence of positive natural selection. Our findings provide significant evidence for signatures of recent positive selection acting on several haplotypes carrying AD susceptibility alleles; interestingly, the genes found in these selected haplotypes can be assembled, independently, into a molecular complex via a protein-protein interaction (<b>PPI)</b> network <b>approach.</b> These results suggest a possible coevolution of genes encoding physically-interacting proteins that underlie AD susceptibility and are coexpressed in different tissues. In particular, PICALM, BIN 1, CD 2 AP, and EPHA 1 are interconnected through multiple interacting proteins and appear to have coordinated evidence of selection in the same human population, suggesting that they may be involved in the execution of a shared molecular function. This observation may be AD-specific, as the 12 loci associated with Parkinson disease do not demonstrate excess evidence of natural selection. The context for selection is probably unrelated to AD itself; it is likely that these genes interact in another context, such as in immune cells, where we observe cis-regulatory effects at several of the selected AD loci...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mutations in ABCC 6 {{underlie}} the ectopic mineralization disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and {{some forms of}} generalized arterial calcification of infancy, both of which affect the cardiovascular system. Using cultured cells, we recently showed that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 (ABCC 6) mediates the cellular release of ATP, which is extracellularly rapidly converted into AMP and the mineralization inhibitor inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The current study was performed to determine which tissues release ATP in an ABCC 6 -dependent manner in vivo, where released ATP is converted into AMP and PPi, and whether human PXE ptients have low plasma <b>PPi</b> concentrations. <b>APPROACH</b> AND RESULTS: Using cultured primary hepatocytes and in vivo liver perfusion experiments, we found that ABCC 6 mediates the direct, sinusoidal, release of ATP from the liver. Outside hepatocytes, but still within the liver vasculature, released ATP is converted into AMP and PPi. The absence of functional ABCC 6 in patients with PXE leads to strongly reduced plasma PPi concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic ABCC 6 -mediated ATP release is {{the main source of}} circulating PPi, revealing an unanticipated role of the liver in systemic PPi homeostasis. Patients with PXE have a strongly reduced plasma PPi level, explaining their mineralization disorder. Our results indicate that systemic PPi is relatively stable and that PXE, generalized arterial calcification of infancy, and other ectopic mineralization disorders could be treated with PPi supplementation therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Core {{elements}} of cell regulation {{are made up}} of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, many parts of the cell regulatory systems include unknown <b>PPIs.</b> To <b>approach</b> this problem, we have developed a computational method of high-throughput PPI network prediction based on all-to-all rigid-body docking of protein tertiary structures. The prediction system accepts a set of data comprising protein tertiary structures as input and generates a list of possible interacting pairs from all the combinations as output. A crucial advantage of this docking based method is in providing predictions of protein pairs that increases our understanding of biological pathways by analyzing the structures of candi-date complex structures, which gives insight into novel interaction mechanisms. Although such exhaustive docking calcu-lation requires massive computational resources, recent advancements in the computational sciences have made such large-scale calculations feasible. In this study we applied our prediction method to a pathway reconstruction problem of bacterial chemotaxis by using two different rigid-body docking tools with different scoring models. We found that the predicted interactions were different between the results from the two tools. When the positive predictions from both of the docking tools were combined, all the core signaling interactions were correctly predicted with the exception of interactions activated by protein phosphory-lation.

Many proteins play different roles in the cell by taking part in several processes, but isolating the different processes in which a protein is involved is often a difficult task. In this paper we present a method based on a greedy local search technique to detect functional modules in <b>PPI</b> graphs. The <b>approach</b> is conceived as a generalization of the algorithm PINCoC to generate overlapping clusters of the interaction graph in input. Due to this peculiarity, multi-facets proteins are allowed to belong to different groups corresponding to different biological processes. A comparison of the results obtained by our method {{with those of other}} well known clustering algorithms shows the capability of our approach to detect different and meaningful functional modules. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} older adults can benefit {{as much as}} younger adults from learning skills in an in-terleaved manner. Here we investigate whether optimized learning through interleaved practice (IP) is associated with changes in inter-regional brain connectivity and whether younger and older adults differ in such brain– behavior correlations. Younger and older adults practiced a set of three 4 -element motor sequences in a repetitive or in an interleaved order for 2 consecutive days. Retention of the practiced sequences was evaluated 3 days after practice with functional images acquired simultaneously. A within-subject design was used so that subjects prac-ticed sequences in the other condition (repetitive or interleaved) 2 – 4 weeks later. Using the psychophysiological interaction (<b>PPI)</b> analysis <b>approach,</b> we found that IP led to higher functional connectivity between {{the right and left}} dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and between the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in older adults. Moreover, increased connectivity between these regions was significantly associated with the learning benefits of IP. In contrast, in younger adults, enhanced learning as a result of IP was associated with increased connectivity between DLPFC and the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the inferior frontal gyrus. These data suggest that though younger and older gain similar behavioral benefits from interleaved train-ing, aging may alter the operation of brain networks underlying such optimized learning.

40|$|Protein-protein {{interaction}} (PPI) {{network analysis}} presents {{an essential role}} in understanding the functional relationship among proteins in a living biological system. Despite the success of current approaches for understanding the PPI network, the large fraction of missing and spurious PPIs and a low coverage of complete PPI network are the sources of major concern. In this paper, based on the diffusion process, we propose a new concept of global geometric affinity and an accompanying computational scheme to filter the uncertain PPIs, namely, reduce the spurious PPIs and recover the missing PPIs in the network. The main concept defines a diffusion process in which all proteins simultaneously participate to define a similarity metric (global geometric affinity (GGA)) to robustly reflect the internal connectivity among proteins. The robustness of the GGA is attributed to propagating the local connectivity to a global representation of similarity among proteins in a diffusion process. The propagation process is extremely fast as only simple matrix products are required in this computation process and thus our method is geared toward applications in high-throughput PPI networks. Furthermore, we proposed two new approaches that determine the optimal geometric scale of the PPI network and the optimal threshold for assigning the PPI from the GGA matrix. Our approach is tested with three protein-protein interaction networks and performs well with significant random noises of deletions and insertions in true <b>PPIs.</b> Our <b>approach</b> has the potential t...|$|R
40|$|Protein-protein {{interactions}} (PPIs) are key drug {{targets and}} recent breakthroughs {{in this area}} are providing insight into the types of molecules needed to selectively and potently inhibit a target traditionally seen as untractable. The rules that have been used to design classic substratecompetitive drugs (for example Lipinski's rule of five) may not apply in this new field in the same way. Here I present work performed in three systems that are well-validated drug targets for oncogenesis: the CDK 2 /cyclin A complex, the PLK 1 Polobox domain and MDM 2. In each case the site of the protein-protein interaction is defined and understood and the rationale for pharmaceutical intervention is clear. I use these as a model system to evaluate the characteristics of drugs that target protein-protein interaction sites and present work on the development of inhibitors as potential leads for subsequent drug development. In Chapter 1 I introduce the problems, challenges and rewards of PPI drug development; in Chapter 2 I present co-crystal structures of MDM 2 with isoindolinone inhibitors; in Chapter 3 I detail attempts to co-crystallise the Plk 1 Polobox with inhibitors and screen potential inhibitors; in Chapter 4 I present the results of screening to identify inhibitors of Cyclin A recruitment; and in Chapter 5 I discuss other strategies for inhibition of the CDK 2 /cyclin A complex, including results with a covalent inhibitor. Through these projects I have been able to demonstrate the wide applicability of the <b>PPI</b> inhibition <b>approach,</b> identify key features of drugs able to inhibit PPIs and contribute to drug design in each system.

40|$|Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) extraction, among ongoing {{biomedical}} {{text mining}} challenges, {{is becoming a}} topic in focus because of its crucial role in providing a starting point to understand biological processes. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to extract the PPI information from biomedical literature. Although they have provided reasonable performance so far, more features are required for real use. In particular, many ML-approaches lack human understandability for learned models. Here, we propose a novel method for classifying <b>PPI</b> sentences. Our <b>approach</b> utilizes the modified hypernetwork model, a hypergraph with weighted hyperedges that are calibrated via an evolutionary learning method. The evolutionary hypernetwork memorizes fragments of training patterns while selfadjusting its own structure for detecting PPI sentences. For experiments, we show that our approach provides competitive performance compared to other ML methods. Apart from its superior classification performance, the evolving hypernetwork model comes with a highly interpretable structure. We show how significant PPI patterns can be naturally extracted from the learned model. We also analyze the discovered patterns...|$|R
40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) {{technologies are}} providing genomic information for {{an increasing number}} of healthy individuals and patient populations. In the context of the large amount of generated genomic data that is being generated, understanding the effect of disease-related mutations at molecular level can contribute to close the gap between genotype and phenotype and thus improve prevention, diagnosis or treatment of a pathological condition. In order to fully characterize the effect of a pathological mutation and have useful information for prediction purposes, it is important first to identify whether the mutation is located at a protein-binding interface, and second to understand the effect on the binding affinity of the affected interaction/s. Computational methods, such as protein docking are currently used to complement experimental efforts and could help to build the human structural interactome. Here we have extended the original pyDockNIP method to predict the location of disease-associated nsSNPs at protein-protein interfaces, when there is no available structure for the protein-protein complex. We have applied this approach to the pathological interaction networks of six diseases with low structural data on <b>PPIs.</b> This <b>approach</b> can almost double the number of nsSNPs that can be characterized and identify edgetic effects in many nsSNPs that were previously unknown. This can help to annotate and interpret genomic data from large-scale population studies, and to achieve a better understanding of disease at molecular level.

40|$|Plants are {{frequently}} affected by pathogen infections. To effectively defend against such infections, two major modes of innate immunity have evolved in plants; pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity. Although the molecular components {{as well as}} the corresponding pathways involved in these two processes have been identified, many aspects of the molecular mechanisms of the plant immune system remain elusive. Recently, the rapid development of omics techniques (e. g., genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics) has provided a great opportunity to explore plant—pathogen interactions from a systems perspective and studies on protein—protein interactions (PPIs) between plants and pathogens have been carried out and characterized at the network level. In this review, we introduce experimental and computational identification methods of PPIs, popular <b>PPI</b> network analysis <b>approaches,</b> and existing bioinformatics resources/tools related to PPIs. Then, we focus on reviewing the progress in genome-wide PPI networks related to plant—pathogen interactions, including pathogen-centric PPI networks, plant-centric PPI networks and interspecies PPI networks between plants and pathogens. We anticipate genome-wide PPI network analysis will provide a clearer understanding of plant—pathogen interactions and will offer some new opportunities for crop protection and improvement...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of fluorescence-based methods and kinetic {{analysis in the}} screening and molecular-scale mechanistic investigation of PPI modulation by small molecules is discussed through several representative examples collected and commented. These experimental approaches {{take advantage of a}} variety of observables. Changes in the protein aggregation pattern have been monitored through fluorescence properties such as spectra, intensities (related to quantum yields), time-decays, and anisotropies of intrinsic protein fluorophores, of extrinsic fluorescent tags and, even, of the same small molecules added to modulate PPIs, as well as through bimolecular excited-state processes such as static and collisional quenching, including electron and excitation-energy transfer, or exciton interaction, whose efficiencies are crucially structure dependent. Besides allowing for quali/quantitative information on the small-molecule induced <b>PPI</b> modulation, these <b>approaches</b> can take advantage from the sensitivity of fluorescence observables on fine structural details to shed light on the molecular-scale mechanisms of action and their functional consequences. Direct investigation of the latter by kinetic inhibition analysis represents a useful change in perspective whenever PPI are relevant for enzyme activity. Dissociative inhibition, that is, the ability of some small molecules to inhibit enzymes by disrupting their active oligomeric assembly is shortly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{genome-wide}} association studies (GWAS) has increased {{rapidly in the}} past couple of years, resulting in the identification of genes associated with different diseases. The next step in translating these findings into biomedically useful information is to find out the mechanism of the action of these genes. However, GWAS studies often implicate genes whose functions are currently unknown; for example, MYEOV, ANKLE 1, TMEM 45 B and ORAOV 1 are found to be associated with breast cancer, but their molecular function is unknown. Results: We carried out Bayesian inference of Gene Ontology (GO) term annotations of genes by employing the directed acyclic graph structure of GO and the network of protein-protein interactions (<b>PPIs).</b> The <b>approach</b> is designed based on the fact that two proteins that interact biophysically would be in physical proximity of each other, would possess complementary molecular function, and play role in related biological processes. Predicted GO terms were ranked according to their relative association scores and the approach was evaluated quantitatively by plotting the precision versus recall values and F-scores (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) versus varying thresholds. Precisions of ~ 58 % and ~ 40 % for localization and functions respectively of proteins were determined at a threshold of ~ 30 (top 30 GO terms in the ranked list). Comparison with function prediction based on semantic similarity among nodes in an ontology and incorporation of those similarities in a k-nearest neighbor classifier confirmed that our results compared favorably. Conclusions: This approach was applied to predict the cellular component and molecular function GO terms of all human proteins that have interacting partners possessing at least one known GO annotation. The list of p redictions is available at [URL] We present the algorithm, evaluations and the results of the computational predictions, especially for genes identified in GWAS studies to be associated with diseases, which are of translational interest. © 2014 Kuppuswamy et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|To study virus–host protein interactions, {{knowledge}} about viral and host protein architectures and repertoires, their particular evolutionary mechanisms, {{and information on}} relevant sources of biological data is essential. The purpose of this review article {{is to provide a}} thorough overview about these aspects. Protein domains are basic units defining protein interactions, and the uniqueness of viral domain repertoires, their mode of evolution, and their roles during viral infection make viruses interesting models of study. Mutations at protein interfaces can reduce or increase their binding affinities by changing protein electrostatics and structural properties. During the course of a viral infection, both pathogen and cellular proteins are constantly competing for binding partners. Endogenous interfaces mediating intraspecific interactions—viral–viral or host–host interactions—are constantly targeted and inhibited by exogenous interfaces mediating viral–host interactions. From a biomedical perspective, blocking such interactions is the main mechanism underlying antiviral therapies. Some proteins are able to bind multiple partners, and their modes of interaction define how fast these “hub proteins” evolve. “Party hubs” have multiple interfaces; they establish simultaneous/stable (domain–domain) interactions, and tend to evolve slowly. On the other hand, “date hubs” have few interfaces; they establish transient/weak (domain–motif) interactions by means of short linear peptides (15 or fewer residues), and can evolve faster. Viral infections are mediated by several protein–protein interactions (PPIs), which can be represented as networks (protein interaction networks, PINs), with proteins being depicted as nodes, and their interactions as edges. It has been suggested that viral proteins tend to establish interactions with more central and highly connected host proteins. In an evolutionary arms race, viral and host proteins are constantly changing their interface residues, either to evade or to optimize their binding capabilities. Apart from gaining and losing interactions via rewiring mechanisms, virus–host PINs also evolve via gene duplication (paralogy); conservation (orthology); horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (xenology); and molecular mimicry (convergence). The last sections of this review focus on <b>PPI</b> experimental <b>approaches</b> and their limitations, and provide an overview of sources of biomolecular data for studying virus–host protein interactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA-mediated {{interference}} (RNAi) -based {{functional genomics}} is a systems-level approach to identify novel genes that control biological phenotypes. Existing computational approaches can identify individual genes from RNAi datasets that regulate a given biological process. However, currently available methods cannot identify which RNAi screen "hits" are novel components of well-characterized biological pathways known {{to regulate the}} interrogated phenotype. In this study, we describe a method to identify genes from RNAi datasets that are novel components of known biological pathways. We experimentally validate our approach {{in the context of}} a recently completed RNAi screen to identify novel regulators of melanogenesis. Results In this study, we utilize a <b>PPI</b> network topology-based <b>approach</b> to identify targets within our RNAi dataset that may be components of known melanogenesis regulatory pathways. Our computational approach identifies a set of screen targets that cluster topologically in a human PPI network with the known pigment regulator Endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB). Validation studies reveal that these genes impact pigment production and EDNRB signaling in pigmented melanoma cells (MNT- 1) and normal melanocytes. Conclusions We present an approach that identifies novel components of well-characterized biological pathways from functional genomics datasets that could not have been identified by existing statistical and computational approaches. </p...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{transcriptional}} regulatory interactions (TRIs) {{is essential}} for exploring functional genomics and systems biology in any organism. While several results from genome-wide analysis of transcriptional regulatory networks are available, they are limited to model organisms such as yeast (1) and worm (2). Beyond these networks, experiments on TRIs study only individual genes and proteins of specific interest. In this chapter, we present a method for the integration of various data sets to predict TRIs for 54 organisms in the Bioverse (3). We describe how to compile and handle various formats and identifiers of data sets from different sources and how to predict TRIs using a homology-based approach, utilizing the compiled data sets. Integrated data sets include experimentally verified TRIs, binding sites of transcription factors, promoter sequences, protein subcellular localization, and protein families. Predicted TRIs expand the networks of gene regulation for {{a large number of}} organisms. The integration of experimentally verified and predicted TRIs with other known protein–protein interactions (PPIs) gives insight into specific pathways, network motifs, and the topological dynamics of an integrated network with gene expression under different conditions, essential for exploring functional genomics and systems biology.
