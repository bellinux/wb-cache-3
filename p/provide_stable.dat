5|$|The Bank of the United States was {{established}} by Alexander Hamilton to <b>provide</b> <b>stable</b> banking services on a national scale, and sought to open a branch in Boston. Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts, and Gore {{decided to make the}} move. He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank, and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank. He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank, a relatively large investment. Gore was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch, and sought to merge state-chartered banks into the organization, arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service. Gore resigned from the board in 1794, citing the demands of his law practice.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to <b>provide</b> <b>stable</b> rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss {{him in the middle of}} the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên. In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.|$|E

Seymour reasoned that dinosaurs would have needed to be endothermic since they would have needed powerful muscles and endurance to compete with and dominate mammals throughout the Mesozoic era.|$|E

Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.|$|E

25|$|Large power fuses use fusible {{elements}} made of silver, copper or tin to <b>provide</b> <b>stable</b> {{and predictable}} performance. High voltage expulsion fuses surround the fusible link with gas-evolving substances, such as boric acid. When the fuse blows, {{heat from the}} arc causes the boric acid to evolve large volumes of gases. The associated high pressure (often greater than 100 atmospheres) and cooling gases rapidly quench the resulting arc. The hot gases are then explosively expelled out of the end(s) of the fuse. Such fuses can only be used outdoors.|$|E

2500|$|Counting sort is {{applicable}} when each input {{is known to}} belong to a particular set, S, of possibilities. [...] The algorithm runs in O(|S| + n) time and O(|S|) memory where n is the length of the input. [...] It works by creating an integer array of size |S| and using the ith bin to count the occurrences of the ith member of S in the input. [...] Each input is then counted by incrementing the value of its corresponding bin. [...] Afterward, the counting array is looped through to arrange all of the inputs in order. [...] This sorting algorithm often cannot be used because S needs to be reasonably small for the algorithm to be efficient, but it is extremely fast and demonstrates great asymptotic behavior as n increases.
