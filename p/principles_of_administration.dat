This lasted {{about a quarter of}} an hour; King then saluted everybody, taking off TRES-AFFECTUEUSEMENT his hat, which he immediately put on again. Had now his affable mien, and was most polite to the strangers present. At dinner, conversation turned on the Wars of Louis XIV.; then on English-American War,--King always blaming the English, whom he does not like. Dinner lasted three hours. His Majesty said more than once to me [in ill humor, I should almost guess, and wishful to hide it]: 'Complete freedom here, as if we were in our Tavern, Sir (ICI, TOUTE LIBERTE, MONSIEUR, COMME SI NOUS ETIONS AU CABARET)!'

6000|$|Some {{may think}} that, however much the central {{authority}} surpasses the local in {{knowledge of the}} <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> the great object which {{has been so much}} insisted on, the social and political education of the citizens, requires that they should be left to manage these matters by their own, however imperfect lights. To this it might be answered that the education of the citizens is not the only thing to be considered; government and administration do not exist for that alone, great as its importance is. But the objection shows a very imperfect understanding of the function of popular institutions as a means of political instruction. It is but a poor education that associates ignorance with ignorance, and leaves them, if they care for knowledge, to grope their way to it without help, and to do without it if they do not. What is wanted is the means of making ignorance aware of itself, and able to profit by knowledge; accustoming minds which know only routine to act upon, and feel the value of principles; teaching them to compare different modes of action, and learn, by the use of their reason, to distinguish the best. When we desire to have a good school, we do not eliminate the teacher. The old remark, [...] "As the schoolmaster is, so will be the school," [...] is as true of the indirect schooling of grown people by public business as of the schooling of youth in academies and colleges. A government which attempts to do every thing is aptly compared by M. Charles de Rémusat to a schoolmaster who does all the pupils' tasks for them; he may be very popular with the pupils, but he will teach them little. A government, on the other hand, which neither does any thing itself that can possibly be done by any one else, nor shows any one else how to do any thing, is like a school {{in which there is no}} schoolmaster, but only pupil-teachers who have never themselves been taught.|$|E
60|$|To {{decide this}} question, it is {{essential}} to consider what is the comparative position of the central and the local authorities as capacity for the work, and security against negligence or abuse. In the first place, the local representative bodies and their officers are almost certain to be of a much lower grade of intelligence and knowledge than Parliament and the national executive. Secondly, besides being themselves of inferior qualifications, they are watched by, and accountable to an inferior public opinion. The public under whose eyes they act, and by whom they are criticized, is both more limited in extent and generally far less enlightened than that which surrounds and admonishes the highest authorities at the capital, while the comparative smallness of the interests involved causes even that inferior public to direct its thoughts to the subject less intently and with less solicitude. Far less interference is exercised by the press and by public discussion, and that which is exercised may with much more impunity be disregarded in the proceedings of local than in those of national authorities. Thus far, the advantage seems wholly on the side of management by the central government; but, when we look more closely, these motives of preference are found to be balanced by others fully as substantial. If the local authorities and public are inferior to the central ones in knowledge of the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> they have the compensatory advantage of a far more direct interest in the result. A man's neighbors or his landlord may be much cleverer than himself, and not without an indirect interest in his prosperity, but, for all that, his interests will be better attended to in his own keeping than in theirs. It is further to be remembered that, even supposing the central government to administer through its own officers, its officers do not act at the centre, but in the locality; and however inferior the local public may be to the central, it is the local public alone which has any opportunity of watching them, and it is the local opinion alone which either acts directly upon their own conduct, or calls the attention of the government to the points in which they may require correction. It is but in extreme cases that the general opinion of the country is brought to bear at all upon details of local administration, and still more rarely has it the means of deciding upon them with any just appreciation of the case. Now the local opinion necessarily acts far more forcibly upon purely local administrators. They, in the natural course of things, are permanent residents, not expecting to be withdrawn from the place when they cease to exercise authority in it; and their authority itself depends, by supposition, on the will of the local public. I need not dwell on the deficiencies of the central authority in detailed knowledge of local persons and things, and the too great engrossment of its time and thoughts by other concerns to admit of its acquiring {{the quantity and quality of}} local knowledge necessary even for deciding on complaints, and enforcing responsibility from so great a number of local agents. In the details of management, therefore, the local bodies will generally have the advantage, but in comprehension of the principles even of purely local management, the superiority of the central government, when rightly constituted, ought to be prodigious, not only by reason of the probably great personal superiority of the individuals composing it, and the multitude of thinkers and writers who are at all times engaged in pressing useful ideas upon their notice, but also because the knowledge and experience of any local authority is but local knowledge and experience, confined to their own part of the country and its modes of management, whereas the central government has the means of knowing all that is to be learned from the united experience of the whole kingdom, with the addition of easy access to that of foreign countries.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine how the EU {{directive}} 2004 / 35 /EC on environmental liability impacts the Swedish administrative legal order. The thesis examines the directive through two main EU principles - the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good <b>administration</b> and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> procedural autonomy. The EU <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good <b>administration</b> as a concept contains various procedural and substantive obligations {{that make up the}} subject for examination of the directive, both as regulated in the directive and as general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law. The directive is analyzed using a comparative method to determine to what extent the procedural and substantive <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the directive impacts the Swedish administrative law, and weather or not the Swedish regulations comply with the EU <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good <b>administration.</b> The results <b>of</b> the study shows that, althought there’s a general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> national procedural autonomy, the EU <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> good <b>administration</b> do affect the Swedish administrative regulation in various aspects, through the implementaion of the directive on environmental liability as well as general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law.

At the argument on September 11 Wright again took the maximum view of executive privilege. In {{response to a question}} by Chief Judge David L.

He said, however, that the White House had made information available, waiving the privilege, but tapes constituted [...] "the raw material of life," [...] something essentially privileged. Wright maintained that the privilege survived even if abused, such as by the president engaging in fraud or other crime. Cox's approach, just as in the sit-in and reapportionment cases, was to avoid asserting a broad legal principle and instead show how the case was sui generis, unlikely to establish a precedent soon relied on, and one which fit easily within existing <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> of justice.

It is obvious that the implementation of decentralization policy or local autonomy is mostly determined by the existing political system and structure. On the Second Stage of local (Daerah Tingkat II), there are various local or internal factors which appears to be very influential for the effectiveness of such policy implementation. A descriptive analysis of the two Second Stage of local governments (Cilacap and Kudus) indicates there are significant policy implementation differences. The very fact that there are local condition differences, specific handicaps confronted by local government, and some variance in human resources capability implies that the idea of uniformity in most of administrative procedure might not favourable for the future of decentralization and local outonomy policy. This is particularly important if we analyze all aspects related to such policy implementation. The above things do get sufficient attention in nearly all of this paper...|$|E
