In the development of detect-classification system, we designed the back-propagation neural network which combined with Visual Basic as the interface and MATLAB as an image-processing tool. The system is able to determine and display the detected results. The defect classification mainly designed to detect and classify the following defects: the second layer of the <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> residue (AS-Residue), the second layer of large-area <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> residue (AS-BPADJ), and the third layer of <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> residue (M 2 -residue) in the Array Photolithography Process. Finally, the result is shown the fact that without the complicated processing procedures, the four defects in the TFT-LCD Array Photo Process can be precisely and quickly classified by imaging processing and back-propagation neural network training. As result, it is feasible to reduce the costs {{and the risk of}} human judgments...|$|R

Previously, a 3 D stacked receiver module was fabricated by utilizing an ultra-thick <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> ramp to form a wafer level package strategy.

Instead of stacking the photodiode array on the TIA/LA chip, we placed them side-by-side on a silicon carrier in very close proximity.

The non-curing lacquer adheres to the enamel and a <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> material satisfactorily adheres to the partially cured lacquer. Once normal photo etching techniques are employed the lacquer coats can be easily removed from the enamel leaving the photo etched image.

40|$|Abstract — Beyond {{the great}} {{gravimetric}} sensitivity {{provided by the}} polymer guiding layer of shear surface wave on quartz resulting from a low acoustic velocity, the use of <b>photo</b> <b>resists</b> provide economical means of depositing guiding layers of optimal thicknesses compared to inorganic layer deposition processes (typically PECVD deposition of silicon dioxide lasting several hours). We here analyze {{the evolution of the}} guiding layer properties, i. e. the acoustic velocity and losses, as a function of time (solvent evaporation following <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> spin coating) and temperature (typical baking steps). The polymer films is deposited on an AT-cut quartz substrate patterned with passivated (SiO 2) inter-digital transducers (Al) for generating 40 µm-wavelength shear waves converted to a guided Love mode in a delay line configuration.

40|$|In {{the current}} paper, the {{fabrication}} process {{of a novel}} proposed hemispherical polysilicon shell standing on a hemispherical silicon cavity is demonstrated. This micro-fabrication process combines both bulk and surface micromachining, which include the isotropic wet etching, a novel mask design, the thick <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> coating and exposure, and high-aspect-ratio curved sacrificial technique. In isotropic wet etching of a hemispherical cavity, the optimal concentration of etchant is experimentally determined along with adequate ultrasonic vibration during wet etching to produce the circle-like of hemispherical cavity. The conventional alignment mark, which will be destroyed during the rather long isotropic wet etching process, {{is replaced by a}} novel mask design with the second alignment mark. Also, for a deep hemispherical cavity larger than 100 µm, the traditional <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> can not be coated on the corner surface well. The thick <b>photo</b> <b>resist,</b> AZ 4620, is found to be able to overcome this problem and be successfully exposed all through its bottom surface. Furthermore, the deposited sacrificial layer materials (PSG) on this cavity will usually result in thinner layer near the corner. In addition, the curved gap of PSG layer has the feature with high-aspect-ratio. These make the PSG etching difficult. Therefore, two steps etching process with two different hydrofluoric concentrations are used to release the PSG with 2 µm thickness and 150 µm arc length...|$|R
50|$|Type 2 {{photosensitive}} anodized aluminum {{is typically}} {{coated with a}} <b>photo</b> <b>resist,</b> which may be of either {{the positive or negative}} type. Exposure of the <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> through a negative and its subsequent development creates areas on the plate that are either protected by the resist or exposed to the effects of the dye, bleach, or etchant that are used to create the contrasting mark. Type 2 photosensitive anodized aluminum must be sealed just like Type 1. Common use for Type 2 applications are those where color (other than black) is desired on the finished product. The dyes used to create colored Type 2 plates can vary significantly in their heat and color fastness, so are often limited to indoor or short-term outdoor usage. Note that colored dyes can also be incorporated into Type 1 photosensitive anodized aluminum.|$|R

A film of tantalum was deposited by sputtering followed by a layer of gold by evaporation. The gold layer was first etched following application of a <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> to form solder compatible connection pads. Resistive networks were formed, also by a <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> and etching process. These were trimmed to a high precision by selective adonization of the film. Capacitors and semiconductors were {{in the form of}} LID (Leadless Inverted Devices) soldered to the surface by selectively heating the substrate from the underside. Completed circuits were potted in a diallyl phthalate resin. Several customized passive networks were made using these techniques as were some amplifiers and other specialized circuits.

From the SFM images vertical structures (root mean square roughness) as well as lateral structures (most prominent in-plane lengths) are extracted. Advancing and receding contact angles were measured to characterize changes in hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface properties of the <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> after development.

40|$|As {{the success}} and {{functionality}} of smart phones {{continues to grow}} around the world, miniaturization of electronic components {{remains one of the}} main trends in mobile communications [1]. Wafer Level Packaging (WLP) continues to be a significant area of interest for RF front end module makers such as TriQuint. The possibilities to shrink die sizes and simplify the packaging process can amount to a sig-nificant cost saving. This can be of strategic im-portance in a market where price competition is fierce. WLP processes are evolving, from flip chip capabil-ity to 3 dimensional cavity formations at the wafer level.

Structural changes in the ULK layer {{with respect to the}} carbon content were analyzed. Using a downstream and a reactive ion etch process for <b>photo</b> <b>resist</b> removal a reduction of carbon was observed. For different plasma gas chemistries the pore size reduction depends first on the process condition (downstream or reactive ion etch) and then on the gas.
