40|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA), is a <b>polyanionic</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> that {{consists}} of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and beta-glucoronic acid.

Initially the main functions of HA were believed to be mechanical as it has a protective, structure stabilizing and shock-absorbing role in the body.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heparin and poly-L-glutamate on the {{function}} of inhibitory M 2 muscarinic autoreceptors on parasympathetic nerves in the lung was tested in antigen-challenged guinea pigs. After antigen challenge, M 2 receptor function is decreased, thus increasing release of acetylcholine from the vagus and potentiating vagally induced bronchoconstriction. Guinea pigs were anesthetized, tracheostomized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated. Electrical stimulation of the vagi caused bronchoconstriction and bradycardia. In controls, pilocarpine attenuated vagally induced bronchoconstriction by stimulating neuronal M 2 muscarinic receptors. Conversely, blocking these autoreceptors with gallamine potentiated vagally induced bronchoconstriction. In challenged animals the effects of both drugs were markedly reduced, confirming M 2 receptor dysfunction. 20 min after heparin or poly-L-glutamate, the effects of both pilocarpine and gallamine on vagally induced bronchoconstriction were restored, demonstrating recovery of M 2 receptor function. Neither heparin nor poly-L-glutamate affected vagally induced responses in control animals.

40|$|Cationic {{antimicrobial}} peptides (CAPs) are {{an important}} component of the innate immune system and are instrumental in the elimination of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, yeast, fungi and cancerous cells from the body. CAPs are comprised of less than 100 amino acids and have a net positive charge due to a multitude of basic residues in their primary sequences. CAPs exert their antimicrobial activity primarily through the formation of pores in microbial membranes, but also play important immunostimulatory roles in the body. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are negatively charged, polydisperse linear polysaccharides found at cellular surfaces. Although many protein-binding interactions of the GAG family, including heparin and heparan sulfate, have been well-characterized, it is not known to what extent endogenous GAGs affect the innate immune system. In the studies here the modulatory activities of GAGs and other <b>polyanionic</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> (PPSs) on CAPs were probed. Initial studies focused on interactions between a short peptide derived from bovine lactoferricin and GAGs. GAGs and other PPSs were then tested for their ability to modulate the antimicrobial activities of a number of CAPs against Gram-positive and -negative organisms. GAGs were also tested for the ability to modulate CAPs binding to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. CAP affinities for the GAGs were determined from lipopolysaccharide competition binding assays.

40|$|Reports on {{the lethal}} {{activity}} of animal antibiotic peptides have largely focused on bacterial rather than eukaryotic targets. In these, involvement of internal organelles {{as well as}} mechanisms {{different from those of}} prokaryotic cells have been described. CA(1 - 8) M(1 - 18) is a synthetic cecropin A-melittin hybrid peptide with leishmanicidal activity. Using Leishmania donovani promastigotes as a model system we have studied the mechanism of action of CA(1 - 8) M(1 - 18), its two parental peptides and two analogues. At micromolar concentration CA(1 - 8) M(1 - 18) induces a fast permeability to H+/OH-, collapse of membrane potential and morphological damage to the plasma membrane. Effects on other organelles are related to the loss of internal homeostasis of the parasite rather than to a direct effect of the peptide. Despite the fast kinetics of the process, the parasite is able to deactivate in part the effect of the peptide, as shown by the higher activity of the d-enantiomer of CA(1 - 8) M(1 - 18). Electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the promastigote membrane, the first event in the lethal sequence, is inhibited by <b>polyanionic</b> <b>polysaccharides,</b> including its own lipophosphoglycan.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} therapeutic achievements, infectious diseases, such as viral infections, {{remain a}} continuous hazard to human health, {{in part due}} to emergence or re-emergence of new and hazardous viruses or the lack of appropriate vaccines or prophylactic or post-exposure therapies. Successful elimination of infectious viruses highly depends on the dynamic interplay between leukocytes and proteins of the fast-responding broad-spectrum innate and more slowly and highly specific adaptive immune system. Extensive research efforts during the last decade demonstrated the processes of virus recognition and innate defense signaling by host cells as essential steps that shape the overall immune response to virus infections. As a result, insight into general molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immunity together with comprehensive understanding of the particular contribution of a specific leukocyte subset within a given virus infection, are critical to understand viral pathogenesis and immunopathology. Furthermore, exploring the mechanisms by which the innate immune system can be triggered to sustain an effective adaptive immune response may pave the way to new therapy and vaccine strategies. COAM (chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose) is a <b>polyanionic</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> derivative which has been synthesized at the Rega Institute and has been known for many years as an antiviral agent. Its broad-spectrum antiviral potency has been demonstrated in lethal virus infection models, such as influenza virus and herpes simplex virus-induced and mengovirus-induced encephalitis. A thorough comprehension about its mechanism of action remained unexplored, though, it was initially suggested that COAM modulates the immune response by acting as an antiviral interferon (IFN) inducer. In the framework of this doctoral research our principal aim was to elucidate which molecules and cells of the innate immune system were responsible for the antiviral resistance induced by COAM in vivo, and to gain insight into the impact of pharmacological modulation of antiviral immunity on the outcome of infection. Throughout this project, a mouse picornavirus, i. e. mengovirus, which induces fatal meningoencephalitis, was used as a model to study the protective mechanisms of COAM on acute lethal virus infection. In a first part of this doctoral thesis, we investigated direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms of COAM in vitro, and attempted to draw a comparison with the dsRNA mimetic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid or poly(I:C), which is a well-known antiviral interferon (IFN) inducer. Although COAM and poly(I:C) share a polyanionic nature, their mode of action in vitro relies on different mechanisms. In comparison with a strong IFN induction and mRNA upregulation of the helicases RIG-I and MDA- 5 by poly(I:C), COAM did not enhance IFN-a or -ß and IFN-inducible RNA helicases in mouse fibroblastoid cells. Instead, COAM inhibited virus entry by blocking the attachment to the cells. These results suggest that COAM can alter the outcome of in vitro infection, not by IFNinduction and in turn modifying the cellular antiviral state, but through inhibition of virus entry into cells. However, although these data point to virus attachment to the cell membrane as the target of antiviral action, this viral entry-inhibiting effect was rather weak, suggesting that this effect is unlikely to fully account for the previously observed potent in vivo antiviral protection by COAM. Secondly, possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of innate immunity that might underlie the observed antiviral protection by COAM in vivo were further explored. The COAM mixture was fractionated and prophylactic intraperitoneal treatment of mice with COAM polymers of high molecular weight resulted in a conversion from 100 % lethal viral encephalitis, caused by mengovirus infection, to an overall survival rate of 93 %, without obvious clinical sequelae. COAM induced a profound peritoneal influx of neutrophil granulocytes together with an activation of macrophages, which correlated with decreased viral titers in peritoneum, blood and target organs, and an annihilation of cerebral induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, COAM was able to interact with the chemokine system. Mouse granulocyte chemotactic protein- 2 (GCP- 2) /CXCL 6, a potent neutrophil attracting chemokine, was found to bind COAM. In addition, COAM also induced mouse GCP- 2 in vitro and in vivo. The antiviral effects of COAM decreased significantly in mice depleted of neutrophils and macrophages, which demonstrated that these cells co-determined the antiviral resistance induced by COAM. All together, these results established that COAM rescued mice from acute and lethal mengovirus infection by recruiting antiviral leukocytes to the site of infection, i. e. the peritoneum. These findings reinforce the role of neutrophils and macrophages as key effector cells that can be manipulated toward antiviral defense. In a last part, the concept that COAM modulates the migration of leukocytes in vivo was further explored and extended to interactions with chemokines other than GCP- 2. Chemokines are central players in coordinating directional and selective leukocyte migration into tissues. COAM induced the transcriptional program of various mouse CXC and CC chemokines in vitro and also in peritoneal leukocytes upon injection of mice with COAM. In addition, COAM was able to directly interact with chemokines through binding. In particular, efficient binding was observed for the neutrophil chemokines KC/CXCL 1 and MIP- 2 /CXCL 2, as well as the monocyte chemoattractant RANTES/CCL 5 and IP- 10 /CXCL 10, the latter being chemotactic for monocytes, activated T cells and natural killer cells. Some degree of binding specificity was detected as no binding interactions were observed for MCP- 1 /CCL 2 and MIP- 1 a/CCL 3. Binding affinities of interacting chemokines for COAM were all in the nM-range and were similar to those observed for the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate, which represents an endogenous chemokine-binding molecule responsible for sustaining chemotactic gradients across vesselwalls and into the extracellular matrix and tissues. Although COAM did not display chemotactic activity by itself, the chemokine binding feature of COAM was translated to in vivo leukocyte recruitment as COAM binding to mouse GCP- 2 promoted a fast and cooperative neutrophil chemotaxis into the peritoneal cavity of mice. These results showed that the formation of a binding complex between COAM and specific chemokines might represent the underlying mechanism of the observed effect on leukocyte migration in vivo. Binding of COAM to GCP- 2 and other chemokines might provide an endogenous chemotactic force, influencing selective and directional leukocyte chemotaxis. In conclusion, central to the mechanism of antiviral protection of the polysaccharide derivative COAM is the concept of leukocyte chemotaxis. Leukocytes, in particular neutrophils, can be tuned toward antiviral defense by this pharmacological molecule that selectively binds chemokines with high affinity. These glycosaminoglycan mimetic features establish COAM as an immunomodulator and an interesting probe with the capacity to influence chemokine gradients and selectivity of leukocyte responses in vivo. Furthermore, COAM constitutes a novel tool to investigate how cells of the myeloid lineage, in particular neutrophils, can influence the pathogenesis of viral infections and other immunopathologies. As the field of viral immunology is rapidly evolving, comprehension concerning the mode of action of antiviral immunomodulators might reveal new concepts which may stimulate future exploration of new antiviral therapeutic strategies. nrpages: 186 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the antiviral activity of sulfated polysaccharides on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) was investigated by determining the effect of dextran sulfate on the binding of CD 4 and several anti-gp 120 monoclonal antibodies to both recombinant and cell surface gp 120. Dextran sulfate did {{not interfere with the}} binding of sCD 4 to rgp 120 on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates or in solution and did not block sCD 4 binding to HIV- 1 -infected cells expressing gp 120 on the cell surface. Dextran sulfate had minimal effects on rgp 120 binding to CD 4 + cells at concentrations which effectively prevent HIV replication. In contrast, it potently inhibited the binding of both rgp 120 and cell surface gp 120 to several monoclonal antibodies directed against the principal neutralizing domain of gp 120 (V 3). In an ELISA format, dextran sulfate enhanced the binding of monoclonal antibodies against amino-terminal regions of gp 120 and had no effect on antibodies directed to other regions of gp 120, including the carboxy terminus. The inhibitory effects of <b>polyanionic</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> on viral binding, viral replication, and formation of syncytia therefore appear mediated by interactions with positively charged amino acids concentrated in the V 3 region. This high local positive charge density, unique to the V 3 loop, leads us to propose that this property is critical to the function of the V 3 region in mediating envelope binding and subsequent fusion between viral and cell membranes. The specific interaction of dextran sulfate with this domain suggests that structurally related molecules on the cell surface, such as heparan sulfate, may be additional targets for HIV binding and infection...|$|R

40|$|Hyaluronan is a <b>polyanionic,</b> megadalton-scale <b>polysaccharide,</b> which initiates cell {{signaling}} by interacting with several receptor proteins including CD 44 involved in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion. Previous {{studies of the}} CD 44 hyaluronan binding domain have identified multiple widespread residues {{to be responsible for}} its recognition capacity. In contrast, the X-ray structural characterization of CD 44 has revealed a single binding mode associated with interactions that involve just a fraction of these residues. In this study, we show through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that hyaluronan can bind CD 44 with three topographically different binding modes that in unison define an interaction fingerprint, thus providing a plausible explanation for the disagreement between the earlier studies. Our results confirm that the known crystallographic mode is the strongest of the three binding modes. The other two modes represent metastable configurations that are readily available in the initial stages of the binding, and they are also the most frequently observed modes in our unbiased simulations. We further discuss how CD 44, fostered by the weaker binding modes, diffuses along HA when attached. This 1 D diffusion combined with the constrained relative orientation of the diffusing proteins is likely to influence the aggregation kinetics of CD 44. Importantly, CD 44 aggregation has been suggested to be a possible mechanism in CD 44 -mediated signaling...|$|R
40|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) or Kala azar {{is caused}} by the parasite Leishmania donovani. VL is associated with high fever, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly and if untreated, it can be fatal Current first-line chemotherapy against VL rather depends on a limited number of drugs like pentavalent antimonial, amphotericin B, and miltefosine, but these drugs have serious problems associated with them as emerging resistance, high toxicity, serious side effects, or high costs. Inactivation of cell-mediated immune system results in parasite-specific clinical symptoms like fever, cachexia, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and blood cytopenia during VL. Immune response against microbes including, Leishmania is directed via pro-inflammatory and modulatory cytokines. Th 1 /Th 2 paradigm is shifts in favour of Leishmania, and thus parasite survival, during infection resulting in impaired microbicidal machinery of macrophages as evidenced by modification [...] IL- 12 driven increase in Th 1 cells, macrophage activation, through production of IFN-γ and generation of ROS and NO contributes to the control of L. donovani infection. Th 1 cytokine generation and production of ROS is mediated by fucoidan, so we tested its therapeutic efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo model of visceral leishmaniasis. Our data demonstrated that fucoidan could confer complete protection to both antimonysusceptible and –resistant L. donovani strains by switching the functional differentiation of Th 2 -type CD 4 + cells to Th 1 -type as well as up regulation of NO and ROS. NO and ROS generation is a protective strategy of macrophages to clear the Leishmania parasites, which survives within the hostile environment of macrophages by hindering their microbicidal mechanisms of production of ROS and NO. Numerous pathways are intimately involved in strictly regulating the macrophage effector response and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway is 80 one of the most ancient and conserved pathways, which {{plays an important role in}} generation of ROS and NO. Leishmania parasite promotes its survival within the macrophage by dysregulating PKC pathway. PKC is activated via its membrane insertion and, lipophosphoglycan (LPG), a leishmanial surface molecule is known to negatively regulate typical PKC isoforms by inhibiting their membrane insertion. Leishmania is known to increase the expression of atypical PKC isoforms (PKC-ε and ζ), while Ca 2 + dependent PKC-β expression decreases during infection. IL- 10 production is a characterstic Th 2 cytokine which increases during infection and Leishmania parasite are known to increase IL- 10 production via deactivation of PKC-β. Moreover NF-κB, a major transcription factor known to assist host immune system in clearing the parasite burden is also dysregulated by Leishmania, via modulation of PKC signaling. MAPK pathway, which is upstream to NF-κB is also known to be inhibited by Leishmania parasites for its survival with the host. Activation of MAPK signaling pathways by various stimuli induced NF-κB activation either through the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, IκB or by direct post-transcriptional modification of its p 65 subunit. Thus, Leishmania successfully evades the macrophage microbicidal machinery and thrives in, through deregulating production of NO and ROS. Establishment of an effective immune response therefore may depend on stimulation of PKC signaling as well as MAPK-mediated activation of NF-κB, which may prove a potential advancement in therapy of leishmaniasis. Previously we have already established that fucoidan can completely cure both antimony-susceptible and-resistant strains of L. donovani through NO and ROS upregulation. Shifting of Th 1 /Th 2 paradigm in favour of host was the main effect of fucoidan, which ultimately resulted in increased production of NO and ROS and clearance of parasetimia. Our present study clearly demonstrated that antileishmanial response of fucoidan was mediated via induction of iNOS and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as activation of p 38 and ERK 1 / 2 MAPK, which in turn activated NF-κB. Interestingly, further investigations illuminated the functional involvement of distinct PKC isoforms in fucoidan-mediated MAPK activation. Moreover, the present investigation provides the first in vivo evidence 81 for the fact that activation of NF-κB by fucoidan may be a prerequisite for shifting the cytokine balance toward disease-resolving Th 1 mode for complete elimination of organ parasite burden.

Many dietary compounds have assessed as potential chemopreventive agents. Fucoidan, a <b>polyanionic,</b> sulphated <b>polysaccharide</b> mainly consisting of L-fucose, is known to maintain the cell wall integrity of brown algae, and has many important biological functions including anti-angiogenic, anti-tumour, antimalarial, contraceptive and immuno-modulatory activities.

Phosphorylation of kinase plays an important role in activation of macrophages, but uncontrolled activation of anything is harmful which could be detrimental for the cell. It is necessary for the cells that both the protein kinases and phosphatases maintain their physiological balance to sustain a normal regulation of events. The present investigation was aimed towards exploring whether ROS has any effect on the kinase phosphatase balance maintained by fucoidan mediated antileishmanial effect in macrophage culture as well as in animal model of visceral leishmaniasis. Moreover, we found that ROS quencher NAC can revert the beneficial effects mediated by fucoidan as Th 1 cytokine production, activation of p 38 and ERK MAPK...|$|R
