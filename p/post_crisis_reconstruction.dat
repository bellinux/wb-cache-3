40|$|In the {{framework}} of GMES, the European initiative for Global Monitoring for Environment and Security, Europe will develop its own operational Earth Observation capacity in order to reflect the EU’s growing responsibility in European and international affairs. One of the core GMES services is the „Emergency Response Service“, which aims to support crisis management and to contribute to humanitarian aid activities. The GMES Emergency Response Service will provide contributions to disaster management by rapid mapping services, which support the damage and situation assessment. Moreover, the service will further evolve to cover crisis preparedness, prevention and early warning as well as <b>post</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>reconstruction</b> and the monitoring of post crisis developments. The paper gives an overview on the GMES Emergency Response Service and the EU project SAFER (Services and Applications for Emergency Response). ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} effect of a <b>post</b> <b>crisis</b> {{environment}} on the technical efficiencies and profitability determinants of the United States banking sector. The analysis is broken down into two stages. The first stage utilizes Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to estimate the technical efficiency scores for individual banks in the sample, while the second stage looks into the determinants of bank profitability, including the efficiency estimates from the analysis conducted in the first stage of this study. Only strictly commercial banks deemed systematically important by the United States Treasury were chosen for this study. The chosen 19 banks were analyzed over a five year period from 2009 to 2014. The analysis highlights links between bank behavior and <b>post</b> <b>crisis</b> regulation, such as drops in efficiency corresponding to higher capital requirements in result of Basel III being phased in. Profitability determinants are also analyzed and interpreted separately to uncover revenue drivers in a <b>post</b> <b>crisis</b> environment...|$|R

Monthly data {{over a period}} between January 1987 and December 2006 shows no clear evidence of stock overreaction behavior in the market.

During the <b>post</b> <b>crisis,</b> evidence of stock overreaction seems to diminish, and evidence of financial bubbles however, is observed in the period. This study believes that evidence of bubbles observed in the Malaysian stock market in the <b>post</b> <b>crisis</b> period is due to stock overreaction {{that took place in the}} market prior to the crisis...|$|R

Finally, we implemented a trading strategy using the VIMEX signal to test the quality of the signal.

For this analysis, we used monthly data for BELEXline and BELEX 15 indices {{as well as all}} stocks which these indices entailed in the period from October, 2005 to July, 2009, provided by the Belgrade Stock Exchange. Results of this paper suggest that Serbian market has low level of liquidity. Especially, the level of illiquidity for both indices increased in the <b>post</b> <b>crises</b> era in Serbia. Consequently, liquidity risk premium is decreased in the same period. Additionaly, results confirm that systematic risk which contained liquidity risk is increased even by 59 % in the <b>post</b> <b>crises</b> period in Serbia...|$|R

40|$|In the {{academic}} field of international stock market, some critics argue that, {{after having a}} global financial crisis, stock markets {{around the world will}} become more integrated. In fact, many researchers have put forward empirical works showing that the co-relation, or Granger-Causality, among different stock markets, strengthens comparatively at the <b>post</b> <b>crisis</b> period. This finding is rational; however, the explanation given for the increased co-movement after the crisis is not sufficient. The critics suggest that this increase is caused by the increase in international arbitrage activities and the higher degree of integration among markets. The Purpose {{of this paper is to}} illustrate that the two explanations given are not adequate to explain the co movement of the markets. The researcher will therefore suggest a more reasonable explanation for the stronger <b>post</b> <b>crisis</b> co-movement, which is the unusual high sensitivity of investors to the international financial news...|$|R
