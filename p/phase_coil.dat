The concept of employing a double ring winding in a VR machine is investigated. This differed from the typically used single, half-pitched, salient pole winding. As a result of combining two ring windings to produce flux linkage in one-stator tooth the flux linkage is significantly increased. The magnetomotive force of the <b>phase</b> <b>coil</b> is increased {{as the number of}} turn increased. The {{increase in the number of}} turn is accommodated in the space around the stator ring. In this way, impressive forces can be expected from modestly sized VR machine. A variable inductor device was built to simulate the electromagnetic parameters of a VR machine in both single salient pole winding and double ring winding configurations. The method employed for static magnetic characteristics measurement is based on the inductance measurement in terms of flux linkage per amps. Key-Words:- VR motor, magnetic characteristics...|$|E

Through a proper combination of the coil terminal voltages, the SCNR is shown to increase with the square root {{of the number of}} coil elements. A prototype two-element array is constructed and an experimental method is designed to determine the combiner coefficients in a simulated MRI electromagnetic field environment. The experimental results show that the mutual coupling effect among the array coils can be totally removed and the combiner output voltage increases with the number of coil elements.

40|$|Gelatin {{is used to}} make hard {{capsules}} and has to meet strict dissolution specifications {{to guarantee}} homogeneous drug delivery. The aging of gelatin induces a decrease of its dissolution rate due {{to the formation of}} intra- and intermolecular cross-links. Cross-link formation has shown to be dependent on the environmental conditions of production, such as temperature and humidity, and therefore on the geographic origin of production. Gelatin structure consists of an amorphous <b>phase</b> (<b>coil</b> structure) and a crystal phase (triple-helixes) and is very sensitive to environmental changes. The present work aims at understanding the role and effects of structural changes during aging on gelatin dissolution, taking into account the origin of production. The molecular structure of pig skin gelatins from three different production sites of the same company were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, synchrotron circular dichroism and H- 1 nuclear magnetic resonance. It turned out that aging induced the melting of triple-helixes, an increase of random coils and, probably, beta-turn conformations. The gelatin structure varied with the origin of production and thus affected the dissolution rate. Gelatins with non-compliant dissolution rates exhibited a higher amount of amorphous phase after aging than compliant gelatins. Although {{it was not possible to}} formulate any certain interpretation of the synchrotron circular dichroism results regarding gelatin dissolution, this technique is able to differentiate compliant dissolutions from non-compliant ones, even before gelatin aging...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{generation}} of energy enables {{commercial and industrial}} facilities to minimize production costs, increase profits, and stay competitive. Most of electrical energy consumed in industrial facilities is received from electrical generators. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} perform research in order to develop advanced electric generators with less cost and high efficiency. There has been a recent interest in flux switching generators (FSG) in which all the flux sources are positioned in the stator that make the rotor simple, robust and brushless. Hence, this project presents an operating principle of a new proposed outer-rotor hybrid excitation flux switching generator. In this Generator a combination of a permanent magnet (PM) and field excitation coil (FEC) are used as the main flux sources. Additional FEC can be used to control the flux so that constant voltage can be produced at various wind conditions. Moreover, twelve coil tests, Three <b>Phase</b> <b>coil</b> test flux excited by PM only, Back-EMF at various speed and stack-length conditions, magnetic flux strengthening at various current densities and flux distribution are investigated by using JMAG software. The result shows that the generated voltage is directly proportional with the change of speed and stack-length {{and the size of the}} improved stack-length design has incremented 7. 4 times of the initial design. Moreover, another technique of improving induced B-EMF was proposed which is deterministic optimization method (DOM). The parameters of the design are optimized one at a time starting from the rotor dimensions followed by the stator parts such as PM, FEC and AC and the improved design indicated a higher output voltage...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} a polymer growth process on the triangular lattice where the configurations produced are self-avoiding trails. We {{show that the}} scaling behaviour {{of this process is}} similar to the analogous process on the square lattice. However, while the square lattice process maps to the collapse transition of the canonical interacting self-avoiding trail model (ISAT) on that lattice, the process on the triangular lattice model does not map to the canonical equilibrium model. On the other hand, we show that the collapse transition of the canonical ISAT model on the triangular lattice behaves in a way reminiscent of the θ-point of the interacting self-avoiding walk model (ISAW), which is the standard model of polymer collapse. This implies an unusual lattice dependency of the ISAT collapse transition in two dimensions. By studying an extended ISAT model, we demonstrate that the growth process maps to a multi-critical point in a larger parameter space. In this extended parameter space the collapse phase transition may be either θ-point-like (second-order) or first-order, and these two are separated by a multi-critical point. It is this multi-critical point to which the growth process maps. Furthermore, we provide evidence that in addition to the high-temperature gas-like swollen polymer <b>phase</b> (<b>coil)</b> and the low-temperature liquid drop-like collapse phase (globule) there is also a maximally dense crystal-like phase (crystal) at low temperatures dependent on the parameter values. The multi-critical point is the meeting point of these three phases. Our hypothesised phase diagram resolves the mystery of the seemingly differing behaviours of the ISAW and ISAT models in two dimensions as well as the behaviour of the trail growth process...|$|E

40|$|Pig skins gelatin {{results of}} the {{collagen}} solubilization. Gelatin is used, amongst other applications, in the pharmaceutical industry to make hard capsules. Raw gelatin, on delivery, contains about 8 - 12 % of water [1] and is a partially-crystalline polymer being composed of an amorphous <b>phase</b> (<b>coil</b> structure with primary chains) and a crystal phase [2]. The latter consists of partially reformed triple-helices of collagen. The shelf life of hard capsules is evaluated through gelatin USP dissolution test after aging under high temperature and high humidity conditions. After aging, the dissolution rate of gelatin is variable: either unchanged or reduced. The decrease of gelatin dissolution rate is partially due to intra- and intermolecular crosslinks formation in the amorphous phase which stabilize that structure [3]. Water in gelatin plays a role of plasticizer in the amorphous phase and is either free or bound to the polymer chains. The state of water in gelatin has been studied but no relation with aging or dissolution rate has been established. The aim {{of the present study}} was to understand how aging affects the gelatin structure and its water mobility, and in addition, to identify structural differences according to gelatin dissolution rate. Thus, sixty pig skin gelatins with correct and non-correct dissolution rate were analyzed using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR) spectroscopy was used on a subgroup of twelve gelatin films to measure the spin-spin relaxation time (T 2). For both methods, samples were taken before and after aging. Aging decreased the amount and the stability to heating of crystals phase and increased the amorphous phase. The water mobility was increased which can be explained by the denaturation of crystals releasing the trapped water from the triple-helices [4]. After aging, the gelatins which failed the dissolution test showed a higher amount of amorphous phase but the water mobility was not modified. These results showed that the structure plays a major role in the gelatin dissolution rate. In order to support this major role of structural characteristics of gelatin, the conformation of the single chains and multiple helices will be assessed using circular dichroism...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands for}} improving {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) quality, especially reducing the imaging time have been driving the channel number of parallel magnetic resonance imaging (Parallel MRI) to increase. When the channel number increases to 64 or even 128, the traditional method of stacking {{the same number of}} radio-frequency (RF) receivers with very low level of integration becomes expensive and cumbersome. However, the cost, size, power consumption of the Parallel MRI receivers can be dramatically reduced by designing a whole receiver front-end even multiple receiver front-ends on a single chip using CMOS technology, and multiplexing the output signal of each receiver front-end into one channel so that as much hardware resource can be shared by as many channels as possible, especially the digitizer. The main object of this research is focused on the analysis and design of fully integrated multi-channel RF receiver and multiplexing technology. First, different architectures of RF receiver and different multiplexing method are analyzed. After comparing the advantages and the disadvantages of these architectures, an architecture of receiver front-end which is most suitable for fully on-chip multi-channel design is proposed and a multiplexing method is selected. According to this proposed architecture, a four-channel receiver front-end was designed and fabricated using TSMC 0. 18 ?m technology on a single chip and methods of testing in the MRI system using parallel planar coil array and <b>phase</b> <b>coil</b> array respectively as target coils were presented. Each channel of the receiver front-end includes an ultra low noise amplifier (LNA), a quadrature image rejection down-converter, a buffer, and a low-pass filter (LPF) which also acts as a variable gain amplifier (VGA). The quadrature image rejection downconverter consists of a quadrature generator, a passive mixer with a transimpedance amplifier which converts the output current signal of the passive mixer into voltage signal while acts as a LPF, and a polyphase filter after the TIA. The receiver has an over NF of 0. 935 dB, variable gain from about 80 dB to 90 dB, power consumption of 30. 8 mW, and chip area of 6 mm 2. Next, a prototype of 4 -channel RF receiver with Time Domain Multiplexing (TDM) on a single printed circuit board (PCB) was designed and bench-tested. Then Parallel MRI experiment was carried out and images were acquired using this prototype. The testing results verify the proposed concepts...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The switched reluctance motor (SRM) has become an attractive alternative candidate to conventional ae or dc motors for adjustable speed drive applications. The SRM drive system consists of a power converter and a control section. Making the control section circuits of an SRM drive integratable will make a large contribution to the SRM's acceptability by relieving design and application engineers of the burden of designing controls. Ile objective of this research is to develop an integrated control circuit for an SRM, implementing closed-loop speed control and providing start torque. The target application for this IC version of an SRM drive is an automotive fuel pump running off a 12 V power supply with a power rating of 50 -IOOW. This thesis presents a breadboard level SRM drive that emirates a custom IC controller implementing closedloop speed control and starting torque. The rotor position sensing information is essential for determining the switching instants to have proper control of speed and torque. A new robust rotor position encoding circuit that, based on the AM encoder technique, uses a new concept to encode the rotor position as a dc signal has been developed during this research and is presented in this thesis. In this circuit, a dc supply voltage is in series with an SRM <b>phase</b> <b>coil</b> and a resistor. The rotor position information is extracted from the voltage across the resistor. This new structure enables the encoder circuit to be merged with the power converter. Only one common ground is needed in the whole systerm This makes the control circuit integratable and also acceptable in automobile applications. In this thesis, a new simple method that gives starting torque to the SRM is presented. Since the SRM drive operates relative to the rotor position, by moving the rotor poles at standstill to an aligned position with a known phase, the SRM can be operated normally by switching on and off the phase current in synchronism with the rotor position. This thesis also presents a new simple senseless closed-loop speed control method. The SRM phase energizing time has a unique relationship with the rotor speed. By monitoring this time, the controller is able to calculate the actual motor speed and then compare it with the reference speed. If the speed error exceeds the allowed range, the controller will change the PAM duty cycle to meet the load requirement until the speed is close to the reference.

Warp plasma is highly unstable and can be easily detonated. Until recently, it was considered an undeliverable medium that could not be controlled. However, using a nanite-controlled trigger for reactant release now allows vessels to deliver a high-energy plasma warhead payload within a Mark IV torpedo casing.|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) signals by multiple receiver coils can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or alternatively can reduce the scan time maintaining a reliable SNR. However, using <b>phased</b> array <b>coils</b> in MRS studies requires efficient data processing and data combination techniques in order to exploit the sensitivity improvement of the <b>phased</b> array <b>coil</b> acquisition method. This paper describes a novel method for the combination of MRS signals acquired by <b>phased</b> array <b>coils,</b> even in presence of correlated noise between the acquisition channels. In fact, {{although it has been}} shown that electric and magnetic coupling mechanisms produce correlated noise in the coils, previous algorithms developed for MRS data combination have ignored this effect. The proposed approach takes advantage of a noise decorrelation stage to maximize the SNR of the combined spectra. In particular Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was exploited to project the acquired spectra in a subspace where the noise vectors are orthogonal. In this subspace the SNR weighting method will provide the optimal overall SNR. Performance evaluation of the proposed method is carried out on simulated 1 H-MRS signals and experimental results are obtained on phantom 1 H-MR spectra using a commercially available 8 -element <b>phased</b> array <b>coil.</b> Noise correlations between elements were generally low due to the optimal coil design, leading to a fair SNR gain (about 0. 5 %) in the center of the field of view (FOV).

Phased arrays are very useful as receiver coils and have been used over the last 15 years or so to improve receiver coil coverage and to speed up image acquisition. These arrays have almost invariably been constructed and used at mid- to highfrequency (< 128 MHz), thus there is clearly an opportunity to increase the operating frequency of the phased array and also use these systems in transceive mode. Using <b>phased</b> array <b>coils</b> in transceive mode {{has the advantage of}} gaining better spatial specificity of excited regions. Also as the operating wavelength in high field strength is shortened by the dielectric properties of the patient and approaches the size of conventional transmitter coils, there are distinct advantages in using the smaller <b>coils</b> in the <b>phased</b> array system for transmission. In addition, with the ability to independently control the magnitudes and phases of the transmission power on each element of a transceiver phased array system, RF focussing or shimming can be performed during RF transmission. The research work presented in this thesis is therefore, primarily focussed on designing and analysing high frequency <b>phased</b> array <b>coils</b> for MRI applications with transceive and RF focussing capability and investigating the possibility of using focussing transceive <b>phased</b> array <b>coils</b> to ameliorate image distortions that appear in high field MR images.

In {{grinding}} viscous materials, such as stainless steel, {{aluminum and}} many polymeric materials, {{the application of}} a dither on the workpieces proves to be an effective way to enhance the quality of surface finish. A linear stepper motor is utilized for this purpose. By means of the PWM control to the adjacent <b>phase</b> <b>coils,</b> the linear stepper can drive the sliding table to make reciprocating motion and also to produce a desired dither signal, while the grinding is undertaken to the attached workpiece. In this paper, a linear stepper motor is introduced to drive the sliding table and a modulated control strategy is used to control the linear stepper continuously, which also generates an additional dither on the sliding table and the attached workpiece. The dither amplitude can be adjusted by means of the modulated frequency. Experiments are designed to measure the practical dither signals and to verify the effectiveness of improving surface finish quality using a dither. It is demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental results that by means of proposed table drive, a rather wide band of dither signal can be acquired and can meet the most demand of viscous material grinding...|$|R
40|$|Sustained {{mitigation}} and/or {{suppression of}} type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) {{has been achieved}} in EAST high-confinement plasmas, utilizing the resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) fields produced by two rows of magnetic coils located just inside the vacuum vessel. Systematic toroidal modelling of the plasma response to these RMP fields with various coil configurations (with dominant toroidal mode number n = 1, 2, 3, 4) in EAST is, for the first time, carried out by using the MARS-F code (Liu et al 2000 Phys. Plasmas 7 3681), with results reported here. In particular, the plasma response is computed with varying <b>coil</b> <b>phasing</b> (the toroidal phase difference of the coil currents) between {{the upper and lower}} rows of coils, from 0 to 360 °. Four figures of merit, constructed based on the MARS-F computations, are used to determine the optimal <b>coil</b> <b>phasing.</b> The modelled results, taking into account the plasma response, agree well with the experimental observations in terms of the <b>coil</b> <b>phasing</b> for both the mitigated and the suppressed ELM cases in EAST experiments. This study provides a crucial confirmation {{of the role of the}} plasma edge peeling response in ELM control, complementing similar studies carried out for other tokamak devices...|$|R
40|$|Endoluminal MRI of the rectum and anus was {{introduced}} {{in the first half of}} this decade to overcome the limitations of endoluminal sonography and body coil MRI. Endoluminal MRI is the imaging method of choice for fecal incontinence and anal tumors, whereas it is a competitive imaging method to <b>phased</b> array <b>coil</b> MRI in patients with perianal fistulas or rectal tumor. The purpose of this article is to describe the technique and major indications of endoluminal MR imaging of the anus and rectu...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe helix-to-coil {{denaturation}} {{transition in}} DNA {{has been investigated}} in mixed solvents at high concentration using ultraviolet light absorption spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Two solvents have been used: water and ethylene glycol. The “melting” transition temperature {{was found to be}} 94 °C for 4 % mass fraction DNA/d-water and 38 °C for 4 % mass fraction DNA/d-ethylene glycol. The DNA melting transition temperature was found to vary linearly with the solvent fraction in the mixed solvents case. Deuterated solvents (d-water and d-ethylene glycol) were used to enhance the small-angle neutron scattering signal and 0. 1 M NaCl (or 0. 0058 g/g mass fraction) salt concentration was added to screen charge interactions in all cases. DNA structural information was obtained by small-angle neutron scattering, including a correlation length characteristic of the inter-distance between the hydrogen-containing (desoxyribose sugar-amine base) groups. This correlation length was found to increase from 8. 5 to 12. 3 Å across the melting transition. Ethylene glycol and water mixed solvents were found to mix randomly in the solvation region in the helix phase, but nonideal solvent mixing was found in the melted <b>coil</b> <b>phase.</b> In the <b>coil</b> <b>phase,</b> solvent mixtures are more effective solvating agents than either of the individual solvents. Once melted, DNA coils behave like swollen water-soluble synthetic polymer chains...|$|R

We used a 3. 0 Tesla device, dedicated <b>phased</b> array <b>coil</b> and time resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) sequences to visualize the feeder vessels in patients with vascular malformations. TRICKS is a method of 3 D CE-MRA providing temporal information. Thanks to its high temporal and spatial resolution and high signal/noise ratio the TRICKS optimized sequence at 3. 0 T yielded very encouraging results in disclosing the origin of arteriovenous malformation...|$|R
