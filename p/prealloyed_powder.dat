Densification by supersolidus liquid phase sintering is sensitive to time-temperatures. A major difficulty arises when a narrow temperature range exists between densification and distortion.

40|$|The {{effects of}} warm {{compaction}} {{on the green}} density and sintering behaviour of aluminium alloys were investigated. Particular {{attention is paid to}} <b>prealloyed</b> <b>powders,</b> i. e. eutectic and hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, regarding their potential applications in the automotive industry. The effects of chemical composition, alloying method, compacting temperature and the amount of powder lubricant were studied. The compaction behaviour was examined by an instrumented die enabling simultaneous measurement of density, die wall friction coefficient, the triaxial stresses acting on the powder during the course of compaction and ejection pressure. The sintering behiiviour was studied via dilatometeric analysis as. well as normal batch sintering. The results show that warm compaction could be a promising way to increase the green density of aluminium alloys, especially <b>prealloyed</b> <b>powders,</b> and to decrease dimensional instability during sintering. Moreover, it reduces the sliding friction coefficient and the ejection force during the powder shaping process.

40|$|A {{phase change}} from {{alpha-alumina}} (corundum) in the feedstock powder to predominantly other alumina phases, such as gamma-alumina in the coating normally takes place, {{as a result}} of the spray process. It is expected that the prevention of this phase transformation will significantly improve the mechanical, electrical, and other properties of thermally sprayed alumina coatings. The results regarding the possibility of stabilization of a-alumina through addition of chromia published in the literature are ambiguous. In this work, stabilization using different spray processes (water-stabilized plasma (WSP), gas-stabilized plasma (APS), and high-velocity oxy-fuel spray (HVOF)) was studied. Mechanical mixtures of alumina and chromia were used, as were <b>prealloyed</b> <b>powders</b> consisting of solid solutions. The investigations focused on mechanical mixtures with both APS and WSP and on <b>prealloyed</b> <b>powders</b> with WSP. The coatings were studied by x-ray diffraction, including Rietveld analysis, and analysis of the lattice parameters. Microstructures were investigated by optical microscopy using metallographic cross-sections. It was shown that in the case of the mechanically mixed powders, the stabilization predominantly depends on the applied spray process. The stabilization of the a phase by use of the WSP process starting from mechanical mixtures was confirmed. It appears that stabilization exhibits a complex dependence on the spray process, the process parameters (in particular the thermal history), the nature of the powder (mechanically mixed or prealloyed), and the chromia content...|$|R

An initial {{analysis of the}} <b>prealloyed</b> <b>powder</b> helped on {{the understanding of the}} intermetallic sintering behavior. Atomized powder consisted of alfa metastable phase that transformed into alfa 2 +gamma equilibrium phases by thermal treating. Different powder particle microstructures were found, which influence the microstructure development of the FAHP gamma-TiAl material depending on the sintering temperature. Duplex, nearly lamellar and fully lamellar microstructures were obtained at the sintering temperatures above 1000 °C. Lower consolidation temperatures, below 1000 °C, {{led to the formation of}} an Al rich phase at powder particle boundaries, which is deleterious to the mechanical properties. High compressive yield strength of 1050 MPa was observed in samples with FAHP duplex microstructures at room temperature. Whereas nearly lamellar and fully lamellar microstructures showed yield strength values of 655 and 626 MPa at room temperature and 440 and 425 MPa at 750 °C, respectively, which are superior in comparison to similar alloys processed by other techniques. These excellent properties can be explained due to the different volume fractions of the alfa 2 and gamma phases and the refinement of the PM microstructures.
