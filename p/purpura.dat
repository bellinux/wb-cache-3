5|$|Henoch–Schönlein <b>purpura</b> (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid <b>purpura,</b> <b>purpura</b> rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch <b>purpura,</b> is a disease of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable <b>purpura</b> (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein <b>purpura.</b> The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the <b>purpura,</b> such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> and thrombotic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} named after Eduard Heinrich Henoch (1820–1910), a German {{pediatrician}} (nephew of Moritz Heinrich Romberg) and his teacher Johann Lukas Schönlein (1793–1864), who described it in the 1860s. Schönlein associated the <b>purpura</b> and arthritis, and Henoch the <b>purpura</b> and gastrointestinal involvement. The English physician William Heberden (1710–1801) and the dermatologist Robert Willan (1757–1812) had already described the disease in 1802 and 1808, respectively, but the name Heberden–Willan disease has fallen into disuse. William Osler {{was the first to}} recognise the underlying allergic mechanism of HSP.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{suffers from}} {{idiopathic}} thrombocytopenic <b>purpura.</b> He was first {{diagnosed with the}} recurring rare blood disorder in 2009. Since then, he has been taking regular medications.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{standards}} {{exist for}} defining Henoch–Schönlein <b>purpura,</b> including the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification and the 1994 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC). Some have reported the ACR criteria {{to be more}} sensitive than those of the CHCC.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the <b>purpura</b> from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
5|$|More recent classifications, the 2006 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and Pediatric Rheumatology Society (PReS) classification, include palpable <b>purpura</b> as a {{mandatory}} criterion, together {{with at least}} one of the following findings: diffuse abdominal pain, predominant IgA deposition (confirmed on skin biopsy), acute arthritis in any joint, and renal involvement (as evidenced by the presence of blood and/or protein in the urine).|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable <b>purpura,</b> abdominal angina, digestive tract hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E
5|$|Protein C {{deficiency}} {{may cause}} <b>purpura</b> fulminans, a severe clotting disorder in the newborn {{that leads to}} both tissue death and bleeding into the skin and other organs. The condition has also been described in adults. Protein C and protein S deficiency have also been {{associated with an increased}} risk of skin necrosis on commencing anticoagulant treatment with warfarin or related drugs.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein <b>purpura</b> is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, <b>purpura</b> fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
25|$|Hemorrhagic {{complications}} {{are more}} common in the immunocompromised or immunosuppressed populations, although healthy children and adults have been affected. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile <b>purpura,</b> malignant chickenpox with <b>purpura,</b> postinfectious <b>purpura,</b> <b>purpura</b> fulminans, and anaphylactoid <b>purpura.</b> These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile <b>purpura</b> being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with <b>purpura</b> is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{instances}} of a purpura-like rash {{are due to}} meningococcal septicaemia; other possible causes, such as Idiopathic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> (ITP; a platelet disorder) and Henoch–Schönlein <b>purpura,</b> also need prompt investigation.|$|E
25|$|CD36 {{deficiency}} {{may be a}} {{cause of}} post transfusion <b>purpura.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{second annual}} Reyes del Aire tournament {{took place on}} Sunday June 18, 2006 on CMLL's weekly Arena Mexico show. The tournament format was a torneo cibernetico, multi-man {{elimination}} match with ten participants. The tournament primarily featured younger, lower ranked wrestlers including Danger, Leono, Loco Max, Máscara <b>Purpura,</b> La Mascara, Neutron, Oro II, Tony Rivera, Stuka Jr. and Valiente. During the match Stuka Jr. and Máscara <b>Purpura</b> were eliminated at the same time, counted {{out of the ring}} after a dive from Máscara <b>Purpura</b> went wrong. It was never revealed if this was a true accident or part of the plan laid out for the match. In the end La Mascara pinned Neutron to win the match in 18:09.|$|E
25|$|Other {{diseases}} featuring necrotizing vasculitis include polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Henoch–Schönlein <b>purpura</b> and {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (EGPA).|$|E
25|$|Vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive {{antibodies}} in the patient, {{leading to}} severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding with florid petechial hemorrhages, ecchymoses, and wet <b>purpura.</b>|$|E
25|$|Post-transfusion <b>purpura</b> is a {{complication}} {{that occurs}} after transfusion of platelets and {{is associated with}} the presence of antibodies in the patient's blood directed against both the donor's and recipient's platelets HPA (human platelet antigen). Recipients who lack this protein develop sensitization to this protein from prior transfusions or previous pregnancies, can develop thrombocytopenia, bleeding into the skin,and causes purplish discolouration of skin which is known as <b>purpura.</b> Intravenous immunoglobulin is the treatment of choice to neutralise such antibodies.|$|E
25|$|On August 27, manager Phil Garner and General Manager Tim <b>Purpura</b> were {{relieved}} of their duties. Cecil Cooper and Tal Smith were named as interim replacements, respectively.|$|E
25|$|A contusion, {{commonly}} known as a bruise, {{is a type of}} hematoma of tissue in which capillaries and sometimes venules are damaged by trauma, allowing blood to seep, hemorrhage, or extravasate into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Bruises, which do not blanch under pressure, can involve capillaries at the level of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone. Bruises are {{not to be confused with}} other similar-looking lesions primarily distinguished by their diameter or causation. These lesions include petechia (< 3nbsp&mm result from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus), <b>purpura</b> (3nbsp&mm to 1nbsp&cm, classified as palpable <b>purpura</b> or non-palpable <b>purpura</b> and indicates various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia), and ecchymosis (>1nbsp&cm caused by blood dissecting through tissue planes and settled in an area remote from the site of trauma or pathology such as periorbital ecchymosis, e.g.,"raccoon eyes", arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma).|$|E
25|$|The senior William Heberden first {{described}} {{the disease in}} 1801 in a 5-year-old child with abdominal pain, hematuria, hematochezia, and <b>purpura</b> of the legs. In 1837, Johann Lukas Schönlein described a syndrome of <b>purpura</b> associated with joint pain and urinary precipitates in children. Eduard Heinrich Henoch, a student of Schönlein's, further associated abdominal pain and renal involvement with the syndrome. In 1968, Jean Berger (1930–2011), a pioneering French nephrologist, with co-author, the electron microscopist Nicole Hinglais, {{was the first to}} describe IgA deposition in this form of glomerulonephritis and therefore it is sometimes called Berger’s disease.|$|E
25|$|In the Harrington–Hollingsworth {{experiment}} in 1950, William J. Harrington performed an exchange blood transfusion {{between himself and}} a thrombocytopenic patient, discovering the immune basis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> and providing evidence {{for the existence of}} autoimmunity.|$|E
25|$|Non-infectious {{diseases}} {{that may result}} in symptoms {{similar to those of}} EVD include acute promyelocytic leukemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, snake envenomation, clotting factor deficiencies/platelet disorders, thrombotic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura,</b> hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Kawasaki disease, and warfarin poisoning.|$|E
25|$|On 26 September 2013, La <b>Purpura</b> de la rosa {{received}} its Israeli premiere at the Abu Gosh Festival performed by Ensemble PHOENIX on period instruments and its vocal branch VOCE PHOENIX, conducted from the {{viola da gamba}} by Myrna Herzog, with staging by Regina Alexandrovskaya.|$|E
25|$|Some {{strains of}} C jejuni produce a cholera-like enterotoxin, which is {{important}} in the watery diarrhea observed in infections. The organism produces diffuse, bloody, edematous, and exudative enteritis. In a small number of cases, the infection may be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> through a poorly understood mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} feature that {{suggests}} a possible underlying adrenal insufficiency is low blood pressure despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids, requiring vasopressor drugs. These patients typically display tachycardia and {{other signs of}} hyperdynamic shock. Other symptoms include fever, <b>purpura</b> fulminans, and gastrointestinal or neurological disturbances. All these features are relatively non-specific in intensive care patients.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, nausea, easy bruising, itching, and heartburn. More severe side effects include {{bleeding}} and thrombotic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura.</b> While {{there is no}} evidence of harm from use during pregnancy, such use has been poorly studied. Clopidogrel is in the thienopyridine-class of antiplatelet agent. It works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12, on platelets.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone is used {{to treat}} many {{inflammatory}} and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura,</b> a decrease in numbers of platelets due to an immune problem, responds to 40mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. It is unclear whether dexamethasone in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids.|$|E
25|$|Henoch–Schönlein <b>purpura</b> (HSP) is a {{systemic}} disorder caused by deposits of IgA and complement component 3 (C3) {{in the small}} vessels. HSP occurs usually in small children and involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. It usually follows an upper respiratory infection and resolves within a couple weeks as the liver clears out the IgA aggregates.|$|E
25|$|In {{thrombotic}} thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or {{has been}} inhibited by antibodies {{directed at the}} enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of vWF and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with deposition of fibrin and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ most obviously affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytopenia {{usually has}} no {{symptoms}} and {{is picked up}} on a routine full blood count (or complete blood count). Some individuals with thrombocytopenia may experience external bleeding such as nosebleeds, and/or bleeding gums. Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. Bruising, particularly <b>purpura</b> in the forearms and petechiae in the feet, legs, and mucous membranes, {{may be caused by}} spontaneous bleeding under the skin.|$|E
25|$|ANAs {{are found}} in many {{disorders}}, {{as well as some}} healthy individuals. These disorders include: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, discoid lupus, thyroid disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, idiopathic thrombocytopaenic <b>purpura,</b> infection and cancer. These antibodies can be subdivided according to their specificity, and each subset has different propensities for specific disorders.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{acquired}} measles often {{occurs with}} idiopathic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> (ITP, a purpuric rash {{and an increased}} tendency to bleed that resolves within two months in children). Between 1 in 25,000 and 1 in 40,000 children are thought to acquire ITP in the six weeks following an MMR vaccination, which is {{a higher rate than}} found in unvaccinated populations. ITP below the age of 6 years is generally a mild disease, rarely having long-term consequences.|$|E
25|$|Signs {{include the}} {{spontaneous}} formation of bruises (<b>purpura)</b> and petechiae (tiny bruises), {{especially on the}} extremities, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, and menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per μl. A very low count (<10,000 per μl) may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.|$|E
25|$|HUS {{is one of}} the {{thrombotic}} microangiopathies, {{a category}} of disorders that includes STEC-HUS, aHUS, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> (TTP). STEC-HUS is usually preceded by a prodrome of diarrhea, which is often bloody, and is caused by Shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), of which E. coli O157:H7 is the most common serotype. Other serotypes also cause disease and can emerge as new causes of STEC-HUS, as occurred with E. coli O104:H4, which triggered a 2011 epidemic of STEC-HUS in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Immune {{thrombocytopenia}} (ITP) {{is a type}} of thrombocytopenic <b>purpura</b> {{defined as}} isolated low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) with normal bone marrow and the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia. It causes a characteristic purpuric rash and an increased tendency to bleed. Two distinct clinical syndromes manifest as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and has a spontaneous resolution within two months. Chronic immune thrombocytopenia persists longer than six months with a specific cause being unknown.|$|E
