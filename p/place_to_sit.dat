25|$|In {{front of}} the church complex is the Plaza Allende, popularly known as Jardin Principal or Main Garden, but most often {{referred}} to simply as el jardin. It was designed in French style, with wrought iron benches and filled with laurel trees. It is a popular <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and relax and bands often play in the kiosk on weekends. In addition to the parish, other important structures, such as the Ignacio Allende House, the Canal House and the municipal palace overlook the garden.|$|E
25|$|Apremont Triangle Park is a triangular, pocket park {{in front}} of Springfield's {{historic}} Kimball Towers in Metro Center. Named for Springfield's 104th Infantry Regiment, which following the World War I Battle of Apremont, became the first U.S. military unit awarded for heroism by a foreign power, receiving France's highest military honor: the croix de guerre for bravery in combat. The same Springfield unit received the same honor again in World War II. Apremont Triangle Park, steps from both the bohemian Kimball Towers and upper-class Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District offers a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> amidst the restaurants on the northern fringe of the Club Quarter.|$|E
25|$|Olmsted also {{designed}} the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits {{just north of}} the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.|$|E

25|$|Carpets {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} insulating a person's feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), reducing sound from walking (particularly in apartment buildings) and adding decoration or colour to a room. Carpets can be made in any colour by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. In the 2000s, carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes. In the 2010s, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs which are used in private homes of wealthy families.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{aspects of}} the {{missions}} were the long arcades (corridors) which flanked all interior and many exterior walls. The arches were Roman (half-round), while the pillars were usually square and made of baked brick, rather than adobe. The overhang created by the arcade had a dual function: it provided a comfortable, shady <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> after a hard-day's work, and (more importantly) it kept rainfall away from the adobe walls. The mainstay of any mission complex was its capilla (chapel). The design of chapels overall followed that of Christian churches in Europe, but tended to be comparatively long and narrow due {{to the size of}} lumber available along the California coast. Each church had a main section (the nave), a baptistry near the front entrance, a sanctuary (where the altar was located), and a sacristy {{at the back of the}} church where materials used to celebrate Mass were stored and where the priests vested. In most churches, a stairway near the main entrance led up to a choir loft.|$|E
500|$|The main {{building}} {{was designed by}} Harry Weedon, the architect for Odeon Cinemas, while the layout and general buildings were designed by coordinating architect Owen Williams. The {{main building}} was not ready on opening, so food was served from temporary sheds. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but due to the site's reputation as a truck stop, was redesigned in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service. The services became a meeting place for rock bands in the 1960s, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix, as it provided a convenient <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> down and eat a meal {{in the early hours}} of the morning. In the 1970s, the quality of the services declined and the food came in for harsh criticism from journalists and artists, such as Roy Harper. [...] Since purchase in 1995, Roadchef have refurbished the premises. They have promoted its history, including the association with a north / south divide, and its regular use by 1960s rock musicians. A number of events took place to celebrate the 50th anniversary in November 2009, including a musical about the services.|$|E

[...] The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people.

Although the men had traditional beards and the women headscarves, AirTran denied that their actions were based on the passengers' appearance. The following day, after the incident received widespread media coverage, AirTran reversed its position and issued a public apology, adding that it would in fact reimburse the passengers for the cost of their rebooked tickets.|$|E

Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much to the delight of the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit.</b> During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) was the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of jurors of American Idol, since that several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled.|$|E
