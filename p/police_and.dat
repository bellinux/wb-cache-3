5|$|On 17 June 1936, all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united under {{the purview of}} Himmler and the SS. Himmler and Heydrich thus became {{two of the most}} powerful men in the country's administration. <b>Police</b> <b>and</b> intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; criminal investigative <b>police),</b> <b>and</b> Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security <b>police)</b> <b>and</b> SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.|$|E
