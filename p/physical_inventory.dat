The app is intended for handheld computers and enables an effective inventory of the products. Many companies still conduct <b>physical</b> <b>inventories,</b> even though this method has long become redundant thanks to today’s technology and can be partially or completely replaced with electronic <b>inventory</b> systems. Unlike <b>physical</b> <b>inventories,</b> electronic inventories are simple, reliable, and quicker. The mobile application has been developed using the Microsoft Visual Studio software tool and is intended for the operating system Windows Mobile. It enables the storage of information acquired through inventories conducted by multiple employees {{at the same time}} and on the same or different locations. The app stores information in MySQL database, on LAN or Web server. The thesis also focuses on requirements for the making of the application and on its development, as well as it demonstrates its usage...|$|R
40|$|Comments welcome Commodity futures risk {{premiums}} vary across commodities {{and over time}} depending {{on the level of}} <b>physical</b> <b>inventories,</b> as predicted by the Theory of Storage. Using a comprehensive dataset on 31 commodity futures and <b>physical</b> <b>inventories</b> between 1969 and 2006, we show that the convenience yield is a decreasing, non-linear relationship of inventories. Price measures, such as the futures basis (“backwardation”), prior futures returns, and prior spot returns reflect the state of inventories and are informative about commodity futures {{risk premiums}}. The excess returns to Spot and Futures Momentum and Backwardation strategies stem in part from the selection of commodities when inventories are low. Positions of futures markets participants are correlated with prices and inventory signals, but we reject the Keynesian “hedging pressure ” hypothesis that these positions are an important determinant of risk premiums...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} role that spot markets and <b>physical</b> <b>inventories</b> play in {{revealing}} the expectations of informed traders to uninformed traders. Using a rational expectations approach, we show that equilibrium differences in beliefs are determined by characteristics of the underlying commodity, including storage costs, the amplitude of demand and supply shocks, the accuracy of information available to informed investors, the numbers of informed and uninformed traders, and the elasticity of demand and supply. We also show that passive investors impede the revelation of information in the spot market, which magnifies the equilibrium difference in beliefs. Because the incentive for speculative trading in futures contracts stems directly from the failure of spot markets to eliminate differences in beliefs, our results provide insight into why and how the amount of speculative futures trading varies across commodities, {{as well as through}} time...|$|R
40|$|Building an {{accurate}} inventory of computing assets in an unknown system and networking environment is a challenging task. Accounting records, <b>physical</b> <b>inventories,</b> computing service configurations, traffic monitors, network and applications server logs all represent valid sources of information. Their integration into a consistent {{model of the}} reality is a desirable goal, e. g. as basis for building commercial Information Technology (IT) Inventory systems, or as background information for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). During this project, we will study the optimal integration of relevant information sources, aiming to generate an enhanced inventory of deployed computing assets categorized according to their usage. In particular, we will investigate the use of log information from HTTP and SMTP/POP servers, Socks/Proxy gateways, and network monitors, and then define a knowledge discovery in database (KDD) process to prepare data for subsequent data-mining tasks aiming to generate an enhanced inventory of the deployed computing asset...|$|R

50|$|Though {{back-office}} software reduces {{the likelihood of}} inventory record inaccuracies, they can still occur if items are not properly tracked as they enter/exit the retail space.

The application of Bayesian principles to inventories can avoid instances of inventory freezing (when <b>physical</b> <b>inventory</b> levels reach zero but records indicate otherwise).|$|E

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Environmental Management, has {{approved}} {{the disposition of}} 31 metric tons of Unirradiated Light Water Breeder Reactor (ULWBR) material in canisters stored within dry wells of the Underground Fuel Storage Facility at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). This unirradiated material consists primarily of ceramic pellets of thorium oxide in stainless steel cladding, but it also contains 300 kilograms of uranium that is 98 wt% U- 233. The ULWBR material was not processed at the INTEC because it was incompatible with prior chemical separation schemes. Other economical recovery options have not been identified, and expressions of interest for consolidating the material with existing projects at other DOE sites have not been received. The U- 233 {{could be used for}} producing the medical isotope Actinium- 225, but the proof-of-principle demonstration and follow-on pilot program have not been developed to the point of requiring production quantities of U- 233. Consequently, the selected disposition of the ULWBR material was burial as Low Level Waste at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), which required terminating safeguards controls for the contained Category II quantity of Attractiveness Level D special nuclear material (SNM). The requested termination followed the twelve point evaluation criteria of the Historical Defense Program Discard Guidance and included a security analysis for evaluating the risks of theft, diversion, and radiological sabotage associated with the material. Continuity of knowledge in the book inventory was assured by documenting that the original shipper’s measurements accurately reflected the quantities of materials received and that the ULWBR materials had remained under adequate physical protection and had been subject to periodic <b>physical</b> <b>inventories.</b> The method selected for substantiating the book values as the basis for terminating safeguards was the nondestructive assay used during <b>physical</b> <b>inventories.</b> Shipping arrangements included refurbishing a licensed cask to be reused over the duration of the termination process. An accompanying batching plan and shipping schedule were developed to accommodate multiple commercial shipments of Category III quantities of SNM in the selected cask, such that all canisters would be received at NTS prior to the expiration of the nonrenewable cask license...|$|R

5000|$|To conduct {{efficient}} and accurate cycle counts, many organizations use {{some form of}} software to implement an inventory control system, {{which is part of}} a warehouse management system. These systems may include mobile computers with integrated barcode scanners that allow the operator to automatically identify items, and enter inventory counts via keypad. The software then transmits data to a database on a host system which can generate inventory reports.Based on user defined criteria, the software will select a number of items to count at specific locations for the specified period of time. Ideally, these selections are daily but many companies choose to generate cycle count items weekly.Many companies perform [...] "mini" [...] <b>physical</b> <b>inventories</b> and call it cycle counts. Instead of using random or system generated part numbers at specific locations to count, they selectively choose specific locations and count everything in those locations. As part of their procedures they rotate throughout the plant with the intention of counting every location a minimum of once each year. This is an effective alternative to true cycle counting where a company may not have the sophistication to utilize cycle counting software.|$|R
5000|$|Yang et al. {{stated that}} in order to cope with high level of uncertainty, {{purchasing}} postponement (purchasing materials as close to production as possible) product development postponement may be applied => no <b>physical</b> <b>inventory.</b> In contrast, to deal with low uncertainty we use logistics postponement (reduction of obsolete inventories, just-in-time delivery) and production postponement => semi-finished product. With high modularity (when components can be incorporated into products with almost no change) product development and production postponements are used, whereas with low modularity (when customization is required) - logistics and purchasing postponements.This is what exactly was lacking in the 20th century because you did not know whether <b>physical</b> <b>inventory,</b> semi-finished, or finished products would work best as it was uncertain due to fluctuating consumer demands. Therefore, Yang et al. (2004) provides us with a guideline on how to manage this uncertainty.|$|E
