40|$|Resource {{efficient}} manufacturing {{as well as}} {{the avoidance}} of time and cost intensive fabrication methods {{play an important role in}} recent <b>production</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>Sheet</b> to sheet (S 2 S) inkjet printing as contactless and highly flexible technology and gravure printing suitable for large-area roll to roll (R 2 R) production combined with <b>production</b> <b>processes</b> like back injection molding or resin transfer molding offer great potential to fulfill the mentioned requirements in the field of smart lightweight applications. The main focus is the S 2 S and R 2 R manufacturing of conductive grid patterns as well as sensor arrays on flexible substrates using inkjet and gravure printing combined with infrared (IR) radiation for functionality formation. The conductive patterns are integrated into composite materials by back injection molding or resin transfer molding enabling data communication, sensor applications or power supply in the field of automotive or clean energy. The conductive grids can increase the directivity of an antenna signal and hence support utilization of 24 GHz radio together with plastic encapsulation in lightweight components e. g. in the automotive sector [1]. The printed and conductive sensor arrays consisting of various layouts can reflect an antenna signal and thus act as a passive sensor e. g. for remote ice detection on wind rotor blades [2]. The printed patterns can be used wirelessly and are well qualified for large-scale production. The printed grids are characterized by finest possible line widths and the passive sensor arrays are determined by different layouts of the single cells and their influence on reflected signals. The combination of the mentioned manufacturing methods allows a fast and efficient production of smart lightweight applications in large scale and without cost and time intensive conventional patterning methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>production</b> <b>processes</b> of <b>sheet</b> metal {{products}} with complex geometries often use transfer presses to obtain fully formed workpieces {{from a single}} machine. The job of adjusting a new multistage tool set increases {{with the number of}} stages because the deformations of the frame, the bottom platen, and the ram vary with the different applied loads. Each of the forces applied by the stages causes a specific deformation of the machine, while each stage is also influenced by all other stages. The Institute for Metal Forming and Metal Forming Machine Tools (University of Hanover, Germany) has developed a new computer-based set-up system for multistage tools. Once the machine properties have been measured, the system calculates the deformation of the machine {{on the basis of the}} forming forces measured during the tool setting process. The use of the developed system will help to shorten the first set-up of new tool sets. Manufacturers of sheet {{metal products}} are expecting significant time savings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of sheet molding {{compounds}} (SMC) {{in diverse}} applications requires different specific material properties {{for each type}} of finished parts. These material properties have to be assured by a reliable quality control, which does not only have to be performed for the prefabricated SMC itself but also during the <b>production</b> <b>process</b> of the semi-finished material. This is of high importance because quality fluctuations and defects can already occur during the production of the semi-finished SMC. This results in high scrap rates as well as machine failure and can additionally cause further problems in the following process steps. Hence, an inline quality control can help to establish objective quality criteria for semi-finished SMC and can enable controlled and stable <b>production</b> <b>processes.</b> Therefore, this paper deals with quality assurance in the <b>production</b> <b>process</b> of semi-finished <b>sheet</b> molding compounds. Air entrapping and fiber distribution are identified as two parameters that influence the quality of the semi-finished product significantly. In addition, the early detection of a pending carrier foil failure can help to establish a stable process. The focus of this paper lies on how various, individually adapted metrology systems can be used for the detection of the respective characteristics and integrated into the <b>production</b> <b>process</b> of the semi-finished SMC. In particular, optical systems, such as area scan cameras and laser stripe sensors as well as thermographic sensors are discussed and possibilities for application-related sensor data evaluation are shown. This helps to reduce the scrap rates of parts and to establish a further automated <b>production</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} motivates {{the development of}} energy-saving and low-polluting <b>production</b> <b>processes.</b> A <b>sheet</b> metal forming <b>process</b> without usage of lubricants is considered as one of these green <b>production</b> technologies. Forming <b>processes</b> {{without the need for}} traditional lubricants save process steps and additional costs to remove the remaining lubrication from the workpiece after forming. In order to realize such a dry forming process and to adjust the material flow effectively, tool surfaces were modified by amorphous carbon coatings and different surface finishing processes for roughness adjustment. To verify the general feasibility of the lubricant-free metal forming process, deep drawing of rectangular cups with and without lubrication with conventional forming tools was investigated. The dry deep drawing process was modelled numerically to analyze process parameters and identify critical contact conditions. By strip drawing tests, the tribological behavior of ta-C and a-C:H coated tools with different surface treatments was investigated. The deposition process and resulting properties of a-C:H coatings were further analyzed to improve their tribological performance. The effects of the process parameters - deposition temperature and bias voltage in the deposition chamber - were investigated using the one-factor-at-a-time method. The strip drawing tests revealed a high influence of the surface roughness of coated tools on the tribological behavior. Therefore, laser based smoothing was further investigated in this study. Laser radiation at 355 nm wavelength was applied as an effective and minimum heatgenerating technique to remove the roughness asperities on ta-C coatings which are built during its growth. Finally, ta-C and a-C:H coatings were applied on tool surfaces and tested in a drawing process of strip profiles. As reference the same forming process with a conventional forming tool was carried out...|$|R
40|$|Processes {{are very}} {{important}} for the success within many business fields. They define the proper application of methods, technologies, tools, and company structures in order to reach business goals. Not only manufacturing processes have to be defined from the start point to their end, also other processes like product development processes need a proper description to gain success. For example in automotive industries complex product development processes are necessary and defined prior to product development. Over the last decades several product modeling languages have been developed moving to object oriented modeling languages, such as UML, but the used process modeling languages are still procedural. The paradigm shift caused by object oriented description within product modeling languages has to be transferred to process modeling languages. This paper describes an object oriented approach for process modeling, referred to as PML and its application to a complex product development and <b>production</b> <b>process</b> for integrated <b>sheet</b> metal design of higher order bifurcations.

The {{aim was to}} study the feasibility of {{the combination of the}} friction stir processing technique with the superplastic forming process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the development, {{identification}} and validation of {{a model for the}} simulation of a thermomechanical multistage <b>production</b> <b>process</b> chain for <b>sheet</b> steels. The <b>process</b> of interest consists of forming (in particular deep-drawing) followed by cutting and heat treatment. For the forming and cutting stages, the complete model is based in particular on a model for thermoelastic, viscoplastic (i. e., rate-dependent) material behavior in sheet steels accounting for isotropic and anisotropic (i. e., kinematic and cross) hardening. This is combined with a model for thermally induced phase transformations in order to model heat treatment. The particular material modeled here is the sheet steel LH 800 (R). This steel has an initially ferritic microstructure which is maintained during forming and cutting. Heating of the workpiece after forming and cutting during heat treatment phase results in transformation of ferrite to austenite. Subsequent air-cooling back to room temperature is accompanied by a second transformation from austenite to martensite. Model predictions for the workpiece behavior during forming and cutting show quite good agreement with corresponding experimental results. In contrast, small discrepancies between the model predictions and experimental results for the change in workpiece geometry during cooling imply that the phase transformation from austenite to martensite in LH 800 (R) is not purely volumetric in nature as assumed in the model. Rather, it results in change in the deviatoric state of stress in the material and a corresponding change in shape of the workpiece. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
