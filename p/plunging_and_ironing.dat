50|$|Desiring {{to secure}} her later years financially, {{and avoid the}} poorhouse, she decided {{she would be the}} first person to ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Taylor used a {{custom-made}} barrel for her trip, constructed of oak <b>and</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> padded with a mattress. Several delays occurred in the launching of the barrel, particularly because no one {{wanted to be part of}} a potential suicide. Two days before Taylor's own attempt, a domestic cat was sent over the Horseshoe Falls in her barrel to test its strength to see if the barrel would break or not. Contrary to rumors at the time, the cat survived the <b>plunge</b> <b>and</b> 17 minutes later, after she was found with a bleeding head, posed with Taylor in photographs.|$|R
