5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local <b>pentagonal</b> symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling {{surrounded}} by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has <b>pentagonal</b> symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
5|$|Conception Bastion, {{also known}} as Ball's Bastion – a small <b>pentagonal</b> bastion, {{containing}} a number of gun emplacements, magazines, and gun crew accommodation. Sir Alexander Ball {{was buried in the}} salient of the bastion.|$|E
5|$|Fort Manoel {{is built}} {{in the shape of}} a square, with a <b>pentagonal</b> bastion on each corner, giving it the shape of a star fort. The four bastions are called St. Helen, St. Anthony, St. John and Notre Dame Bastions.|$|E
5|$|Notre Dame Ravelin, {{also known}} as the Lower Ravelin – a <b>pentagonal</b> ravelin near Notre Dame Curtain, between San Salvatore and St. Philip Bastions. A number of modern {{government}} buildings are located in the open area within the ravelin.|$|E
5|$|St. Andrew's Bastion – an {{asymmetrical}} <b>pentagonal</b> bastion. It is two-tiered, {{with its}} lower part originally containing the Marsamxett Gate, which was demolished {{in the early}} 20th century. A small faussebraye is located beneath the bastion. Ponsonby's Column {{was built on the}} bastion in 1838, but it was destroyed by lightning in 1864.|$|E
5|$|St. Francis Ravelin, {{also known}} as the Upper Ravelin – a <b>pentagonal</b> ravelin near St. Anne Curtain, between St. Philip and St. Francis Bastions. The Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) offices are located in the open area within the ravelin.|$|E
5|$|St. James Counterguard – a <b>pentagonal</b> counterguard {{built in}} 1640 near St. James Bastion. Its salient angle {{contains}} an echaugette, {{and it also}} contains a gunpowder magazine. Its central platform houses the Central Bank of Malta annex.|$|E
5|$|St. John and Notre Dame Bastions {{are located}} along the landward {{side of the}} fort. Each bastion is {{protected}} by a low cavalier. The curtain wall between the two bastions is further protected by a <b>pentagonal</b> ravelin, which is largely rock hewn.|$|E
5|$|St. John's Counterguard – a <b>pentagonal</b> counterguard {{built in}} 1640 near St. John's Bastion. Its salient angle {{contains}} an echaugette, {{and it also}} contains a gunpowder magazine. It is currently used as a football ground.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} starfish {{consists}} mostly of deep-sea and other cold-water starfish {{often with a}} global distribution. The shape is <b>pentagonal</b> or star-shaped with five to fifteen arms. They mostly have poorly developed skeletons with papulae widely distributed on the aboral surface and often spiny pedicellariae. This group includes the slime star.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the eastern}} walls of the city consist of an en crémaillère enciente built in the mid-16th century, {{although}} parts of the walls {{date back to the}} medieval period. The <b>pentagonal</b> Despuig Bastion, built in the 1740s during the magistracy Ramon Despuig, is grafted below the walls on the northeastern corner of the city.|$|E
5|$|Penrose {{originally}} {{discovered the}} P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one {{half of a}} net of a dodecahedron) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons. By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained {{one of the two}} P1 tilings with <b>pentagonal</b> symmetry.|$|E
5|$|St. Christopher Bastion – a two-tiered <b>pentagonal</b> bastion, today {{breached}} to {{make way}} for the Valletta ring road. The upper part contains the Lower Barrakka Gardens, while the lower part contains the Siege Bell War Memorial and the Monument to the Unknown Soldier. A low battery was built near the bastion in the 1680s, but most of it was dismantled {{to make way}} for the ring road.|$|E
5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned <b>pentagonal</b> alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new <b>pentagonal</b> wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
5|$|The Watts Brothers Tool Works square {{drill bit}} has {{the shape of}} a Reuleaux triangle, {{modified}} with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which allows for the bit not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill <b>pentagonal,</b> hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 60 county routes in Essex County, {{signed with the}} <b>pentagonal</b> county highway shields found {{in most of the}} state. The first in order is CR2, also known as Corduroy Road and Creek Road in Ticonderoga; the last is CR86E, known locally as Saint Huberts Road in Saint Huberts. In Keene, there are five county routes along NY73 that are former {{alignments}} of NY86A, which previously ran along that alignment.|$|E
5|$|Fort Runyon was a {{timber and}} {{earthwork}} fort {{constructed by the}} Union Army following the occupation of northern Virginia in the American Civil War in order to defend the southern approaches to the Long Bridge {{as part of the}} defenses of Washington, D.C. during that war. The Columbia Turnpike and Alexandria and Loudon Railroad ran through the <b>pentagonal</b> structure, which controlled access to Washington via the Long Bridge. With a perimeter of almost , and due to its unusual shape it was approximately the same size, shape, and in almost the same location as the Pentagon, built 80 years later.|$|E
5|$|Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of {{protactinium}} are known. PaOBr3 has a monoclinic structure {{composed of}} double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into <b>pentagonal</b> bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural {{to that of other}} actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900°C.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where protactinium ions {{are arranged in}} <b>pentagonal</b> bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.|$|E
5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the <b>Pentagonal</b> Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
5|$|The initial Russian position, which {{stretched}} {{south of}} the new Smolensk Highway (Napoleon's expected route of advance), was anchored on its left by a <b>pentagonal</b> earthwork redoubt erected on a mound {{near the village of}} Shevardino. The Russian generals soon realized that their left wing was too exposed and vulnerable. So the Russian line was moved back from this position, but the Redoubt remained manned, Kutuzov stating that the fortification was manned simply to delay the advance of the French forces. Historian Dmitry Buturlin reports that it was used as an observation point to determine the course of the French advance. Historians Witner and Ratch, and many others, reported it was used as a fortification to threaten the French right flank, despite being beyond effective reach of guns of the period.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the civil}} war was over, Gia Long decided {{to add to the}} two citadels that had been built under the {{supervision}} of French officers. Gia Long was convinced of their effectiveness and during his 18-year reign, a further 11 citadels were built throughout the country. The majority were built in the Vauban style, with <b>pentagonal</b> or hexagonal geometry, while a minority, including the one in Huế, were built in a four-sided traditional Chinese design. The fortresses were built at Vinh, Thanh Hóa, Bắc Ninh, Hà Tĩnh, Thái Nguyên and Hải Dương in the north, Huế, Quảng Ngãi, Khánh Hòa and Bình Định in the centre, and Vĩnh Long in the Mekong Delta. Construction was at its most intense in the early phase of Gia Long's reignonly one of the 11 were built {{in the last six years}} of his rule. De Puymanel and Lebrun left Vietnam before the end of the war, so the forts were designed by Vietnamese engineers who oversaw the construction. The position of Citadel Supervision Officer was created under the Ministry of War and made responsible for the work, underlining the importance that Gia Long placed on fortifications. Gia Long's fortifications program was marred by accusations that the people labored all day and part of the night in all weather conditions, and that as a direct consequence, land went fallow. Complaints of mandarin corruption and oppressive taxation were often levelled at his government. Following his coronation, Gia Long drastically reduced his naval fleet and by the 1810s, only two of the European-style vessels were still in service. The downsizing of the navy was mainly attributed to budgetary constraints caused by heavy spending on fortifications and transport infrastructure such as roads, dykes and canals. However, in 1819, a new phase of shipbuilding was launched, with Gia Long personally supervising the dockyards.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner wall}} is a solid structure, 4.5–6m thick and 12m high. It is faced with {{carefully}} cut limestone blocks, while its core is filled with mortar made of lime and crushed bricks. Between seven and eleven bands of brick, approximately 40cm thick, traverse the structure, {{not only as a}} form of decoration, but also strengthening the cohesion of the structure by bonding the stone façade with the mortar core, and increasing endurance to earthquakes. The wall was strengthened with 96 towers, mainly square but also a few octagonal ones, three hexagonal and a single <b>pentagonal</b> one. They were 15–20m tall and 10–12m wide, and placed at irregular distances, according to the rise of the terrain: the intervals vary between 21 and 77m, although most curtain wall sections measure between 40 and 60 meters. Each tower had a battlemented terrace on the top. Its interior was usually divided by a floor into two chambers, which did not communicate with each other. The lower chamber, which opened through the main wall to the city, was used for storage, while the upper one could be entered from the wall's walkway, and had windows for view and for firing projectiles. Access to the wall was provided by large ramps along their side. The lower floor could also be accessed from the peribolos by small posterns. Generally speaking, most of the surviving towers of the main wall have been rebuilt either in Byzantine or in Ottoman times, and only the foundations of some are of original Theodosian construction. Furthermore, while until the Komnenian period the reconstructions largely remained true to the original model, later modifications ignored the windows and embrasures on the upper store and focused on the tower terrace as the sole fighting platform.|$|E
25|$|The Medal of Ushakov is {{suspended}} from a standard Russian <b>pentagonal</b> mount {{by a small}} silver metallic chain hanging from both upper corners of the mount going through the anchor shackle {{and bottom of the}} <b>pentagonal</b> mount. The mount is covered by an overlapping 24mm wide silk moiré blue ribbon with 2mm blue and white edge stripes.|$|E
25|$|Cross section—the {{horizontal}} cross-section {{taken at}} {{some distance from}} the base. It is possible to discern retouching or rebuilding in deteriorated parts of the edges. The following types of cross section are commonly seen: triangular (sub-triangular and backed triangular), rhombic (rhomboidal and backed rhomboidal), trapezium (trapezoid and backed trapezoidal), pentagon (<b>pentagonal</b> and backed <b>pentagonal),</b> polygonal, biconvex or lenticular (sub lenticular).|$|E
25|$|It {{can be seen}} as a net of a <b>pentagonal</b> pyramid {{although}} with isosceles triangles.|$|E
25|$|All county routes are {{signed with}} the MUTCD-standard blue <b>pentagonal</b> shield, however some older signs still remain.|$|E
25|$|Another {{architectural}} innovation {{originated in}} Bagan is the Buddhist temple with a <b>pentagonal</b> floor plan. This design {{grew out of}} hybrid (between one-face and four-face designs) designs. The idea was to include the veneration of the Maitreya Buddha, the future and fifth Buddha of this era, {{in addition to the}} four who had already appeared. The Dhammayazika and the Ngamyethna Pagoda are examples of the <b>pentagonal</b> design.|$|E
