5|$|Gaudí's <b>professional</b> <b>life</b> was {{distinctive}} in that {{he never}} ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaudí was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E

The game lets the player {{assume the role of}} one of the main characters, making decisions for the character's personal and <b>professional</b> <b>life,</b> and competing in a number of minigames. It has been criticized by reviewers because of the simplicity of the mini-games and voice actors who do not play the same characters on the series, with Jason Ocampo of IGN giving it a 6.0/10 overall rating. The Wii release received mixed reviews, and the Windows release received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPurposeClinical {{competence}} among nurses is {{an essential}} requirement {{for the provision of}} safe and effective patient care. This study aims to classify types of <b>professional</b> quality of <b>life</b> experienced by Korean nurses, and examine the relationship between demographic and professional characteristics and clinical competence among nurses experiencing each type. MethodsA total of 335 nurses completed questionnaires assessing <b>professional</b> quality of <b>life,</b> clinical competence, and demographic and professional characteristics. Following identification of the underlying factors of <b>professional</b> quality of <b>life,</b> we classified participants into three clusters. ResultsThere were significant differences in age, marital status, religion, educational status, and position between clusters. Results also revealed that nurses with high compassion satisfaction and low compassion fatigue (burnout, secondary traumatic stress) tended to have higher clinical competence. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} directly examine the relationship between <b>professional</b> quality of <b>life</b> level and clinical competence among nurses. Thus, interventions to increase nurses' compassion satisfaction and relieve compassion fatigue are needed, as <b>professional</b> quality of <b>life</b> may affect clinical competence...|$|R

5|$|Barbirolli's first {{concert in}} New York was on 5 November 1936. The {{programme}} consisted of short pieces by Berlioz and Arnold Bax, and symphonies by Mozart (the Linz) and Brahms (the Fourth). During his ten weeks, he programmed several American novelties including Charles Martin Loeffler's tone-poem Memories of My Childhood, a symphony by Anis Fuleihan, and Philip James's Bret Harte overture. He also conducted Serge Koussevitzky's Double Bass Concerto. The players told the Philharmonic management {{that they would}} be happy for Barbirolli to be appointed to a permanent position. The outcome of this was an invitation to him to become Music Director and Permanent Conductor for three years starting with the 1937–38 season. At the same time as this great change in his <b>professional</b> <b>life,</b> Barbirolli's personal life was also transformed. His marriage had not lasted; within four years he and Marjorie Barbirolli had been living apart. In 1938 she sued for divorce on the grounds of his desertion. The suit was undefended, and the divorce was granted in December 1938. In 1939, Barbirolli married the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell. The marriage lasted for the rest of Barbirolli's life.|$|E

5|$|The series plot {{revolves}} around Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) {{and his life}} in sleepy, slow-paced fictional Mayberry, North Carolina.

His <b>professional</b> <b>life,</b> however, {{is complicated by the}} repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts).

At home, Andy enjoys fishing trips with his son, Opie (Ronny Howard), and quiet evenings on the front porch with his maiden aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). Opie tests his father's parenting skills season after season, and Aunt Bee's ill-considered romances and adventures cause her nephew concern.|$|E

30|$|Several {{developed}} countries may face fiscal risks {{stemming from the}} lack of financial sustainability of their pay-as-you-go (PAYG) public pension systems.
