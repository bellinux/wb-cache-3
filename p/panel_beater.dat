500|$|The {{situation}} caused two marshals {{from the}} pit {{wall on the}} opposite side of the track to intervene. The first marshal to cross the track was a 25-year-old <b>panel</b> <b>beater</b> named William (Bill). The second was 19-year-old Frederik [...] "Frikkie" [...] Jansen van Vuuren, who was carrying a [...] fire extinguisher. George Witt, the chief pit marshal for the race, said that the policy of the circuit was that in cases of fire, two marshals must attend and a further two act as back-up in case the first pair's extinguishers were not effective enough. Witt also recalled that both marshals crossed the track without prior permission. The former narrowly made it across the track, but the latter did not. As the two men started to run across the track, the cars driven by Hans-Joachim Stuck and Pryce came over the brow of a rise in the track.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the Mark V name is {{somewhat}} mysterious as {{there had been no}} Mk I to IV Jaguars and the MK IV designation was only given to its predecessor after the launch of the Mk V. Chairman and chief stylist William Lyons (Sir William after 1956) and his team of shop assistants known as <b>panel</b> <b>beaters</b> put together five prototype bodies with various chassis experiments in the 1946-1948 period before he was satisfied with the result, and the chosen one was known as Mark V in internal documents. Lyons explained this in a speech given on September 30 1948 to introduce the new car to distributors and members of the press, so that is how the Mark V got its name. A photograph of the discarded prototypes survives with the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Die-based forming is a technology used by many industries to form metal panels. However, this method of forming lacks flexibility and cost effectiveness. In such cases, manual panel beating is typically undertaken for incremental forming of metal panels. Manual panel forming is a highly skilled operation with very little documentation and is disappearing due to non-observance {{and a lack of}} interest. Confederation of British Metal forming (CBM) and Institution of Sheet Metal Engineering (ISME) have realised the need for capturing and understanding manual skills used by <b>panel</b> <b>beaters</b> to preserve the knowledge. At the same time, industries seek for alternative panel forming solutions to produce high quality and cost-effective parts at low volume and reduce the repetitive, yet adaptive parts of the panel forming process to free up skilled workers to concentrate on the forming activities that are more difficult to automate. Incremental forming technologies, currently in practice, lack adaptability as they require substantial fixtures and dedicated tools. In this research a new proof-of-concept fixtureless automated sheet metal forming approach was developed on the basis of human skills captured from <b>panel</b> <b>beaters.</b> The proposed novel approach, named Mechatroforming®, consists of integrated mechanisms to form simple sheet metal parts by manipulating the workpiece using a robotic arm under a repetitive hammering tool. Predictive motion planning based on FEA was analysed and the manual forming skills were captured using a motion capture system. This facilitated the coordinated hammering and motion of the part to produce the intended shape accurately. A 3 D measurement system with a vertical resolution of 50 μm was also deployed to monitor the formation of the parts and make corrections to the forming path if needed. Therefore, the developed mechatronic system is highly adjustable by robotic motion and was closed loop via the 3 D measurement system. The developed automated system has been tested rigorously, initially for bowl shape parts to prove the principle. The developed system which is 98...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{widespread}} use of latex devices has been followed, in the last 25 years, {{by an increase in}} IgE mediated sensitization. The clinical manifestations of latex allergy affect the skin (urticaria and angioneurotic oedema), the lower and the upper respiratory tracts (rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and glottis oedema), and the cardiovascular system (anaphylaxis). There is also an anaphylactic risk during surgery and invasive diagnostic procedures. Vegetable food cross-reacts with latex so {{that more than half of}} the patients show specific IgE against some food. Further than traditional groups at risk, as health care workers, other work categories have to be protected, because of the inappropriate use of latex gloves (food or drug industry workers, mechanics, <b>panel</b> <b>beaters</b> and so on). Recently the latex most important allergenic fractions have been characterized and recombinant allergens are now available. The recombinant allergens allow a better standardization of the extracts for diagnostic use, the production of safer extracts for immunotherapy as well as a more accurate evaluation of food cross-reactions. The recombinant allergens will allow a more accurate dosage of latex concentrations in air and in objects and, in future, to establish threshold limit values. The main aims of prevention are the replacement of latex with alternative elastomers, the reduction of work and extra work exposure and an efficient health survey in working environment. The use of latex gloves and devices among general population has to be discouraged. Specific immunotherapy has to be considered a second choice and restricted to highly qualified workers in order to realize a rehabilitation to their previous jobs. The actually obtained protection must be verified...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess whether}} {{contemporary}} solvent exposures {{in the vehicle}} collision repair industry are associated with objectively measured neuropsychological performance in collision repair workers. The RBANS battery and additional tests were administered to 47 vehicle collision repair and 51 comparison workers randomly selected from a previous questionnaire study. Collision repair workers performed lower on tests of attention (digit span backwards: - 1. 5, 95 % CI - 2. 4, - 0. 5; digit span total: - 1. 7, CI - 3. 3, - 0. 0; coding: - 6. 1, CI - 9. 9, - 2. 8; total attention scale: - 9. 3, CI - 15. 9, - 2. 8) and the RBANS total scale (- 5. 1, CI - 9. 1, - 1. 2). Additional tests also showed deficits in visual attention and reaction time (Trails B: - 11. 5, CI - 22. 4, - 0. 5) and motor speed/dexterity (coin rotation dominant hand & non-dominant: - 2. 9, CI - 5. 3, - 0. 4 and - 3. 1, CI - 5. 6, - 0. 7 respectively).

40|$|MBA - WBSSouth African townships are characterised by {{generally}} {{high levels}} of unemployment and poverty. Small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) are seen to be a fruitful source of jobs that generate income, which in turn relieve poverty. The purpose {{of this research was}} to obtain an understanding of the constraints facing micro enterprises in South African townships. It is envisaged that this understanding of the constraints facing the micro enterprises will assist government, business and other institutions to provide a favourable environment for SMMEs to operate in, and hence contribute to relieving unemployment and poverty. This research comprised case studies of six micro enterprises on the Vosloorus Industrial Estate, in the Vosloorus township. The micro enterprises selected ranged across a number of skill sets, including welders, auto mechanics, <b>panel</b> <b>beaters</b> and furniture makers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the micro enterprise owners. A semi-structured interview was also held with: Khula Enterprises, the owners of the industrial estate; Mr Nhlapo, the chairman of Gapipa (Gauteng Province Industrial Parks Association – refer to Section 2. 6); and Patson Ngwevela, the councillor for the applicable ward in which the industrial estate is located. Several constraints to the growth of the micro enterprises were identified. Micro enterprises need to continuously adapt to environmental changes in order to survive and grow. In other words, the micro enterprises need to adapt their internal environments so that they are relevant to their external environment. As a result of this need, the key constraints identified were classified under the headings of external constraints, internal constraints and the constraints with the support structures. The key external constraints identified were the {{high levels of}} unemployment and poverty, and the competition from the backyard and street corner enterprises. The key internal constraints identified were the fact that the micro enterprises operated informally, the fact that the micro enterprise owner’s skills were unaccredited, and the fact that marketing was in essence passive. The key constraints identified with the support structures were the lack of awareness and the lack of trust in the support structure...|$|R
40|$|D. Com. (Economics) One of {{the current}} most topical aspects of {{economic}} activity in South Africa is {{the growth of the}} informal sector. In addition, with deregulation becoming a hallmark of government economic policy, local authorities have become increasingly aware of the growth of the informal sector. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the nature and extent of informal sector activities in the Johannesburg municipal area by means of a questionnaire method of research. After a study of the numerous definitions concerning the informal sector, it was decided that for the purpose of this thesis, the informal sector be defined as: Those businesses that do not conform to a diversity of legal requirements, while the market and price mechanisms determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. In Johannesburg, it was observed that the formal sector's inability to create sufficient employment opportunities for all its citizens led to increasing numbers of people becoming involved in the informal sector. As far as the nature of the informal sector is concerned, the survey carried out during August 1991 revealed that diverse types of economic activities are being carried out. The main activities of the informal sector in Johannesburg were found to be: (i) production (such as "furniture makers" and "knitters"); (ii) accommodation (such as sub-letting of land/property or premises); (iii) building construction (such as building contractors and plasterers); (rv) repair services (such as motor repairs, <b>panel</b> <b>beaters</b> and home appliance repairs); (v) retail distribution (such as food vendors and hawkers of fresh produce); (vi) transport (such as the transport of goods and passengers); and (vii) personal services (such as hairdressers and photographers). The most important activity was found to be retail distribution. Disproportionately more male than female entrepreneurs were involved in this sector. Most entrepreneurs were between the ages of 31 and 40 years. These entrepreneurs work long hours and frequently have to provide their services for seven days a week. Most of the undertakings were operated solely by the informal sector entrepreneur, and employees were only employed in exceptional cases. Informal sector entrepreneurs experienced great problems in obtaining finance and licences. Other problems included access to water and electricity. A unique method was developed in order to determine the extent of informal sector activities in Johannesburg. In applying this method it was found that 15, 20 percent of the total number of unemployed households in Johannesburg participated in informal sector activities. Having taken account of the findings of the survey conducted in August 1991, the informal sector has an important role to play in the future, especially as an avenue for the employment of those who cannot be accommodated in the formal sector. The greatest challenge facing the Johannesburg City Council is to introduce development measures such as financial assistance, the provision of infrastructure, establishing a development fund, deregulation and training programmes in order to stimulate the expansion of informal sector activities without detrimentally affecting the formal sector activities.
