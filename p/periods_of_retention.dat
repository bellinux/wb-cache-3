40|$|Exposure {{to chronic}} stress {{can alter the}} {{structure}} and function of brain regions involved in learning and memory, and these effects are typically long-lasting if the stress occurs during sensitive periods of development. Until recently, adolescence has received relatively little attention as a sensitive period of development, despite marked changes in behaviour, heightened reactivity to stressors, and cognitive and neural maturation. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to investigate the long-term effects of chronic stress in adolescence on two spatial learning and memory tasks (Morris water maze and Spatial Object Location test) and on a working memory task (Delayed Alternation task). Male rats were randomly assigned to chronic social instability stress (SS; daily 1 hour isolation and subsequent change of cage partner between postnatal days 30 and 45) or to a no-stress control group (CTL). During acquisition learning in the Morris water maze task, SS rats demonstrated impaired long-term memory for the location of the hidden escape platform compared to CTL rats, although the impairment was only seen after the first day of training. Similarly, SS rats had impaired long-term memory in the Spatial Object Location test after a long delay (240 minutes), but not after shorter delays (15 or 60 minutes) compared to CTL rats. On the Delayed Alternation task, which assessed working memory across delays ranging from 5 to 90 seconds, no group differences were observed. These results are partially in line with previous research that revealed adult impairment on spatial learning and memory tasks after exposure to chronic social instability stress in adolescence. The observed deficits, however, appear to be limited to long-term memory as no group differences were observed during brief <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Root {{resorption}} is a {{side effect}} of orthodontic treatment that occurs with the removal of hyalinized tissue. Studies have shown that a reparative process in the periodontium begins when the applied orthodontic force is discontinued or reduced below a certain level. However, quantitative 3 -dimensional evaluation of root resorption repair has not been done. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantitatively assess the 2 - and 3 -dimensional changes of root resorption craters after 2 weeks of continuous mesially applied orthodontic forces of 50 g on rat molars and 2 - to 16 -week retention periods. Methods: We used 60 male Wistar rats (10 weeks old). Nickel-titanium closed-coil springs were used to apply 50 -g mesial forces for 2 weeks to move the maxillary left first molars. The rats were randomly allocated to 6 groups. Those in the zero-week retention group were killed after force application. In the remaining 5 groups, the interdental spaces between the maxillary first and second molars were filled with resin to retain the molars. The molars were extracted after <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> from 2 and 16 weeks. The maxillary right molars were used as the controls. Mesial and distal roots (distobuccal and distopalatal) were examined by using scanning electron and 3 -dimensional scanning laser microscopes. The surface area, depth, volume, and roughness of the root resorption craters were measured. Results: The area, depth, and volume of the craters decreased gradually and showed similar trends over the retention time, approaching a plateau at the 12 th week. After 16 weeks of retention, the volumes of the resorption craters of the distobuccal and distopalatal roots reached recovery peaks of 69. 5 % and 66. 7 %, respectively. Small pits on the mesial roots showed recovery of 62. 5 % at the 12 th week. The healing patterns in distal roots with severe resorption and mesial roots with shallow resorption had no significant differences. Conclusions: The resorption and repair processes during the early stages of retention are balanced, and most of the reparative process occurs after 4 weeks of passive retention after the application of orthodontic force. Frequent orthodontic reactivations should be avoided to allow recovery and repair of root surface damage...|$|E
40|$|In {{the lower}} St. Lawrence estuary (LSLE, eastern Canada), blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense are a {{recurrent}} phenomenon, resulting in paralytic shellfish poisoning outbreaks every summer. A first coupled physical-biological model of A. tamarense blooms {{was developed for}} this system in order to explore the interactions between cyst germination, cellular growth and water circulation and to identify the effect of physical processes on bloom development and transport across the estuary. The simulated summer (1998) was characterized by an A. tamarense red tide with concentrations reaching 2. 3 x 10 (6) cells L- 1 along the south shore of the LSLE. The biological model was built with previously observed A. tamarense cyst distribution, cyst germination rate and timing, and A. tamarense growth limitation by temperature and salinity. The coupled model successfully reproduced {{the timing of the}} A. tamarense bloom in 1998, its coincidence with the combined plumes from the Manicouagan and Aux-Outardes (M-O) rivers on the north shore of the estuary, and the temporal variations in the north-south gradients in cell concentrations. The simulation results reveal that the interaction between cyst germination and the estuarine circulation generates a preferential inoculation of the surface waters of the M-O river plume with newly germinated cells which could partly explain the coincidence of the blooms with the freshwater plume. Furthermore, the results suggest that the spatio-temporal evolution of the bloom is dominated by alternating <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and advection of the M-O plume: east or northeast winds favor the retention of the plume close to the north shore while west or north-west winds result in its advection toward the south shore. The response of the simulated freshwater plume to fluctuating wind forcing controls the delivery of the A. tamarense bloom from {{the northern part of the}} estuary to the south shore. In addition, our results suggest that a long residence time of the M-O plume and associated A. tamarense population in the LSLE during the summer 1998 contributed to the development of the red tide. We thus hypothesize that the wind-driven dynamics of the M-O plume could partly determine the success of A. tamarense blooms in the LSLE by influencing the residence time of the blooms and water column stability, which in turn affects A. tamarense vertical migrations and growth.

40|$|Environmental {{conditions}} such as water temperature and ambient light level are expected to exert a strong influence on the natural behaviour and bottom trawl catchability of marine groundfish species such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). In this thesis, I use acoustic telemetry to investigate this prediction for cod inhabiting coastal inshore waters in the North Atlantic ocean. [...] Laboratory and field experiments were first conducted to examine two intragastric methods for attaching acoustic transmitters to cod. I found that cod which voluntarily swallowed transmitters wrapped in bait exhibited a delayed onset of initial regurgitation, longer <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> higher food consumption, and lower mortality in comparison to fish tagged using the method of forced insertion into the gut. Under field conditions, cod in shallow coastal waters were successfully tagged by lowering a tagging frame near the seafloor containing baited acoustic transmitters. The technique {{did not appear to}} affect natural behaviour and was found to be ideal for short-term telemetry studies. [...] Temporal patterns in the natural activity level of acoustically tagged cod were investigated using a stationary positioning system. Time-of-day was found to have a significant affect on the activity level of cod inhabiting two study areas, the coastal waters of Norway and Newfoundland. High resolution tracking of juvenile cod revealed significant between-individual variation, suggesting that juvenile cod may make different trade-offs in balancing the demands of foraging and predator avoidance. Adult cod in Smith Sound on the northeast coast of Newfoundland exhibited seasonal variation in diel activity rhythm. During summer, cod were active throughout the diel cycle with a pronounced increase in activity during daylight hours. During winter, cod occupied deeper water and were significantly less active. Water temperature and ambient light intensity are thought to be the key proximate factors responsible for this seasonal difference in behaviour. [...] Finally, the behaviour of cod was examined in response to an approaching vessel and bottom trawl at different times of year. Using acoustic telemetry, the swimming speed of cod was estimated for the periods before, during, and after passage of a vessel travelling at different speeds as well as in response to this vessel towing a bottom trawl. The likelihood of reaction, reaction distance, and the duration of disturbance produced by the encounter were examined. The results showed that cod are capable of reacting to an approaching vessel from considerable distances and that the disturbance produced by the encounter can persist for periods up to 56 min. [...] In summary, the findings from this thesis indicate that variation in environmental conditions {{play an important role in}} modifying the behaviour of cod. Diel variation in ambient light intensity and seasonal variation in water temperature appear to be important proximate factors. Both are predicted to affect the availability and vulnerability of inshore cod populations to acoustic and bottom trawl sampling tools used in resource assessment surveys...|$|E
40|$|Educators {{and psychologists}} have extolled the {{benefits}} of active learning techniques such as organizing material, self-explaining, learning through experience, and practicing retrieval for years. Underlying these strategies is the generation effect, an encoding phenomenon in which actively generating rather than passively learning information improves the subsequent retrieval of item information. Despite rather extensive analysis of the generation effect, the processes underlying it are not fully understood. Theories suggest that active generation increases cognitive effort, conceptual processing, item distinctiveness, and semantic processing. Further, generation {{has also been shown}} to have varying positive, negative and null effects for contextual features such as order, color, and spatial location, prompting tradeoff and transfer-appropriate processing accounts. This dissertation investigates the positive and negative effects of generation, the universality of the generation effect, and its underlying neural mechanisms. Further, these studies test various explanations of the generation effect, and a transfer-appropriate processing account is considered in detail. In the first set of studies, I used five experiments to investigate the ways in which active generation can influence memory for item information, related item information, and contextual information. Employing synonym (e. g., ACADEMIC - SCH_L_R), antonym (e. g., question - a____), idiom (e. g., it's raining cats and ()), picture, and category-exemplar (e. g., animal - c_t) generation tasks, the positive generation effect for item memory was generally robust, and persisted over long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and in the face of cognitive distraction. However, negative generation effects were found for font color memory, while null effects were found for background color and location memory. Further, generation was found to impair memory for related items and even the items themselves under certain circumstances. The second set of studies investigated {{the degree to which the}} positive generation effect translates to participants in China, a country that stresses a Confucian rather than Socratic learning style reminiscent of active generation. To address memory for contextual details in a culture that processes information in a field-dependent rather than field-independent manner as in the United States, we also examined the effect of generation on color and spatial location. American and Chinese participants read or generated idioms (e. g., it's raining cats and (); &# 20542;&# 23478;&# 33633;()) presented in different colors or locations, and were tested for item and context memory. For both groups, generation improved item memory. However, American individuals exhibited a negative generation effect only for color memory, while Chinese individuals exhibited negative effects for both color and location memory. These experiments demonstrate the universality of the positive generation effect and the first negative generation effect for location memory to my knowledge. Finally, I explored the neural basis of the generation effect in an fMRI study. During encoding, participants read or generated synonyms from cues (e. g., GARBAGE - W_ST_). Again, compared to simply reading target words, generating target words significantly improved later recognition memory performance. During encoding, this benefit was associated with a broad neural network that involved both prefrontal (inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus) and posterior cortex (inferior temporal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, ventral posterior parietal cortex). These results leave open the possibility that active generation increases attention and cognitive effort (prefrontal and posterior cortical activation), conceptual and semantic processing (IFG and MTG), and item distinctiveness (LOC and ACC). Overall, active generation proved to be a powerful encoding strategy, engaging a wide range of cognitive processes and broad networks of neural activity. Seemingly an almost effortless task, generation enhanced item memory for various stimuli under several conditions. However, active generation had limitations, as it impaired both item and context memory in certain situations. I propose that a transfer-appropriate processing account in which active generation promotes conceptual processing and reduces perceptual processing, ultimately enhancing memory for item information, impairing memory for intrinsic contextual information, and ignoring memory for extrinsic contextual information, best accounts for this pattern of positive and negative generation effects...|$|E

40|$|In {{the attempt}} {{to account for the}} {{emptying}} of the uterus at a definite time, various hypotheses have been formulated upon the basis of {{one or more of the}} changes in the fetal or maternal organism which have been noted at the time of termination of pregnancy. The viewpoint of the obstetrician, whose experience involves chiefly tlhe phenomena of labor, has been the basis of numerous theories, the multiplicity of which bears evidence of the uncertaintly attending them. A clue to the nature of parturition is found by experiment. Empty-ing of the uterus is under hormonal control; the time of onset may be hastened or postponed as desired, living offspring being born in either case. In experiments in which a new ovulation is superimposed upon pregnancy, a definite rhythm is still evident in the duration of gesta-tion; the amount of lengt!hening or shortening of pregnancy is not irregular, but is fixed according to the length of the ovulation cycle; the normal mechanism of labor seems to be in operation except, at an earlier or later time than is usual. In order to determine the relation of parturition to preceding stages of pregnancy, the method of the embryologist rather than that of t. he obstetrician must be followed. The common method of approach to a problem of embryology, whether a structure or a function is involved, is to reconstruct various stages in the development of the organ or pro-cess. The final form is viewed from the standpoint of its development.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that both procedural skills and episodic memories consolidate across <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> offline <b>retention,</b> and most particularly across <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> sleep. Such consolidation {{has been demonstrated}} to be more marked for emotional than for neutral episodes, but the interaction between emotionality and the offline consolidation of procedural skills {{has yet to be}} investigated. Here, we address this issue by examining the impact of an emotional background context at encoding upon the subsequent consolidation of mirror tracing, a well-studied procedural skill. We also consider the importance of sleep for such consolidation by manipulating the retention interval (over a day, overnight, or over 24 h containing normal sleep). Our data show significantly greater offline improvements in the accuracy of mirror tracing when negative emotional content is present during the training phase when compared to when neutral or positive content is present. Furthermore, consolidation across a night of sleep is associated with faster and more accurate performance than consolidation across a day of wakefulness. These novel findings show that the emotional context in which a procedural skill is learned can impact upon subsequent offline consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{potential}} for contamination of wastewaters from pig farming. Methods. Wastewaters from pig farming were stored in a tank. After 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>retention,</b> they were added to lysimeters filled with argillaceous, sandy, or medium soil. Finally, these lysimeters were submitted to simulations of either a rainy season or a dry season. The number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci was measured in the effluents of the storage tank (for the various <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>retention),</b> in the percolate from the lysimeters, and in {{the three types of}} soil. The microbiological analyses were carried out using the membrane filter technique. The pH analyses were done potentiometrically. Results. For the three microorganisms, the largest decrease in bacterial counts in the storage tanks occurred with 90 or 120 days <b>of</b> <b>retention.</b> There was a marked decrease in the bacterial count in the percolates of the three soils. For the three soil types the greatest reduction in bacterial counts was found in medium soil, due to its acidity (pH < 7. 0). Hydraulic retention was not sufficient to ensure the sanitary adequacy of the wastewaters and their use for irrigation, given that fecal coliform values were above 1 000 CFU per 100 mL. Therefore, adding the residues to the soil was considered a second stage of treatment. Conclusions. The <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> wastewaters followed by adding them to soil was effective in minimizing the contaminating effect of pig farming residues. The storage time for wastewaters from pig farming could be decreased from 120 to 90 days...|$|R

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{condition of}} Emys orbicularis females (presence {{or absence of}} oviductal eggs) was studied by palpation and radiography in a coastal population of central Italy (Tuscany). Forty-nine females were recaptured at least twice during the reproductive period in 1997; 15 of them were found without eggs, 29 reproduced at least once, and 5 reproduced twice. The <b>period</b> <b>of</b> egg <b>retention</b> {{was estimated to be}} three to four weeks, and the time between two depositions about 34 days (n = 5). Despite the small sample of females reproducing twice, there is a significant tendency regarding a positive correlation between frequency of reproduction and female body size, within the study population. Reproductive females were bigger than females found without eggs; in addition, carapace length increased significantly in females found zero, one and two times with eggs. A comparison with preliminary data from northern populations of E. orbicularis, lead to the hypothesis that the annual clutch frequency could be negatively related to latitude, the model of this relationship should be still a matter of discussion...|$|R

40|$|Summary Corticosteroids {{are known}} to {{modulate}} the consolidation of memories during sleep, specifically in the hippocampus-dependent declarative memory system. However, effects of the major human corticosteroid cortisol are conveyed via two different receptors, i. e., mineralo-corticoid (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) whose specific contributions to memory consolidation are unclear. Whereas {{a shift in the}} balance between MR and GR activation toward predominant GR activation has been found to impair sleep-dependent consolidation of declara-tive memories, the effect of predominant MR activation is not well characterized. Here, we examined differential corticosteroid receptor contributions to memory consolidation during post-learning sleep in two placebo-controlled double-blind studies in humans, by comparing the effects of the selective MR agonist fludrocortisone (0. 2 mg, orally, Study 1) and of hydrocortisone (22 mg, intravenously, Study 2) with strong binding affinity to both MR and GR. We hypothesized increased activation of MRs during sleep to enhance declarative memory consolidation, but the joint MR/GR activation to impair it. Participants (16 men in each study) learned a declarative (word pair associates) and a procedural task (mirror tracing) before a 7 -h <b>period</b> <b>of</b> nocturnal <b>retention</b> sleep, with the substances administered before sleep (Study 1) and during sleep (Stud...|$|R
40|$|Taking {{into account}} {{a large number}} of types of nominal and real {{exchange}} rates, while estimating the real equilibrium exchange rate, one should always remember that there is no a single, universal equilibrium exchange rate. A point value or a path of that exchange rate depends on the adopted definitions and assumptions {{as well as on the}} method and purpose of the analysis. However, a value added of each estimation of the equilibrium exchange rate is an answer, whether the economic policy causes upset or stabilisation of the economy. Moreover, in the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> discussion on the exchange rate of accession to ERM- 2, showing an interval of the exchange rate where all values of the exchange rate ensure at least suboptimal behaviour of the economy may help to make a decision on the date of accession to ERM- 2 that will minimise costs <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the exchange rate within a definite currency band. For Poland, estimated by the NATREX method the long-run real equilibrium exchange rate ensures the internal equilibrium with annual growth rates of GDP amounting to 4. 1 %, comprised of growth of consumption by 4 % p. a., investment by 8. 7 %, volume of exports by 8. 5 % and volume of imports by 8. 1 % p. a. Estimating on the ground of real exchange rates an approximate value of nominal exchange rates, one can state that the long-term equilibrium in the economy is ensured with the exchange rate of 3. 80 - 3. 90 zlotys for 1 euro. The current exchange rate will probably approach the equilibrium exchange rate at the turn of 2010 and 2011, and it will remain near that level over 5 - 6 quarters. This means that in that <b>period</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the PLN exchange rate within a narrow band of fluctuations is relatively the least. The next period where the current exchange rate should approach the optimal exchange rate is 2014. Then, also in the medium term, the exchange rate of zloty should be comprised within the interval of 3. 80 - 3. 90 (assuming the stable exchange rate of USD/EUR= 1. 40) ...|$|R
