5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E

In the 1940s Ludwig Guttmann introduced a program of turning paraplegics every two hours thus allowing bedsores to heal. Previously such individuals had a two-year life-expectancy, normally succumbing to blood and skin infections. Guttmann had learned the technique from the work of Boston physician Donald Munro.|$|E

25|$|In other craniofacial syndromes, the {{abnormal}} feature {{may actually}} improve the airway, but its correction may put the <b>person</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for {{obstructive sleep apnea}} after surgery when it is modified. Cleft palate syndromes are such an example. During the newborn period, all humans are obligate nasal breathers. The palate is both {{the roof of the}} mouth and the floor of the nose. Having an open palate may make feeding difficult, but generally, does not interfere with breathing, in fact, if the nose is very obstructed, then an open palate may relieve breathing. There are a number of clefting syndromes in which the open palate is not the only abnormal feature; additionally, there is a narrow nasal passage - which may not be obvious. In such individuals, closure of the cleft palate – whether by surgery or by a temporary oral appliance, can cause the onset of obstruction.|$|E

Findings from analogue studies with nonpatienis indicate that perceived confidentiality limitations will deter people from seeking therapy and will inhibit self-disclosures once they are in treatment. However these findings da not hold up in research with actual therapy patients. A methodological issue is whether the subject pool for clinical studies is primarily <b>persons</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for only mild to moderate social injury if their communications are repeated to others. In the few studies of <b>persons</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for serious sociolegal consequences, warnings of mandatory reporting served {{as a barrier to}} therapeutic disclosure or entry into treatment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Persons</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for {{inherited}} neurodegenerative diseases {{may experience}} symptoms {{of anxiety and}} depression because of concern over the possibility of developing the disease in the future. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess psychological and emotional symptoms in <b>persons</b> <b>at</b> the age of risk for developing early-onset familial Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (FAD). Their responses on a psychiatric rating scale (SCL- 90 -R) were compared with four groups: patients with mild FAD; head injury patients; patients with clinically diagnosed depression; and healthy control subjects. Mean scores of the at-risk FAD group were not statistically different than those of the controls. In contrast, the head injury and depressed groups had significantly elevated scores across the clinical scales. These results suggest that depression and anxiety are not prominent features in <b>persons</b> <b>at</b> genetic <b>risk</b> for early-onset familial Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease.
