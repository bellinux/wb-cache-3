A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the city of Salto, Uruguay, to identify mosquito-producing containers, the spatial distribution of mosquitoes and the relationship between the different population indices of Aedes aegypti. On each of 312 <b>premises</b> <b>visited,</b> water-filled containers and immature Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were identified. The containers were counted and classified into six categories. Pupae per person and Stegomyia indices were calculated. Pupae per person were represented spatially. The number of each type of container and number of mosquitoes in each were analyzed and compared, and their spatial distribution was analyzed. No significant differences in the number of the different types of containers with mosquitoes or in the number of mosquitoes in each were found. The distribution of the containers with mosquito was random and the distribution of mosquitoes by type of container was aggregated or highly aggregated...|$|R

The ragged robins were hanging out, pinky red, from the hedgerows; the cuckoo was calling from the copse beside the mill stream; and the merry wee hedge-warblers were singing lustily from the topmost sprays of hawthorn, with their full throats bursting tremulously in the broad sunshine. And Ernest Le Breton, too, filled with the season, had come down from Dunbude for a fortnight's holiday, on his <b>premised</b> <b>visit</b> to his friend Oswald, or, to say the truth more plainly, to Oswald's pretty little sister Edie. For Ernest had fully made up his mind by this time what it was he had come for, and he took the earliest possible opportunity of taking a walk with Edie alone, through the tiny glen behind the town, where the wee stream tumbles lazily upon the big slow-turning vanes of the overshot mill-wheel.|$|R

5000|$|The Gympie Municipal Council first {{introduced}} by-laws {{relating to the}} erection and maintenance of earth closets in 1883. Initially only {{certain areas of the}} municipality (including Mary Street) were required to conform to provisions. In areas where earth closets were made mandatory, pit systems were filled in and existing toilets were required to be rebuilt or altered. Each earth closet was fitted with a box or other vessel [...] "for the reception of nightsoil or other filth" [...] and placed conveniently for removal. Earth closets were also required to be furnished with [...] "a suitable receptacle for the storage of a quantity of dry earth for deodorising purposes". People engaged in the removal of nightsoil were required to pay an annual license fee and could only operate between eleven at night to five in the morning. From 1885 the council operated its own nightsoil service. By 1894 the whole of the municipality was under the provisions of the by-laws. In 1895, the by-laws were further extended and every nightman was required to keep a register of all <b>premises</b> <b>visited,</b> to be submitted monthly to the council inspector.

There were only few other centres of excellence that were involved in research in Industrial Toxicology worldwide, including those headed by Professor Schilipkoter in Düsseldorf, Germany, and Dr. Erwing Selikoff at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. During his tenure at ITRC, Zaidi continued to work on cellular mechanisms through which asbestos, silica and other dusts as well as other industrial toxins affected human health (for example [...] ).

5000|$|The {{building}} was constructed around 1860 by the Nawab of Awadh, who intended {{it to be}} a centre of the royalty's literary life in the region. According to a local historian, the name derived from [...] "rifa" [...] or [...] "happiness" [...] and [...] "aam" [...] or [...] "common", and suggested that the club offered happiness to the common man. The club was open to everybody, and was thus a symbol of rebellion against local British clubs, which did not permit Indians to enter. In subsequent years it became what The Economist described as [...] "an important nationalist hangout". It was one of the centres of nationalist, anti-British intellectual activity, frequented by individuals such as Munshi Premchand and Mohammad Amir Ahmad Khan. In the 1900s it hosted meetings of the All-India Muslim League. The club hosted a meeting of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League which led to the Lucknow Pact of 1916, which was also signed on the <b>premises.</b> Mahatma Gandhi <b>visited</b> the building to give a speech on Hindu-Muslim unity on 15 October 1920 and on 26 April 1922 Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel made speeches at the club encouraging local people to intensify the Swadeshi movement.

O Conjunto Residencial Marquês de São Vicente, prédio situado na Gávea, Zona Sul do Rio de Janeiro, foi pensado pelo arquiteto Affonso Eduardo Reidy dessa forma e construído com a certeza de que atenderia a esse programa, a certeza dos idealistas. Partindo de tal constatação, realizamos uma série de visitas aos apartamentos e entrevistas com os moradores deste prédio, com objetivo de proceder a uma análise morfológica das configurações espaciais feitas por eles a fim de construirmos o discurso do senso comum para, em seguida, relacioná-lo ao projeto original, o discurso da racionalidade. Ou seja, procuramos conhecer o outro lado da história, i. e., saber como os outros - nesse caso os moradores - construíram esse espaço no seu imaginário.

40|$|Making {{recommendation}} requires predicting what is {{of interest}} to a user at a specific time. Even the same user may have different desires at different times. It is important to extract the aggregate interest of a user {{from his or her}} navigational path through the site in a session. This paper concentrates on the discovery and modelling of the user’s aggregate interest in a session. This approach relies on the <b>premise</b> that the <b>visiting</b> time of a page is an indicator of the user’s interest in that page. The proportion of times spent in a set of pages requested by the user within a single session forms the aggregate interest of that user in that session. We first partition user sessions into clusters such that only sessions which represent similar aggregate interest of users are placed in the same cluster. We employ a model-based clustering approach and partition user sessions according to similar amount of time in similar pages. In particular, we cluster sessions by learning a mixture of Poisson models using Expectation Maximization algorithm. The resulting clusters are then used to recommend pages to a user that are most likely contain the information which {{is of interest}} to that user at that time. Although the approach does not use the sequential patterns of transactions, experimental evaluation shows that the approach is quite effective in capturing a Web user’s access pattern. The model has an advantage over previous proposals in terms of speed and memory usage...|$|R

DoE personell include teachers, principles, support staff, aboriginal education workers, officers and early years liaison officers. DoE personnel conducting home visits should create a management plan that includes a risk assessment. This plan must be approved by the principle or relevant senior management staff prior to the visit. Should there be any uncertainty, DoE personnel may discuss the appropriateness of a home visit with the principle and/or relevant senior manager in the learning services. Home visits should be conducted during work hours and DoE personnel engaged in visits should keep their mobile phone switched on and remain only in the general living areas of the house. Phone contact should be made 30 minutes after expected return. DoE personnel must ensure adherence to the State Public Service code of conduct (link: [URL] and other relevant professional codes of ethics. Home based visits can assist to build rapport with families, inform an holistic assessement of educational/student welfare issues and identify the need for referral to other services. When planning a home visit with a parent or carer, DoE personnel should ascertain basic preliminary information about the meeting place. For exmaple, asking questions such as: Who will be home {{at the time of the}} visit? Do you have any pets? Will you be expecting any visitors at this time? will allow DoE personnel to evaluate the safety of the environment and the appropriateness of the scheduled time of the home visit. It is expected that DoE personnel be sensitive to available cultural background information in order to ensure home visits are mutually beneficial and respectful.
