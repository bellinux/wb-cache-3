40|$|Abstract Background In children, {{abdominal}} {{obesity is}} a better predictor {{of the presence of}} cardiovascular risk factors than body mass index (BMI) -defined obesity. We aimed to evaluate the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> abdominal <b>obesity</b> in the Greek pediatric population and {{to assess the impact of}} residence on the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> both BMI-defined and abdominal obesity. Methods In the context <b>of</b> the Childhood <b>Obesity</b> Surveillance Initiative <b>of</b> the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe, a national representative sample of 7. 0 – 7. 9 and 9. 0 – 9. 9 -year-old children was evaluated (n[*]=[*] 2, 531 and 2, 700, respectively). Overweight and obesity according to BMI were estimated using both the WHO and International Obesity Task Force cut-off points. Abdominal obesity was defined as waist circumference/height ratio > 0. 5. Results The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> abdominal <b>obesity</b> did not differ between 7 -year-old boys and girls (25. 2 and 25. 3 %, respectively; p[*]=[*]NS). Among 9 -year-old children, abdominal obesity was more prevalent in boys than in girls (33. 2 and 28. 2 %, respectively; p[*]=[*] 0. 005). Among normal weight and overweight children, the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> abdominal <b>obesity</b> was 1. 6 – 6. 8 and 21. 8 – 49. 1 %, respectively. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> abdominal and BMI-defined obesity did not differ between children living in the mainland, in Crete and in other islands except in 7 -year-old girls, where the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> BMI-defined <b>obesity</b> was highest in those living in Crete, intermediate in those living in other islands and lowest in those living in the mainland. In 9 -year-old boys and in 7 - and 9 -year-old girls, the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> abdominal <b>obesity</b> was highest in children living in Athens and lowest in children living in Thessaloniki, whereas children living in other cities and in villages showed intermediate rates. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> abdominal <b>obesity</b> in 7 -year-old boys and the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> BMI-defined <b>obesity</b> did not differ between children living in cities and villages. Conclusions The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> pediatric abdominal <b>obesity</b> in Greece is among the highest worldwide. Boys and children living in the capital are at higher risk for becoming obese. Given that abdominal obesity is more prevalent than BMI-defined obesity and appears to be more sensitive in identifying cardiovascular risk, measurement of waist circumference might have to be incorporated in the screening for childhood obesity...|$|R
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E

25|$|Diabetes and prediabetes are {{strongly}} linked to obesity and overweight. Nearly 50% {{of people with}} diabetes are obese, and 90% are overweight. 19 A chief risk factor for prediabetes is excess abdominal fat. Obesity increases one’s risk {{for a variety of}} other medical problems, including hypertension, stroke, other forms of cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and several forms of cancer. Obese individuals are at twice the risk of dying from any cause than normal-weight individuals. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> and overweight have risen to epidemic proportions in the United States, where 67% of adults are overweight and, of these, approximately half are obese.|$|E
25|$|Cardiometabolic risk among {{children}} and adolescents is fueled by the rising <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> in this age group. From 1980 to 2008, rates of obesity have increased from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2–5. During the same time period, obesity increased from 6.5% to nearly 20% among 6-11year-olds and from 5% to 18% among adolescents aged 12–19. Hypertension {{among children}} and adolescents has increased by 1% since 1999 and is estimated to affect 3.6% of those aged 3–18. This increase is attributed to the rising number of overweight and obese children. The prevalence of lipid abnormalities among {{children and adolescents}} is also tied to obesity and overweight. Approximately 14% of normal-weight youths aged 12–19 have lipid abnormalities. That figure rises to 22% of overweight youths and nearly 43% of obese youths.|$|E

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{experiments}} examined {{the influence of}} sugar-sweetened soft drinks on weight gain in children and adolescents. In one experiment, adolescents replaced sugar-sweetened soft drinks in their diet with artificially sweetened soft drinks that were sent to their homes over 25 weeks. Compared with children in a control group, children who received the artificially sweetened drinks saw a smaller increase in their BMI (by −0.14kg/m2), but this effect was only statistically significant among the heaviest children (who saw a benefit of −0.75kg/m2). In another study, an educational program encouraged schoolchildren to consume fewer soft drinks. During the school year, the <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> decreased among children in the program by 0.2%, compared to a 7.5% increase among children in the control group. Another study, published in Pediatrics in 2013, concluded that for children {{from the age of}} 2 to 5, their risk of obesity increased by 43% if they were regular soft drink consumers as opposed to those who rarely or never consumed them.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 review {{identified}} ten {{other possible}} {{contributors to the}} recent increase of obesity: (1) insufficient sleep, (2) endocrine disruptors (environmental pollutants that interfere with lipid metabolism), (3) decreased variability in ambient temperature, (4) decreased rates of smoking, because smoking suppresses appetite, (5) increased use of medications that can cause weight gain (e.g., atypical antipsychotics), (6) proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier, (7) pregnancy at a later age (which may cause susceptibility to obesity in children), (8) epigenetic risk factors passed on generationally, (9) natural selection for higher BMI, and (10) assortative mating leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors (this would [...] {{increase the number of}} obese people by increasing population variance in weight). While there is substantial evidence supporting the influence of these mechanisms on the increased <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>obesity,</b> the evidence is still inconclusive, and the authors state that these are probably less influential than the ones discussed in the previous paragraph.|$|E

2500|$|A {{cannabinoid}} receptor antagonist, also {{known simply as}} a cannabinoid antagonist or as an anticannabinoid, {{is a type of}} cannabinoidergic drug that binds to {{cannabinoid receptor}}s (CBR) and prevents their activation by endocannabinoids. They include antagonists, inverse agonists, and antibodies of CBRs. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system {{led to the development of}} CB1 receptor antagonists. The first CBR antagonist, rimonabant, was described in 1994. Rimonabant blocks the CB1 receptor selectively and has been shown to decrease food intake and regulate body-weight gain. The <b>prevalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>obesity</b> worldwide is increasing dramatically and has a great impact on public health. The lack of efficient and well-tolerated drugs to cure obesity has led to an increased interest [...] in research and development of CBR antagonists. Cannabidiol (CBD), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, is a non-competitive CB1/CB2 receptor antagonist. And Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a naturally occurring cannabinoid, modulate the effects of THC via direct blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, thus behaving like first-generation CB1 receptor inverse agonists, such as rimonabant. CBD is a very low-affinity CB1 ligand, that can nevertheless affect CB1 receptor activity in vivo in an indirect manner, while THCV is a high-affinity CB1 receptor ligand and potent antagonist in vitro and yet only occasionally produces effects in vivo resulting from CB1 receptor antagonism. THCV has also high affinity for CB2 receptors and signals as a partial agonist, differing from both CBD and rimonabant.|$|E
