2500|$|During {{the early}} 1800s, Freehold {{steadily}} grew in size. [...] The village around the courthouse was now called Freehold, {{along with the}} surrounding farmland. [...] In 1852, when long distance railroad systems were first being developed, a railroad station, with trains making regular stops, was built near the courthouse in Freehold. [...] Freehold soon had <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> {{in the village and}} in some of the outlying farmland. [...] By 1883, there was an electrical grid and a telephone switchboard, at a time when these inventions were still brand new. [...] These public advancements caused rapid economic growth in Freehold. [...] The village of Freehold became an important commercial and industrial hub in central New Jersey. [...] The farms in the rest of Freehold benefitted greatly by being able to sell their products more easily in New York and Philadelphia. [...] Both the village and the farms prospered together, however the public policies sought by the two different communities continued to grow further apart. [...] The municipal government was increasingly divided between the villagers and farmers.|$|E

50|$|An aerobic {{treatment}} system or ATS, often called (incorrectly) an aerobic septic system, {{is a small}} scale sewage treatment system similar to a septic tank system, but which uses an aerobic process for digestion rather than just the anaerobic process used in septic systems.

50|$|In many areas, {{detention}} {{tanks are}} required to be installed inside a property and are used to temporarily hold rainwater runoff during heavy rains and restrict the outlet flow to the public sewer.

5000|$|Vienna, {{located on}} the Danube River, was a major trading {{crossroads}} between east and west. As {{a result of this}} traffic, the city had suffered from episodic plague outbreaks since the first wave of [...] "Black Death" [...] in the fourteenth century. The city was crowded and densely built. Descriptions indicate that there were no <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> or drainage systems, with stinking mounds of domestic garbage littering the streets. In addition, warehouses for trade goods, which held items such as clothing, carpets, and grain for months at a time, were heavily infested with rats.

50|$|His {{social policy}} was equally vigorous. He added 24,000 {{teachers}} to the strained public school system, while having 560 schools built and establishing building administration posts to remodel many others. Increasing spending on poverty relief programs, his efforts began or completed 37,000 public housing units, while extending public running water to around {{a million people}} and <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> to 600,000 households (over 2 million people). A physician by vocation, he had clinics and hospitals built totaling 54,000 m² (580,000 ft²), while incorporating six bankrupt facilities into the provincial aegis (including the Saladillo Hospital). Severe flooding {{in the north of}} the province (the center of the nation's grain belt) in 1984 led the Governor to enact the Master Hydrostructural Plan, which built numerous needed levees and canals, while closing illegally built ones.|$|E
50|$|New York City, Washington DC, Seattle {{and other}} cities with {{combined}} systems have this problem due to a large influx of storm water after every heavy rain. Some cities have dealt with this by adding large storage tanks or ponds to hold the water until it can be treated. Chicago has a system of tunnels, collectively called the Deep Tunnel, underneath the city for storing its stormwater. In many areas detention tanks or roof detention systems are required to be installed for a property and are used to temporarily hold rainwater runoff during heavy rains and restrict the outlet flow to the public sewer. This lessens {{the risk of the}} public sewer being overburdened during a heavy rain. An overflow outlet may also be utilized which connects higher on the outlet side of the detention tank.

50|$|The {{risks from}} waste {{leachate}} {{are due to}} its high organic contaminant concentrations and high concentration of ammonia. Pathogenic microorganisms that might be present in it are often cited as the most important, but pathogenic organism counts reduce rapidly with time in the landfill, so this only applies to the freshest leachate. Toxic substances may, however, be present in variable concentrations, and their presence {{is related to the}} nature of the waste deposited. Most landfills containing organic material will produce methane, some of which dissolves in the leachate. This could, in theory, be released in poorly ventilated areas in the treatment plant. All plants in Europe must now be assessed under the EU ATEX Directive and zoned where explosion risks are identified to prevent future accidents. The most important requirement is the prevention of the discharge of dissolved methane from untreated leachate into <b>public</b> <b>sewers,</b> and most sewage treatment authorities limit the permissible discharge concentration of dissolved methane to 0.14 mg/l, or 1/10 of the lower explosive limit. This entails methane stripping from the leachate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{overview}} of the important aspects of managing and controlling industrial effluent discharges to <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> namely sampling, characterization, quantification and legislative controls has been presented. The findings have been validated {{by means of a}} case study covering three industrial sectors namely, tanning, textile finishing and food processing industries. Industrial effluents discharges were found to be best monitored by systematic and automatic sampling and quantified using water meter readings corrected for evaporative and consumptive losses. Based on the treatment processes employed in the public owned treatment works and the chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand levels obtained, the effluent from all the three industrial sectors studied were found to lie in the toxic zone. Thus, physico-chemical treatment of these effluents is required to bring them into the biodegradable zone. KL values (quoted to base e) were greater than 0. 50 day- 1 compared to 0. 39 day- 1 for typical municipality wastewater.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} {{on the production}} and management of hazardous waste by approximately 20 000 small-quantity hazardous-waste generators (SQHWGs) {{in the state of}} Florida. SQHWGs are generators that produce less than 1000 kg of hazardous waste in a calendar month. There were approximately 117 000 metric tonnes of small-quantity-generator (SQG) hazardous waste produced annually. Included in this total are over 43 000 tonnes of waste oils even though they were not regulated as a hazardous waste {{at the time of the}} survey. Approximately half of this hazardous waste is managed using the following methods: recycling, treatment, and disposal in permitted hazardous-waste-management facilities. However, large quanti-ties of this SQG hazardous waste are disposed of in sanitary landfills and discharged to <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> and these facilities are typically not designed to handle hazardous waste. These data indicate that there are potential environmental and human-health problems associated with the management of SQG hazardous waste in Florida as well as throughout the U. S. A.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} forest conservation requirements and zoning {{on the value of}} land undergoing subdivision. Land prices are increasing in the percentage of subdivision acreage developers are required to keep in forest, suggesting that forest conservation regulations increase the amounts of forested open space that developers provide. Benefits from open-space amenities remain largely internal to the subdivision, so that land market incentives mitigate the justification for open space preservation policies. Consistent with theoretical predictions that zoning promotes sprawl, we find that minimum-lot-size zoning constrains developers of closer-in subdivisions where <b>public</b> <b>sewers</b> are available. ...|$|E
