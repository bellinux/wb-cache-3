25|$|Following the Normandy {{invasion}} in June 1944, many changes to attitude occurred, prisoners {{could no longer}} be sent to France, similarly, no supplies could be received into the Islands. Both sides realised that the writing was on the wall for Germany and the Island authorities could become less subservient and more demanding in requests, such as the request for Red Cross assistance. The Germans were agreeing to more of these requests. Even Britain changed its attitude, <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> for Red Cross help being refused with Churchill, on 27 September 1944, writing a note saying: Let them starve. No fighting. They can rot at their leisure.|$|E
2500|$|Though not attacked, Bergen was threatened. On August 27, 1664, four English frigates {{entered the}} Upper New York Bay, {{demanding}} surrender {{of the fort}} at New Amsterdam, and by extension, all of New Netherland. After some days, Stuyvesant acquiesced, unable to rouse the population to a military defense. [...] The indifferent response from the West India Company to <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> for protection against “the deplorable and tragic massacres” by the natives had gone unheeded. Hence a lack of weapons, gunpowder, reinforcements and ships made New Amsterdam defenseless. Stuyvesant made {{the best of a}} bad situation and successfully negotiated good terms from his “too powerful enemies." [...] In the Articles of Capitulation, Stuyvesant and his council secured the principle of tolerance in Article VIII, which assured New Netherlanders that they “shall keep and enjoy the liberty of their consciences" [...] in religion under English rule. The capture of the city was one out of a series of attacks on Dutch colonies that resulted in the Second Anglo-Dutch War between England and the Dutch Republic. The village, which had begun construction of a block house at the town gates, was required to garrison English soldiers.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, Goodwill {{asked the}} Board of Broadcast Governors, {{which had become}} Canada's {{broadcast}} regulator nine years earlier, to remove the stipulation that it operate only in English. Like the <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> to change its operating language, it was refused.|$|E
50|$|The plaintiffs also filed {{a motion}} to {{expedite}} the hearing on the plaintiff's <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> for a preliminary injunction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Killed a man up at One Horse Gulch, last night," [...] said Bill, {{grasping}} the decanter which the attentive bar-keeper had, without <b>previous</b> <b>request,</b> placed before him.|$|R
5000|$|... stateless: {{it treats}} each request as an {{independent}} transaction, unrelated to any <b>previous</b> <b>request.</b> Stateless is just one technique; managed state and transactional systems can also be composable, but with greater difficulty.|$|R
50|$|In 424 BC, {{during the}} Peloponnesian War, Eion {{was the site}} where the Athenian {{commander}} Aristides intercepted a Persian messenger named Artaphernes. The message, which {{was on its way to}} Sparta, was a letter from the Persian king addressing <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> made to him by the Spartans.|$|E
5000|$|By resigning {{instead of}} retiring, Walker {{was unable to}} draw an army pension. He made {{statements}} {{at the time to}} the Dallas Morning News that he had [...] "refused" [...] to take his pension. However, he had made several <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> for his pension dating back to 1973. The army restored his pension rights in 1982.|$|E
5000|$|A dispute arose about Caroline Devlins' autopsy between Sussex Police and the coroner. The police {{refused to}} pay for a Home Office {{pathologist}} because they only wanted a [...] "routine" [...] examination performed. As the circumstances around her death were unexplained, the Worthing pathologist wanted a Home Office pathologist to do a more thorough examination. There existed a state of distrust between the county pathologist and the police force to do with <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> to do with deaths in unexplained circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that this}} code checks the current REMOTE_ADDR (the user's IP address) and User-agent against the REMOTE_ADDR and User-agent of the <b>previous</b> <b>request.</b> This might be {{inconvenient}} for some sites as discussed above.|$|R
50|$|In May 2008 two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> for the Chinese {{authorities}} to adequately {{respond to the}} allegations, and to explain the source of organs which would account for the sudden increase in organ transplants in China since 2000.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{implementation}} of sessions includes transmitting the SID through GET or POST variables, then this might also render the [...] "back" [...] button in most browsers unusable, as the user would then be using an older, invalid, session identifier from a <b>previous</b> <b>request.</b>|$|R
50|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 191, adopted on June 18, 1964, after reiterating its <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> of the Republic of South Africa {{and again}} condemning apartheid, the Council decided to {{establish}} a Group of Experts made up of representatives of all the then current members of the Council to study the feasibility and effectiveness of measures which could {{be taken by the}} Council under the Charter. The Council also invited the Secretary-General to establish education and training programs for South Africans abroad.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1978, a {{political}} crisis {{was overcome by}} the intervention of Aldo Moro, who proposed a new cabinet, again formed only by Christian Democratic politicians, but this time with positive confidence votes from the other parties, including the PCI. This cabinet was formed on 16 March 1978, the day on which Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the left wing terrorist group the Red Brigades. The dramatic situation which followed brought PCI to vote for Andreotti's cabinet {{for the sake of}} what was called [...] "national solidarity", despite its refusal to accept several <b>previous</b> <b>requests.</b>|$|E
50|$|ASP.NET session state {{enables you}} to store and {{retrieve}} values for a user as the user navigates ASP.NET pages in a Web application. HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that a Web server treats each HTTP request for a page as an independent request. The server retains no knowledge of variable values that were used during <b>previous</b> <b>requests.</b> ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides a way to persist variable values {{for the duration of}} that session. By default, ASP.NET session state is enabled for all ASP.NET applications.|$|E
50|$|When {{his wife}} leaves him, Barker hires a passing odd job man {{to kill him}} when he least expects it. When his wife returns he finds his <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> {{impossible}} to cancel. Also starring David Jason, Joan Sims, Derek Ware, Larry Martyn and George Waring. Written by Bernard McKenna.|$|R
5000|$|HEADERS frame. As {{its name}} implies, {{this type of}} frame carries HTTP headers [...] When sent by the browser to the server, it signals that a request is being made. When sent by the server to the browser, it signals that a {{response}} to a <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> or push promise is being sent.|$|R
30|$|It was {{predicted}} that {{in response to}} an initial request for A (mention of the hypernym), the designated items would belong to both subclasses because a preference for any one subclass is irrelevant: Children will make an inclusive use of the hypernym. In contrast, when the same <b>request</b> follows a <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> to show B, then there should be cases where children designate B’ exclusively. This is because {{in the context of a}} <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> to show one subclass (B), designating the complementary subclass (B’) is now relevant as this materialises the partition and establishes B’ on par with B, which is at the same hierarchical level: If you have asked me to show one subclass, then it is reasonable for me to expect that the next request will be to show the other subclass. These are cases of an exclusive use of the hypernym.|$|R
50|$|An {{effective}} telemarketing process {{often involves}} {{two or more}} calls. The first call (or series of calls) determines the customer’s needs. The final call (or series of calls) motivates the customer to make a purchase. Prospective customers are identified by various means, including past purchase history, <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> for information, credit limit, competition entry forms, and application forms. Names {{may also be purchased}} from another company's consumer database or obtained from a telephone directory or another public list. The qualification process is intended to determine which customers are most likely to purchase the product or service.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most of the}} servers {{that are}} used in production, WEBrick is not {{scalable}} since it is a single threaded web server by default. Hence, multiple requests at the same time cannot be handled and the subsequent requests would have to wait till all the <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> have been handled, incurring a large delay. Since WEBrick is written in an interpreted language like Ruby, it will never be as fast as a web server which is written in a compiled language. Hence, developers prefer other multi-threaded full-fledged web servers like Lighttpd and Mongrel for deploying their Rails applications.|$|E
5000|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 190, adopted on June 9, 1964, after reiterating its <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> of the Republic of South Africa, the Council {{noted with}} great concern the Rivonia Trial and urged the {{government}} to release all persons convicted or being tried for their opposition to apartheid. The Council also invited all states to exert all their influence in order to induce the Government of South Africa to comply and asked the Secretary-General to closely follow {{the implementation of the}} present resolution to report on it to the Security Council at the earliest possible date.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009 {{a request}} was {{submitted}} by the heirs of the Czernin family to Austria's culture ministry {{for the return of}} the painting. A <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> was submitted in 1960s however it was [...] "rejected {{on the grounds that the}} sale had been voluntary and the price had been adequate." [...] A 1998 restitution law which pertains to public institutions has bolstered the family's legal position.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, Lowry wrote several {{articles}} which were {{printed in the}} United States Naval Institute magazine Proceedings, including [...] "Exploits of the U-53," [...] "The Clipperton Operations" [...] and [...] "L-16: Mystery No Longer." [...] After his death in 1981, he was buried at sea per his <b>previous</b> <b>request.</b> There is currently a professorship in his honor at the Navy War College in Newport, Rhode Island.|$|R
50|$|A third {{reservation}} {{concerns the}} participation of Greater Berlin in the Federation. We interpret the effect of Articles 23 and 144 (2) of the Basic Law as constituting acceptance of our <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> that while Berlin may not be accorded voting membership in the Bundestag or Bundesrat nor be governed by the Federation she may, nevertheless, designate {{a small number of}} representatives to the meetings of those legislative bodies.|$|R

5000|$|While Xavier was {{accompanying}} {{the army and}} his two original companions sent elsewhere he was notified by Father Francesco Corsi, (1573-1635), of the declining atmosphere of religious freedom in Lahore under the [...] "intolerant attitude of the Viceroy" [...] put in place by Akbar. Immediately Father Jerome requested that the Emperor send the more experienced Father Pinheiro back to Lahore as well as issuing a farmān [...] "granting freedom of worship" [...] to the Christians. This is significant largely because Akbar had denied <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> by the missionaries to [...] "strengthen {{the position of the}} mission" [...] in more of an authoritative way within the Islamic Empire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scale of}} the project {{resulted}} in protests by the Lummi Nation and other concerned parties {{in opposition to the}} construction of the terminal. The Lummi Nation argues that the construction of the Gateway Pacific Terminal violates their treaty rights under the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliot, which under Article 5 grants signatory nations [...] "The right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations is further secured to said Indians in common with all citizens of the Territory." [...] Further, they argue the presence of the terminal could [...] "irrevocably damage religious and sacred sites, such as Cherry Point, if the coal should spill." [...] <b>Previous</b> <b>requests</b> for permits in the area, including for a proposed salmon fishery, have been rejected on similar grounds.|$|E
3000|$|... where T is {{the current}} time and T(K) {{is the time when}} the K th <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> to the {{document}} was performed being K the size of the request window. With the aim of reducing the processing time at each node, an optimization for CacheData was proposed in [15]. This enhancement proposes that the server decides which nodes in the response path have to store the document instead of leaving this decision to each node.|$|R
5000|$|... The Government of Iraq has requested, via the Foreign Military Sales program, the {{possible}} sale of 400 Stryker ICVs {{for use by}} the Iraqi National Police. The order would also include 8 heavy recovery vehicles for use with the Strykers. The Stryker was chosen over a <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> for LAV-25s. The Iraqi Army is also seeking to buy 30 Stryker vehicles. On 25 July 2013, Iraq requested the sale of 50 M1135 NBC Reconnaissance Vehicles for $900 million.|$|R
25|$|At his own <b>previous</b> <b>request,</b> Dragging Canoe was succeeded {{as leader}} of the Lower Cherokee by John Watts (Kunokeski), {{although}} The Bowl (Diwali) succeeded him as headman of Running Water, along with Bloody Fellow and Doublehead, who continued Dragging Canoe's policy of Indian unity, including an agreement with McGillivray of the Upper Muscogee to build joint blockhouses from which warriors of both tribes could operate at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers, at Running Water, and at Muscle Shoals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{state has}} an Open Meeting Law, {{enforced}} by the Attorney General, and a Public Records Law, {{enforced by the}} Secretary of the Commonwealth. [...] A 2008 report by the Better Government Association and National Freedom of Information Coalition ranked Massachusetts 43rd out of 50 states for government transparency, {{and gave it a}} failing grade of [...] "F" [...] taking into account time, cost, and comprehensiveness of access to public records. [...] Access to government records and the actions of the Secretary in enforcing the law became an issue in the 2014 campaign for the office. Incumbent William Galvin cited his <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> that the legislature revise the Public Records Law to make access easier. [...] The governor claims to be exempt from the Public Records Law.|$|E
5000|$|Gackt {{noted that}} he done a gothic theme already during his band era (Malice Mizer) and that likes edgy music with a message. However, as until now he was doing music with record label {{companies}} which pushed many regulations he could not express his originality to the extreme. From the anime production team also received an {{order to make a}} song with feeling of happy future, but as he does not consider himself a commercial writer decided to do something unexpected. The same thing regularly happened with <b>previous</b> <b>requests,</b> for example [...] "Redemption" [...] and [...] "Longing" [...] for Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII instead of ballads have also been fierce songs. He considers he is returning to be an original musician as whether the CDs success or public opinion, the musicians' essence is to compose what he likes, to perform and impress the public.|$|E
50|$|Acceso Inteligente is {{designed}} to make the process of requesting public information easier for the everyday Chilean citizen {{as well as the}} government, and make all information requests and responses public. Through Acceso Inteligente, if a person wants to request information from a Ministry in the Chilean government, they can first browse the Acceso Inteligente database and look at <b>previous</b> <b>requests</b> and responses. If they find that the information has not been previously requested, they can fill out a user-friendly form through the website. Once an individual submits an information request (protected by FOIA regulation), Acceso Inteligente automatically connects to the public agency to which the information requests are addressed. Acceso Inteligente provides documentation of the actual request, as well as information on when the request was made and when and how the government responded. The website reduces the amount of work for Ministries, since government responses are publicly available in the database.|$|E
50|$|The FA rejoined FIFA in 1946 {{and participated}} in their first World Cup in 1950. One of the first actions of the Football Association was to request the {{expulsion}} of the German and Japanese national football associations for their countries' role in World War II. Germany and Japan were prevented from qualifying for the 1950 FIFA World Cup as a consequence. They were re-acquainted with FIFA in 1950 following a second request from Switzerland who had a <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> rejected in 1948.|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} feature {{provided by}} Hypermap is that layers are cached by the Hypermap map cache, based on MapProxy, making remote map layer display fast and reliable. Significantly, this enables instant previews {{of any given}} layer during the search process. Even if a map layer tile is not {{available at the time}} it is requested, Hypermap can still return the cached tile from MapProxy, provided it has been already generated from a <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> or in case the layer has been pre-seeded when it was accessible.|$|R
30|$|Hypermap also {{includes}} a map cache engine, which caches and re-projects layers from the web map services on the fly. Caching a given layer’s tile greatly accelerates the response time for clients, assuming the tile had been previously generated from the remote service - typically by a <b>previous</b> <b>request</b> or with a layer pre-seed process. Another benefit of using a map cache engine is to support a layer re-projection operation to a different spatial reference system which is {{not supported by the}} original remote service.|$|R
