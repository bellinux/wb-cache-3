40|$|Abstract—Plunge shaving is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the <b>plunge</b> shaving <b>method,</b> the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge shaving cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge shaving cutter has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge shaving, Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, Shaving cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC shaving machine. For shaving <b>methods</b> other than <b>plunge</b> shaving, the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the shaving cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the <b>plunge</b> shaving <b>method,</b> however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. Focusing on the surface geometry of shaving cutter, what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of active profile) and EAP. (end of active profile) as shown in Fig. 1. In gear shaving, SAP. of cutter tooth shaves the gear tooth tip while EAP. shaves the gear tooth root. Traditionally, the cutter surface geometry results from a cutter re-sharpening machine by trial and error, which is very time-consuming. I...|$|R

Diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) is an important insect pest of cruciferous crops {{around the world and}} the thermal responses of polyphagous species are critical to understand the influences of a rapidly changing climate on their distribution and abundance. Experiments were carried out to the lethal temperature limits (ULT 0 and LLT 0 : temperatures where there is no survival) as well as Upper and Lower Lethal Temperature (ULT 25 and LLT 25) (temperature where 25 % DBM survived) of lab-reared adult DBM population to extreme temperatures attained by either two-way ramping (ramping temperatures from baseline to LT 25 and ramping back again) or sudden <b>plunging</b> <b>method.</b> In this study the ULT 0 for DBM was recorded as 42. 6 uC and LLT 0 was recorded as 216. 5 uC. DBM had an ULT 25 of 41. 8 uC and LLT 25 of 215. 2 uC. The duration of exposure to extreme temperatures had significant impacts on survival of DBM, with extreme temperatures and/or longer durations contributing to higher lethality. Comparing the two-way ramping temperature treatment to that of direct plunging temperature treatment, our study clearly demonstrated that DBM was more tolerant to temperature in the two-way ramping assay than that of the plunging assay for cold temperatures, but at warmer temperatures survival exhibited no differences between ramping and plunging. These results suggest that DBM will not be put under physiological stress from a rapidly changing climate, rather access t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this research, high {{efficiency}} machining tool path design of die cavities were developed using CAD/CAM and plunge roughing technology. The algorithms of cutting tool path design for ideal and non-ideal rouging area were {{proposed to improve}} the material removal rate (MRR). The proposed tool path design methods {{are based on the}} minimum numbers of rectangular or triangular patterns to cover the roughing areas. The cutting results of the traditional Z-plane and the plunge roughing were compared to show the improvement of the cutting efficiency with the proposed methods. Design of experiments (DOE) method was adopted to optimize the tool path designs and cutting conditions. Cutting experiments were carried out to verify the proposed cutting path design methods. The better material removal rate was obtained using the proposed <b>plunge</b> roughing <b>method</b> compared to the traditional Z-plane roughing. Both of the cutting simulations and the cutting experiments also showed the cutting efficiency of plunge roughing is increased with increase of cutting depth. The proposed hybrid tool path design method can further improve the cutting efficiency of plunge roughing process...|$|R

40|$|The {{aeration}} of {{the ocean}} contributes to the transfer of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide between the ocean and the atmosphere. Breaking waves are known to enhance the aeration process by increasing the turbulent mixing and entraining air bubbles. One type of breaking waves, the plunging breaker, can entrain large quantities of air bubbles to depths as large as 10 to 20 metres. The resulting increase of the air-water interface area and the increase of the gas saturation concentration with the depth induce a massive augmentation of air-water gas transfer. The aeration characteristics of plunging breakers in the deep sea are presented using a similarity with <b>plunging</b> jets. A <b>method</b> is developed to predict the sizes of the entrained bubbles, the resulting interface area, the maximum penetration depth and the air-water gas transfer.

40|$|As {{determined}} by freeze fracture electron microscopy, increasing levels of bovine brain galactosylceramide (GalCer) altered the surface structure of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers by inducing a striking "macro-ripple" {{phase in the}} larger, multilamellar lipid vesicles at GalCer mole fractions between 0. 4 and 0. 8. The term "macro-ripple" phase was used to distinguish it from the P beta' ripple phase observed in saturated, symmetric-chain length phosphatidylcholines. Whereas the P beta' ripple phase displays two types of corrugations, one with a wavelength of 12 - 15 nm {{and the other with}} a wavelength of 25 - 35 nm, the macro-ripple phase occurring in GalCer/POPC dispersions was of one type with a wavelength of 100 - 110 nm. Also, in contrast to the extended linear arrays of adjacent ripples observed in the P beta' ripple phase, the macro-ripple phase of GalCer/POPC dispersions was interrupted frequently by packing defects resulting from double dislocations and various disclinations and, thus, appeared to be continuously twisting and turning. Control experiments verified that the macro-ripple phase was not an artifact of incomplete lipid mixing or demixing during preparation. Three different methods of lipid mixing were compared: a spray method of rapid solvent evaporation, a sublimation method of solvent removal, and solvent removal using a rotary evaporation apparatus. Control experiments also revealed that the macro-ripple phase was observed regardless of whether lipid specimens were prepared by either ultra-rapid or manual <b>plunge</b> freezing <b>methods</b> as well as either in {{the presence or absence of}} the cryo-protectant glycerol. The macro-ripple phase was always observed in mixtures that were fully annealed by incubation above the main thermal transition of both POPC and bovine brain GalCer before rapid freezing. If the GalCer mixed with POPC contained only nonhydroxy acyl chains or only 2 -hydroxy acyl chains, then the occurrence of macro-ripple phase decreased dramatically...|$|R

40|$|The {{outbreak}} of East Coast fever {{in the beginning}} of the century lead to the introduction of the plunge dip system to control the disease. This approach focused on eradicating the vectors (i. e. ticks) that transmitted the disease. The successful eradication of the disease in 1954 was mainly through the intensive use of acaricides. The fundamental objectives of this study is to detennine whether there is continued justification for controlling ticks and tick-borne diseases through dipping, as well as identifying the impact of tick control to the rural household. The study was conducted in two veterinary zones located in the Venda region of the Northern Province, namely the Yellow Line and the Open area. A sample of 125 respondents was taken from livestock fanners in the selected areas within the aforementioned zones. Data was accumulated by the use of a structured questionnaire, observations, as well as discussions with fanners. III Cattle dipping is perfonned to achieve both the economic, cultural and the social role with the majority of respondents (97 %) fanning with cattle both for commercial and subsistence purposes. The value of cattle has been estimated to be Rl 152. A number of criteria have been used to estimate this value. These are the value of sales, milk, draught power and manure, and are quantified using the replacement value method. Eleven percent of the respondents expressed some dissatisfaction with the classical tick control <b>method</b> (<b>plunge</b> dip). The development of tick resistance to successive acaricide compounds is a major problem stated by 79 % of the dissatisfied fanners. As a result, most of the respondents (61 %) supplement dipping with either modem or traditional tick control measures such as hand picking. The surveys amongst rural households show a 3 % mortality rate in spite of the existence of the programme. It is estimated that the mortality rate would have been 4 % without the control programme. Cost-benefit analysis revealed a benefit-cost ratio of 0. 8 (i. e. <l) indicating that the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases by the government is not economically justified. However, because of the economic nature of the service it provides (public good), the dipping of cattle still deserves government support. In addition, the provision of tick control services by the government leads to a socially optimal level of supply. The sensitivity analysis gives the benefit-cost ratio of 1. 2 when the mortality rate is assumed to would have been 10 % without the control programme. The results of both the logistic regression model and the multivariate regression analysis revealed that the structure of production (e. g. breed of cattle kept), as well as human resource factors (e. g. educational qualification) influences the demand for tick control service and fanners' willingness-to-pay for such a service significantly. In addition, there is also a slight indication of regional differences with regard to the demand for dipping and willingness-to-pay for the service by fanners. The manner in which cattle dipping should be continued by the government, however, needs some alterations. The currently envisioned tick control strategy is based on integrated tick management system where acaricides will be strategically applied. This IV strategy will reduce the costs of tick control thereby improving the benefit-cost ratio. However, there is no easy and straightforward solution on the frequency of cattle dipping. A multi-disciplinary study needs to be conducted to ensure an optimal tick control strategy compatible with the needs of the resource poor farmers. ...|$|R
