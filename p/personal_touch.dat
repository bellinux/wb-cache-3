5|$|From Exile onward, the {{characters}} of Myst were generally praised in each release. The live-action characters in the pre-rendered Myst titles were favorably received; Greg Kasavin of GameSpot said that the series' use of real actors and full-motion video endeared {{the characters}} to the player, giving the games a distinctively <b>personal</b> <b>touch.</b> Fellow Gamespot reviewer Scott Osborne stated the actors delivered convincing performances, and were smoothly incorporated into the game's scenes.

After the 1511 earthquake, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style following Italian, particularly Venetian, models. After the quake in 1895, it was once again rebuilt, this time in the Vienna Secession style, which today is juxtaposed against the earlier Baroque style buildings that remain. Large sectors built in the inter-war period often include a <b>personal</b> <b>touch</b> by the architects Jože Plečnik and Ivan Vurnik.

25|$|During the war, {{the palace}} became {{the home in}} exile {{of a number of}} royals {{displaced}} by the invasions of their respective countries back in Europe.

25|$|The 18th {{century was}} a time of {{enlightenment}} progression occurring in all intellectual fields. However, the English language was deteriorating into a tangled mess. A group of London booksellers commissioned well-known essayist Samuel Johnson to compile a set of rules governing the English Language. After nine years and the help of six assistants the first edition of A Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755. Johnson's great knowledge of letters, words and literature brought uniqueness to his dictionary. Each word defined in detail, with descriptions of their various uses and numerous literary quotes as illustrations. This was the first dictionary of its kind, containing 40,000 words and nearly 114,000 quotes packed together with Johnson's <b>personal</b> <b>touch.</b> A warm reception greeted Johnson's Dictionary as it was the first dictionary that could be read with pleasure. The definitions full of wit and depth of thought supported by passages from beloved poets and philosophers, which a reader could be content spending an evening poring over its pages. Johnson's choice of structure and format has certainly shaped future English dictionaries and lexicons and the role they play in language development.|$|E
