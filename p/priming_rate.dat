40|$|A fluorescence-based, T 7 (Sequenase) dye {{terminator}} {{method for}} sequencing double-stranded DNA using strings of three contiguous hexamers as primers and single-stranded binding protein is described. In this method, the circular, supercoiled DNA vector pUC 19 is first linearized with a restriction enzyme {{to create a}} sequenceable template. Sequencing is then accomplished using three cycles of 'denaturation,' annealing, and extension/termination. Twenty-two of 33 hexamer strings tested in a controlled study produced acceptable sequence, with read lengths varying from the mid 300 s to the low 400 s and a base-calling accuracy of at least 97 %. To test its potential utility in directed DNA sequencing, the protocol was then used to completely sequence both strands of pUC 19. For this test project, a total of 28 hexamer strings was used with an overall successful <b>priming</b> <b>rate</b> of 75 %. The current protocol appears to be sufficiently robust {{to be used in}} the finishing phase of a shotgun sequencing project and is amenable to semiautomation. Prospects for using the protocol for full-scale directed sequencing as well as for full automation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|To study CD 4 + T cell {{productivity}} during HIV- 1 infection, CD 4 + T cell telomere lengths were measured. Cross-sectional and {{longitudinal analysis}} of HIV- 1 -infected individuals with CD 4 + T cells counts > 300 cells/mm 3 showed normal average telomeric restriction fragment (TRF) length and normal shortening rates of CD 45 RA+ naive and CD 45 RO+ memory CD 4 + T cells. These TRF data were interpreted {{in terms of}} CD 4 + T cell production {{by means of a}} mathematical model. This model resolves previous criticisms arguing that the normal TRF length of CD 4 + T cells in HIV- 1 clinical latency is due to the killing of dividing CD 4 + T cells by the virus. Only an increased <b>priming</b> <b>rate</b> of naive CD 4 + T cells to become memory cells may elongate the average TRF length of memory CD 4 + T cells, and may therefore mask the shortening effect of increased turnover in the CD 4 + memory T cell compartment. The data are more compatible with the notion that during HIV- 1 clinical latency the turnover of CD 4 + T cells is not markedly increased, however, and that HIV-related interference with renewal from progenitors plays a role in CD 4 + T cell depletion. In such a "limited renewal" scenario disease progression is no longer a consequence of markedly increased CD 4 + T cell productio...|$|E
40|$|Following {{migration}} {{into the}} intestinal mucosa in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), neutrophils enter the intestinal lumen and are excreted. This provides a basis for quantification of disease activity by measuring excreted label following injection of In‐ 111 ‐labeled neutrophils. In severe pan‐colitis, 50 % of the injected In‐ 111 is typically recovered in the feces, indicating that 50 % of neutrophil turnover is via fecal excretion. Neutrophils have an intravascular lifespan of ~ 10 h and a distribution volume of ~ 10 L, so total body neutrophil turnover is 10. N/ 10 cells/h, where N is the peripheral blood neutrophil count (cells/L). Neutrophil loss via the colon in a patient with 50 % fecal In‐ 111 loss is therefore N/ 120 cells/min. Pan‐colonic mucosal‐blood flow in pan‐colitis is 200 mL/min, which would deliver N/ 5 neutrophils to the colon per min. Therefore, 5 / 120, or 4 %, of incoming neutrophils undergo migration into inflamed bowel. If the 96 % of nonmigrating cells exit in a primed state, then at steady state > 90 % of circulating neutrophils would be primed if no depriming took place. As {{the highest level of}} priming seen in IBD is ~ 40 %, this indicates that depriming within the circulation must take place. Using the above values in the steady state equation relating <b>priming</b> <b>rate</b> to depriming rate plus primed‐cell destruction rate gives a mean depriming time of 35 min. We conclude that a very small proportion of neutrophils entering a site of inflammation migrate and that in vivo depriming must take place to limit the numbers of primed neutrophils in the circulation.

40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} the {{influences}} of aging and AD on lexical-semantics by assigning a semantic priming paradigm. The following participants {{are included in the}} study: 30 young students, 22 early elderly, 19 late elderly, and 14 AD patients. The participants are asked to perform lexical decision tasks. Targets are high-frequency concrete words or nonwords. The primes are controlled with regard to their semantic relevance to the targets as follows: Association (e. g., king - lion), Superordination (beast - lion), Coordination (tiger - lion), Shared feature (eyes - lion), Distinctive feature (mane - lion), or Neutral (XXXX – lion). The participants have to decide whether the stimulus is a real word or not as correctly and as quickly as possible when the targets appeared on a monitor. As the Results, the mean reaction times (RTs) of the elderly groups are significantly longer than those of the young group, and the RTs of the AD group are even longer than those of the elderly groups. In the young and the elderly groups, the RTs for all the related-prime conditions are significantly shorter than those for the neutral-prime conditions (priming effects). The priming effects appears to be greater in the elderly groups. However, when the RTs are taken into consideration (priming rates), the gains are equivalent among young and elderly groups. In the AD group, priming effects are not observed, and noticeable individual differences in the <b>priming</b> <b>rate</b> are seen. The above findings suggest that lexical-semantics are generally preserved from aging. We also discusses that lexical-semantics are impaired in AD, and the diversity of the impairments may be the essence of AD...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the flow of}} carbon into different groups of soil microorganisms isolated from different particle size fractions. Two agricultural sites of contrasting organic matter input were compared. Both soils had been submitted to vegetation change from C 3 (Rye/Wheat) to C 4 (Maize) plants, 25 and 45 years ago. Soil carbon was separated into one fast-degrading particulate organic matter fraction (POM) and one slow-degrading organo-mineral fraction (OMF). The structure of the soil microbial community were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), and turnover of single PLFAs was calculated from the changes in their C- 13 content. Soil enzyme activities involved in the degradation of carbohydrates was determined using fluorogenic MUF (methyl-umbelliferryl phosphate) substrates. We found that fresh organic matter input drives soil organic matter dynamic. Higher annual input of fresh organic matter resulted in a higher amount of fungal biomass in the POM-fraction and shorter mean residence times. Fungal activity therefore seems essential for the decomposition and incorporation of organic matter input into the soil. As a consequence, limited litter input changed especially the fungal community favoring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Altogether, supply and availability of fresh plant carbon changed the distribution of microbial biomass, the microbial community structure and enzyme activities and resulted in different priming of soil organic matter. Most interestingly we found that only at low input the OMF fraction had significantly higher calculated MRT for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria suggesting high recycling of soil carbon {{or the use of}} other carbon sources. But on average all microbial groups had nearly similar carbon uptake rates in all fractions and both soils, which contrasted the turnover times of bulk carbon. Hereby the microbial carbon turnover was always faster than the soil organic carbon turnover and higher carbon input reduced the carbon storage efficiency from 51 % in the low input to 20 %. These findings suggest that microbial community preferentially assimilated fresh carbon sources but also used recycled existing soil carbon. However, the <b>priming</b> <b>rate</b> was drastically reduced under carbon limitation. In consequence at high carbon availability more carbon was respired to activate the existing soil carbon (priming) whereas at low carbon availability new soil carbon was formed at higher efficiencies.

40|$|This article {{tests for}} {{asymmetry}} in thebehavior of bank lending rates by testing {{the hypothesis that}} the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> responds more fully and quickly to increase than decreases in market interest rates. The econometric methodology used is better suited to the discreteness and rigidity of the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> than that of previous studies. Our results suggest that banks adjust the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> asymmetrically in response to change in the discount rate, the commercial paper rate, and the spread between the prime and commercial paper rates. Asymmetry in bank lending rates is implied by several explanations for the preference among small firms for internal finance. Asymmetry in bank lending rates may result from the fact that individual banks have acquired costly information which prevents their customers from responding quickly to changes in loan terms, or it may stem from a cyclical "lemons" premium resulting from informational asymmetries [Oliner and Rudebusch (1992) ]. Either way, asymmetric behavior of bank lending rates, such as the <b>prime</b> <b>rate,</b> may be part of a more complete explanation of small firms' preference for internal finance.

For example, a rate given as 9.99% plus the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> will be 16.99% when the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> is 7.00% (such as the end of 2005). These rates usually also have contractual minimums and maximums to protect the consumer (or the bank, as it may be) from wild fluctuations of the <b>prime</b> <b>rate.</b> While these accounts are harder to budget for, they can theoretically be a little less expensive since the bank does not have to accept the risk of fluctuation of the market (since the <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> follows inflation rates, which affect the profitability of loans).

40|$|A voluminous {{literature}} {{attempts to}} explain the various channels of the {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} through which central banks ultimately achieve price stability. However, most research focuses on interest rate pass-through and the demand for money phase, while there is limited research on the demand for credit. This study endeavours to contribute to the understanding of this neglected phase of monetary policy transmission by exploring the response of the real demand for bank credit by the private sector to changes in the real <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> from 1990 : 1 to 2004 : 4 in South Africa. Firstly, the behaviour of the real <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> in relation to the repo rate is explored using graphical analysis. The study observes that an increase in the repo rate causes an increase in the real <b>prime</b> <b>rate,</b> such that there is always a margin of three or four percentage points between the two rates. Secondly, using secondary data, the Johansen methodology is used to determine the relationship between the demand for bank credit and its determinants (GDP, inflation, real <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> and real yield on government bonds). Two co-integrating relationships are found. The Gaussian errors from one co-integrating vector are used to model the Vector Error Correction Model, which provides the short-run dynamics and the long-run results, through the use of Eviews 5 software. The results of the study show that while all other variables are negatively related to the demand for bank credit in the long-run, GDP has a positive influence. In the short-run, yield on government bonds and inflation coefficients depict a positive association, while the coefficients of real <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> and GDP are negative. The error correction coefficient is - 0. 32, which implies that a 32 % adjustment to equilibrium happens in the demand for bank credit in a quarter and that the complete adjustment takes about three quarters to complete. Thirdly, the generalised impulse responses results indicate that the impact on the real <b>prime</b> <b>rate</b> affects the demand for bank credit from the first quarter.
