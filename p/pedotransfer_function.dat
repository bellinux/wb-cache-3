40|$|SUMMARY: Pedotransfer {{functions}} are classes of models {{used to estimate}} soil water holding characteristics based on commonly measured soil composition data {{as well as other}} soil characteristics. These models are important on their own but are particularly useful in modelling agricultural crop yields across a region where only soil composition is known. In this paper, an additive, multivariate spatial process model is introduced that offers the flexibility to capture the complex structure typical of the relationship between soil compo-sition and water holding characteristics. A new form of <b>pedotransfer</b> <b>function</b> is developed that models the entire soil water profile. Further, the uncertainty in the soil water charac-teristics is quantified in a manner to simulate ensembles of soil water profiles. Using this capability, a small study is conducted with the CERES maize crop model to examine the sources of variation in the yields of maize. Here it is shown that the interannual variability of weather is a more significant source of variation in crop yield than the uncertainty in the <b>pedotransfer</b> <b>function</b> for specific soil textures...|$|E

To overcome these oversights <b>pedotransfer</b> <b>functions</b> are applied using other known soil properties to estimate bulk density. <b>Pedotransfer</b> <b>functions</b> have been derived from large international data sets across many studies, with their own inherent biases, many ignoring horizonation and depth variances. Initially <b>pedotransfer</b> <b>functions</b> from the literature were used to predict different horizon type bulk densities using local known bulk density data sets.

The predicted co-efficient of determination was 0. 5 or greater in 12 of the 17 horizon types studied.
