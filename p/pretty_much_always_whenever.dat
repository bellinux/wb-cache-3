I argue for this conclusion {{on a number of}} grounds, but primarily {{on the grounds that the}} projection postulate fails correctly to account for repeated, continuous and unsharp measurements (all of which are standard in contemporary physics) and that the eigenvalue-eigenvector link implies that virtually all interesting properties are maximally indefinite <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>always.</b> I present an alternative way of conceptualising quantum mechanics that does a better job of representing quantum mechanics as it is actually used, and in particular that eliminates use of either the projection postulate or the eigenvalue-eigenvector link, and I reformulate the measurement problem within this new presentation of orthodoxy.

40|$|Heuristic {{approaches}} {{often do}} so well {{that they seem to}} <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>always</b> give the right answer. How close can heuristic algorithms get to always giving the right answer, without inducing seismic complexity-theoretic consequences? This article first discusses how a series of results by Berman, Buhrman, Hartmanis, Homer, Longpré, Ogiwara, Schöening, and Watanabe, from the early 1970 s through the early 1990 s, explicitly or implicitly limited how well heuristic algorithms can do on NP-hard problems. In particular, many desirable levels of heuristic success cannot be obtained unless severe, highly unlikely complexity class collapses occur. Second, we survey work initiated by Goldreich and Wigderson, who showed how under plausible assumptions deterministic heuristics for randomized computation can achieve a very high frequency of correctness. Finally, we consider formal ways in which theory can help explain the effectiveness of heuristics that solve NP-hard problems in practice.

Anna Johns from AOL's TV Squad felt Ana Lucia is [...] "abrasive and lacking common sense or civility". C. K.

5000|$|Yu asks [...] "Has the DJMag list {{transformed}} into a popularity contest or is it still a resemblance of the DJs talent?". The list has also been criticized for not including a more balanced reflection of artists from other Electronic dance music styles and showing rankings based on less commercial mainstream DJs. A feature in The Guardian in 2010 by the journalist Ben Child entitled [...] "What does DJ Mag's top 100 poll tell us about UK dance music? Not much" [...] explores this further, noting that What's surprising, at least {{to those of us}} who don't enjoy the more mainstream genres, is the paucity of artists from outside the house and trance scenes in the top 100. This has <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>always</b> been the case, with the odd Drum 'N' Bass or Breakbeat acts occasionally making it into the lower reaches in years gone by, but this year's situation is particularly extreme. There is just one artist Andy C whose music is not based on the standard four-to-the-floor beat pattern adopted by mainstream dance music in the top 100 - and he has been around for more than a decade and a half.As the poll is publicly voted, DJ Mag have no direct input into which DJs are featured.|$|R

5000|$|They {{also spoke}} about the {{creative}} process behind the album, saying: [...] "We all get predictable sometimes, and I wanted to show real artistry and take creative risk and just do different shit with this album. I think I did it with the song “More;” I think I did it with “Industry.” “Rise” is a song I also think people wouldn’t expect from me, so there’s definitely some songs on it they wouldn’t expect. The approach on this was different because Mega actually {{had a lot to}} do with the production. I was kind of giving him basic ideas; that’s how I start anyway. I start to format it a certain way and then as we start to build it I add on to it. The process was definitely outside of anything I’ve ever done before. I’m <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>always</b> control. Mega got a few of the sounds, like on the “Industry” song with the Lauryn Hill ad-lib. Mega put a lot into that kind of stuff. It’s a challenge work with one producer for a whole album. But, it’s Large Professor; he’s one of the greatest producers that’s ever existed. It’s not debatable. So when you get an opportunity with someone like that, you do it. He was gonna make me do things different than how I would normally do it. But I was welcome to the challenge, and I’m glad I did it." ...|$|R

50|$|When {{the club}} was formed as the Lions in 1994, they {{decided to use the}} jumpers worn by Fitzroy Football Club in the AFL. This was for two reasons: firstly the colours more or less matched those of Farum BK, the local soccer club, and it was {{believed}} that that might have gotten them some financial help from the club later, and secondly, the Fitzroy jumpers had the lettering FFC on the front, matching the name Farum Football Club.Later, newer Lions jumpers were used, and these had a lion on the front, with the name Farum underneath. In 2002 Farum Cats changed their moniker from Lions to Cats, and got a shipment of jumpers from Geelong Cats. They were greyish silver with the GFC shield of the Geelong Football Club on Farum Cats lungs and on the stomach. These were used during Farum's greatest reign in the DAFL, Cats when they won back-to-back-to-back premierships. At the time, the club also used {{a modified version of the}} GFC shield, spelling out FFC instead. In the 2008 season, the team sold the old jumpers to the players, and started using a new shipment of jumpers from Geelong. These were mainly large to extra large-sized jumpers, with long sleeves in the 2006-07 style Cats clash jumper. Many of the players did not, however, like these jumpers, as sleeveless jumpers were preferred by many, and the few sleeveless jumpers were <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>always</b> used. These were older, homestyle Cats jumpers from Fila while the others were of the brand Slazenger.In the 2010 final series the team started using their new original Farum Cats jumpers, after wearing different Geelong Cats jumpers since 2002. Their kit is mainly dark blue, with two thick white hoops, and the old FFC shield on the front, with the new one on the upper left, and the old (then current) DAFL shield on the upper right. The only cooperate name visible is Sekem, the manufacturer.|$|R
