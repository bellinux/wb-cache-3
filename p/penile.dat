5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} <b>penile</b> cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female sexual partners of heterosexual men. <b>Penile</b> cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal <b>penile</b> nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so <b>penile</b> nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|The {{glans penis}} is rounded, short, and small and is superficially divided into {{left and right}} halves by a trough {{at the top and}} a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with <b>penile</b> spines, except for an area near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and <b>penile</b> cancer. Genital warts and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make <b>penile</b> hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The fossa {{has several}} scent glands, {{although}} the glands are less developed in females. Like herpestids {{it has a}} perianal skin gland inside an anal sac which surrounds the anus like a pocket. The pocket opens to the exterior with a horizontal slit below the tail. Other glands are located near the penis or vagina, with the <b>penile</b> glands emitting a strong odor. Like the herpestids, it has no prescrotal glands.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} alleges than in Nakuru forty five {{cases of}} sexual violence were reported including rapes, forced male circumcisions and <b>penile</b> amputation. Rapes were also reported in Naivasha, as were forced circumcisions of Luo men. One witness claims that Naivasha's men {{were forced to}} remove their underwear to confirm their ethnicity and forcibly circumcised if their uncircumcised penis identified them as Luo.|$|E
5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is <b>penile</b> vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or inflatable tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding <b>penile</b> tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with <b>penile</b> spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E
5|$|The thin corpus spongiosum of {{the penis}} {{runs along the}} {{underside}} of the <b>penile</b> shaft, enveloping the urethra, and expands at the end to form the glans. It partially contributes to erection, which are primarily caused by the two corpora cavernosa that comprise the bulk of the shaft; like the female cavernosa, the male cavernosa soak up blood and become erect when sexually excited. The male corpora cavernosa taper off internally on reaching the spongiosum head. With regard to the Y-shape of the cavernosa– crown, body, and legs– the body accounts for much more of the structure in men, and the legs are stubbier; typically, the cavernosa are longer and thicker in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which the subject is unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and shoes. In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the <b>penile</b> tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) {{leaves his}} trailer for work, as he {{approaches}} a bear growling outside. He wants {{to move back to}} Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, but Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) insists that they must go forward in life. Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into the emergency room, and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a <b>penile</b> prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) wants to ask the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for a job as an attending surgeon, but is nervous that he will reject her, and goes out to lunch with her girlfriend Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw).|$|E
5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat {{over the course of}} a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing <b>penile</b> spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the glans or the entire <b>penile</b> structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
25|$|To treat erectile {{dysfunction}} or in <b>penile</b> rehabilitation following surgery (PGE1 as alprostadil).|$|E
25|$|Counterintuitively, <b>penile</b> erections {{during sleep}} are not more {{frequent}} during sexual dreams than during other dreams. The {{parasympathetic nervous system}} experiences increased activity during REM sleep which may cause erection of the penis or clitoris. In males, 80% to 95% of REM sleep is normally accompanied by partial to full <b>penile</b> erection, while only about 12% of men's dreams contain sexual content.|$|E
25|$|In males, Gardasil {{may reduce}} {{their risk of}} genital warts and precancerous lesions caused by HPV. This {{reduction}} in precancerous lesions might be predicted to reduce the rates of <b>penile</b> and anal cancer in men. Since <b>penile</b> and anal cancers are much less common than cervical cancer, HPV vaccination of young men {{is likely to be}} much less cost-effective than for young women.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{study has been}} {{performed}} showing that ketoconazole {{may be useful in}} temporarily reducing erectile function in postoperative <b>penile</b> surgery patients.|$|E
25|$|On medical circumcisions {{performed}} by surgeons, the epithelium is removed {{along with the}} foreskin, to prevent post operative <b>penile</b> adhesion and its complications.|$|E
25|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{recently}} {{addressed the}} procedures required before a supervised release program could include <b>penile</b> plethysmograph testing.|$|E
25|$|Gardasil is in {{particular}} demand among {{men who have}} sex with men, who are at higher risk for genital warts, <b>penile</b> cancer, and anal cancer.|$|E
25|$|HPV (Human Papillomavirus)—skin and mucosal contact. 'High risk' {{types of}} HPV cause almost all {{cervical}} cancers, {{as well as}} some anal, <b>penile,</b> and vulvar cancer. Some other types of HPV cause genital warts.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{can have}} {{enthesitis}} presenting as heel pain, Achilles tendinitis or plantar fasciitis, along with balanitis circinata (circinate balanitis), which involves <b>penile</b> lesions present in roughly 20 to 40 {{percent of the}} men with the disease.|$|E
25|$|Previously, it was erroneously {{thought that}} {{individuals}} with PAIS were always infertile; at least one case report has been published that describes fertile men that fit the criteria for grade 2 PAIS (micropenis, <b>penile</b> hypospadias, and gynecomastia).|$|E
25|$|The {{report and}} {{subsequent}} book about Reimer influenced several medical practices, reputations, and even current {{understanding of the}} biology of gender. The case accelerated the decline of sex reassignment and surgery for unambiguous XY infants with micropenis, various other rare congenital malformations, or <b>penile</b> loss in infancy.|$|E
25|$|Seminal vesiculitis (also {{known as}} spermatocystitis) is an {{inflammation}} of the seminal vesicles, most often caused by bacterial infection. Symptoms of seminal vesiculitis can include vague back or lower abdominal pain; <b>penile,</b> scrotal, or perineal pain; painful ejaculation; hematospermia; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there are}} a number of {{variations}} and adoptions of the missionary position, the classic missionary position involves a man and a woman, with the woman lying on her back and the man on top. Variations in the positions may vary the angle and depth of <b>penile</b> penetration.|$|E
25|$|Studying human {{sexual arousal}} has proved a {{fruitful}} {{way of understanding}} how men and women differ as genders {{and in terms of}} sexual orientation. A clinical measurement may use <b>penile</b> or vaginal photoplethysmography, where genital engorgement with blood is measured in response to exposure to different erotic material.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} known as saline microscopy. This is the most {{commonly}} used method and requires an endocervical, vaginal, or <b>penile</b> swab specimen for examination under a microscope. The presence of one or multiple trichomonads constitutes a positive result. This method is cheap but has a low sensitivity (60-70%) often due to an inadequate sample, resulting in false negatives.|$|E
25|$|The male fox's scrotum is held {{up close}} to the body with the testes inside even after they descend. Like other canines, the male fox has a baculum, or <b>penile</b> bone. The testes of red foxes are smaller than those of Arctic foxes. Sperm {{formation}} in red foxes begins in August–September, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in December–February.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{prostate}} was first described by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in 1536, {{and illustrated by}} Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853. Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction. Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Surgical removal of the testes (orchiectomy) to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, but with limited success. Transurethral resection of {{the prostate}} (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction {{in the middle of}} the 20th century because it could better preserve <b>penile</b> erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh. This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of <b>penile</b> function.|$|E
25|$|Sperm {{competition}} theory: Testosterone {{levels are}} shown {{to increase as}} a response to previously neutral stimuli when conditioned to become sexual in male rats. This reaction engages <b>penile</b> reflexes (such as erection and ejaculation) that aid in sperm competition when more than one male is present in mating encounters, allowing for more production of successful sperm and a higher chance of reproduction.|$|E
25|$|According to Gordon G. Gallup, {{as a form}} of {{adapting}} to multiple mating in females, human <b>penile</b> shape is indicative of an evolutionary history of polyandry. Male humans evolved to have a wedge- or spoon-shaped glans and to perform repeated thrusting motions during copulation in order to draw foreign semen back away from the cervix and thus to compete with sperm of other males.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of puberty, {{androgen}} levels increase dramatically in males, and androgens mediate the development of masculine secondary sexual characteristics {{as well as the}} activation of spermatogenesis and fertility and masculine behavioral changes such as gynephilia and increased sex drive. Masculine secondary sexual characteristics include androgenic hair, voice deepening, emergence of the Adam's apple, broadening of the shoulders, increased muscle mass, and <b>penile</b> growth.|$|E
25|$|Genital warts {{may occur}} singly but {{are more often}} found in clusters. They may be found {{anywhere}} in the anal or genital area, and are frequently found on external surfaces of the body, including the <b>penile</b> shaft, scrotum, or labia majora of the vagina. They can also occur on internal surfaces like the opening to the urethra, inside the vagina, on the cervix, or in the anus.|$|E
