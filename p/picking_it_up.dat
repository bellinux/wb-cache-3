5|$|Massive Dynamic {{executive}} Mark Young (Ptolemy Slocum) {{delivers a}} {{presentation at the}} company’s Manhattan office. When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing {{to go out to}} dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) watching them, which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E

25|$|The ball can {{be kicked}} in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of kicks used; the punt, drop kick and place kick. To punt the ball the player must kick the ball before it touches the ground. A drop kick occurs if the ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place kick the ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player kicks the ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player kicks the ball along the ground instead of diving on it or <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

[...] However, he died before he could take up the position. [...] On September 4, 1861 Briggs was getting an overcoat out of his closet {{at his home in}} Pittsfield, when a gun fell. [...] As Briggs was <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> the gun discharged and Briggs was shot. [...] Briggs died early in the morning of September 12, 1861, and was buried in the Pittsfield Cemetery.|$|E

500|$|The series had {{originated}} from a production deal between Syfy and CBS Paramount Network Television. Thomas Vitale, the {{senior vice president}} of programming and original movies for Syfy, described the partnership as a way to add more [...] "genre programming to our schedule". It was one of three series UPN ordered as mid-season replacements during the 2000-2001 television season; the others were Chains of Love and Special Unit 2. The network had requested six episodes of All Souls when <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for air, and all of them had been shot before its cancellation. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's John Levesque felt that the network decided to produce All Souls in an attempt to find another successful series following the end of [...] While Levesque thought the shows were [...] "promising," [...] he did not believe any of them were a [...] "slam-dunk".|$|E
500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At such moments, he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E

These include riding in Christopher Robin's umbrella to rescue Piglet from a flood, discovering [...] "the North Pole" [...] by <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to help fish Roo out of the river, inventing the game of Poohsticks, and getting Eeyore out of the river by dropping a large rock on one side of him to wash him towards the bank.|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese macaque {{is a very}} {{intelligent}} species. Researchers studying this species at Koshima Island in Japan left sweet potatoes out on the beach for them to eat, then witnessed one female, named Imo (Japanese for yam or potato), washing the food off with river water rather than brushing it off as the others were doing, and later even dipping her clean food into salty sea water. After a while, others started to copy her behavior. This trait was then passed on from generation to generation, until eventually all except the oldest members of the troop were washing their food and even seasoning it in the sea. She was similarly the first observed balling up wheat with air pockets, throwing it into the water, and {{waiting for it to}} float back up before <b>picking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and eating it free from soil.
