Proposed reforms include a plan to replace the College of Cardinals as the electoral body with the Synod of Bishops, which includes many more members. Under <b>present</b> <b>procedure,</b> however, the Synod may only meet when called by the pope. Universi Dominici gregis explicitly provides that even if a synod or an ecumenical council is in session {{at the time of}} a pope's death, it may not perform the election.

6000|$|But I {{forget that}} I am expatiating {{on a subject}} wherein I have no concern, having neither a talent nor an {{inclination}} for satire. On the other side, I am so entirely satisfied with the whole <b>present</b> <b>procedure</b> of human things, that I have been for some years preparing material towards [...] "A Panegyric upon the World;" [...] to which I intended to add a second part, entitled [...] "A Modest Defence of the Proceedings of the Rabble in all Ages." [...] Both these I had thoughts to publish by way of appendix to the following treatise; but finding my common- place book fill much slower than I had reason to expect, I have chosen to defer them to another occasion. Besides, I have been unhappily prevented in that design by a certain domestic misfortune, in the particulars whereof, though {{it would be very}} seasonable, and much in the modern way, to inform the gentle reader, and would also be of great assistance towards extending this preface into the size now in vogue--which by rule ought to be large in proportion as the subsequent volume is small--yet I shall now dismiss our impatient reader from any further attendance at the porch; and having duly prepared his mind by a preliminary discourse, shall gladly introduce him to the sublime mysteries that ensue.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of these various pressures, and {{following}} a 15 January 1946 report of the Military Government decrying the efficiency of denazification, saying, [...] "The <b>present</b> <b>procedure</b> fails in practice to reach a substantial number of persons who supported or assisted the Nazis", it was decided to involve Germans in the process. In March 1946 the Law for Liberation from National Socialism and Militarism (link=no) came into effect, turning over responsibility for denazification to the Germans. Each zone had a Minister of Denazification. On 1 April 1946, a special law established 545 civilian tribunals under German administration (link=no), with a staff of 22,000 of mostly lay judges, enough, perhaps, to start to work but too many for all the staff themselves to be thoroughly investigated and cleared. They had a case load of 900,000. Several new regulations came into effect in the setting up of the German-run tribunals, including the idea that the aim of denazification was now rehabilitation rather than merely punishment, and that someone whose guilt might meet the formal criteria could also have their specific actions taken into consideration for mitigation. Efficiency thus improved, while rigor declined.|$|E
5000|$|The {{investigation}} highlighted {{that although}} the aircraft had been certified as airworthy, the [...] "procedure for issue of certificate of airworthiness is inadequate and weak to ensure that aircraft is maintained in accordance with Technical Literature", effectively putting into doubt that the aircraft was airworthy. The investigation added, that the last review of the aircraft for renewing certificate of airworthiness was done by an engineer with avionics background only. The investigation commission added pressure stating: [...] "It is {{the opinion of the}} inquiry committee that <b>present</b> <b>procedure</b> of C of A cannot ensure that aircraft is maintained in accordance with Technical Literature and there is no Service Bulletin or Mandatory Airworthiness Directive (AD) outstanding. The inspection by Airworthiness for renewal of C of A is also a weak area." [...] The investigation highlighted that for example the right engine's feathering motor was found in a poor condition of maintenance with wrongly fitted bearing and worn out armature, PIA's engineering did not possess diagrams of the CVR and DFDR for maintenance, the engine oil condition had not been monitored by any Spectrometric Oil Analysis Program and the oil was extremely dirty.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{procedure for}} recovering from image analysis the three dimensional nonsymmetric fiber-orientation distribution in short-fiber composites is proposed. Microphotographs from two orthogonal faces of a composite sample {{are needed to}} determine the three dimensional fiber orientation. A simple weighting function is derived {{to take into account}} the probability of intercepting fibers at varying inclination angles. The <b>present</b> <b>procedure</b> improves the previous works of other researchers in the following two aspects. First, it can obtain the single-angle fiber-orientation distribution from one micrograph in reference to the normal of the photographed surface. This distribution is often needed in predicting the mechanical and physical properties of short-fiber composites in this direction. Second, no symmetry in fiber-orientation distribution is assumed in the determination of the three dimensional fiber-orientation, which makes the <b>present</b> <b>procedure</b> more practical and versatile...|$|E
