50|$|The basic gain {{stage for}} a valve {{amplifier}} is the auto-biased common cathode stage, in which an anode resistor, the valve, and a cathode resistor form a <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> across the supply rails. The resistance of the valve varies {{as a function of}} the voltage on the grid, relative to the voltage on the cathode.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} circuit for {{the voltage}} reference is a resistor <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> connected between the voltage rails.

50|$|There {{are three}} primary types of {{potential}} transformers (PT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical. The electromagnetic potential transformer is a wire-wound transformer. The {{capacitor voltage transformer}} (CVT) uses a capacitance <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> and is used at higher voltages due to a lower cost than an electromagnetic PT.

An optical voltage transformer exploits the electrical properties of optical materials. Measurement of high voltages is possible by the potential transformers.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{advantages}} of the <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> compared to a variable resistor in series with the source is that, while variable resistors have a maximum resistance where some current will always flow, dividers are able to vary the output voltage from maximum (...) to ground (zero volts) as the wiper moves {{from one end of the}} potentiometer to the other. There is, however, always a small amount of contact resistance.|$|E
5000|$|In electronics, {{a voltage}} divider [...] (also {{known as a}} <b>potential</b> <b>divider)</b> is a passive linear circuit that {{produces}} an output voltage (Vout) that is a fraction of its input voltage (Vin). Voltage division {{is the result of}} distributing the input voltage among the components of the divider. A simple example of a voltage divider is two resistors connected in series, with the input voltage applied across the resistor pair and the output voltage emerging from the connection between them.|$|E
50|$|For output {{voltages}} {{not provided}} by standard fixed regulators and load currents {{of less than}} 7 A, commonly available adjustable three-terminal linear regulators may be used. The LM317 series (+1.25 V) regulates positive voltages while the LM337 series (−1.25 V) regulates negative voltages. The adjustment is performed by constructing a <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> with its ends between the regulator output and ground, and its centre-tap connected to the 'adjust' terminal of the regulator. The ratio of resistances determines the output voltage using the same feedback mechanisms described earlier.|$|E
50|$|To {{obtain a}} {{sufficiently}} stable output voltage, the output current must either be stable (and so be made {{part of the}} calculation of the <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> values) or limited to an appropriately {{small percentage of the}} divider's input current. Load sensitivity can be decreased by reducing the impedance of both halves of the divider, though this increases the divider's quiescent input current and results in higher power consumption (and wasted heat) in the divider. Voltage regulators are often used in lieu of passive voltage dividers when it is necessary to accommodate high or fluctuating load currents.|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternate}} to the long-tail pair, the concertina uses a single triode as a variable resistance within a <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> formed by Ra and Rk {{either side of}} the valve. The result is that the voltage at the anode swings exactly and opposite to the voltage at the cathode, giving a perfectly balanced phase split. the disadvantage of this stage (cf the differential long-tail pair) {{is that it does not}} give any gain. Using a double triode (typically octal or noval) to form a SET input buffer (giving gain) to then feed a concertina phase splitter is a classic push-pull front end, typically followed by a driver (triode) and (triode or pentode) output stage (in ultra linear in many cases) to form the classic push-pull amplifier circuit.|$|E
50|$|The {{transistor}} (or other device) {{is used as}} {{one half}} of a <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> to establish the regulated output voltage. The output voltage is compared to a reference voltage to produce a control signal to the transistor which will drive its gate or base. With negative feedback and good choice of compensation, the output voltage is kept reasonably constant. Linear regulators are often inefficient: since the transistor is acting like a resistor, it will waste electrical energy by converting it to heat. In fact, the power loss due to heating in the transistor is the current multiplied by the voltage difference between input and output voltage. The same function can often be performed much more efficiently by a switched-mode power supply, but a linear regulator may be preferred for light loads or where the desired output voltage approaches the source voltage. In these cases, the linear regulator may dissipate less power than a switcher. The linear regulator also {{has the advantage of}} not requiring magnetic devices (inductors or transformers) which can be relatively expensive or bulky, being often of simpler design, and cause less electromagnetic interference. Some designs of linear regulators use only transistors, diodes and resistors, which are easier to fabricate into an integrated circuit, further reducing their weight, footprint on a PCB, and price.|$|E

As only one power supply was available, the {{electric}} potential of the grid Vg was indirectly controlled by displacing the corona tip towards or away from the grid which was connected to a high voltage (HV) <b>potential</b> <b>divider.</b> By approximating the tip to the grid, more current is injected into it, which raises Vg as charges then need to flow to ground through the large resistance of the divider.|$|E

40|$|Discharge lamps require high {{ignition}} voltage from typically one to several kilovolts for cold-start, but have low onstate voltage of typically 100 V. For discharge arc monitoring purposes, {{it is difficult}} or uneconomical to implement voltage sensor to cover such {{a wide range of}} voltage. In this paper, a nonintrusive and electrically isolated method, based on the single-sensor principle, is used to derive the system parameters and variables for system monitoring and control purposes. Unlike the traditional resistive <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> for voltage feedback, the proposed method is nondissipative. Only one coupled winding is used to derive the converter inductor voltage, from which the lamp power, lamp arc resistance and inverter dc link voltage can be accurately derived. The proposal is verified with good agreement between derived values and measurements in an electronic ballast-fluorescent lamp system. The proposal can be useful in applications in which sensing the voltage across the load is either difficult or costly. © 2005 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Ionospheric {{absorption}} is {{a controlling}} factor in accurate prediction of medium to high frequency signal levels that are passing through ionosphere. Particularly at high latitudes ionospheric storms {{are the main}} problem, causing unreliable communication. Sometimes these storms can lead HF radio signals to "polar blackouts" (reducing the signal in-time by 20 % or more) or they can even be completely absorbed by ionosphere. [Ware and Owren, 1958] This project report presents the design, construction and testing of a device {{that is used to}} measure ionospheric cosmic noise absorption, which is called riometer. During the project development different methods of filter design (all-pole and coupled capacitor resonator filters), impedance matching (L, pi and capacitor tapped matching) and signal attenuation calculation (impedance mismatch, pi attenuator and <b>potential</b> <b>divider)</b> are showed and described. The need for new riometer design had arisen, because some discrete components used in previous riometer designs are obsolete [LIS Riometers] and therefore the new riometers cannot be made based on the old designs, so the new design had to be invented. This new riometer design also includes the new feature of controlling the switching between antenna and calibration using the computer control inputs and mechanical override switch, thus providing higher system flexibility.

40|$|Initial {{testing and}} {{commissioning}} of two high power klystrons (TH 2103 D) and gyrotron (VGA 8000 A 19) {{have been carried out}} at our Institute. Each of the klystrons is capable of delivering 500 kW at 3. 7 GHz, to be used for non-inductive lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in the Steady State Superconducting Tokamak (SST- 1). The gyrotron is capable of delivering 200 KW at 28 GHz, for breakdown and electron cyclotron resonant heating (ECRH) experiments on Aditya tokamak. The potential appearing at the anode point with respect to the cathode will turn-ON, turn-OFF and control the beam current. Thus these anode modulator power supplies control the out put power of the devices. Main input for both the power supplies is derived from the cathode power supply. A - 2 kV bias power supply is connected between the modulator output and anode terminal to suppress dark current. The output pulse duration is adjustable from 50 msec. to 1000 sec. by the control system.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{design for a}} linear array of eight {{electric}} potential sensors arranged with 1 mm spacing and configured to measure spatially varying potential at the microscopic scale. The array successfully detects a 50 µm wide feature associated {{with one of the}} samples tested. In a single sensor arrangement we have demonstrated < 1 µm resolution, but the data acquisition times can become prohibitive. The sensors operate noninvasively by capacitively coupling to the sample. The issues associated with using an array of sensors in close proximity are addressed. Cross coupling and strategies for matching the response of the sensors are described in detail. Results are presented for a range of samples including a resistive <b>potential</b> <b>divider,</b> a ceramic microwave circuit board, and a section taken from an oil drill pipe containing a known fault. The data acquisition times are compared with those of a single sensor system, with improvements of 4. 5 times in speed reported. In one case real-time simultaneous data acquisition is demonstrated using all eight sensors. Since these sensors operate via the displacement current they may also be applied to the characterization of material properties, including, for example, insulators, dielectrics, and poorly conducting composite materials. It is concluded that we see significant improvements in the data acquisition times for the linear array over a single sensor as expected and are able to overcome the difficulties associated with operating an array of sensors in close proximity...|$|E
40|$|Analog {{memory is}} of great {{importance}} in neurocomputing technologies field, but still remains difficult to implement. With emergence of memristors in VLSI technologies the idea of designing scalable analog data storage elements finds its second wind. A memristor, known for its history dependent resistance levels, independently can provide blocks of binary or discrete state data storage. However, using single memristor to save the analog value is practically limited due to the device variability and implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a new design of discrete state memory cell consisting of subcells constructed from a memristor and its resistive network. A memristor in the sub-cells provides the storage element, while its resistive network is used for programming its resistance. Several sub-cells are then connected in parallel, resembling <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> configuration. The output of the memory cell is the voltage resulting from distributing the input voltage among the sub-cells. Here, proposed design was programmed to obtain 10 and 27 different output levels depending on {{the configuration of the}} combined resistive networks within the sub-cell. Despite the simplicity of the circuit, this realization of multilevel memory provides increased number of output levels compared to previous designs of memory technologies based on memristors. Simulation results of proposed memory are analyzed providing explicit data on the issues of distinguishing discrete analog output levels and sensitivity of the cell to oscillations in write signal patterns.

40|$|Since the {{installation}} in April 1970, the McKinney type mass spectrometer {{has maintained a}} good condition and about 5000 isotopic analyses of oxygen, carbon and sulfer has been cerried out so far. The ion source filament was changed to spiral one from single wire. Consequently three times sensitivity and the longer life of filament were obtained. Gradual changes in the ratio of <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> (β) and the sensitivity (|△ E(0) (2) |/E(0) (1)) for the difference of β have been observed (Table 1). Because these changes are opposite in trend but similar in degree, it is supposed that these changes are caused by decrease of feed-back resister value in the balancing system. Although there remain some problems in the corrections for the difference in observed isotopic tatio between two cases that a same CO(2) is fed to ion source from the ST side of inlet system {{on the one hand}} and from the X side on the another, the reproducibility of the measurement of isotopic ratio for long period is about ±O. 1 ‰ (Table 2, Fig. 1). δ(18) O values of standard waters, MSA- 1 and MSA- 2, measured during a period from May to Dec. 1970 and in Sep. 1971 yielded good agreements implying the reproducibility of the measurement to be constant (Table 3). Both calculated δ(18) O values relative to a given sample based on each observed δ(18) O value relative to two different samples agreed each other.

40|$|Increased use of {{nonlinear}} electrical loads injects harmonic currents {{to power}} systems. High levels of power system harmonics create voltage distortion and enlarge power quality problems. Harmonics result in poor power factor, lower efficiency and interference to adjacent communication systems. The harmonic currents {{flow into the}} utility supply lines produces extra losses. An active power filter uses a switching inverter to produce harmonic compensating currents. The major objective of this project was to eliminate effects of harmonics and to improve power factor of a typical nonlinear load. Attempts were made to apply active power filters for current shaping of a specific load, contrary to its common applications of applying {{at the point of}} common coupling. The National Instruments USB- 6008 multifunction data acquisition (OAQ) module was used to acquire data from the sample load viz. the computer power supply. A <b>potential</b> <b>divider</b> was incorporated to the circuit to acquire voltage signal. Current signal was acquired using a series resistor. Filter current was implemented by switching an inductor using four insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) arranged in H bridge configuration. The simulation circuit was implemented using M·ATLAB Simulink software tool. Inductance of the switching inductor, voltage of the step up transformer and the switching frequency of the system were obtained by simulation. Subsequently the above circuit parameters were validated for variable loads using total harmonic distortion as the discerning criterion. It was possible to reduce THO of the current wave of computer power supply from 107 % to 12 %. Power factor was improved from 0. 66 to unity. By increasing the power factor to unity, the current flow can be reduced by approximately 34 %. The observations made herein are applicable for harmonic elimination in nonlinear loads in general with necessary modifications...|$|E
40|$|A {{new trend}} in the {{development}} of integrated sensor is to include the signal conditioning circuit and sensor control circuit on the same chip. This approach can improve the performance and capability of the sensor. Several successful applications have been developed for pressure sensors and accelerometers. However most reported tin oxide gas sensor still at discrete level. To make the monolithic integrated gas sensor available in the future, integration of the front-end circuit should be considered. To control the tin oxide gas sensor, the heating power is an important issue to consider. The heating source is usually provided by passing a current through a polysilicon resistor. It is well known that polysilicon have relatively high temperature coefficient. The heating power cannot be controlled precisely with this simple arrangement. A resistor matching scheme is proposed in [11, 12, 13]. However the proposed scheme can only be compensated at a fix temperature. In this thesis, a new power control circuit is presented. With the new circuit technique, called the Bipolar-like translinear loop, the heating power can be compensated for wide range of heating temperature. The power control circuit can control the heating power to within 1 % for a ± 50 % change in heating resistor value. The heating power can be adjusted by changing the reference current of the circuit. Compared with the heater without compensation, the change in heating power can be reduced by 50 times. A signal conditioning circuit is also considered in this thesis. Tin oxide gas sensor is a chemo-resistor device. The resistance can change by as much as 10 times due to change in gas concentration. This gives rise to large charge in the chemo-resistance. The commercial method for the signal conditioning is to use the <b>potential</b> <b>divider.</b> This technique is not suitable when the output resistance changes is large. We proposed a new signal conditioning circuit. The system can detect gas concentration as low as 30 ppm. The lowest gas concentration is limited by our measurement system...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to study {{the changes in the}} redox potential and pH-value of the tap water as a function of underwater spark discharges, storage device capacitance and the charging voltage. Methodology. To define the electric parameters of discharge circuit we used the Rogowski loop and the compensated capacitance-ohm <b>potential</b> <b>divider.</b> To determine water properties before and after the treatment we used the following devices: the water analyzer Anion - 7051 with the limit of absolute error of the EMF measurement ± 2 mV, the BANTE 902 device with the absolute error of ± 0. 002 рН. Results. We managed to establish the time of the origination of changes in the properties of treated water. A change in the positive redox potential to a negative one occurred already after the third pulse at a total energy input of ≥ 1 kJ. The pH value increased in the range of 0. 2 – 0. 45 рН units. We obtained the relationship of a change in the redox potential as a function of total energy of the pulse train that actually exhibits the linear relation to the mass of erosion products. We established that the electrodes made of stainless steel and the electrodes made of graphite provide similar changes in water properties. An increase in pH is indicative of the progress of reactions that result in the formation of ОН‾. Originality. The obtained experimental data prove a rapid and reliable change in the redox potential from positive to negative changes in the redox potential exponent can persist during ten days and even longer. The erosion products of electrodes can be removed from the treated water using the method of magnetic separation. Practical value.
