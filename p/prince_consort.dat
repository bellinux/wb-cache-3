5|$|Subtle persuasions by the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who {{reminded}} her {{mother of the}} happiness that Beatrice had brought the <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort,</b> induced the Queen to resume talking to Beatrice. Queen Victoria consented to the marriage on condition that Henry give up his German commitments and live permanently with Beatrice and the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Victoria came {{to depend}} {{more and more}} on his support and guidance. He aided the {{development}} of Britain's constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with Parliament—although he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston's tenure as Foreign Secretary. In 1857, he was given the formal title of <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, Beatrice and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort,</b> seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E

5|$|As Duke of York, George's {{arms were}} the royal arms, with an inescutcheon {{of the arms}} of Saxony, all differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing an anchor azure. As Prince of Wales the centre label lost its anchor. As King, he bore the royal arms. In 1917, he removed, by warrant, the Saxony inescutcheon from the arms of all male-line {{descendants}} of the <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort</b> domiciled in the United Kingdom (although the royal arms themselves had never borne the shield).|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was laid}} down on 26 October 1859 as a wooden two-deck, 90-gun ship {{of the line}} by Pembroke Royal Dockyard, but her {{construction}} was suspended pending experience with the conversion of her half-sisters of the <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort</b> class to broadside ironclads. The Admiralty ordered on 2 July 1862 that she be cut down one deck and converted to an armoured frigate {{for the price of}} £239,258. The ship was launched on 7 March 1864 and commissioned in September 1866, but was not completed until 4 October 1866.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte's {{paternal}} family {{belonged to}} the House of Hohenzollern, a royal house that had ruled the German state of Prussia since the seventeenth century. By {{the end of her}} first year, Charlotte's father had become Crown Prince as his father ascended to the Prussian throne as King Wilhelm I. Charlotte's mother, Vicky, was the eldest daughter of the British monarch Queen Victoria and her husband Albert, <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort.</b> Charlotte and her brother, Wilhelm, were the only grandchildren born in Albert's lifetime. He and Victoria visited their daughter and two grandchildren when Charlotte was two months old; Vicky and Frederick in turn brought Wilhelm and Charlotte on a visit to England in June 1861, six months before Albert's death.|$|E

5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort,</b> was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E
5|$|In total, 141 {{men have}} held {{the rank of}} field marshal. The {{majority}} led careers in the British Army or the British Indian Army, rising through the ranks to eventually become a field marshal. Some members of the British Royal Family—most recently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and Charles, Prince of Wales—were promoted to the rank after shorter periods of service. Three British monarchs—George V, Edward VIII, and George VI— assumed the rank on their accessions to the throne, while Edward VII was already a field marshal, and two British consorts—Albert, <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort</b> and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh—were appointed by their respective queens. Other ceremonial appointments were made as diplomatic gestures. Twelve foreign monarchs held the honour, though three (Wilhelm II, German Emperor; Franz Joseph I, Austrian Emperor; and Hirohito, Emperor of Japan) were stripped of it when their countries became enemies of Britain and her allies in the two world wars. Also awarded the rank were two distinguished foreign military officers, honoured for their contributions to World War I and World War II respectively, and one foreign statesman.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti also pursued an {{abortive}} {{project to}} install a second giant equestrian statue in Old Palace Yard, this time portraying Edward, the Black Prince. He envisaged the two statues facing each other {{on either side of}} the entrance to the House of Lords. Although the scheme was reported in several journals, including the Illustrated London News, the Art Journal and the Athenaeum, and was strongly criticised for its perceived thematic inappropriateness, nothing came of it. Three different versions of the model for Marochetti's Black Prince came to light at the turn of the 21st century. They appear to have been designed at the same time as his Richard I, demonstrating their common origins; models of the two statues almost certainly would have co-existed in his workshop and Marochetti probably intended to seek a commission from Prince Albert. However, the death of the <b>Prince</b> <b>Consort</b> in 1861 deprived him of his most influential patron, and Marochetti's own death was to follow in 1867. Queen Victoria purchased one of Marochetti's statuette versions of the Black Prince following the sculptor's death and gave it to her son Edward, Prince of Wales. It is still part of the Royal Collection.|$|E

5|$|The February 1852 {{death of}} Prime Minister Rainiharo left the queen without her consort, long-time {{political}} adviser and military Commander-in-Chief. She consequently awarded Rainilaiarivony a double promotion to Twelfth Honor ten days afterward, {{in preparation for}} an increase in military and political responsibilities. Shortly thereafter the queen expressed romantic interest in Rainilaiarivony and proposed that he assume the former role of his father as <b>prince</b> <b>consort</b> and Prime Minister. The young man refused on the double basis of their age difference, the queen being forty years his senior, as well as the perceived impropriety of becoming intimate with his father's former lover. Ranavalona continued to harbor feelings for him throughout her lifetime but she did not express resentment over his refusal to reciprocate them and went on to take another high-ranking official as consort: Rainijohary, who was jointly awarded the role of Prime Minister along with the new Commander-in-Chief, Rainivoninahitriniony. Within a year the queen had assigned the 24-year-old Rainilaiarivony to his first position of responsibility within the military, and promoted him to Royal Secretary, keeper of the Royal Seal, and supervisor to the Royal Treasurer.|$|E

5000|$|Royal Oaks boilers were in {{one group}} of six on the forward side of the engines. The <b>Prince</b> <b>Consorts</b> larger engines {{required}} more boilers, so they had two groups of four; one set forward of the engines, and one set further aft; this was why the <b>Prince</b> <b>Consorts</b> had two widely spaced funnels (one for each set of boilers). The <b>Prince</b> <b>Consorts</b> boilers were not of equal size. The forward set were larger and had five furnaces each, whereas the aft boilers had three furnaces each. [...] "Each group of boilers had its own coal bunkers abreast it". [...] "The boilers worked at 20 lb pressure." ...|$|R
