25|$|On 15 December 2011, {{services}} between Bishan and Marina Bay {{stations were}} suspended due to damage sustained on 40 metres of <b>power</b> <b>rail</b> between City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut stations. Trains along the stretch stalled, causing a 5-hour service disruption. Train service resumed fully at 11.40pm on that day.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{polarity}} of {{the power}} rails differs. On the Kleinprofil lines the <b>power</b> <b>rail</b> is positively charged and the track is negative, on the Großprofil lines it is the other way around. In East Berlin the polarity of the track section Thälmannplatz/Otto-Grotewohl-Straße - Pankow, {{was the same as}} on the Großprofil lines. After reunification, this exception to the normal Kleinprofil polarity was reversed by the BVG, even though there are benefits to this arrangement (there is less corrosion of metal parts in the tunnel with the Großprofil polarity).|$|E

50|$|The ATX {{specification}} {{requires that}} the power-good signal ("PWR_OK") go high no sooner than 100 ms after the <b>power</b> <b>rails</b> have stabilized, and remain high for 16 ms after loss of AC power, and fall (to less than 0.4 V) at least 1 ms before the <b>power</b> <b>rails</b> fall out of specification (to 95% of their nominal value).|$|R

2500|$|In summer 1976 Teuvo Aura, {{the city}} {{director}} of Helsinki, {{signed an agreement}} with Valmet and Strömberg to purchase the trains required for the metro from them. In doing so Aura bypassed the city council completely, reportedly because he feared the council would decide to buy the rolling stock from manufacturers in the Soviet Union instead. By this time the direct currentbased technology of the M1 series trains had become outdated. In 1977 prototypes for the M100 train series (referred to as [...] "nokkajuna", , to differentiate from the M1 prototypes) were delivered. In these units the direct current from the <b>power</b> <b>rail</b> was converted to alternating current powering induction motors. The M100 trains were the first metro trains in the world to be equipped with such technology.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>power</b> <b>rails</b> are {{contained}} in a conduit midway between and below the two surface rails on which the cars operate, {{in much the same}} fashion as the cable for cable cars. The conduit contains two [...] "T" [...] section steel <b>power</b> <b>rails</b> of opposite polarity facing each other, about 12 in apart and about 18 in below the street surface. Power reached the car by means of an attachment, called a plough (US - plow), that rode in the conduit beneath the car. The plough had two metal shoes attached to springs that pushed sideways against the <b>power</b> <b>rails.</b> The plough was normally connected to a platform that could slide laterally to conform with variations in the placement of the conduit, for example in some areas there was a conduit for cable cars adjacent to the one for electric cars.|$|R

5000|$|Current sense {{amplifiers}} (also called {{current shunt}} amplifiers) are special-purpose amplifiers that output a voltage {{proportional to the}} current flowing in a <b>power</b> <b>rail.</b> They utilize a [...] "current-sense resistor" [...] to convert the load current in the <b>power</b> <b>rail</b> to a small voltage, which is then amplified by the current-sense amplifiers. The currents in the <b>power</b> <b>rail</b> {{can be in the}} range of 1 A to 20 A, requiring the current-sense resistor to be a resistor typically in the range of 1 to 100 mΩ. These amplifiers are designed to amplify a very small [...] "sense voltage" [...] of 10 to 100 mV, in the presence of very large common-mode voltages of 5 to 30 V. DC precision (low input offset voltage) and high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) are distinguishing characteristics of these amplifiers. Some current sense amplifiers measure current flowing in a single direction; bidirectional amplifiers measure current flow in both directions through the sense resistor.|$|E
