40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} the general nature of {{the relations between the}} Palestinians and their respective Arab Host-States during the period l 9 L 9 _l 967. The political attitudes and activities of the Palestinians constitute our central concern and those of the Arab Host-States are analyzed only in as much as they are related to the Palestinians. The theoretical framework of this study incorporates the hypothesis which, while examining the status of the Palestinians relative to various definitions of minorities, stateless persons and refugees, gives basic importance to Pan-Arabism as a common-bond. It is also of great significance that the dual character of nationalism and Pan-Arabism is shared both by the Palestinians and the Arab states at large. This study is broadly divided into three major eras: the era of formation, the era of transition and the era of revival. In addition, this study undertakes two case studies of the Palestinians in Jordan and in the Gaza Strip. The era of formation which covers the period 1949 - 1952 had witnessed the dispersion of the Palestinian Arabs. The roots of the relations between the Palestinians and their respective Host-States were laid down during this era. The era of transition which covers the period 1952 - 1963 was characterized by a Palestinian drive towards educational and academic attainment. Moreover, this era saw an increase in Palestinian political activism which was mainly manifested through political partes and political literature. The era of revival which covers the period 1963 - 1967 brought a shift in the political attitude {{of the majority of the}} Palestinian Arabs from a major stress on Pan-Arabism and Arab unity to one of recognition of a Palestinian identity and the revival of Palestinian entity which culminated in the establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the emergence of AL-Fatah: <b>Palestine</b> <b>National</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>Movement...</b>|$|E
