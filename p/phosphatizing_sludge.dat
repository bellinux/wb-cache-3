40|$|An {{integrating}} {{process of}} <b>phosphatizing</b> <b>sludge</b> treatment has been developed. Phosphatizing sludges from {{the automobile industry}} mainly consists of ferrous phosphate and contains about 50 % of the nickel, zinc and manganese compounds used as bonder components in the phosphating process. By decomposing the sludge with phosphoric acid at pH 1. 3 - 1. 7 and 70 C- 80 C the non-ferrous compounds are dissolved. The remaining solid ferrous phosphate can be thermally converted with stellworks slag resulting in a phosphate fertilizer similar to the Thomas meal, oily components of the <b>phosphatizing</b> <b>sludge</b> can be separated by pneumatic flotation prior to the acid treatment.
