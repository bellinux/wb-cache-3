25|$|Idemitsu {{is working}} on {{geothermal}} power in Ōita Prefecture, Japan. The plant will use a binary power generation system that produces electricity from both the steam with a regular turbine and from hot water by vaporizing <b>pentane</b> which then drives a turbine.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is a {{versatile}} solvent, miscible {{with water and}} with many organic solvents, including acetic acid, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and toluene. It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as <b>pentane</b> and hexane, and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene.|$|E
25|$|Before 1949, {{chemical}} engineer Fritz Stastny (1908–1985) developed pre-expanded PS beads by incorporating aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as <b>pentane.</b> These beads are {{the raw material}} for moulding parts or extruding sheets. BASF and Stastny applied for a patent that was issued in 1949. The moulding process was demonstrated at the Kunststoff Messe 1952 in Düsseldorf. Products were named Styropor.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pentanes</b> {{are also}} an active {{ingredient}} in some pesticides.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pentanes</b> are {{relatively}} inexpensive {{and are the}} most volatile liquid alkanes at room temperature, so they are often used in the laboratory as solvents that can be conveniently and rapidly evaporated. However, because of their nonpolarity and lack of functionality, they dissolve only non-polar and alkyl-rich compounds. <b>Pentanes</b> are miscible with most common nonpolar solvents such as chlorocarbons, aromatics, and ethers.|$|R
25|$|Polystyrene foams are {{produced}} using blowing agents that form bubbles {{and expand the}} foam. In expanded polystyrene, these are usually hydrocarbons such as <b>pentane,</b> which may pose a flammability hazard in manufacturing or storage of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact. Extruded polystyrene is usually made with hydrofluorocarbons (HFC-134a), which have global warming potentials of approximately 1000–1300 times that of carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{gas from}} gas wells and from {{condensate}} wells, {{in which there}} is little or no crude oil, is called non-associated gas. Gas wells typically produce only raw natural gas, while condensate wells produce raw natural gas along with other low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Those that are liquid at ambient conditions (i.e., <b>pentane</b> and heavier) are called natural gas condensate (sometimes also called natural gasoline or simply condensate).|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, cobalt(II) {{chloride}} {{serves as}} a common precursor to other cobalt compounds. Reaction of the anhydrous compound with sodium cyclopentadienide gives cobaltocene. This 19-electron species is a good reducing agent, being readily oxidised to the yellow 18-electron cobaltacenium cation. Reaction of 1-norbonyllithium with the CoCl2·THF in <b>pentane</b> produces the brown, thermally stable cobalt(IV) tetralkyl — a rare example of a stable transition metal/saturated alkane compound, different products are obtained in other solvents.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pentanes</b> are a {{group of}} alkanes with five carbon atoms with the formula C5H12. It has three isomers.|$|R

40|$|The Massachusetts OTA has {{identified}} <b>pentanes</b> emissions from EPS plants to be potentially hazardous and, as a result, may possibly be restricting manufacturing {{in the near}} future. The particular company {{involved in this case}} study is CBIS-Korfill of Brookfield, MA. According to the company, they are currently at the halfway point for allowable <b>pentanes</b> emissions. In this endeavor, projected cost and “green-ness ” are two design priorities. Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) • The EPS that this company uses contains an average of 6 % <b>pentanes</b> by weight. • Merely lowering the petanes % does not yield desirable material properties. • The price of EPS has increased over the past year from $ 0. 57 /lb up to $ 0. 97 /lb • TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) are our main analysis tools. 101 EPS in regular and expanded state...|$|R
25|$|The major {{application}} of 4,4'-MDI is {{the production of}} rigid polyurethane. Typically, one metric ton of polyurethane foam needs 616 kg of MDI and 386 kg of polyol, with 54 kg of <b>pentane</b> as a blowing agent. These rigid polyurethane foams are good thermal insulators and used in nearly all freezers and refrigerators worldwide, as well as buildings. Typical polyols used are polyethylene adipate (a polyester) and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (a polyether).|$|E
25|$|In its strictest sense, {{petroleum}} includes only crude oil, but {{in common}} usage it includes all liquid, gaseous and solid hydrocarbons. Under surface pressure and temperature conditions, lighter hydrocarbons methane, ethane, {{propane and butane}} occur as gases, while <b>pentane</b> and heavier hydrocarbons are {{in the form of}} liquids or solids. However, in an underground oil reservoir the proportions of gas, liquid, and solid depend on subsurface conditions and on the phase diagram of the petroleum mixture.|$|E
25|$|Often mid-stream {{and well}} head gases require removal {{of many of}} the various {{hydrocarbon}} species contained within the natural gas. Some of these gases include heptane, <b>pentane,</b> propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above Methane (CH4) to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission. Typically, natural gas compressors require 950 to 1050BTU per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational name plate specifications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentanes</b> are {{components}} of some fuels and are employed as specialty solvents in the laboratory. Their properties {{are very similar}} to those of butanes and hexanes.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its low boiling point, low cost, and {{relative}} safety, <b>pentanes</b> {{are used as}} a working medium in geothermal power stations in some blended refrigerants.|$|R
30|$|There are {{two primary}} classifications of {{isomerization}} {{based on the}} configuration. These are once-through and recycling process. In the once-through process, there is no recycle of hydrogen, methyl <b>pentanes</b> and unreacted feed back to the reactor feed stream and the octane number of achieved is between 78 and 82. On the other hand, in recycling process, there is the recycle of methyl <b>pentanes</b> and unreacted feed back to the reactor feed stream, which increases the octane number of products up to 88 – 92.|$|R
25|$|Polyurethane foam (including foam rubber) is {{sometimes}} made using {{small amounts of}} blowing agents to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol restricted the use of many chlorine-containing blowing agents, such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, blowing agents such as carbon dioxide, <b>pentane,</b> 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated blowing agents remained in use in many developing countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} names {{were derived from}} methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, {{respectively}} (hexadecane is also {{sometimes referred to as}} cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel (-a or -o) from the basic numerical term. Hence, <b>pentane,</b> C5H12; hexane, C6H14; heptane, C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example nonane, use the Latin prefix non-. For a more complete list, see List of alkanes.|$|E
25|$|More {{volatile}} short-chain alkanes {{are also}} produced by and found in plant tissues. The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally {{high levels of}} n-heptane in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, <b>pentane,</b> and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not {{generally considered to be}} a major component of biogenic air pollution.|$|E

50|$|Conventional {{crude oil}} {{production}} (not including oil sands and <b>pentanes</b> plus) represented 38.6% of Alberta ’s total crude oil and equivalent production and 25.5% of Canada’s total crude oil and equivalent production.|$|R

25|$|From <b>pentane</b> to octane the alkanes {{are highly}} {{volatile}} liquids. They {{are used as}} fuels in internal combustion engines, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition {{is measured by the}} octane rating of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and heptane has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.|$|E
25|$|The {{overhead}} {{sour gas}} from the stripper contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That sour gas {{is sent to the}} refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main amine gas treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and <b>pentane</b> or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery fuel gas. The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric acid process or in the conventional Contact Process.|$|E
25|$|The alkanes from <b>pentane</b> (C5H12) to octane (C8H18) are refined into gasoline, {{the ones}} from nonane (C9H20) to {{hexadecane}} (C16H34) into diesel fuel, kerosene and jet fuel. Alkanes {{with more than}} 16 carbon atoms can be refined into fuel oil and lubricating oil. At the heavier end of the range, paraffin wax is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while asphalt has 35 and up, although these are usually cracked by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand {{and the cost of}} recovery, these gases are either flared off, sold as liquefied petroleum gas under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C4H10), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapor pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, {{but it is also a}} main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentanes</b> {{are some}} of the primary blowing agents used in the {{production}} of polystyrene foam and other foams. Usually, a mixture of n-, i-, and increasingly cyclopentane is used for this purpose.|$|R

2500|$|It {{is almost}} certain that the term {{paraffin}} stems from the petrochemical industry. Branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins. The {{use of the term}} [...] "paraffin" [...] is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers, i.e., compounds of the same chemical formula, e.g., <b>pentane</b> and isopentane.|$|E
2500|$|Butyllithium is commercially {{available}} as solutions (15%, 25%,1.5 M, 2 M, 2.5 M, 10 M, etc.) in alkanes such as <b>pentane,</b> hexanes, and heptanes. [...] Solutions in diethyl ether and THF can be prepared, {{but are not}} stable enough for storage. Annual worldwide production and consumption of butyllithium and other organolithium compounds is estimated at 1800 tonnes.|$|E
