5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E

5|$|Prolactinomas {{may respond}} to {{dopamine}} agonist treatment–medication that mimics {{the action of}} dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually bromocriptine or cabergoline.

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E

5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
25|$|The term {{hypopituitarism}} {{is often}} used interchangeably with GH deficiency by endocrinologists but more often denotes GH deficiency plus deficiency {{of at least one}} other anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone.</b> When GH deficiency (usually with other anterior pituitary deficiencies) is associated with posterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency (usually diabetes insipidus), the condition is termed panhypopituitarism.|$|E

40|$|A {{plethora of}} hormones {{regulate}} {{many of the}} body’s functions, including growth and development, metabolism, electrolyte balances, and reproduction. Numerous glands throughout the body produce hormones. The hypothalamus produces several releasing and inhibiting hormones that act on the pituitary gland, stimulating the release of <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormones.</b> Of the <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormones,</b> several act on other glands located in various regions of the body, whereas other <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormones</b> directly affect their target organs. Other hormone-producing glands throughout the body include the adrenal glands, which primarily produce cortisol; the gonads (i. e., ovaries and testes), which produce sex hormones; the thyroid, which produces thyroid hormone; the parathyroid, which produces parathyroid hormone; and the pancreas, which produces insulin and glucagon. Many of these hormones are part of regulatory hormonal cascades involving a hypothalamic hormone, one or more <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormones,</b> and one or more target gland hormones.

25|$|Adipose {{tissue and}} {{lactating}} mammary glands also take up glucose {{from the blood}} for conversion into triglycerides. This occurs {{in the same way}} as it does in the liver, except that these tissues do not release the triglycerides thus produced as VLDL into the blood. Adipose tissue cells store the triglycerides in their fat droplets, ultimately to release them again as free fatty acids and glycerol into the blood (as described above), when the plasma concentration of insulin is low, and that of glucagon and/or epinephrine is high. Mammary glands discharge the fat (as cream fat droplets) into the milk that they produce under the influence of the anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> prolactin.|$|E
25|$|Dating to {{approximately}} the year 1550, outbreeding in Charles II's lineage had ceased (see also pedigree collapse). From then on, all his ancestors were {{in one way}} or another descendants of Joanna and Philip I of Castile, and among these just the royal houses of Spain, Austria and Bavaria. Charles II's genome was actually more homozygous than that of a child whose parents are siblings. He was born physically and mentally disabled, and disfigured. Possibly through affliction with mandibular prognathism, he was barely able to chew. His tongue was so large that his speech could barely be understood, and he frequently drooled. It has been suggested that he suffered from the endocrine disease acromegaly, or his inbred lineage may have led to a combination of rare genetic disorders such as combined <b>pituitary</b> <b>hormone</b> deficiency and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E

2500|$|When Cushing's {{syndrome}} is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level), or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offers equal detection rates. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates {{the effects of}} cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, cortisol levels >50 nmol/l (1.81µg/dl) would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome because an ectopic source of cortisol or ACTH (such as adrenal adenoma) exists which is not inhibited by the dexamethasone. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late-night levels of salivary cortisol are high in cushingoid patients.
