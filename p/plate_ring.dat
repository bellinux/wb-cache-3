40|$|Abstract-The {{capacitance}} of {{a parallel}} plate capacitor is formulated in basic electrostatics, {{assuming that the}} separation between the two electrode plates is very narrow and the fringe field of the edges is negligible. However, in practical problems of electrical and electronic engineering there are many cases where the plate separation is wide and the fringe field effect cannot be neglected. In our previously published paper the capacitance of strip capacitor was computed by the boundary element method (BEM) for the case where the separation becomes wide, and a new empirical formula of the capacitance against the plate separation was derived. The empirical formula agreed well with experimental data. This paper presents a “formula ” for the capacitance of a parallel plate disk capacitor. The “formula ” is valid over a wider separation than formulas presented previously.

40|$|Cone-cylinder intersections are {{commonly}} found in pressure vessels and piping. Examples include conical end closures to cylindrical vessels and conical reducers between cylinders of different radii. In {{the case of a}} cone large end-to-cylinder intersection under internal pressure, the intersection is subject to a large circumferential compressive force. Both the cone and the cylinder may be thickened near the intersection to resist this compression, but it is often convenient and necessary to augment further the strength of the intersection using an annular <b>plate</b> <b>ring</b> stiffener. Under this large circumferential compression, the intersection may fail by elastic buckling, plastic buckling or plastic collapse. This paper describes an investigation of the elastic buckling strength of ring-stiffened cone-cylinder intersections. Two buckling modes are identified: a shell mode for thin intersections with a shallow cone (a cone with its apex half angle approaching 90 °) and/or a relatively stocky ring stiffener, and a ring mode for other cases. An existing elastic buckling approximation for annular plate rings in steel silos is found to be applicable to the intersection when it buckles in the ring mode. New approximate design equations are also established for the shell mode. In addition, simple expressions are identified which relate the number of circumferential buckling waves to the geometric parameters of the intersection.

40|$|Steel liner plates, {{which are}} bolted {{together}} to form a shell, are commonly used to provide temporary protective linings in the tunneling industry to ensure the stability of the tunnel and safety of the workers until more permanent ground reinforcement can be installed. As the ground deforms to try and close the opening, the liner plate is radially stressed, and by deforming redistributes these loads back to the surrounding insitu earth. Grouting behind the plates is done to fill any voids and ensure uniform contact to the strata {{around the back of the}} plates. Another function of the liner plate in some applications is to act as a platform or structure for the mining machine to react against in order to develop the necessary forward thrust to be able to excavate the face. In this case, the liner plates are loaded axially as a horizontal column of bolted liner plate rings, creating a jacking force against the liner plate assembly. In general, the buckling strength of the plate sections determines the jacking force capacity. Historically, the jacking force capacity of tunnel liner plates has been theoretically determined by some simplistic equations developed from tests of single liner plates. Recently, full-scale tests on a complete circular section of bolted liner <b>plate</b> <b>ring</b> segments have been conducted in the NIOSH Safety Structures Testing Laboratory using the unique Mine Roof Simulator to apply controlled loading in a manner that simulates the real world environment. Due to the unique size and capacity of the Mine Roof Simulator, these are believed to be the first full-scale tests conducted on the jacking force capability of tunnel liner plate rings. These tests indicate that the previously used theoretical equations tend to over predict the jacking force capacity of these tunnel liner plates. Unanticipated deformations in the field have been observed at loads below these theoretical design loads, therefore, a more accurate determination of the jacking force capability was needed. This report summarizes the full-scale test results, examines design parameters that impact the jacking force capability, and develops new mathematical models to improve the prediction of design loads...|$|E

40|$|Inspired by {{traditional}} Chiaroscuro woodblock printing {{techniques of the}} 16 th century, we explore the use of multicolour impressions produced by relief prints {{as a means to}} evaluate the surface rendered with 2. 5 D and 3 D printing technologies. Even though topography and micro-imaging methods can be used to measure surfaces, perceptual quality evaluation from surfaces rendered by additive printing methods is still a challenge. By reducing the dimension from 3 D or 2. 5 D back to 2 D, classic methods to measure quality that have already found a correlation with human perception would become available to us. A traditional relief print is created through the combination of a raised printing surface and the surface qualities of the printing block (end-grain hardwood, chipboard, linoleum, acrylic), which is then inked and printed under great downward pressure. The block surface is manipulated by engraving, cutting and abrasion (traditional tools include sharp V shape or U shaped chisels). In order to obtain a high quality printed image, the inked plate needs to produce a solid and well defined line with uniform colour. As a benchmark of our idea, we employed different methods to control the modulation of a surface by either carving (laser cutting, CNC engraving) from an existing material (acrylic, wood, model board) or building relief using additive fabrication (Makerbot, Océ 2. 5 D printer prototype). For print analysis we created a set of two targets generated to test special resolution and edge detail. Following traditional printmaking processes the blocks were inked, and subjected to a high level of downward pressure in a press to create impressions (i. e. the surface is embossed by the physical force). All of the blocks were inked and printed in the same way. Instead of evaluating the quality of the surface rendered by each of the methods directly, we perform the evaluation on the impressions made with the blocks. Each of the testing blocks was adapted from optical frequency test patterns in order to access special resolution and edge detail in print. The first test target uses the 1951 USAF resolution test chart where groups of three horizontal and vertical lines, referred to as elements, are depicted at varying sizes and orientations. By finding the element with the smallest discernible set of lines, we can indicate the resolution corresponding to a given printing block fabrication method. For the second target we utilised a Zone <b>plate</b> <b>ring</b> pattern with a special frequency up to 2 line pairs per millimeter (LP/mm). Different aspects can be assessed on the impressions such as the density of ink, the uniformity of the surfaces, the sharpness of the edges and the spatial resolution at different angles. For instance, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) describing the print accuracy for different frequencies in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions can be found for each of the methods based on the impressions. In our paper, we discuss the results of our method with each of the available technologies and the possible extension of our solution for the evaluation of more complex features...|$|E

Cyclic loading tests on the cross-shaped connections are carried out by using MTS servo loading system. Comparative analyses are conducted based on the experimental results including hysteretic curves, skeleton curves and stiffness degradation curves as well as ductility coefficients of cyclic loading tests. Furthermore, effects of geometric parameters of ring-stiffened plate, axial compression ratio and backing plate on the deformation performance of cross-shaped connections are analyzed. The {{results show that the}} increase of width of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> and the shape change of <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> from square to circle can both significantly improve the ductility and the hysteretic characteristics of connection. It is emphasized that the specimen with square <b>ring</b> <b>plates</b> is of better deformation performance but lower bearing capacity than the ones with circular <b>ring</b> <b>plates.</b> Besides, the backing plates always have positive effects on the hysteretic characteristics, ductility and energy dissipation of the CFST column connections.
