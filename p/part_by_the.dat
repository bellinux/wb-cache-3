5|$|Appreciation of art {{among the}} gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty, {{especially}} {{in regard to}} paintings, which is an art practiced by many. Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably shifted from the Northern (960–1127) to Southern Song (1127–1279) periods, influenced in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gradual embrace of the Neo-Confucian political ideology at court.|$|E

5|$|The Roman invasion, and {{possibly}} the preceding period {{of involvement in the}} internal affairs of the south of England, was inspired in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> potential of the Mendip Hills.

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in August 1945, {{a number}} of native Indonesian employees of Nippon Eigasha formed Berita Film Indonesia, which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly proclaimed Indonesian government. During the ensuing revolution, allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of newsreels at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce fictional films. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, {{a continuation of the}} former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.|$|E

5|$|ExxonMobil leads a {{consortium}} of Chevron and Petronas that has invested $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves estimated at one billion barrels in southern Chad. Oil production began in 2003 with {{the completion of a}} pipeline (financed in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> World Bank) that links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon. As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount. On 14 July 2006, the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70% of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes.|$|E
5|$|Filmed over {{a period}} of two months after nearly three years of research, The Mirror Never Lies was {{sponsored}} in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wakatobi regency government. The first feature film to star the Bajau, it used their language extensively. Although a commercial failure domestically, it has been screened at many international film festivals and won several awards both inside and outside of Indonesia. Critical reviews have generally been positive, mostly emphasising the film's visuals.|$|E
5|$|Five {{people have}} been {{depicted}} on U.S. currency during their lifetime. Abraham Lincoln was portrayed on the 1861 $10 Demand Note; Salmon Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, approved his own portrait for the 1862 $1 Legal Tender Note; Winfield Scott was depicted on Interest Bearing Notes during the early 1860s; and Francis Spinner and Spencer Clark both approved {{the use of their}} own image on fractional currency. In 1873, driven in large <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> actions of Spinner and Clark, Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond, security, note, or fractional or postal currency.|$|E

The U.S. House investigation, conducted in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Government Accountability Office (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but also noted that the DoD had refused access to key witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Hairway to Steven {{was issued}} in April, and marked a midway point between the band's {{experimental}} roots, {{and the more}} accessible recordings that would follow. While half of the material is as extreme sounding as their earlier work, other songs are more conventional. This was the first Butthole Surfers album to make extensive use of acoustic guitar. Hairway to Steven did not have song titles when first released, and instead represented each track with an absurdist, often scatological, cartoon. The band traveled widely {{in support of the}} album over the next year, including a very successful tour of Europe (helped in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> influence of new UK distributor Blast First). Like their studio recordings, their live shows were beginning to lose much of their earlier chaos.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, the leaking {{roof was}} repaired. In December 2007, the House {{received}} a $28,500 {{grant from the}} Dr. Scholl Foundation. The grant was used to complete lead-paint abatement, which would make conducting other restoration work safer. By 2010, the Dr. Scholl Foundation granted another $50,000 and a family foundation provided another $50,000 for the restoration. It was reported that other college grants totaling $15,500 were given for preservation planning, in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. It was reported in May 2010 that a matching grant of $101,500 was given to Connecticut College from the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, which provided the funding for {{the next phase of}} renovations for restoring the House.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, RA {{organizers}} {{announced that}} the film festival would move from October 2010 to April 2011 because of funding shortfalls. One news source reported that RA organizers had intended to hold an October film festival, but a community fundraiser brought in only $5,000—far less than hoped, and not enough to allow an October festival to occur. The move to April was prompted, in <b>part,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hope that a $75,000 D.C. government grant would allow the festival to occur. However, on March 8, 2011, RA officials cancelled the April event because of continuing heavy debt and because several grants had not been awarded to the organization. Festival organizers scheduled the 20th Reel Affirmations LGBTQ film festival for October 13–22, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, Rosetta {{was used}} to {{computationally}} design a protein with a function never before observed in nature. This was inspired in <b>part</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> retraction of a high-profile paper from 2004 which originally described the computational design of a protein with improved enzymatic activity relative to its natural form. The 2008 research paper from David Baker's group describing how the protein was made, which cited Rosetta@home for the computing resources it made available, represented an important proof of concept for this protein design method. This type of protein design could have future applications in drug discovery, green chemistry, and bioremediation.|$|E
