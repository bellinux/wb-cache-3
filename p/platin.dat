25|$|Chemotherapy in {{ovarian cancer}} {{typically}} consists of <b>platins,</b> {{a group of}} platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel. Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin {{in that it is}} less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and <b>platins</b> alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than <b>platins</b> and nonplatins in combination. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.|$|R

25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, <b>platins</b> are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or <b>platins.</b>|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Platin-induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy (PIPN) {{is a common}} cause of PN in cancer patients. The aim {{of this paper is}} to systematically review the current literature regarding PIPN, with a particular focus on epidemiological and clinical characteristics of painful PIPN, and to discuss relevant management strategies. METHODS: A systematic computer-based literature search was conducted on the PubMed database. RESULTS: This search strategy resulted in the identification of 353 articles. After the eligibility assessment, 282 articles were excluded. An additional 24 papers were identified by scanning the reference lists. In total, 95 papers met the inclusion criteria and were used for this review. The prevalence of neuropathic symptoms due to acute toxicity of oxaliplatin was estimated at 84. 6 %, whereas PN established after chemotherapy with <b>platins</b> was estimated at 74. 9 %. Specifically regarding pain, the reported prevalence of pain due to acute toxicity of oxaliplatin was estimated at 55. 6 %, whereas the reported prevalence of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain in PIPN was estimated at 49. 2 %. CONCLUSION: Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication in patients receiving <b>platins</b> and can be particularly painful. There is significant heterogeneity among studies regarding the method for diagnosing {{peripheral neuropathy}}. Nerve conduction studies are the gold standard and should be performed in patients receiving <b>platins</b> and complaining of neuropathic symptoms post-treatment...|$|R
50|$|Platinum-based antineoplastic drugs (informally called <b>platins)</b> are {{chemotherapeutic}} agents used {{to treat}} cancer. They are coordination complexes of platinum. These drugs are {{used to treat}} almost 50% of cancer patients. In this form of chemotherapy, popular drugs include cisplatin and carboplatin, but several have been proposed or are under development. Addition of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs to chemoradiation in women with early cervical cancer seems to improve survival and reduce risk of recurrence.|$|R
40|$|Chemotherapy-induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy (CIPN) is a potentially debilitating {{side effect of}} a number of chemotherapeutic agents that does not have any FDA-approved interventions or prevention strategies. Although the cellular mechanisms mediating CIPN remain to be determined, several lines of evidence support the notion that DNA damage may be a causative factor in neuropathy induced by a number of cancer therapies. Therapies including platinum agents and ionizing radiation cause DNA damage in sensory neurons and augmenting key steps in the base excision repair (BER) pathway reverses this damage. Neuronal protection is provided by overexpressing APE 1 as well as using a first generation targeted APE 1 small molecule E 3330 (also called APX 3330). Accordingly, we determined whether novel second-generation APE 1 targeted molecules would be protective against neurotoxicity-induced by cisplatin or oxaliplatin while not diminishing the anti-tumor effect of the <b>platins.</b> We determined using our ex vivo model of sensory neurons in culture measuring various endpoints of neurotoxicity that APX 2009 is an effective small molecule that is neuroprotective against cisplatin and oxaliplatin-induced toxicity of sensory neurons. APX 2009 also demonstrated a strong tumor cell killing effect in tumor cells. Additionally, the enhanced tumor cell killing was further shown in a more robust 3 D pancreatic tumor model. Together, these data suggest that APX 2009 is effective in preventing or reversing platinum-induced CIPN, while not affecting the anti-cancer activity of <b>platins...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractChemotherapy may be {{indicated}} in {{head and neck}} cancer: as induction, associated with radiation therapy, or as a palliative solution, in case of local or locoregional progression if surgery and radiation therapy are contraindicated, and/or in case of metastatic progression. The most frequently used anticancer agents are <b>platins,</b> antimetabolites (5 -fluorouracil, methotrexate) and taxanes. For several years now, in some indications, chemotherapy {{may be associated with}} targeted anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Prescription of chemotherapy and follow-up in head and neck cancer requires particular attention due to comorbidities related to alcohol abuse and smoking and frequent denutrition. Management thus requires close cooperation between the ENT physician, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists...|$|R
25|$|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors {{are another}} investigational drug class {{that may have}} {{applications}} in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have {{also been shown to}} increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with <b>platins</b> in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.|$|R
40|$|Germline {{variants}} within BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes {{account for}} approximately 25 % of familial aggregations of breast-ovarian cancers.

40|$|SummaryNasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} (NPC) is {{a specific}} entity different from head and neck carcinoma. Incidence is higher in South-East Asia and North Africa. Prognosis, especially for locally advanced stages (IIB - IVB) and metastasis, remains poor: more than third of cases will present local and/or metastatic recurrence. Overall 5 -year survival for all NPC stages ranges from 50 % to 70 %. The role of chemotherapy in metastasis is well established, and remains an important palliative treatment, although no randomized trial has been reported comparing the different chemotherapy regimens. As 1 st-line treatment, platin-based regimens seems optimal; in 2 nd line and after progression under <b>platins,</b> there is no consensus: monotherapy with drugs such as gemcitabine, capecitabine or taxanes {{has been the most}} widely tested, with acceptable results. Future trials should integrate targeted therapy, in the light of overexpression of EGFR 1 and C-kit in NPC. The present study presents {{a review of the literature}} concerning the various studies of metastatic NPC...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Reovirus type 3 Dearing (RT 3 D) {{replicates}} preferentially in Ras-activated cancers. RT 3 D shows synergistic {{in vitro}} cytotoxicity {{in combination with}} <b>platins</b> and taxanes. The purpose of this phase I/II study was to assess RT 3 D combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with advanced cancers. Experimental Design: Patients were initially treated in a dose-escalating, phase I trial with intravenous RT 3 D days 1 to 5, carboplatin [area under curve (AUC) 5, day 1] and paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2, day 1) 3 -weekly. RT 3 D was escalated through three dose levels: 3 × 109, 1 × 1010, and 3 × 1010 TCID 50 in cohorts of three. Primary endpoints were to define the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity and to recommend a dose for phase II studies. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, immune response, and antitumor activity. A subsequent phase II study using the 3 × 1010 TCID 50 dose characterized the response rate in patients with head and neck cancer. Results: Thirty-one heavily pretreated patients received study therapy. There were no dose-limiting toxicities during dose-escalation and most toxicities were grade I/II. Overall effectiveness rates were as follows: one patient had a complete response (3. 8...|$|R
40|$|The diverse {{effects of}} 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3), the bio-active form of vitamin D, on cancer cell {{metabolism}} and proliferation {{has made it}} an interesting candidate as a supporting therapeutic option in cancer treatment. An important strategy in cancer therapy {{is the use of}} combination chemotherapy to overcome drug resistance associated with numerous anti-cancer agents and to provide better means of avoiding undesirable side effects. This complex strategy is widely adopted by oncologists and several established “cocktails” of chemotherapeutics are routinely administered to cancer patients. Among the principles followed in designing such treatment regimens is the use of drugs with different mechanisms of action to overcome the issue of tumor heterogeneity and to evade resistance. In light of the profound and diverse effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 reported by in vitro and in vivo studies, we discuss how these effects could support the use of this molecule in combination with “classical” cytotoxic drugs, such as <b>platins</b> and anti-metabolites, for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors. We also examine recent evidence supporting synergistic activities with other promising anti-cancer drug candidates, and postulate mechanisms through which 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 may help evade chemoresistance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{standard}} of care for ovarian cancer includes platinum-based chemotherapy. It is not possible, however, to predict clinical platinum sensitivity or to design rational strategies to overcome resistance. We used a novel approach to identify altered gene expression associated with high sensitivity to cisplatin, to define novel targets to sensitize tumor cells to <b>platins</b> and ultimately improve {{the effectiveness of this}} widely used class of chemotherapeutics. Experimental Design: Using differential display PCR, we identified genes differentially expressed in a mutagenized cell line with unusual sensitivity to cisplatin. The most highly differentially expressed gene was selected, and its role in determining cisplatin sensitivity was validated by gene transfection and small interfering RNA (siRNA) approaches, by association of expression levels with cisplatin sensitivity in cell lines, and by association of tumor expression levels with survival in a retrospective cohort of 71 patients with serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. Results: The most highly differently expressed gene identified was ANKRD 1, ankyrin repeat domain 1 (cardiac muscle). ANKRD 1 mRNA levels were correlated with platinum sensitivity in cell lines, and most significantly, decreasing ANKRD 1 using siRNA increased cisplatin sensitivity > 2 -fold. ANKRD 1 was expressed in the majority of ovarian adenocarcinomas tested (62 / 71, 87 %), and higher tumor levels of ANKRD 1 were found in patients with worse outcome (overall survival, P = 0. 013). Conclusions: These findings suggest that ANKRD 1, a gene not previously associated with ovarian cancer or with response to chemotherapy, is associated with treatment outcome, and decreasing ANKRD 1 expression, or function, is a potential strategy to sensitize tumors to platinum-based drugs. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{generate}} new platinum compounds that may be effective {{in the treatment of}} cancer, as well as having a lower toxicity than traditional <b>platins</b> and being orally viable, we are studing the synthesis and reactivity of platinum complexes of tetraazamacrocycles bearing carboxylato pendant arms. We have synthesized adducts of meso- and rac- 5, 5, 7, 12, 12, 14 -hexamethyl- 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazacyclotetradecane- 1, 7 -diacetic acid ((LH 2) -H- 1). The meso-(PtL 1) -L-II complex is unstable with respect to disproportionation, forming platinum metal and [meso-(PtL 1) -L-IV](2 +). The rac-isomer shows less tendency to disproportionate. Cyclic voltammetry suggests that the rac-(PtL 1) -L-II complex undergoes two one-electron oxidations. Using bis-triazacyclononanenickel(III), [Ni-III(tacn) (2) ](3 +) as an outer-sphere oxidant, the self-exchange rate for the [Pt-II/L-III](0 /+) couple has been estimated at 0. 034 M- 1 s(- 1).
