This is a study of determining the using possibilities of modern meta-heuristic hybrid artificial intelligence techniques such as IKE and AANN methods for prediction of bonding strength of <b>plywood</b> <b>panels.</b> This study has composed of two main parts as experimental and analytical. Scots pine, maritime pine and European black pine logs were used as wood species. The pine veneers peeled at 32 °C and 50 °C were dried at 110 °C, 140 °C and 160 °C temperatures.

For analysis, three panels of five layers, with dimensions of 350 x 350 x 15. 5 mm each, were employed. The tests were based on the standards EN 323 - 2000, EN 322 - 2000 and ABNT NBR 9486 - 2011. Statistical modeling was performed using the R software, using the methodology of geostatistics. The average results were compared with values reported in the literature. The average water absorption was 7 % higher in comparison with other studies, which used urea formaldehyde. So, the product can be applied only to interior and their use is not advisable for floors; the average moisture content and density were within the average values found in the literature.

In parallel layers, the highest values of the s vm (Von Mises) stress were distributed along the narrow or central region of the test piece, which also represents the desired stress distribution. Contrary to this, in perpendicular layers, the stress distribution is concentrated at the transition between the narrow and wider areas, which indicates the presence of a significant problem in determining the tensile properties of <b>plywood</b> <b>panels.</b> The study results also indicate that the shear component t xy accounts for a significant share of the total stress and that its influence on the overall stress is significantly more pronounced in perpendicular layers.

50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} stitching together <b>plywood</b> <b>panels</b> {{with some sort}} of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the <b>plywood</b> <b>panels</b> of the hull are simple methods of clamping the hull parts together before they are permanently welded or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the fused <b>plywood</b> <b>panels</b> behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel electric fencing wire can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the joining edges and stitched. Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass {{on the inside of the}} hull.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Formaldehyde-based {{adhesives}} such as urea-formaldehyde (UF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesives {{dominate the}} current wood adhesive market. However, these adhesives {{are derived from}} petrochemicals and carcinogenic formaldehyde. In this study, we developed two formaldehyde-free adhesives based on abundant, renewable, and inexpensive soy flour (SF). The first adhesive was mainly composed of SF, polyethylenimine (PEI), and maleic anhydride (MA). The optimum formulation of this adhesive and the optimum hot-press conditions for making plywood were investigated. A three-cycle soak test and a boiling water test (BWT) were employed to evaluate the strength and water-resistance of plywood bonded with the soy flour-based adhesive. Results showed that SF, PEI, MA and NaOH were all essential components for the adhesive and the SF/PEI/MA weight ratio of 7 / 1. 0 / 0. 32 resulted in the highest water-resistance. When the hot-press temperature was {{in the range of}} 140 - 170 ºC, both the water-resistance and the shear strengths of plywood bonded with the adhesive remained statistically the same, except that the dry shear strength of plywood at 170 ºC was statistically lower than that at 160 ºC. When the hot-press time ranged from 2 to 6 min at 160 ºC, the <b>plywood</b> <b>panels</b> made at the hot-press time of 5 min led to the highest boiling water test/wet (BWT/w) shear strength among all samples, and the <b>plywood</b> <b>panel</b> made at the hot-press time of 5 min had a higher dry shear strength than that at 3 min. <b>Plywood</b> <b>panels</b> bonded with this SF/PEI/MA adhesive exceeded the water-resistance requirements for interior applications.

The effects of these catalysts on the water-resistance of plywood bonded with the SF-TMTE adhesive under different hot-press conditions were investigated. It was found that all catalysts improved the water-resistance of the resulting plywood to some extent. Among all catalysts investigated, calcium hydroxide and triethylamine were better than other catalysts in terms of improving the water-resistance of the resulting <b>plywood</b> <b>panels.</b> These preliminary results also revealed that increasing hot-press temperature and increasing hot-press time enhanced the water-resistance.
