40|$|<b>Contoured</b> <b>charts</b> {{are widely}} used to {{visualize}} 2 D physical fields. Experts can identify global patterns and structures in a <b>contoured</b> <b>chart</b> {{by looking at the}} isocurves and reasoning about their spatial relations. We develop an algorithm for computing the topological adjacency relations between iso-contours. The algorithm is novel in that it grounds the computation of spatial relations between aggregate spatial objects upon the computation of relations between the constituents. It is scale-independent and efficient. We present an application of the algorithm to weather data analysis for extracting patterns from numerical weather datasets. Introduction <b>Contoured</b> <b>charts</b> have been widely used to visualize 2 D physical fields. They abstract out local fluctuations and retain global patterns, and are a concise and qualitative intermediary representation often suitable for studying the global behaviors of physical fields.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{adequately}} design a pavement system, attention {{must be paid}} to the subgrade. This thesis attempts to formulate such a design method based on the expected traffic volumes, the subgrade material properties, and material behaviour. The methodology described in this thesis involves two main phases. The first phase develops a relationship between the vertical strain produced {{at the top of the}} subgrade and a combination of five axle loads and three base thicknesses. This relationship is based on constitutive equations and the finite element method. These fifteen relationships shown as strain contours are for a specific material, and can be used to find the critical strain for a given axle load and base thickness. The second phase of this thesis deals with the development of a pavement design method using vertical strain <b>contour</b> <b>charts.</b> These strain <b>contour</b> <b>charts</b> have been developed using constitutive equations and the finite element method for different types of soil parameters and behaviors. This method then utilizes equations from the Asphalt Institute design method to determine base thickness and the life of the subgrade. Numerical examples of the design method have been provided. A set of computer programs have been developed for the finite element analysis. These programs have been unified under a menu program (FINITE) and are capable of finding the stress-strain distributions in the subgrad...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{recurrence}} of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after surgery {{needs to be}} estimated when considering adjuvant systemic therapy. We assessed prognostic factors of patients with operable GIST, to compare widely used risk-stratification schemes {{and to develop a}} new method for risk estimation. METHODS: Population-based cohorts of patients diagnosed with operable GIST, who were not given adjuvant therapy, were identified from the literature. Data from ten series and 2560 patients were pooled. Risk of tumour recurrence was stratified using the National Institute of Health (NIH) consensus criteria, the modified consensus criteria, and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria. Prognostic factors were examined using proportional hazards and non-linear models. The results were validated in an independent centre-based cohort consisting of 920 patients with GIST. FINDINGS: Estimated 15 -year recurrence-free survival (RFS) after surgery was 59 · 9 % (95 % CI 56 · 2 - 63 · 6); few recurrences occurred after the first 10 years of follow-up. Large tumour size, high mitosis count, non-gastric location, presence of rupture, and male sex were independent adverse prognostic factors. In receiver operating characteristics curve analysis of 10 -year RFS, the NIH consensus criteria, modified consensus criteria, and AFIP criteria resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0 · 79 (95 % CI 0 · 76 - 0 · 81), 0 · 78 (0 · 75 - 0 · 80), and 0 · 82 (0 · 80 - 0 · 85), respectively. The modified consensus criteria identified a single high-risk group. Since tumour size and mitosis count had a non-linear association with the risk of GIST recurrence, novel <b>prognostic</b> <b>contour</b> maps were generated using non-linear modelling of tumour size and mitosis count, and taking into account tumour site and rupture. The non-linear model accurately predicted the risk {{of recurrence}} (AUC 0 · 88, 0 · 86 - 0 · 90). INTERPRETATION: The risk-stratification schemes assessed identify patients who are likely to be cured by surgery alone. Although the modified NIH classification is the best criteria to identify a single high-risk group for consideration of adjuvant therapy, the <b>prognostic</b> <b>contour</b> maps resulting from non-linear modelling are appropriate for estimation of individualised outcomes.

The results show that negatively raked tips give a more uniform distribution of air pressure {{than any of the other}} three arrangements, because the tip vortex does not disturb the flow at the trailing edge.

Such signals have been recorded digitally over a variety of seafloor environments for which independent observations from bottom photographs or sidescan sonars were available. An attempt is made to relate the statistical properties of the bottom‐backscattered sound field to the independently observed geologicalcharacteristics of the seafloor surveyed. Acoustic boundary mapping over flat areas is achieved by following trend changes in the acoustic data both along and across track. Such changes in the acoustics are found to correlate with changes in bottom type or roughness structure. The overall energy level of a partial angular‐dependence function of backscattering appears to depend strongly on bottom type, whereas the shape of the function does not. Clues to the roughness structure of the bottom are obtained by relating the shape of the probability density function of normal‐incidence echo envelopes to the degree of coherence in the backscattered acoustic field...|$|R

Numerical results demonstrated that the DBFP showed 2 D axisymmetry at ± 90 ˚ and three-di-mensional (3 D) asymmetry at any other posture with G ≠ 0, and 2 D axisymmetrical one at any posture with G = 0.

40|$|Road tunnels {{are vital}} {{infrastructures}} providing underground vehicular passageways for commuters and motorists. Various {{quantitative risk assessment}} (QRA) models have recently been developed and employed to evaluate the safety levels of road tunnels in terms of societal risk (as measured by the F/N curve). For a particular road tunnel, traffic volume and proportion of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are two adjustable parameters that may significantly affect the societal risk, and are thus very useful in implementing risk reduction solutions. To evaluate the impact the two contributing factors have on the risk, this article first presents an approach that employs a QRA model to generate societal risk {{for a series of}} possible combinations of the two factors. Some combinations may result in F/N curves that do not fulfill a predetermined safety target. This article thus proposes an "excess risk index" in order to quantify the road tunnel risk magnitudes that do not pass the safety target. The two-factor impact analysis can be illustrated by a <b>contour</b> <b>chart</b> based on the excess risk. Finally, the methodology has been applied to Singapore's KPE road tunnel and the results show that in terms of meeting the test safety target for societal risk, the traffic capacity of the tunnel should be no more than 1, 200 vehs/h/lane, with a maximum proportion of 18 % HGVs.
