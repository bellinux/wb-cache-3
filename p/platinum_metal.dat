25|$|Indium is {{the fourth}} element of the boron group but was {{discovered}} before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium. In 1863 Ferdinand Reich and his assistant, Hieronymous Theodor Richter, were looking {{in a sample of}} the mineral zinc blende, also known as sphalerite (ZnS), for the spectroscopic lines of the newly discovered element thallium. Reich heated the ore in a coil of <b>platinum</b> <b>metal</b> and observed the lines that appeared in a spectroscope. Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue. Concluding that it must come from a new element, they named it after the characteristic indigo color it had produced.|$|E
25|$|A {{electrode}} typically {{consists of}} carbon support, Pt particles, Nafion ionomer, and/or Teflon binder. The carbon support functions as an electrical conductor; the Pt particles are reaction sites; the ionomer provides paths for proton conduction, and the Teflon binder increases the hydrophobicity of the electrode to minimize potential flooding. In order {{to enable the}} electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, protons, electrons and the reactant gases (hydrogen or oxygen) must {{gain access to the}} surface of the catalyst in the electrodes, while the product water, which can be in either liquid or gaseous phase, or both phases, must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet. These properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder (ionomer) and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles. Typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios (as further described below) reducing the amount of the costly platinum. The polymer electrolyte binder provides the ionic conductivity, while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the electric conductivity and enables low <b>platinum</b> <b>metal</b> loading. The electric conductivity in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity.|$|E

40|$|In {{this review}} the {{advances}} in and {{problems associated with}} the prepara-tion, structure and practical applications of macromolecular <b>platinum</b> <b>metals</b> chelates (MPMC) are presented and assessed. The terminology, classijkation and nomenclature of MPMC are considered and special attention is paid to their preparation and structural features. Some applications of MPMC are described. During the last two decades the chemistry of macromolecular <b>platinum</b> <b>metals</b> chelates (MPMC) has received much attention. The chelation of <b>platinum</b> <b>metals</b> by polymeric ligands is widely used, for example, for the preparation of efficient polymeric catalysts (I), for membrane filtration of solutions containing low concentrations of <b>platinum</b> <b>metals</b> (2, 3), and in ion exchange (4, 5). Important theoretical pro-blems in the polymeric and co-ordination chemistry of MPMC, such as macromolecular reactivity, the nature of bonding in metal chelates and the distortion of ligands have also been investigated. Terminology, Classification and Nomenclature of the MPMC High molecular weight homo- and heterochain compounds with pendant metal chelates (I) (6) or where the chelates form crosslinks (II) (7) to the chain are usually called macromolecular metal chelates, as shown below. Here the symbol-denotes a polymeric chain. In contrast to co-ordination polymers which are described in detail elsewhere (8, 9) MPMC do not contain metal in the polymer backbone, thus the metal can be easily removed or substituted by other metals without breaking the main chain of the macromolecule. Similarly other <b>platinum</b> <b>metals</b> complexes with chelates which act as ion-exchange resins (3 - 5, 10) should also be related to macromolecular <b>platinum</b> <b>metals</b> chelates. The parameters used in MPMC classification, the classes and typical examples of MPMC (I I- 21) are listed in Table I.
