5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are harmless to humans.

IS 200 pattern was a stable epidemiological marker in strains of all <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> except PT 6 a and 14 b. Ribotyping separated strains of the <b>phage</b> <b>types</b> into one major and five minor groups; the pattern of the RDNC strain was not seen with other strains. More than one ribotype was observed among strains of Enteritidis PTs 6, 7, 14 b and 21.

A possible factor in determining the host range of particular serovars is phage-mediated acquisition of a small number of genetic elements that enable infection of a particular host.

50|$|Dating {{back to the}} 1940s till date, T-even phages are {{considered}} the best studied model organisms. Model organisms are usually required to be simple with as few as five genes. Yet, T-even phages are in fact among the largest and highest complexity virus, in which these phages genetic information {{is made up of}} around 160 genes. Coincident with their complexity, T-even viruses were found to have an unimaginable feature of no other, the presence of the unusual base hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC) in place of the nucleic acid base cytosine. In addition to this, the HMC residues on the T-even phage are glucosylated in a specific pattern. This unique feature allowed the formation of new enzymes that never existed in T-even infected cells or any other cell and modifying T-even phage DNA provided a basic underlying advancement in viral and molecular levels. Other unique features of the T-even virus is its regulated gene expression. These unique features and other features gave significance of the T-even phages, this includes transduction which is responsible for transfer of drug resistant features, lysogenic conversion is responsible for acquisition of new characteristics such as the formation of new enzymes, random insertion into bacterial chromosome can induce insertional mutation, epidemiological typing of bacteria (<b>phage</b> <b>typing),</b> phages are used extensively in genetic engineering where they serve as cloning vectors. Libraries of genes and monoclonal antibodies are maintained in phages. In addition to all this they are responsible for natural removal of bacteria from water bodies.|$|E
50|$|Barber's {{research}} {{was focused on}} the staphylococcus bacterium as well as various aspects of antibiotics, especially development of penicillin-resistant bacteria. Her first scientific paper was published in 1937 and concerned meningitis caused by the Listeria bacterium. In 1947, she published her best-known work, on penicillin resistance in staphylocci, proving that the bacteria were becoming more resistant to the drug over time, using the new technique of <b>phage</b> <b>typing.</b> She found that this was because bacteria with mutations that caused them to synthesize a penicillin-destroying enzyme were selected during treatment with antibiotics, leading to rapid spread of a single antibiotic-resistant strain throughout the hospital. Between 1948 and 1958, her focus shifted to cross-infection by Staphylococcus in hospitals, which she found to be caused by penicilin-resistant bacteria and the nurses became nasal carriers soon after working on the wards. After she returned to BPMS (British Postgraduate Medical School) in 1958, she expanded upon this work, making a clear case for limiting antibiotic use and combining drugs for maximum effect and minimal increases in drug resistance; these studies were carried out at St. Thomas' Hospital. The policies implemented {{as a result of her}} work caused antibiotic resistance observed in the hospital to drop dramatically. After her successful publications, Barber was hired by the Medical Research Council to study semisynthetic penicillin, cephalosporin, fucidin, lincomycin, and pristinamycin. In 1963, she published Antibiotic and Chemotherapy with L. P. Garrod, an encyclopedic work on the characteristics and medical uses of various antibiotics.
