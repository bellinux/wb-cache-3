50|$|Other {{fluoropolymers}} tend to {{have similar}} properties to PTFE—high chemical resistance and good dielectric properties—which leads {{to use in the}} chemical process industry and electrical insulation. They are easier to work with (to form into complex shapes), but are more expensive than PTFE and have lower thermal stability. Fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> is the second most produced fluoropolymer. Films from two different fluoropolymers serve as glass-replacements in solar cells.|$|R
50|$|One {{solution}} to this problem involves growing cells on an MEA inside a sealed chamber. This chamber serves as a non-humidified incubator that is enclosed by a fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> membrane that is permeable to select gases (i.e. gases necessary for metabolism) but impermeable to water and microbes. Other solutions entail an incubator with an impermeable membrane that has a specific mix of gases (air with 5% CO2 is typical) sealed inside.|$|R

The model is able to describe electric breakdown in the polymer voids and {{takes into account the}} electrostatic forces between the interface charges. The bulk behavior is described by a Maxwell stress based electromechanical model which may account for finite deformations. The 2 D finite element simulations focus on a cell of fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> containing lens-shaped porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The simulations for a loading-unloading history show that, depending on the void size, breakdown in the ePTFE lenses takes place consecutively...|$|R

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared, and thermal analyses did not detect a significant change at the molecular level as the result of this exposure. However, various microscopic analyses revealed a roughening of the coating surface due to atomic oxygen erosion which resulted in some materials changing from specular reflectors of visible radiation to diffuse reflectors. The potential effect of silicon-containing molecular contamination on these materials is addressed...|$|R

40|$|Examination of {{fluorinated}} ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> copolymer materials {{recovered from}} the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) reveals differing damage characteristics on leading edge (ram-facing) versus trailing edge (wake-facing surfaces). Silver/Teflon (Ag/FEP) thermal control materials on ram facing surfaces of the LDEF exhibited obvious degradation, with an apparent increase in diffuse light scattering, whereas identical materials on the wake facing surfaces showed little apparent damage with cursory inspection. Microscopic examination of both types of surfaces reveals {{the nature and extent}} of environment induced degradation of materials. The ram facing surfaces were clearly eroded by atomic oxygen impingement, while the wake facing material developed a thin, highly embrittled surface layer...|$|R

The atomic oxygen erosion yield for FEP Teflon {{was found to}} be significantly in excess of previous low fluence orbital data and is an order of magnitude below that of polyimide Kapton. LDEF FEP Teflon erosion yield data as a function of angle of attack is presented. Atomic oxygen interaction with silicon polymers results in crazing of the silicones as well as deposition of dark contaminant oxidation products on adjoining surfaces. Documentation of results and possible mechanistic explanations are presented...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We report small-angle neutron {{scattering}} studies of grafted copolymer films of perfluorinated poly(ethylene <b>propylene),</b> <b>FEP,</b> base polymer and polystyrene, PS, grafted blocks. The films show highly anisotropic scattering patterns, revealing nematic-like ordering of the crystalline domain structure {{as a consequence}} of the processing conditions. Upon grafting, the styrene swells the amorphous domains in the copolymer formation. For styrene content beyond roughly 15 %, the amorphous regimes increase on the cost of crystalline domains. To stabilize the rather well-defined domain structure already given by the original FEP base material, the sam-ples need to be cross-linked. Without cross-linking, the nanometer length scale domains vanish, and some large scale structure takes over, likely driven by th...|$|R
40|$|Examination of {{fluorinated}} ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> copolymer specimens {{recovered from}} the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) provides evidence for degradation attributed to extended solar vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of sheared FEP film edges reveal {{the presence of a}} highly embrittled layer on the exposed surface of specimens obtained from the trailing edge of the LDEF. Similar images obtained for leading edge and control FEP films do not exhibit evidence for such an embrittled layer. Laboratory VUV irradiation of FEP films is found to produce a damage layer similar to that witnessed in the LDEF trailing edge films. Spectroscopic analyses of irradiated films provide data to advance a photochemical mechanism for degradation...|$|R
40|$|The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) {{spacecraft}} {{has enabled}} {{the measurement of}} the effects of fixed orientation exposure of high fluence atomic oxygen on fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP</b> Teflon) and silicones. The atomic oxygen erosion yield for the FEP Teflon was found to be 3. 64 x 10 (exp - 25) cm(exp 3) /atom. This erosion yield is significantly higher than that measured from previous low fluence orbital data. The FEP Teflon erosion yield was found to have the same dependence on oxygen arrival angle as Kapton and Mylar. Atomic oxygen interaction with silicon polymers results in the crazing of silicon. Released silicone contaminants were found to darken upon further atomic oxygen exposure...|$|R
50|$|Perfluoroalkoxy alkanes or PFA are fluoropolymers. They are {{copolymers}} of tetrafluoroethylene (C2F4) and perfluoroethers (C2F3ORf, where Rf is a perfluorinated group such as trifluoromethyl (CF3)). In {{terms of}} their properties, these polymers are similar to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The big {{difference is that the}} alkoxy substituents allow the polymer to be melt-processed. On a molecular level, PFA has a smaller chain length, and higher chain entanglement than other fluoropolymers. It also contains an oxygen atom at the branches. This results in a material that is more translucent and has improved flow, creep resistance, and thermal stability close to or exceeding PTFE. Similarly advantaged processing properties are found in fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP),</b> the copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene.|$|R
40|$|Cumulative space {{environment}} effects on Ag/fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> were {{a function of}} exposure orientation. Samples from nineteen silvered Teflon (Ag/FEP) thermal control surfaces recovered from the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) were analyzed to determine changes in this material {{as a function of}} position on the spacecraft. Although solar absorptance and infrared emittance of measured thermal blanket specimens are relatively unchanged from control specimen values, significant changes in surface morphology, composition and chemistry were observed. Researchers hypothesize that the FEP surfaces on LDEF were degraded by ultraviolet radiation exposure at all orientations, but that the damaged material had been removed by erosion from the blankets exposed to atomic oxygen flux and that contamination is masking the damage on trays flanking the trailing edge...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} characterization of selected polymeric materials which received exposure on the LDEF is reported. The specimens examined include silvered fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> teflon thermal blanket material, polysulfone matrix resin/graphite fiber reinforced composites, and several high performance polymer films. These specimens came from numerous LDEF locations and, thus, received different environmental exposures. The results of infrared, thermal, x ray photoelectron, and various solution property analyses have shown {{no significant change}} {{at the molecular level}} in the polymer that survived exposure. However, scanning electron and scanning tunneling microscopies show resin loss and a texturing of the surface of some specimens which resulted in a change in optical properties. The potential effect of a silicon containing molecular contamination on these materials is addressed. The possibility of continued post-exposure degradation of some polymeric films is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} and optical {{properties of the}} metallized Teflon Fluorinated Ethylene <b>Propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> thermal control materials on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have degraded over the seven years the telescope has been in orbit. Astronaut observations and photographic documentation from the Second Servicing Mission revealed severe cracks of the multi-layer insulation (MLI) blanket outer layer in many locations around the telescope, particularly on solar facing surfaces. Two samples, the outer Teflon FEP MLI layer and radiator surfaces, were characterized post- mission through exhaustive mechanical, thermal, chemical, and optical testing. The observed damage to the thermal control materials, the sample retrieval and handling, and the significant changes to the radiator surfaces of HST will be discussed. Each of these issues is addressed with respect to current and future mission requirements...|$|R
40|$|Microarc {{oxidation}} (MAO) coatings {{were prepared}} on 2024 -T 4 aluminum alloys using a pulsed {{bipolar power supply}} at different anode pulse-widths. After the MAO coatings were formed, the micropores and microcracks {{on the surface of}} the MAO coatings were filled with Fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> dispersion for preparing MAO self-lubricating composite coatings containing FEP. The effect of the anode pulse-width on the microstructure and wear resistance of the microarc oxidation coatings was investigated. The wear resistance of the microarc oxidation self-lubricating composite coatings was analyzed. The results revealed that the MAO self-lubricating composite coatings integrated the advantages of wear resistance of the MAO ceramic coatings and a low friction coefficient of FEP. Compared to the MAO coatings, the microarc oxidation self-lubricating composite coatings exhibited a lower friction coefficient and lower wear rates...|$|R
40|$|A {{micrographic}} {{investigation is}} reported of {{samples of the}} fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> Teflon thermal-blanketing materials recovered from the Long-Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) satellite. The samples are taken from the trailing edge and row 8 which correspond to exposures to vacuum UV (VUV) and VUV + atomic O, respectively. Data are taken from SEM and IR-spectra observations, and the LDEF leading-edge FEP shows {{a high degree of}} erosion, roughening, and sharp peaks angled {{in the direction of the}} flow of atomic O. The trailing edge sample influenced primarily by VUV shows a hard brittle layer and some cracked mosaic patterns. Comparisons to a reference sample suggest that the brittle layer is related to exposure to VUV and is removed by atomic-O impingement. Polymers that are stable to VUV radiation appear to be more stable in terms of atomic oxygen...|$|R

Charging behaviors of this dielectric material, under electron beam irradiation, is {{of special interest}} for future spacecraft needs. Hence, ground experimental parameters have been adjusted in order {{to distinguish between the}} different physical mechanisms that steers FEP charging potential. The effect of incident electron spectrum, electric field, and dose rate has been investigated through surface potential measurements during and after the irradiation process. The experimental results especially reveal that charging potential evolution as a function of time is not strongly dependent upon the electron spectrum and the electric field but varies noticeably with dose rate. These results have been analyzed in the light of a physical model that takes into account ionization, trapping/detrapping, and recombination mechanisms for negative and positive charges...|$|R

An average 4. 3 % relative increase in the short-circuit current density (JSC) was recorded for the Calyxo cadmium telluride (CdTe) modules after the best LDS layer was applied. The LDS layers consisted of a 0. 5 mm thick ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) host doped with Lumogen F Violet 570 and Yellow 083 dyes with a 0. 127 mm thick top encapsulation sheet of fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP).</b> The same LDS layer was also applied to mini-modules (10 cm × 10 cm) cut from production line modules, sold as CX 3, which resulted in a JSC increase of 7 %.

40|$|The {{chemical}} characterization of several polymeric materials which received 10 months of exposure and 5. 8 years of exposure on a Row 9 Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) experiment (A 0134) is reported. Specimens include fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> teflon film, polysulfone film, and graphite fiber reinforced epoxy amd polysulfone matrix composites. The responses {{of these materials}} to the two LEO exposures are compared. The results of infrared, thermal, x-ray photoelectron, and scanning electron microscope analyses are reported. Solution property measurements of various molecular weight parameters are presented for the thermoplastic polysulfone materials. Molecular level effects attributable to exposure that were present in 10 -month exposed specimens were not found in 5. 8 -year exposed specimens. This result suggests that increased atomic oxygen fluence {{toward the end of}} the LDEF mission may have eroded away selected environmentally induced changes in surface chemistry for 5. 8 -year exposure specimens...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple device for {{multiplex}} quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA) {{made from a}} novel melt-extruded microcapillary film (MCF) containing a parallel array of 200 µm capillaries along its length. To make ELISA devices different protein antigens or antibodies were immobilised inside individual microcapillaries within long reels of MCF extruded from fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP).</b> Short pieces of coated film were cut and interfaced with a pipette, allowing sequential uptake of samples and detection solutions into all capillaries from a reagent well. As well as being simple to produce, these FEP MCF devices have excellent light transmittance allowing direct optical interrogation of the capillaries for simple signal quantification. Proof of concept experiments demonstrate both quantitative and multiplex assays in FEP MCF devices using a standard direct ELISA procedure and read using a flatbed scanner. This new multiplex immunoassay platform should find applications ranging from lab detection to point-of-care and field diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNovel {{broadband}} ultra-antireflective surfaces {{were created}} via the electrodeposition of a nanostructured zinc oxide thin film onto conductive, light absorbing periodic nanocone arrays. Nanocone arrays of (i) fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> {{coated with a}} 50 nm plasmonic gold thin film and (ii) the electroactive polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) exhibited a very low broadband reflectivity of less than 0. 1 % from 475 to 800 nm at {{a wide range of}} incident angles after the electrodeposition of a nanostructured ZnO thin film onto the surface. SEM images reveal the formation of ZnO nanoflowers and nanorods on both nanocone array surfaces; these additional ZnO nanostructures enhance the coupling of the incident visible light into the absorptive gold or PEDOT nanocones to significantly reduce the reflectivity of these surfaces.

40|$|Metallized Teflon {{fluorinated}} ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> {{thermal control}} insulation is mechanically degraded if {{exposed to a}} sufficient fluence of soft x-ray radiation. Soft x-ray photons (4 - 8 A in wavelength or 1. 55 - 3. 2 keV) emitted during solar flares have been proposed {{as a cause of}} mechanical properties degradation of aluminized Teflon FEP thermal control insulation on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Such degradation can be characterized by a reduction in elongation-to-failure of the Teflon FEP. Ground laboratory soft x-ray exposure tests of aluminized Teflon FEP were conducted to assess the degree of elongation degradation which would occur as a result of exposure to soft x-rays in the range of 3 - 10 keV. Tests results indicate that soft x-ray exposure in the 3 - 10 keV range, at mission fluence levels, does not alone cause the observed reduction in elongation of flight retrieved samples.

The inlet and outlet of the DFC were coupled with a Tekran Model 2537 A mercury (Hg) vapor analyzer using a Tekran Model 1110 two port synchronized sampler. The surface GEM flux ranged from - 4. 47 ng m(- 2) hr(- 1) to 9. 89 ng m(- 2) hr(- 1). For most sample periods, daytime GEM flux was strongly correlated with solar radiation. The average nighttime GEM flux was slightly negative and was not well correlated with any of the measured meteorological variables. Preliminary, empirical models were developed to estimate GEM emissions from snow surfaces in northern New York. These models suggest that most, if not all, of the Hg deposited with and to snow is reemitted to the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Belden’s Haloarrest jacket {{offers a}} unique {{solution}} to fit many applications. The Haloarrest jacket is a Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH) alternative to traditional wire and cable jacket compounds. Cables with the Haloarrest LSZH jacket provide a useful alternative for industries that require restricted use of halogenated products. Materials that contain halogens emit potentially harmful and corrosive gases {{when they are}} burned. Haloarrest jacketed cables offer excellent flame resistance, low smoke properties, and reduced toxicity. Halogen containing polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> are widely used in wire and cable applications. PVC and FEP hold many benefits, the most notable being inherent flame retardancy. Some applications require a material where the unique properties of the Haloarrest, containing no halogens, is a better solution. Applications in which the Haloarrest jacket is most suitable include instrumentation and control cables, industrial data cables, shipboard cables, and circuit integrity cables. In Europe, halogen free wire and cable products are used extensively. The change t...|$|R
40|$|Fluorinated {{ethylene}} <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> {{films were}} made superhydrophobic by Ar[*]+[*]O 2 plasma etching process. Field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} and atomic force microscopy studies of the plasma-treated FEP samples detected the presence of uniformly distributed nano-protrusions exhibiting a low surface roughness necessary for maintaining the transparency of the samples. In fact, optical transmittance measurements showed an improvement in the transparency of FEP samples after plasma treatment. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis showed the presence of –CF x –O–CF x – (x[*]=[*] 1, 2, or 3) linkages in both untreated and plasma-treated samples which explains the hydrophilic nature (contact angle below 90 ∘) of the untreated sample. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed no changes in the bulk properties of the plasma-treated samples. Moreover, exposure to the environment caused the surfaces to lose their superhydrophobic property in an indefinite amount of time. This has been further studied through a water immersion experiment and explained through the wetting state transition from Cassie state to Wenzel state...|$|R
40|$|Samples of polyimide, {{polypropylene}} (PP), {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE), and fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP)</b> {{were exposed}} to 500 MGy of radiation from an 8 MeV electron accelerator. These dosages were intended to mimic the radiation exposure of spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit. This radiation can create atomic scale defect states within the molecular bonds in these polymers and change their basic mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. Recent work has suggested that previously identified defect states are sensitive to atmospheric exposure (more specific oxygen and water) and these defect states will recover and eventually vanish with time. Failure to consider and characterize such recovery, can create inaccuracies in radiation damage studies, and has called into question previous work studying the effects of radiation on spacecraft materials. In order {{to better understand the}} relaxation of these defect states, optical-transmission spectra were taken at intervals after atmospheric exposure. They were then compared with each other to evaluate the effects of atmospheric exposure and time, on the polymers defect states...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, micro-porous layers (MPLs) for polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFCs) are commonly deposited onto gas diffusion layer (GDL) substrates starting from hydrophobic carbon-based dispersions. In this work, different quantities of fluorinated ethylene <b>propylene</b> (<b>FEP),</b> a fluorinated copolymer {{proven to be}} superior to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for a proper water management, were used to make both GDL and MPL hydrophobic. After {{the identification of the}} optimal amount of FEP, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was also added to gas diffusion media (GDM) to reduce overall ohmic resistance of the whole device and adhesion of MPLs to GDLs. Ex-situ chemical and mechanical accelerated stress tests (ASTs) were carried out to accelerate degradation of materials aiming to assess their durability. The highest quantity of FEP in GDMs led to the best electrochemical and diffusive properties. The presence of CMC allowed reducing overall ohmic resistance due to a better electrolyte hydration. A satisfactory durability was proven since the fundamental properties related to gas diffusion medium, such as wettability, ohmic and mass transport resistances, revealed to be quasi-stable upon ASTs...|$|R

The {{influence of the}} deposition parameters (argon and oxygen flow rates, and substrate temperature) and effect of coating thickness on the optical, electrical, structural and microstructural properties of ITO thin films deposited on FEP was investigated. The thickness of the ITO coatings was varied from 10 to 180 nm. The optimized ITO coating (10 nm thick) exhibited high IR emittance (79 %) on FEP substrate with high average solar transmittance (94 %) and moderate sheet resistance (3 kΩ/sq.). We also investigated in detail the angular dependence of reflectance as well as haze factor of thin ITO coatings. Our results suggest that 10 nm thick ITO coating exhibits an average haze factor of 8. 6 %. The high value of IR emittance, moderate sheet resistance and high solar transmittance along with low haze factor indicate the suitability of ITO thin films on FEP substrates as flexible optical solar reflector for space applications...|$|R

Surfaces of silicon and glass substrates are chemically modified with APTES bearing amine terminal groups, while FEP sheet surfaces are treated to form carboxyl groups and subsequently activated by means of EDC-NHS chemistry. The activation procedures of silicon, glass and FEP sheet are characterized by contact angle measurements and XPS. Robust bonds are created at room-temperature by simply pressing two amine-terminated substrates together with activated FEP sheet in between.

In each experiment, a specimen of ablative material was mounted on a torsion pendulum and irradiated with a laser pulse having an energy of 5 J. The amplitude of the resulting rotation of the torsion pendulum was taken to be an indication of the momentum transferred from the laser beam. Of the ablative materials tested, aluminum foils yielded the smallest rotation amplitudes of the order of 10 degrees. Black coating materials yielded rotation amplitudes of the order of 90 degrees.
