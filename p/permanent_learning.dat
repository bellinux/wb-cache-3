30|$|It {{is unclear}} if the {{protocols}} of the reviewed studies {{resulted in a}} full or complete transition to MFW. Only a few studies required at least one running session to be completed entirely in MFW {{by the end of}} the transition period. A full transition (i.e. 100 % of weekly running volume) to MFW was accomplished by three studies during the last week of the transition [33, 34, 37] or not specifically stated in other studies. It is possible that running in both MFW and CRS causes motor interference that prevents a true MFW-adapted gait pattern from emerging. Therefore, more research is needed to distinguish whether the altered gait resulting from MFW transition is a temporary performance of an observable behaviour or a <b>permanent,</b> <b>learned</b> motor skill.|$|R

To this idea, the Reformed Church of England with its marriable and married Clergy would have approximated, if the revenues of the Church, as they existed at the death of Henry VII., had been rightly transferred by his successor;--transferred, I mean, from reservoirs, which had by degeneracy on the one hand, and progressive improvement on the other, fallen into ruin, and in which those revenues had stagnated into contagion or uselessness,--transferred from what had become public evils to their original and inherent purpose of public benefits, instead of being sacrilegiously alienated by a transfer to private proprietors.
