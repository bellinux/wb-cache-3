The results are visually interesting, but the mechanics are mismanaged. While the game strives to be as simple and as straightforward as possible, the camera often gets in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|A major critic {{complaint}} about Uru {{was that the}} game did not ship with the multiplayer component.

Reviewer Bob Mandel found that the most disappointing part of the dropped multiplayer game was that [...] "as you progress through the game, a number of tantalizing clues emerge of <b>places</b> <b>you</b> can go and activities you can undertake only through the promised online mode." ...|$|E

The band members lived in caravans, as {{the building was}} in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as [...] "derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ...

Popular acts {{included}} platinum selling success of Bleed American by Jimmy Eat World (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's The <b>Places</b> <b>You</b> Have Come to Fear the Most (2003). The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same time, use of the term [...] "emo" [...] expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion. The term [...] "emo" [...] has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance and disparate groups such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco, even when they reject the label.|$|E

That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no one seems to touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics.

[...] Reed, however, said if players can find any flaws, they are based on [...] "personal taste", but also stated that regardless of refinement, [...] "you can never quite replicate the wow factor of the original—even if it ends up being a better game." [...] Navarro said that at times, the combat is [...] "overly straightforward ... and still prone to button mashing," [...] and said that it was [...] "a bit disappointing" [...] that more was not done to the combat system. He criticized the cliffhanger ending and said a few of the bonus challenges [...] "aren't all that great." [...] GameTrailers criticized the invisible walls, stating that [...] "There are <b>places</b> <b>you</b> should be able to go that you simply can't."

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{focuses on the}} yearning desire {{to be with a}} loved one for Christmas, {{regardless}} of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, bass effect, and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment. Slates Ragusea counts [...] "at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other <b>places.</b> (<b>You</b> might also analyze it as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate)." [...] According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains [...] "The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set." [...] In a piece on the song in Vogue, a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: [...] "those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back then. I think that's what gives it that timeless, classic quality." ...|$|E
