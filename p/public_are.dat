5000|$|In public {{relations}} and communication theory, a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> distinct from a stakeholder or a market. A <b>public</b> <b>is</b> {{a subset of the}} set of stakeholders for an organization, that comprises those people concerned with a specific issue. Whilst a market has an exchange relationship with an organization, and is usually a passive entity that is created by the organization, a public does not necessarily have an exchange relationship, and is both self-creating and self-organizing. <b>Publics</b> <b>are</b> targeted by <b>public</b> relations efforts. In this, target <b>publics</b> <b>are</b> those <b>publics</b> whose involvement <b>is</b> necessary for achieving organization goals; intervening <b>publics</b> <b>are</b> opinion formers and mediators, who pass information to the target publics; and influentials <b>are</b> <b>publics</b> that the target publics turn to for consultation, whose value judgements are influential upon how a target public will judge any {{public relations}} material. The <b>public</b> <b>is</b> often targeted especially in regard to political agendas as their vote is necessary in order to further the progression of the cause. As seen in Massachusetts between 2003 and 2004, it was necessary to [...] "win a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public support" [...] in order to get same-sex marriage passed in the commonwealth.|$|R
5|$|Kastner's {{reasons for}} not making the {{document}} <b>public</b> <b>are</b> unknown. Vrba believed {{until the end of}} his life that Kastner withheld it in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the Aid and Rescue Committee and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. Shortly after Vrba arrived in Slovakia from Auschwitz in April 1944, Eichmann proposed to the Aid and Rescue Committee in Budapest (specifically to Kastner, Joel Brand and Hansi Brand) that the Nazis trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but in exchange for money and other goods Kastner did obtain safe passage to Switzerland for 1,684 Jews on what became known as the Kastner train. Vrba believed that Kastner suppressed the Vrba–Wetzler report in order not to damage those negotiations with the SS.|$|E
5|$|The bill then {{proceeds}} {{to the committee}} stage, where {{the details of the}} drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. Bills that are more controversial, or that require the views of interested groups or the <b>public,</b> <b>are</b> often referred to a select committee. This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations to the committee. Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible to the general <b>public</b> <b>are</b> those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

5000|$|Public {{relations}} theory {{perspectives on}} <b>publics</b> <b>are</b> situational, per Dewey and Grunig; mass, where a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> simply {{viewed as a}} population of individuals; agenda-building, where a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> viewed {{as a condition of}} political involvement that is not transitory; and [...] "homo narrans", where a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> (in the words of Gabriel M. Vasquez, assistant professor in the School of Communication at the University of Houston) a collection of [...] "individuals that develop a group consciousness around a problematic situation and act to solve the problematic situation" [...] <b>Public</b> schools <b>are</b> often under controversy for their [...] "agenda-building," [...] especially in debates over whether to teach a religious or secular curriculum. [...] The promotion of an agenda is commonplace whenever one <b>is</b> in a <b>public</b> environment, but schools have exceptional power in that regard. In the public school system, {{it is the responsibility of}} those within the system to determine what agenda is being promoted.|$|R
