5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a <b>poor</b> <b>signal</b> of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
25|$|WEVD {{found itself}} in a {{difficult}} financial position that was a veritable Catch-22 — unions and other left wing institutions were difficult to motivate to make donations due to the station's limited broadcast time and <b>poor</b> <b>signal</b> coverage, but without these donations {{it would be impossible}} to improve the transmission situation which would make the donations happen. To make up the financial shortfall the station became aggressive in pushing for contributions from its listeners.|$|E
25|$|The {{switchover}} {{began when}} BBC Two was switched off at 0200 on 17 October 2007. This {{was followed by}} the remaining analogue channels at 0200, on 14 November 2007. As a result of the switchover, all televisions in the Whitehaven area had to have a digital terrestrial receiver (Freeview) or digital satellite alternative (Freesat, Sky, etc.) The switchover in the Whitehaven area was not entirely successful: in nearby Eskdale, <b>poor</b> <b>signal</b> quality left viewers with blank television screens and the digital switchover was supposed to give over 40 channels but certain areas received fewer than 20.|$|E

5000|$|More diffuse or {{completely}} omnidirectional ground antennas capable {{of communicating with}} one or more satellites visible in the sky at the same time, but at significantly higher transmit power than fixed geostationary dish antennas (due to the lower gain), and with much <b>poorer</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratios for receiving the signal.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} {{observed}} that while current CCD detectors allow very high image resolution, often this involves a trade-off because, {{for a given}} chip size, as the pixel count increases, the pixel size decreases. As the pixels get smaller, their well depth decreases, {{reducing the number of}} electrons that can be stored. In turn, this results in a <b>poorer</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio.|$|R
25|$|Morse code {{is used by}} some amateur radio operators, {{although}} {{knowledge of}} and proficiency with {{it is no longer}} required for licensing in most countries. Pilots and air traffic controllers usually need only a cursory understanding. Aeronautical navigational aids, such as VORs and NDBs, constantly identify in Morse code. Compared to voice, Morse code is less sensitive to <b>poor</b> <b>signal</b> conditions, yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device. Morse is, therefore, a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels. Many amateur radio repeaters, for example, identify with Morse, even though they are used for voice communications.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} disaster was identified as the Turbo train passing signal SN109 (located on an overhead gantry—gantry 8—with four other signals serving other tracks) at which {{it should have been}} held. It was established that the signal had been showing a red aspect, and the preceding signal (SN87) had been showing a single yellow which should have led the driver to be prepared for a red at SN109. Since the Thames Turbo driver, 31-year-old Michael Hodder, had been killed in the accident, {{it was not possible to}} establish why he had passed the signal at danger. However, Hodder was inexperienced, having qualified as a driver only two weeks before the crash. His driver training was found to be defective, whilst the signalling in the Paddington area was known to have caused problems – SN109 had been passed at danger on eight occasions in six years, but Hodder had no specific warning of this. Furthermore, 5 October 1999 was a day of bright sunshine and at just past 8 o'clock the sun would have been low and behind Hodder, with low sunlight reflecting off yellow aspects. <b>Poor</b> <b>signal</b> placement meant that Hodder would have seen sunlit yellow aspects of SN109 at a point where his view of the red aspect of SN109 (but not of any other signal on the gantry) was still obstructed. The inquiry considered it more probable than not that the poor sighting of SN109, both in itself and in comparison with the other signals on and at gantry 8, allied to the effect of bright sunlight at a low angle, were factors which had led Hodder to believe that he had a proceed aspect. Since 1998 a campaign to have the signal SN109 properly sited had been running, and the Bristol HST drivers were re-routed as not to pass this signal.|$|E
2500|$|APD can {{manifest}} as problems {{determining the}} direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as [...] "hat" [...] with [...] "bat", [...] "there" [...] with [...] "where", etc. [...] Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word. [...] Background noise, such {{as the sound of}} a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder. Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, <b>poor</b> <b>signal,</b> intermittent sounds and the chopping of words. Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, ABC {{steadily}} {{rose in the}} ratings to become the number one network in primetime. Accordingly, the network began to seek upgrades to its slate of affiliates, which included some stations that either had <b>poor</b> <b>signals</b> or poorly performing local programming. WBAL-TV {{had been invited to}} switch to ABC in 1977, but opted to remain with NBC out of concerns about the poor ratings for ABC's recently revamped evening newscasts.|$|R

50|$|On June 13, 2008, Charlie FM's {{programming}} was abruptly dropped, {{replaced with}} that of WORD News Radio, which had previously only broadcast on AM, leaving the station to abandon music altogether after nineteen years.

40|$|Abstract—This work uses two {{performance}} metrics, target {{detection and}} scene reconstruction performance, to compare various estimation techniques that operate on compressed measurements. Specifically we compare {{the performance of}} the compressed matched filter, ℓ 1 -regularized least squares, and complex approximate message passing (CAMP), as well as a sparsified matched filter estimate. We show that the compressed matched filter provides the same or similar detection performance as the other, more computationally expensive techniques, but at the expense of <b>poorer</b> <b>signal</b> reconstruction error. However, by sparsifying the matched filter estimate using a soft-thresholding function, this estimate can achieve high reconstruction performance as well, and at much lower computational cost.
