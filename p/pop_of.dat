5|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is {{the eighth}} studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, {{released}} on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It {{was produced by}} Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> its predecessor Electr-O-Pura to encompass {{a variety of other}} music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open-ended dissonance.|$|E

It was released in the United States through MCA, and in the United Kingdom through Virgin Records. The album became a Top5 bestseller in the UK and Australia, and {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award. Michelle Phillips of The Mamas and The Papas; and Chynna Phillips and Carnie Wilson of Wilson Phillips sang backup for the album. Thomas Dolby played keyboard on some album tracks.|$|E
25|$|Though Britpop {{is viewed}} as a {{marketing}} tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common, such as showing elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> the Eighties in their music. Britpop was a media driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s—and was associated with the British popular cultural movement of Cool Britannia which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop music of that decade.|$|E

25|$|Of the Blue Colour of the Sky is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band OK Go. It was {{released}} on January 12, 2010 on Capitol Records in the USA and EMI in the UK, and re-released on the band's independent label Paracadute Records on April 1. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann and was recorded in a span of seven months at Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York. The album's name, lyrics, and concept are based on The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky, a pseudoscientific book published in 1876. Its style was noted as {{a significant departure from}} the power <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> their earlier albums. After the band's split with EMI and Capitol, Paracadute took over the promotional campaign and all distribution responsibilities. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release and debuted at number 40 on Billboard 200 chart.|$|E
25|$|Though Britpop is seen {{retrospectively}} as {{a marketing}} tool, {{and more of a}} cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> the Eighties in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur and Oasis drew from the Kinks and the Beatles, respectively, while Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock. Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past. Alternative rock acts from the indie scene of the Eighties and early Nineties were the direct ancestors of the Britpop movement. The influence of the Smiths is common to the majority of Britpop artists. The Madchester scene, fronted by the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets (for whom Oasis's Noel Gallagher had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on good times and catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based shoegazing and American based grunge styles of music.|$|E

Hertsgaard writes: [...] "what caught most people's interest was the exotic rhythm track. The opening descent of shimmering harplike notes beckoned even those who resisted Indian music, while the lyrics melded the mysticism of the East... with the pragmatism of the West, and the hedonism of youth culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Chamber pop (also called ork-pop, {{short for}} [...] "orchestral pop") is {{a style of}} rock music {{characterized}} by an emphasis on melody and texture, the intricate use of strings, horns, piano, and vocal harmonies, and other components drawn from the lounge and orchestral <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> the 1960s. It was founded mainly {{on the work of}} the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson (especially the 1966 album Pet Sounds) and composer Burt Bacharach, in addition to producers Henry Mancini, Lee Hazlewood, Phil Spector, and singer Scott Walker.|$|E

500|$|Poodle Hat is the {{eleventh}} studio album by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic, released on May 20, 2003. It was the seventh studio album self-produced by Yankovic. The musical styles {{on the album}} are built around parodies and pastiches of <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> the early-2000s. The album's lead single, [...] "Couch Potato", is a parody of [...] "Lose Yourself" [...] by Eminem.

500|$|The song {{has been}} {{characterized}} as possessing [...] "forceful velocity" [...] and an [...] "instantly hummable melody" [...] with it being [...] "buoyant", [...] "bubbly" [...] and [...] "Motown marriage track".

40|$|AbstractMany {{industrial}} engineering problems require fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis and dynamics analysis to improve functionality or operational performance. One such {{problem is the}} <b>popping</b> off <b>of</b> pressure safety valve (PSV) widely used in pressure vessels and pipes. <b>Popping</b> off <b>of</b> a spring-loaded pressure safety valve (PSV) is crucial to prevent the pressure vessel or pipe from overpressure. It's difficult to observe {{the dynamics of the}} valve disc as well as the flow characteristics through the small chamber between the valve disc and valve seat over such a remarkable short period in the past. To address this issue, a transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with moving grid technique has been presented in this work. Fine structure grid has been generated over the whole flow domain to ensure that the valve disc can move freely and continuously without negative volume problem. Two types of time-dependent overpressure are given to simulate the <b>popping</b> <b>of</b> the PSV under different overpressure conditions. Response parameters such as the displacement of the disc, fluid force on the disc and the blowdown value are monitored to see their influence on the <b>popping</b> <b>of</b> the valve. The results are helpful to improve the <b>popping</b> action <b>of</b> the valve in design stage, and demonstrate the availability and efficiency of using transient CFD simulation in the <b>popping</b> analysis <b>of</b> spring-loaded PSV...|$|R
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1999, the Daddies {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth album, Soul Caddy. A loose concept album reflecting Perry's disillusionment over the cultural zeitgeist and his experience with fame (as he described it, a [...] "bittersweet" [...] record about [...] "being alienated and hoping to connect"), Soul Caddy marked {{a continuation of the}} band's musically varied format, intended to introduce a truer perspective of the Daddies' sound and personality to both their swing-based fans and a wider audience. Drawing from the rock and <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> the 1960s and 1970s, Soul Caddy interwove swing and ska with glam rock, soul, psychedelic pop, folk and funk.|$|E

500|$|Music {{historian}} Lorenzo Candalaria described American {{rock band}} the Beach Boys as [...] "one {{of the most}} experimental and innovative groups of the 1960s." [...] Co-founder and leader Brian Wilson wrote and produced songs for the group that ranged from massive hits to obscure experimental pop compositions. Their 1966 single [...] "Good Vibrations", also produced and co-written by Wilson, topped record charts internationally, subsequently proliferating a wave of pop experimentation with its rush of riff changes, echo chamber effects, and intricate harmonies. It was followed by Smiley Smile (1967), an album of stripped-down recordings. In 2003, Stylus Magazine wrote that the album [...] "embrace the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era.

Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly appreciated the cover, and opined that [...] " [...] discovers the beating heart inside that band's subdued electro-goth jam". Becky Bain from Idolator called Shakira's version of [...] "Islands" [...] "sunnier than the original" [...] and regarded it as [...] "brilliantly subdued", complimenting the singer's overall reworking of the original track. In 2011, Stereogum included the cover on their list of [...] "The 10 Best xx Covers". Shakira's cover of [...] "Islands" [...] appeared on the US Billboard Latin Digital Songs chart, peaking at number 39 for one week.|$|E
500|$|During the mid 1960s, {{pop music}} made {{repeated}} forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word [...] "progressive" [...] was frequently used, {{and it was}} thought that every song and single was to be a [...] "progression" [...] from the last. The Beatles' Paul McCartney intimated in 1967: [...] "we [...] got a bit bored with 12 bars all the time, so we tried to get into something else. Then came [...] Dylan, the Who, and the Beach Boys.... We're all trying to do vaguely the same kind of thing." [...] Before the progressive <b>pop</b> <b>of</b> the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. The Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers.|$|E
