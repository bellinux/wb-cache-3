40|$|Cement {{pressurisation}} is {{an important}} step in total hip arthroplasty that determines the long-term integration at the cement-bone interface. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of a new pressuriser designed by us against the standard existing pressurisers in an in vitro experimental set-up using two parameters: cement penetration and cement pressurisation. A polypropylene cup model was designed to represent the acetabulum. DePuy’s T-handle, Exeter and our own <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser were each tested for cement pressurisation in this acetabular model. Cement penetration and pressures were measured. The cement intrusion into the capillaries with the DePuy pressuriser was found to vary between 2  and 8  mm (mean: 5  mm at the pole and 4. 6  mm at the rim), with the Exeter pressuriser it varied between 3  and 9  mm (mean: 5. 8  mm at the pole and 7. 8  mm at the rim) and with the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser it varied between 4  and 6  mm (mean 5. 2  mm at the pole and 4. 8  mm at the rim). The peak pressure achieved with the DePuy pressuriser was 60  kPa whereas it was 70  kPa with the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser. The mean penetration with the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> pressuriser was found to be better than the other types. The penetration was found to be more uniform with equal penetration at the rim {{as well as at the}} pole...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} carried out to develop the new {{material}} supply mechanism for <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> injection molding. The objective of this project is to design a new material supply mechanism that can overcome the limitation on the <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> injection molding at the same the to improve {{the function of the}} current material supply that only act as a material storage. The development process consists of the design process and the validation process. The new design consists of the new function to give more functionality to the current material supply. The new function consists of the mixing mechanism and also the heating element and in additional to that, the valve is also being integrated into the mechanism in order to control the molten plastic from flowing out. The process of selecting a new material supply mechanism are made by selecting the best concept from three concept of a new material supply mechanism using a Pugh concept selection method. Due to the constrain in obtaining the component part, validation process {{was carried out}} by using CAE software. The validation process is done by using the CAE software analysis in the temperature flow on the mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} validation of a high speed reluctance actuator for a soccer robot. The actuator is used to shoot a regular sized soccer ball by applying different force levels directly to the ball. As the application requires force in only one direction, a <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> reluctance actuator is selected. A capacitor is used to buffer energy from the battery of the robot. Through an IGBT, the energy is transferred from the capacitor to the actuator. Consequently, by applying pulse width modulation, the force applied by the actuator can be adjusted to enable a variable shooting power. The reluctance type actuator is designed using finite element analysis. The actuator is build and implemented in the robot providing the capability to shoot a ball from standstill over 12 meters with a starting speed of 11 m/s...|$|R

50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|R

They are fitted to the lower limb of SCI patients {{with the help of}} metal rods. KAFO is a type of orthotic device which stabilizes knee, ankle and foot, where the knee is supported by a caliper. In some cases, the joint is locked using a drop lock, spring loaded lock, cam lock, ball lock, dial lock or a <b>plunger</b> <b>type</b> of lock. The KAFOs are mainly used to support the patients with muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesions and lost structural integrity [40]. However, combination of KAFO and a Shannon’s brace provides better support. Shannon’s brace is used separately or combined with KAFO to provide waist support, once the patient shows improvement. It helps the patients in restoring his functional abilities. In context to locomotion, it helps a patient to become independent of supportive/mobility aids.|$|R
