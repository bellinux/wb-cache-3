5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the <b>public</b> <b>switched</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange is a telecommunications system {{used in the}} <b>public</b> <b>switched</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> or in large enterprises. An exchange consists of electronic components and in older systems also human operators that interconnect (switch) telephone subscriber lines or virtual circuits of digital systems to establish telephone calls between subscribers.|$|E
25|$|A {{telephone}} number is {{a sequence of}} digits assigned to a fixed-line telephone subscriber station connected to a telephone line or to a wireless electronic telephony device, such as a radio telephone or a mobile telephone, or to other devices for data transmission via the <b>public</b> <b>switched</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> (PSTN) or other private networks.|$|E

25|$|Switches {{are used}} in both local central offices and in long {{distance}} centers. There are two major types in the <b>Public</b> <b>switched</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> (PSTN), the Class 4 telephone switches designed for toll or switch-to-switch connections, and the Class 5 telephone switches or subscriber switches, which manage connections from subscriber telephones. Since the 1990s, hybrid Class 4/5 switching systems that serve both functions have become common.|$|E
25|$|For {{corporate}} or enterprise use, {{a private}} telephone exchange {{is often referred}} to as a private branch exchange (PBX), when it has connections to the <b>public</b> <b>switched</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b> A PBX is installed in enterprise facilities, typically collocated with large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the local private telephone system and any private leased line circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a PBX or key telephone system in the office of a receptionist.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} the <b>public</b> <b>switched</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> {{has a single}} emergency telephone number (sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or the emergency services number) that allows a caller to contact local emergency services for assistance. The emergency number differs from country to country; it is typically a three-digit number {{so that it can}} be easily remembered and dialed quickly. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services; these often differ only by the last digit. See List of emergency telephone numbers.|$|E

2500|$|The number {{contains}} the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended endpoint for the telephone call. Each such endpoint {{must have a}} unique number within the <b>public</b> <b>switched</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network.</b> Most countries use fixed length numbers (for normal lines at least) and therefore the number of endpoints determines the necessary length of the telephone number. It is also possible for each subscriber to {{have a set of}} shorter numbers for the endpoints most often used. These [...] "shorthand" [...] or [...] "speed calling" [...] numbers are automatically translated to unique telephone numbers before the call can be connected. Some special services have their own short numbers (e.g., 1-1-9, 9-1-1,1-0-0, 1-0-1, 1-0-2, 0-0-0, 9-9-9, 1-1-1, and 1-1-2 being the Emergency Services numbers for China, Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Sri Lanka; Canada and the United States; Israel (Police); Israel (Paramedic); Israel (Fire); Australia; the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Poland, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Macao, Bahrain, Qatar, Bangladesh, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Trinidad, Tobago; New Zealand; Kuwait and the European Union, respectively.) ...|$|E
