Both methods showed that Quereus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl. predominates on the slate site, while the oaks on both the limestone and peat sites are very mixed, with a well-developed Q. robur L. component. The Hybrid Index method over-estimated the morphological intermediacy of the trees, while the <b>Pictorial</b> Scatter <b>Diagram</b> method under-estimated the Q. robur component.

40|$|Abstract: This chapter {{outlines}} an explicitly neural {{theory of}} language and a construction grammar formalism based on this theory. The formalism, ECG, combines deep insights from cognitive linguistics with advanced techniques of neural computation. We illustrate the theory and the formalism with detailed automatically generated semantic analyses of several related examples. Recent developments in neuroscience and the behavioral sciences suggest approaching language as a cornerstone of Unified Cognitive Science. One such integrative effort has been underway for two decades in Berkeley. The NTL (Neural Theory of Language) project studies language learning and use as an embodied neural system using {{a wide range of}} analytic, experimental, and modeling techniques. The basic motivation for NTL and its relation to ongoing experimental work is discussed in several places 1. The core idea is to take all the constraints seriously and to build explicit computational models that demonstrate the theoretical claims. At one level, NTL continues the tradition of Cognitive Linguistics (CL) represented by several chapters in this volume. But explicit computational modeling demands greater precision than is possible with the <b>pictorial</b> <b>diagrams</b> that remain standard in most CL work...|$|R

40|$|Actinic keratosis (AK) is {{a common}} precancerous skin lesion and many AK {{management}} guidelines exist, {{but there has been}} limited investigation into the quality of these documents. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the strengths and weaknesses of guidelines that address AK management. A systematic search for guidelines with recommendations for AK was performed. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) was used to appraise the quality of guidelines. Multiple raters independently reviewed each of the guidelines and applied the AGREE II tool and scores were calculated. Overall, 2, 307 citations were identified and 7 fulfilled the study criteria. The Cancer Council of Australia/Australian Cancer Network guideline had the highest mean scores and was the only guideline to include a systematic review, include an evidence rating for recommendations, and report conflicts of interest and funding sources. High-quality, effective guidelines are evidence-based with recommendations that are concise and organized, so practical application is facilitated. Features such as concise tables, <b>pictorial</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and explicit links to evidence are helpful. However, the rigor and validity of some guidelines were weak. So, it is important for providers to be aware of the features that contribute to a high-quality, practical document...|$|R

Through qualitative, case-study research, the aim was to explore not only the impact on job satisfaction downsizing had on employees, but also to identify existing literature, in order to understand and establish the subjects being studied. The data is drawn from two stages of case study research. Stage one involved a literature review of downsizing and employee job satisfaction. This was necessary, in order to build a theoretical background, allowing the author to discuss the findings with the primary research resulting from the survey. Stage two consisted of the primary research tool relating to a distributed questionnaire to one hundred and eight two (182) employees from British Telecom's retail division, identified as the most affected staff group of the BT downsizing strategy. The main results from this study are presented through tables and <b>pictorial</b> <b>diagrams</b> and are aligned to the existing literature in order to present any similarities with the existing literature or is there new evidence stating opposites the existing literature. The aims of the investigation are to analyse post downsizing, job satisfaction scores using a job satisfaction survey (JSS) ...|$|R

Eichler inspired later generation of scientists, including John Henry Schaffner. Diagrams were included e.g. in Types of Floral Mechanism by Church (1908). They were used in different textbooks, e.g. Organogenesis of Flowers'''' by Sattler (1973), Botanische Bestimmungsübungen by Stützel (2006) or Plant Systematics by Simpson (2010). Floral Diagrams (2010) by Ronse De Craene followed Eichler’s approach using the contemporary APG II system.|$|R

It is, on the contrary, a merit, for it teaches the pupil to look through the literary order and discover the logical order. He thus learns what the literary order really is, and sees that this may be varied indefinitely, so long as the logical relations are kept clear.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{determine}} how childhood overweight, {{in conjunction with}} other life course weight characteristics, relates to the development of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Among 109, 172 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II, body fatness at ages 5, 10, and 20 years was assessed by recall using 9 -level <b>pictorial</b> <b>diagrams</b> (somatotypes) representing extreme thinness (category 1) to obesity (category 9). Recalled weights at age 18 years and adulthood were used to derive BMI. Self-reported cases of type 2 diabetes were confirmed by supplementary questionnaire. RESULTS — Somatotypes at ages 5 and 10 years were positively associated with diabetes risk (P trend � 0. 0001). The adjusted relative risk (RR) of women with somatotype � 6 (vs. 2) at age 5 years was 2. 19 (95 % CI 1. 79 – 2. 67) and at age 10 years was 2. 57 (2. 20 – 3. 01). Increases in size by somatotype or by weight gain since age 18 were associated with increased risk. Compared with women who were never overweight at any age, women who were overweight as an adult (BMI � 25 kg/m 2) but not previously had an adjusted RR of 8. 23 (7. 41 – 9. 15). The adjusted RR was 15. 10 (13. 21 – 17. 26) for women who were also overweight at age 10 (somatotype � 5) and 18 (BMI � 25 kg/m 2).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to develop and test the psychometric {{properties}} of the Family Genogram Interview (FGI), a standardized genogram format theoretically grounded in Bowen Family Systems Theory. The sample consisted of 50 hetero-sexual, married women who had at least one child between 4 and 10 years of age, who completed the FGI with a trained interviewer. The results indicate the FGI has good interinterviewer reliability while construct validity assessments yielded mixed results. The results indicate the FGI is a positive step toward standardization and advancement of genogram interviewing in research and clinical applications. Limitations and directions for future studies are discussed. Keywords genograms, Bowen Theory, family assessment, family genogram interview The Family Genogram Interview (FGI) is the most widely used means of assessing relationship processes in nuclear and extended family systems (McGoldrick & Gerson, 1985; McGoldrick, Gerson, & Petry, 2008). A genogram is a <b>pictorial</b> <b>diagram</b> of a family using data gathered during a semi-structured interview to assess for various elements of family functioning, such as conflict, cutoff, enmeshment, and other family relationship patterns. A genogram resembles a ‘‘family tree’ ’ however the information gathered includes both the simple structure of the family and the emotional patterns and processes present in the nuclear and extended family system. In a typical genogram, circles represent females and squares represent males. Information is often gathered for at least three family generations (McGoldrick et al., 2008). Clinicians typi-cally gather information about the structure of the family (i. e., when individuals were married or how many children each couple had) and family relationships (i. e., Are there any relationships with conflict or cutoff?). While the genogram interview as it is currently used has widespread popularity in clinical and research applications, it also has several drawbacks including limited standardization and a limited theoretical foundation (Coupland, Serovich & Glenn, 1995). The {{purpose of the}} current study was to develop a standardized genogram format theoretically grounded in Bowen family systems theory...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Since its introduction, the Entity-Relationship (ER) {{model has}} been the vehicle of choice in {{communicating}} {{the structure of a}} database schema in an implementation-independent fashion. Part of its popularity has no doubt been due to the clarity and simplicity of the associated <b>pictorial</b> Entity-Relationship <b>Diagrams</b> (“ERD’s”) and to the dependable mapping it affords to a relational database schema. Although the {{model has been}} extended in different ways over the years, its basic properties have been remarkably stable. Even though the ER model has been seen as pretty well “settled, ” some recent papers, notably [4] and [2 (from whose paper our title is derived) ], have enumerated what their authors consider serious shortcomings of the ER model. They illustrate these by some interesting examples. We believe, however, that those examples are themselves flawed. In fact, while not claiming that the ER model is perfect, we do believe that the overhauls hinted at are probably not necessary and possibly counterproductive. ...|$|R

40|$|Characterization {{by means}} of Kolmogorov entropy shows that the {{dynamics}} of the bottom bed in small size circulating fluidized bed risers are significantly different from {{the dynamics of the}} dense bottom bed in large size risers and, as a consequence, two types of circulating regimes are introduced: the exploding bubble bed for large risers and the circulating ‘slugging’ bed for small risers, the latter at high superficial gas velocities. In a <b>pictorial</b> fluidization <b>diagram</b> ten gas—solid fluidization regimes are given, seven of which are experimentally identified with the Kolmogorov entropy by varying the superficial gas velocity, riser solids holdup and diameter (or width) of the riser: bubbling bed, slugging bed, exploding bubble bed, intermediate turbulent bed, circulating ‘slugging’ bed, intermediate dilute flow, and dilute transport flow. No transition could be identified between the exploding bubble bed at captive conditions and the exploding bubble bed at circulating conditions in the dense bottom bed of the two largest facilities in this study. This suggests that the dense bottom bed in large size risers can be considered as a bubbling bed. A turbulent bed was found in none of the facilities of this study with the Geldart B solids used. As well as by the Kolmogorov entropy (chaos analysis), the hydrodynamics have been characterized by amplitude of pressure fluctuations, while a solids distribution analysis has also been carried out. The study has been made in four (circulating) fluidized beds of different size and design, all operated with 0. 30 mm silica sand. The dimensions of the fluidized bed risers are 1. 47 × 1. 42 × 13. 5 m, 0. 70 × 0. 12 × 8. 5 m, 0. 12 m i. d. × 5. 8 m, and 0. 083 m i. d. × 4. 0 m...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} {{to a range of}} objectives outlined in Tertiary Education Strategies and the recommendations of work-parties around the use of information and communication technologies the New Zealand Ministry of Education has funded a range of open, flexible and networked learning research, developmental and implementation projects since 2003. The principle underlying these projects is that the smart use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) will provide learners with a greater choice as to where, when and how they learn. As a leading vocational education provider the Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec) recognised that conventional models of education, solely dependent upon physical attendance at scheduled face-to-face sessions, may no longer suit every educational situation, the needs of individual learners or the desires of local communities. It was clear “flexibility” was a concept Wintec should consider in fulfilling their obligations of providing high quality learning experiences to their learners. During a review of Wintec’s flexible delivery maturity a pictorial framework, A. C. E, was developed firstly, to guide the introduction of flexible learning activities undertaken within the institution and secondly, to provide a diagrammatic overview to increase institutional awareness of ”flexibility”. The A. C. E. framework is based on the three As, Cs, and Es, the constituent parts of the framework are: The 3 As: Awareness (participants reflect upon the existing educational capacity and capability), Action (activities are generated providing guidance for e-learning implementations) and Accomplishment (the impact of implementations are measured). The 3 Cs: Context (factors shaping and influencing perceptions), Content (factors influencing direction and focus) and Capability (factors shaping participant confidence and understanding). The 3 Es: Enabled (initiatives can be measured by how they have enabled users to participate), Engaged (initiatives can be measured by how they have initiated and maintained engagement) and Empowered (initiatives can be measured by how they have ensured capability of participation). Using the A. C. E framework a <b>pictorial</b> <b>diagram</b> has been produced firstly, to guide the introduction of flexible learning in teaching and learning and the provision of support services in the institution and secondly, to provide a diagrammatic overview to increase institutional awareness of flexible learning.

40|$|The Geneva Bible was {{translated}} into English at Geneva Switzerland by English Protestant exiles and published in 1560. It became an immediate favorite with the English public {{and served as a}} transition between the Great Bible and the King James Version. The translation committee, headed by William Whittingham, produced the most unique Bible of its time because of its numerous study notes, illustrated woodcuts, and strongly anti-Catholic bias. The Geneva Bible served as a standard of the highest quality printing and practical scholarship in the sixteenth century. Each book of the Bible was preceded by an explanatory paragraph called “The Argument” of the book. The study notes included extensive cross references, <b>pictorial</b> charts and <b>diagrams,</b> explanations of translations, and theological notations, especially regarding matters of eschatology. It was these notations which inflamed the apocalyptic visions of the English people and eventually led to the English civil wars of the seventeenth century. The English public viewed the Protestant Reformation as a cosmic conflict between the forces of Christ and those of antichrist. With the accession of King James I of England in 1603, the apocalyptic expectations of the English people reached even further heights. One cannot fully understand nor appreciate the religious, social and political context of the King James Version apart from the cultural setting which was so greatly influenced by the Geneva Bible...|$|R
