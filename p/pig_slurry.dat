The V 3 region of 16 S rRNA genes was PCR amplified and sequenced using paired-end Illumina technology for in-depth characterization of bacterial community. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Tenericutes were the predominant bacterial phyla present in slurry samples. Bacterial taxonomic community composition was not influenced by the season; however, phylogenetic community composition was affected by seasonal variations. The community composition and diversity patterns were strongly influenced by pH. The bacterial diversity indices showed a unimodal relationship with pH. Phylogenetic signals were detected over only short phylogenetic distances, revealing that closely related bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) tend to co-occur in the same environment; hence, they are ecologically similar. Across all samples, a niche-based process, through strong environmental filtering imposed by pH, primarily governed bacterial community assembly; however, in samples close to the neutral pH range, the role of environmental filtering was decreased due to neutral community assembly. In summary, pH emerged as the major physico-chemical variable in <b>pig</b> manure <b>slurry</b> that regulates {{the relative importance of}} niche-based and neutral processes in shaping the community assembly of bacteria...|$|R

Farm waste samples were reanalysed under controlled temperature conditions over a period of 50 days after sampling, to investigate the stability of their fluorescence properties. For silage liquor, tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity ratios were observed to decrease with time, and were associated with a decrease in tryptophan fluorescence intensity, suggestive of clostridia breakdown of protein. For slurry samples, tryptophan: fulvic-like fluorescence intensity exhibited a more variable time-evolution, and tryptophan fluorescence intensity increased through time; the more complex fluorescence signal is due to the relatively heterogeneous nature of the slurry.

Agricultural food wastes are also attractive composting materials for their conversion into decomposed manures to be used for producing high-value crops (Rubio et al. 2013). It was largely considered that composting processes that ensure nutrient-rich conditions, appropriate carbon rating, organic matter humification and adequate bulking for reducing N-losses are required to overcome production cost (Bernal et al. 2009).

In this study, we investigated the active bacterial species responsible for the assimilation of dead bacterial cells and their components in aerated <b>pig</b> manure <b>slurry</b> by using 13 C-labeled bacterial biomass probing. After 3 days of forced aeration, 13 C-labeled and unlabeled dead Escherichia coli cell suspensions were added to the slurry. The suspensions contained 13 C-labeled and unlabeled bacterial cell components, possibly including the cell wall and membrane, as well as intracellular materials. RNA extracted from each slurry sample 2 h after addition of E. coli suspension was density-resolved by isopycnic centrifugation and analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, followed by cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes. In the heavy isotopically labeled RNA fraction, the predominant 13 C-assimilating population was identified as belonging to the genus Acholeplasma, which was not detected in control heavy RNA.

On average 119, 238 and 475 kgha− 1 yr− 1 of N; 102, 203 and 406 kgha− 1 yr− 1 of P and 43, 87 and 173 kgha− 1 yr− 1 of K were added, for rates of 20, 40 and 80 m 3 ha− 1 of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry,</b> respectively. Samples of water runoff from the soil surface were collected during the entire period and the minerals, N, P and K were determined. Successive applications of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> decreased surface runoff. In relative terms, the K losses were higher than N and P. As regards total nutrients applied through <b>pig</b> <b>slurry,</b> losses through surface runoff were of 2. 74, 1. 61 and 1. 37 % of mineral N; 6. 29, 5. 01 and 3. 51 % of available P and 17. 16, 9. 01 and 11. 14 % of available K, for the three rates of applied <b>pig</b> <b>slurry,</b> respectively. Repeated applications of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> on a no tillage managed soil caused losses of N, P and K from the soil through surface runoff, in the sequence: K>P>N.

The ANR increase at first cut was likely due to an increase of the NH 4 ¿N/total N ratio along with a decrease of the organic C/total N ratio of slurry during co-digestion. Field application may under certain circumstances decrease N fertilizer value of CS, due to a higher NH 3 emission compared to RS. A potential ANR increase may then be reduced, absent, or even become a decrease.

Climate observations from the following three periods in year 2000 were used as input: (1) 1 week before the normal sowing time for spring crops, (2) mid-season, and (3) 1 week after harvesting. There was little difference in the total NH 3 volatilization from slurry applied in the three periods, principally due to interactions between soil water content and air temperature. The time from application to when 10 ␘f the applied TAN was lost was similar for countries in the south and north of Europe, primarily due to the low wind speeds counteracting the effect of higher air temperatures at the southern location. To reduce NH 3 volatilization, the slurry should be incorporated faster in mid- and late-season than in the early spring, due to increasing air temperatures during the growing season...|$|R
40|$|Three Gram-positive, anaerobic, pleomorphic strains (PG 10 T, PG 18 and PG 22), were {{selected}} among five strains isolated from <b>pig</b> <b>slurries</b> while searching for host specific bifidobacteria {{to track the}} source of fecal pollution in water. Analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence showed a maximum identity of 94 % to various species of the family Bifidobacteriaceae. However, phylogenetic analyses of 16 S rRNA and HSP 60 gene sequences revealed a closer relationship of these strains {{to members of the}} recently described Aeriscardovia, Parascardovia and Scardovia genera, than to other Bifidobacterium species. The names Neoscardovia gen. nov. and Neoscardovia arbecensis sp. nov. are proposed for a new genus and for the first species belonging to this genus, respectively, and for which PG 10 T (CECT 8111 T, DSM 25737 T) was designated as the type strain. This new species should be placed in the Bifidobacteriaceae family within the class Actinobacteria, with Aeriscardovia aeriphila being the closest relative. The prevailing cellular fatty acids were C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 1 ω 9 c, and the major polar lipids consisted of a variety of glycolipids, diphosphatidyl glycerol, two unidentified phospholipids, and phosphatidyl glycerol. The peptidoglycan structure was A 1 γ meso-Dpm-direct.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results obtained in a long-term experiment focused {{on the study of}} the evolution of cementitious materials immersed in <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> at real conditions. Cement mortars were made with four different cement types and immersed in <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> for 48 months. Furthermore, to separate pure hydration process from <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> effect, mortar samples were immersed in water for 12 months at laboratory conditions. Compressive strength, X-ray diffraction and ultrasonic measurements were made in all samples. Ultrasonic measurements were made from ultrasonic images obtained from automatic ultrasonic inspections.

An empirical relationship between ultrasonic velocity and compressive strength has been obtained and the long-term effect of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> on cementitious materials has been determined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract ? the {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the change in soil C and N mineralization due to successive <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> application under conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) systems. The experiment was carried out in a clayey Latossolo Vermelho eutrófico (Rhodic Eutrudox) in Palotina, PR, Brazil. Increasing doses of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> (0, 30, 60 and 120 m 3 ha- 1 per year) were applied in both tillage systems, with three replicates. Half of the <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> was applied before summer soil preparation, and the other half before the winter crop season. The areas were cultivated with soybean (Glycine max L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in the summers of 1998 and 1999, respectively, and with wheat (Triticum sativum Lam.) in the winters of both years. Soil samples were collected at 0 ? 5, 5 ? 10, and 10 ? 20 cm depths. Under both CT and NT systems, <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> application increased C and N mineralization. However, increasing <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> additions decreased the C to N mineralization ratio. Under the NT system, C and N mineralization was greater than in CT system. 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the changes in soil enzyme activities due to application of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> under different soil tillage systems. The experiment was conducted in a clayey Oxisol in Palotina, PR, using different quantities of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> (0, 30, 60 and 120 m 3 ha- 1 year- 1) applied to the soil prior to the summer and winter crop season under conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT), with three replicates. The areas were cultivated with soybean (Glycine max L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in the summers of 1998 and 1999, respectively, and with wheat (Triticum sativum Lam.) in the winters of both years. The soil samples were collected in March and October of 1998 and 1999 at depths of 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. The <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> application and the soil tillage systems influenced enzyme activities in the soil. The increase of <b>pig</b> <b>slurry</b> application decreased the ratio of soil enzyme activities to microbial biomass carbon. The phosphatase activity had a negative relationship with soil-available phosphorus.

40|$|The Adenoviridae family {{comprises}} a wide {{diversity of}} viruses {{that may be}} excreted for long periods in feces or urine. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} the detection of human and animal adenoviruses as well as human and animal polyomaviruses by PCR could be used as an index of fecal contamination of human and animal origin. In this study, quantitative PCR assays targeting specifically porcine adenoviruses have been developed and applied to fecal and environmental samples, including <b>pig</b> <b>slurries,</b> urban sewage, slaughterhouse sewage and river water samples. To develop real-time quantitative PCR for the detection and quantitation of porcine adenoviruses, primers and a TaqMan probe targeting a 68 -bp region of the porcine adenovirus hexon gene were designed to amplify specifically porcine adenovirus, and the conditions of the reaction were optimized. The assay detected 1 - 10 genome copies per test tube and was specific in showing no positive results when samples containing human or bovine adenoviruses were analyzed. Fecal samples contained mean concentrations of porcine adenoviruses of 10 (5) GC/g while slaughterhouse wastewater samples showed mean values of 10 (3) GC/ml. The assay detected porcine fecal pollution in samples that were highly diluted and had been collected at a considerable distance from the input source, such as river water. In general, the data presented here provide a quantitative tool for the analysis of porcine adenoviruses as indicators of the presence of porcine contamination in the environment, and support the detection of porcine adenoviruses by real-time quantitative PCR as a promising and valuable tool for source-tracking studies...|$|R
50|$|A major {{byproduct}} of <b>pig</b> production is <b>slurry.</b> One sow and her piglets can produce ten tonnes of slurry a year.
