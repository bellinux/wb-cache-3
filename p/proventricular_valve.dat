40|$|Yersinia pestis, {{the agent}} of plague, is usually {{transmitted}} by fleas. To produce a transmissible infection, Y. pestis colonizes the flea midgut and forms a biofilm in the <b>proventricular</b> <b>valve,</b> which blocks normal blood feeding. The enteropathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, from which Y. pestis recently evolved, is not transmitted by fleas. However, both Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis form biofilms that adhere to the external mouthparts and block feeding of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes, which has been proposed {{as a model of}} Y. pestis-flea interactions. We compared the ability of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis to infect the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis and to produce biofilms in the flea and in vitro. Five of 18 Y. pseudotuberculosis strains, encompassing seven serotypes, including all three serotype O 3 strains tested, were unable to stably colonize the flea midgut. The other strains persisted in the flea midgut for 4 weeks but did not increase in numbers, and none of the 18 strains colonized the proventriculus or produced a biofilm in the flea. Y. pseudotuberculosis strains also varied greatly in their ability to produce biofilms in vitro, but there was no correlation between biofilm phenotype in vitro or on the surface of C. elegans and the ability to colonize or block fleas. Our results support a model in which a genetic change in the Y. pseudotuberculosis progenitor of Y. pestis extended its pre-existing ex vivo biofilm-forming ability to the flea gut environment, thus enabling proventricular blockage and efficient flea-borne transmission. Flea-borne transmission of Yersinia pestis is a relatively recen...|$|E
40|$|The Yersinia pestis Hms+ {{phenotype}} is {{a manifestation}} of biofilm formation that causes adsorption of Congo red and haemin at 26  °C but not at 37  °C. This phenotype is required for blockage of the <b>proventricular</b> <b>valve</b> of the oriental rat flea and {{plays a role in}} transmission of bubonic plague from fleas to mammals. Genes responsible for this phenotype are located in three separate operons, hmsHFRS, hmsT and hmsP. HmsH and HmsF are outer membrane (OM) proteins, while the other four Hms proteins are located in the inner membrane. According to the Hidden Markov Method-based predictor, HmsH has a large N terminus in the periplasm, a β-barrel structure with 16 β-strands that traverse the OM, eight surface-exposed loops, and seven short turns connecting the β-strands on the periplasmic side. Here, we demonstrate that HmsH is a heat-modifiable protein, a characteristic of other β-barrel proteins, thereby supporting the bioinformatics analysis. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to identify conserved amino acids in the HmsH-like family that are critical for the function of HmsH in biofilm formation. Of 23 conserved amino acids mutated, four residues affected HmsH function and three likely caused protein instability. We used formaldehyde cross-linking to demonstrate that HmsH interacts with HmsF but not with HmsR, HmsS, HmsT or HmsP. Loss-of-function HmsH variants with single alanine substitutions retained their β-structure and interaction with HmsF. Finally, using a polar hmsH : : mini-kan mutant, we demonstrated that biofilm development is not important for the pathogenesis of bubonic or pneumonic plague in mice...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the {{classification}} of bees has been conducted {{with the aid of}} dissecting (light) microscopy. In more recent times, detailed information on external and internal morphology for bee classification has been obtained using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. MicroCT is emerging as a new method for non-invasive 3 D computerised X-ray tomographic imaging of insects at the microscopic level, and in this study has been evaluated for its use in morphological studies of bees. A Skyscan 1172 MicroCT system was used to assess the internal and external morphology of the Australian stingless bee Trigona carbonaria with particular focus on the proventricular plates. MicroCT was useful in non-invasively visualising gross external morphological features such as the articulations of the coxae, trochanters, tibiae and tarsi of each leg including broadened hind basitarsi. Image magnification revealed further detail such as antennal scapes and the various parts of the tongue including the proboscis and labia. However, the individual facets of the eye were barely discernable and MicroCT did not reveal fine details of hairs on the body or legs. Internal morphology was clearly visualised, including the tracheal system and details of the proventriculus and proventricular basal plates which form the leaflets of the <b>proventricular</b> <b>valve.</b> Thus, the characteristic features of the proventricular basal plates of Meliponini could be quickly and easily identified non-invasively. Therefore, MicroCT, as one of the emerging techniques of diagnostic radioentomology, has particular advantages for non-invasively and non-destructively imaging bees and, particularly, rare or more scientifically valued insects such as museum specimens and those trapped in amber...|$|E
40|$|Transmission of Yersinia pestis by flea bite {{can occur}} by two mechanisms. After taking a blood meal from a bacteremic mammal, fleas have the {{potential}} to transmit the very next time they feed. This early-phase transmission resembles mechanical transmission in some respects, but the mechanism is unknown. Thereafter, transmission occurs after Yersinia pestis forms a biofilm in the <b>proventricular</b> <b>valve</b> in the flea foregut. The biofilm can impede and sometimes completely block the ingestion of blood, resulting in regurgitative transmission of bacteria into the bite site. In this study, we compared the relative efficiency of the two modes of transmission for Xenopsylla cheopis, a flea known to become completely blocked at a high rate, and Oropsylla montana, a flea that has been considered to rarely develop proventricular blockage. Fleas that took an infectious blood meal containing Y. pestis were maintained and monitored for four weeks for infection and proventricular blockage. The number of Y. pestis transmitted by groups of fleas by the two modes of transmission was also determined. O. montana readily developed complete proventricular blockage, and large numbers of Y. pestis were transmitted by that mechanism both by it and by X. cheopis, a flea known to block at a high rate. In contrast, few bacteria were transmitted in the early phase by either species. A model system incorporating standardized experimental conditions and viability controls was developed to more reliably compare the infection, proventricular blockage and transmission dynamics of different flea vectors, and was used to resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the vector competence of O. montana. Both X. cheopis and O. montana are fully capable of transmitting Y. pestis by the proventricular biofilm-dependent mechanism...|$|E
