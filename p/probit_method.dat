40|$|BackgroundThe PROBIT {{methodology}} {{was presented}} in the 1995 World Health Organization Technical Report on Anthropometry {{as an alternative to}} the standard prevalence based method of measuring malnutrition in children. Theoretically the <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> will always give a smaller standard error than the standard prevalence method in measuring malnutrition. A recent article by Dale et al. assessed the <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> for measuring global acute malnutrition measure and found that the method was biased and the precision was superior only for sample sizes less than 150 when compared to the standard method. In a manner similar to Dale, our study further investigated the bias and precision of the <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> for different sample sizes using simulated populations. ResultsThe <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> showed bias for each of the ten simulated populations, but the direction and magnitude of the average bias was changed depending on the simulated population. For a given simulated population, the average bias was relatively constant for all sample sizes drawn. The 95 % half-width confidence interval was lower for the <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> than the standard prevalence method regardless of the sample size or simulated population. The absolute difference in the confidence limits showed the most gains for the <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> for the smaller samples sizes, but the ratio of confidence intervals was relatively constant across all sample sizes. ConclusionsThe <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> will provide gains in precision regardless of the sample size, but the method may be biased.

40|$|Abstract Objective Prevalence {{of acute}} {{malnutrition}} is classically {{estimated by the}} proportion of children meeting a case definition in a representative population sample. In 1995 the WHO proposed the <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method,</b> based on converting parameters of a normally distributed variable to cumulative probability, as an alternative method requiring a smaller sample size. The present study compares classical and PROBIT methods for estimating the prevalence of global, moderate and severe acute malnutrition (GAM, MAM and SAM) defined by weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Design Bias and precision of classical and PROBIT methods were compared by simulating a total of 1 · 26 million surveys generated from 560 nutrition surveys. Setting Data used for simulation were derived from nutritional surveys of children aged 6 - 59 months carried out in thirty-one countries around the world. Subjects Data of 459 036 children aged 6 - 59 months from representative samples were used to generate simulated populations. Results The <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> provided an estimate of GAM, MAM and SAM using WHZ or MUAC proportional to the true prevalence with a small systematic overestimation. The <b>PROBIT</b> <b>method</b> was more precise than the classical method for estimating the prevalence for GAM, MAM and SAM by WHZ or MUAC for small sample sizes (i. e. n< 150 for SAM and GAM; n< 300 for MAM), but lost this advantage when sample sizes increased. Conclusions The classical method is preferred for estimating acute malnutrition prevalence from large sample surveys.

Because of its greater flexibility in design, the <b>probit</b> <b>method</b> was used to estimate the shelf-life for four bacterial populations, wet and dry spores of Bacillus anthracis and wet and dry cells of Pasteurella tularensis. On the basis of data gained by storing these organisms at high temperature, the <b>probit</b> <b>method</b> was used to predict the time at which 50 % viability would occur for cells stored at 3 C. A plane passing through a three-space showing change in percentage viability of bacteria was formulated by a multiple regression method. With this functional technique, the percentage viability, expressed as a probit, was linearily related to a logarithm of storage time and storage temperature. The use of this method to study the effect of controlled variables on the viability of cells is demonstrated by comparing the effect of viability associated with three additives used prior to drying.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the prevalence of acute malnutrition in children under five is widely used {{for the detection of}} emergencies, planning interventions, advocacy, and monitoring and evaluation. This study examined PROBIT Methods which convert parameters (mean and standard deviation (SD)) of a normally distributed variable to a cumulative probability below any cut-off to estimate acute malnutrition in children under five using Middle-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC). We assessed the performance of: <b>PROBIT</b> <b>Method</b> I, with mean MUAC from the survey sample and MUAC SD from a database of previous surveys; and <b>PROBIT</b> <b>Method</b> II, with mean and SD of MUAC observed in the survey sample. Specifically, we generated sub-samples from 852 survey datasets, simulating 100 surveys for eight sample sizes. Overall the methods were tested on 681 600 simulated surveys. PROBIT methods relying on sample sizes as small as 50 had better performance than the classic method for estimating and classifying the prevalence of acute malnutrition. They had better precision in the estimation of acute malnutrition for all sample sizes and better coverage for smaller sample sizes, while having relatively little bias. They classified situations accurately for a threshold of 5 % acute malnutrition. Both PROBIT methods had similar outcomes. PROBIT Methods have a clear advantage in the {{assessment of}} acute malnutrition prevalence based on MUAC, compared to the classic method.

We used the Ordered Probit Model to evaluate the effect of the explanatory variables on the enterprise profitability status, but also to determine the impact of each explanatory variable on the probability of each level of enterprise profitability status. This is because our dependent variable is polychotomous in nature (Borooah 2002). Modelling polytchotomous dependent variables may use the ordered logit or ordered <b>probit</b> <b>methods.</b> In principal, the two approaches arrive at the same results and conclusions. While there are no theoretical reasons for preferring one method to the other, the majority of analysts tend to use the ordered probit, possibly because of its assumption of normal distribution of the error term. In the ordered logit model the error term is assumed to be logistically distributed, whereas in the ordered probit model the error term is normally distributed. The two approaches also differ in terms of interpretation of their coefficients. The other advantage of the ordered probit analysis over the ordered logit is that it allows for random test variation, correlated error terms and unequal error variances, but also can capture any substitution pattern (Borooah 2002).|$|R
