40|$|A {{total of}} 3528 {{specimens}} of freshwater turtles belonging to two families viz., Geoemydidae (brown river turtle, Kachuga smithi; Indian saw-backed turtle, K. tecta; Brahminy river turtle, Hardella thurgi; spotted pond turtle, Geoclemys hamiltonii) and Trionychidae (Indian soft-shell turtle, Aspederates gangeticus; <b>peacock</b> <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle,</b> A. hurum; narrow-headed soft-shell turtle, Chitra indica; Indian flap-shell turtle, Lissemys punciata) were identified. Kachuga smithi (43. 62 %) and K. tecta (42. 06 %) had abundant population status, whereas, Hardella thurgi (0. 88 %) and Chitra indica (0. 54 %) were rare. Capturing of turtles for supply to foreigners and export {{is a major}} threat to these animals. Fishermen also kill them during fishing. Canal closure and de-silting is also harmful to turtles.

50|$|Scientifically, {{the black}} <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> or Bostami Turtle (Aspideretes Nigricans, {{sometimes}} placed in genus Nilssonia) is {{a species of}} freshwater turtle found in India (Assam) and Bangladesh (Chittagong).

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the brief {{introduction}} of Turtle Rescue and Conservation Centre (TRCC) and description of some rescued turtles. Nine specimens of turtles belonging to five genera were rescued and trans-located to the centre till date including 9. 3 kg male Indian <b>Peacock</b> <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> (Nilssonia hurum) {{for the first time}} from Jhapa district. The rescue operations were conducted for the translocation of turtles confiscated from the local market, censorial collectors, fisherman and public residence. The high resolution photographs of captured specimens, their necessary biometry and GPS coordinates of location were taken. Species identification was done with the help of and pictorial field guide and relevant literatures. Climatic data of study area were recorded from Gainde Irrigation Project, Maidhar, Jhapa. Interviews were taken during field visits with the help of structured questionnaire. Preliminary rescue data showed that the Indian flap-shelled turtle (Lissemys punctata) and Yellow bellied roofed turtle (Pangshura flaviventer) were the most overexploited species in the vicinities of the study area. The climatic condition of the rescue centre and water quality found suitable to support terrestrial and freshwater turtles and other various wetland flora and fauna. However, the rapid population growth and habitat destruction due to deforestation, unmanaged urbanization and expansion of agricultural land are found as the major threats to th...|$|R

Instead, we analyzed the embryos of a <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> species with highly emarginated skull. In fact, <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> have only a narrow bar of bone across the temporal region lateral to the external adductor muscles due to large scale emargination from the dorsal and ventral margins of the cheek (Ogushi, 1911, Sheil, 2003). In normal development of <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles,</b> the postorbital bone does not grow in a posterior direction significantly, keeping its relatively small size within the dermatocranium (Sheil, 2003;Sánchez-Villagra et al.,, Sánchez-Villagra et al., Sánchez-Villagra et al., 2009). Therefore, the small postorbital bone of <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtles</b> does not largely contribute {{to the formation of}} a bony roof at the temporal region of the skull.|$|R

40|$|The {{capability}} of Chlorella vulgaris to remove nitrogen {{in the form}} of ammonium ions from the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater in a local agricultural products limited company (in Hangzhou, China) was studied. The <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater was found to include high concentrations of nitrogen (107. 63 ± 4. 84 mg/L) {{in the form of}} ammonium (NH 4 +) with the small amounts of nitrite (0. 32 ± 0. 04 mg/L on annual average) at pH 6. 7 and to be suitable for growing Chlorella vulgaris. When Chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in a batch mode, a majority of the nitrogen concentration was dramatically removed after a lag-phase period. The total biomass weight gained during the entire cultivation period balanced out well with the nitrogen removed from the culture medium. These results indicate that Chlorella vulgaris has potential to remove nitrogen (i. e., ammonium ion) and nitrite at a reasonable uptake rate from wastewater while being cultivated using the <b>soft-shelled</b> <b>turtle</b> processing wastewater...|$|R
5000|$|The head of Amyda cartilaginea can {{be black}} or brown. Its head {{typically}} displays yellow dots that sometimes appear to fuse together, creating elongated streaks. As the turtle ages, its nape region becomes white or gray. [...] A trait that helps differentiate the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> from other similar species is its noticeably elongated snout. This is an adaptation that, coupled with its great flexibility, aids the turtle in breathing {{when it has}} buried itself. [...] Increased gas exchange, {{a result of an}} adaptation known as [...] "pharyngel breathing", allows the Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle</b> to remain submerged in water for extended periods of time. [...] Amyda cartilaginea has several permanent tubercles on its neck; [...] these tubercles can appear yellow or black. The Asiatic <b>soft-shell</b> <b>turtle's</b> limbs also have yellow spots, but these are usually less in quantity and difficult to distinguish. Its feet are wide and flat, resembling paddles. As a final descriptive note, the males have longer and thicker tails than females.|$|R
