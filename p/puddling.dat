5|$|<b>Puddling</b> process: The <b>puddling</b> {{process was}} known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The {{improvement}} of steelmaking processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated forging, folding, and stacking of wrought iron from pig iron to make swords.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began {{refining}} iron from {{pig iron}} to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the <b>puddling</b> process for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others, including Joseph Hall.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, <b>puddling</b> furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
50|$|Phrynobatrachus is a genus of Sub-Saharan frogs {{that form}} the monogeneric family Phrynobatrachidae. Their common name is <b>puddle</b> frogs, dwarf <b>puddle</b> frogs, African <b>puddle</b> frogs, or African river frogs.The common name, <b>puddle</b> frog, refers {{to the fact that}} many species breed in {{temporary}} waterbodies such as <b>puddles.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} of anuran communities at the Serra do Cipó (southeastern Brazil) was studied to familiarize ourselves with {{the species that}} breed at natural <b>puddles.</b> An experiment with artificial <b>puddles</b> was conducted to investigate the relationship os several physical properties of <b>puddles</b> to the pattern of their colonization by breeding anurans; the factors included was <b>puddle</b> size, permanency, pH, distance from a colonizing source, and abundance and richness of potential tadpoles predators. Estimates of anuran species richness were based on records of tadpoles and calling males, species richness was higher in <b>puddles</b> with more types of tadpoles predators. The number of species of tadpoles was higher in less ephemeral <b>puddles</b> with more predator types, {{and the number of}} species of calling males was higher in <b>puddles</b> having greater abundance of tadpole predators. Males may not be sensitive to tadpole-predation risk when they select calling sites, and the same physical characteristics of the <b>puddles</b> may attract both tadpole predators and anurans. For example, <b>puddle</b> permanency problably is such a feature, because in the less ephemeral <b>puddles</b> there were more species of tadpoles, as well as greater numbers and species richness of predators...|$|R
5|$|Parry {{was born}} in Merthyr Tydfil in 1841, the seventh of eight {{children}} of Daniel and Elizabeth Parry (née Richards). The family was musically inclined, with all family members singing in the chapel choir. Parry's mother, who performed at church functions, was remembered for her fine voice; two of Parry's sisters, Elizabeth and Jane, and a brother, Henry, gained some prominence in the United States as vocalists. He left school at age nine {{to work in the}} mines as the family needed the income. Young Parry worked a 56-hour week for twelve and a half pence while at the mine. By age 12, Parry was working at the <b>puddling</b> furnaces of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, where his father also worked.|$|E
5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay <b>puddling</b> to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|In 1827 {{a rolling}} mill capable of 100 tons of bar iron per week was {{installed}} at the Walker Ironworks; in the same year, Losh, Wilson and Bell's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White's gazetteer of Durham and Northumberland as a steam engine manufacturer. In 1833, the iron <b>puddling</b> process was installed at Walker. In 1835, while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway, Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont, and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby. In that year, {{at the age of}} nineteen, Thomas Bell's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm's Newcastle office under his father. In 1836 he joined his father at the firm's ironworks at Walker.|$|E
25|$|The flame {{is applied}} to the base metal and held until a small <b>puddle</b> of molten metal is formed. The <b>puddle</b> is moved along the path where the weld bead is desired. Usually, more metal is added to the <b>puddle</b> as it is moved along by dipping metal from a welding rod or filler rod into the molten metal <b>puddle.</b> The metal <b>puddle</b> will travel towards where the metal is the hottest. This is {{accomplished}} through torch manipulation by the welder.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Puddles</b> are {{a source}} of {{recreation}} for children, who often like jumping in <b>puddles</b> as an [...] "up-side" [...] to rain. A children's nursery rhyme records the story of Doctor Foster and his encounter with a <b>puddle</b> in Gloucester. Muddy <b>puddles,</b> and the pleasures of splashing mud in them, are a repeated theme in the children's animation Peppa Pig, to the extent of selling character-branded wellington boots.|$|R
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and <b>puddling</b> process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Hall {{discovered}} that the addition of iron oxide {{to the charge of}} the <b>puddling</b> furnace caused a violent reaction, in which the pig iron was decarburised, this became known as 'wet puddling'. It was also found possible to produce steel by stopping the <b>puddling</b> process before decarburisation was complete.|$|E

25|$|In 1802 {{there was}} a partial failure, {{probably}} due to the sides bowing and transferring too much weight to the base where they joined to the deck. After remedial work it failed again in 1812 and was reinforced with timber baulks. Although plans were prepared for replacement in stone, it survived until 1930, when the bottom plates were replaced by a wooden base, which was sealed by <b>puddling.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1853, {{the firm}} reorganized, {{doubling}} its capital investment and adopting the name Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company. Within a year, the company's assets had {{expanded to include}} three furnaces, a steel-making <b>puddling</b> mill, a foundry, two blacksmith shops, two carpentry shops, a saw mill, a grist mill, company store, 200 dwellings (to house workers), a boarding house, iron ore mines, coal mines, a tavern, and a hotel.|$|E
25|$|For other {{purposes}} further processing {{is needed to}} reduce the carbon content to enable iron {{to be used for}} tools or as a construction material. There have been various processes for this. The earliest process was conducted in the finery forge. In the late 18th century, this began to be displaced by 'potting and stamping', but the most successful new process of the industrial revolution period was <b>puddling.</b>|$|E

25|$|Iron {{founding}} – In the Iron industry, coke {{was finally}} {{applied to all}} stages of iron smelting, replacing charcoal. This had been achieved much earlier for lead and copper {{as well as for}} producing pig iron in a blast furnace, but the second stage in the production of bar iron depended on the use of potting and stamping (for which a patent expired in 1786) or <b>puddling</b> (patented by Henry Cort in 1783 and 1784).|$|E
25|$|Industrialization {{took place}} in Wallonia (French {{speaking}} southern Belgium), starting {{in the middle of}} the 1820s, and especially after 1830. The availability of cheap coal was a main factor that attracted entrepreneurs. Numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as <b>puddling</b> and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around Liège and Charleroi. The leader was a transplanted Englishman John Cockerill. His factories at Seraing integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.|$|E
25|$|Adults use a {{wide range}} of food sources, most preferring to nectar on sturdy plants with red or pink flowers. Many members of the {{families}} Apocynaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae are used as common nectar sources. Males participate in a behavior called <b>puddling,</b> in which they congregate on mud, damp gravel or puddles. They extract sodium ions and amino acids from these sources which aid in reproduction. Males that puddle are typically fresh, and puddle only for their first couple of days. Females will occasionally puddle, but do not form congregations. Adults have also been seen feeding on dung, carrion, and urine.|$|E

25|$|Belgium was {{the second}} country, after Britain, in which the Industrial Revolution took place and the first in {{continental}} Europe: Wallonia (French speaking southern Belgium) was the first region to follow the British model successfully. Starting {{in the middle of}} the 1820s, and especially after Belgium became an independent nation in 1830, numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as <b>puddling</b> and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around Liège and Charleroi.

25|$|Cleveland Rolling Mill {{expanded}} {{its presence in}} 1868 {{with the construction of}} the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. By the end of 1872, the combined Cleveland plants had two <b>puddling</b> mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, the English {{steelmakers}} produced blister and crucible steel which required specialized equipment like finery forges and <b>puddling</b> furnaces and cost over £50 per long ton. In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns {{increased demand for}} wrought iron and steel. The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was {{the largest in the}} United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.|$|E
