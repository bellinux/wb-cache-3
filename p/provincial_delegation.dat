As such, a parallel central bank, headquartered in Burgos, was formed. Both Republican and Nationalist banks claimed to be the legitimate Bank of Spain, both domestically and internationally. The central headquarters of the Bank of Spain in Madrid, and thus its gold reserves, as well as its most important <b>provincial</b> <b>delegations,</b> were kept under the control of the Republican government, while the Nationalists gained control of the <b>provincial</b> <b>delegations</b> within their territory, including Burgos.|$|R
