5|$|This form of {{treatment}} {{is meant to}} reduce the intensity or altogether eliminate the allergic reactions people have by gradually increasing exposure to the form of radiation that brings about the reaction. In the case of solar urticaria, <b>phototherapy</b> and photochemotherapy are the two major desensitization treatments.|$|E
5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to <b>phototherapy</b> because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phototherapies</b> like {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT), UVA 1, UVB, and PUVA treat skin diseases. These <b>phototherapies</b> work because they alter cytokine profiles, change immune cytotoxicity in the skin, and directly kill diseased cells by apoptosis. Apoptosis {{is a term}} that only describes the morphologic changes a cell undergoes during this mode of cell death. The terms “immediate”, “intermediate”, and “delayed” apoptosis segregate the different apoptotic mechanisms into three kinetic categories, whereas the terms preprogrammed cell death (pre-PCD) and programmed cell death (PCD) describe the underlying mechanisms. Immediate apoptosis (T ≤ 0. 5 h post-exposure) is triggered by singlet-oxygen damage that opens the mitochondrial megachannel, which can be mediated by PDT or UVA 1 radiation. It is a pre-PCD mechanism of apoptosis, i. e., protein synthesis is not required post-insult, because all the necessary components are constitutively synthesized and only need to be activated. Intermediate apoptosis (T ≤ 4 h > 0. 5 h) is initiated by receptor cross-linking on the plasma membrane, which can be achieved using high doses of UVB or UVC radiation. It is also a pre-PCD mechanism. Delayed apoptosis (T > 4 h) is induced by DNA damage that {{can be caused by}} X-rays, PUVA, UVC, UVB, UVA, and PDT. It is a PCD mechanism of apoptosis, i. e., protein synthesis is required post-insult. These three apoptotic mechanisms each access one of two “pointsof-no-return” located on the mitochondrial membrane, which activate different, but not mutually exclusive, final pathways of apoptosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{importance}} of validly identifying and incorporating patients' views for improving {{health care is}} generally acknowledged. Common approaches to assess patients' preferences {{are based on the}} quality adjusted life year (QALY) framework, but this ignores a number of aspects that may be relevant. As an alternative, we assessed patients' treatment preferences and trade-offs for five common systemic therapies for psoriasis. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Twenty-nine patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis expressed treatment preferences for five oral and <b>phototherapies</b> and indicated the relative {{importance of}} various treatment attributes, such as adverse effects, discomforts, and safety measures. In a structured interview, they were presented with clinical scenarios that contained descriptions of process and outcome characteristics and illustrations of the anticipated treatment benefit. RESULTS: Over all paired comparisons, methotrexate (33 %), cyclosporin (30 %), acitretin (15 %), UV-B (14 %), and PUVA (8 %) were preferred to the other treatment. Patients were willing to trade-off their initial preference for more improvement of psoriasis.

40|$|Since ancient times, many {{cultures}} worldwide found out independently that the topical administration of some photoactive natural products (mainly extracted from plants) followed {{by exposure to}} sunlight, might be an effective treatment of some skin diseases, thus accidently giving birth to the so-called photochemotherapy. In the attempt to resemble nature by exploiting its teaching, {{during the last two}} centuries, scientists tried to rationalize this knowledge in order to develop more effective therapeutic strategies and to understand in depth the mechanisms of action involved, expanding the potential application of this therapy to pathologies other than skin diseases, such as some types of tumors.

25|$|The lamps used in <b>phototherapy</b> {{contain a}} {{phosphor}} that emits only UVB ultraviolet light. There are two types: broadband UVB that gives 290–320 nanometer with peak wavelength of 306nm, and narrowband UVB that gives 311–313 nanometer.

25|$|One {{treatment}} {{strategy is}} light therapy (<b>phototherapy),</b> {{with either a}} full-spectrum lamp providing 10,000 lux at a specified distance from the eyes or a wearable LED device providing 350–550 lux at a shorter distance.

The light is typically timed for 30–90 minutes at the patient's usual time of spontaneous awakening, or shortly before (but not long before), which is {{in accordance with the}} phase response curve (PRC) for light. Only experimentation, preferably with specialist help, will show how great an advance is possible and comfortable. For maintenance, some patients must continue the treatment indefinitely; some may reduce the daily treatment to 15 minutes; others may use the lamp, for example, just a few days a week or just every third week. Whether the treatment is successful is highly individual. Light therapy generally requires adding some extra time to the patient's morning routine. Patients with a family history of macular degeneration are advised to consult with an eye doctor. The use of exogenous melatonin administration (see below) in conjunction with light therapy is common.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of two <b>phototherapies,</b> laser and {{polarized}} light, on diode laser (970 lambda nm) wounds. Background Data: Lasers have been used in surgery, and some wavelengths may cause thermal damage to the tissue and affect healing. Several studies have shown that some wavelengths are effective in improving healing. Coherent and noncoherent light have been successfully used on the modulation of biological phenomena of several origins. Animals and Methods: Thirty-one Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups (GI to GIII). A 20 -mm x 2 -mm wound was created on the dorsum of each animal with a diode laser (Sirolaser, Sirona (R), Bensheim, Germany). Group GI acted as control. On GII, laser light (lambda 655 nm, 30 mW, phi similar to 3 mm, 12 J/cm(2)) was used and on GIII illumination with polarized light (lambda 400 - 2000 nm, 40 mW, phi similar to 5. 5 cm, 12 J/cm(2)) was used, every other day (GII) or daily (GIII) for 7 days. The animals were killed at 0, 7, and 14 days after surgery. Specimens were taken, routinely processed, stained and imunnomarked [HE (hematoxylin-eosin), sirius red, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) ], and underwent histological analysis. Results: GII showed better response at day 14 when re-epithelialization was in a more advanced stage. The number of myofibroblasts was significantly different over the healing time (7 to 14 days); this number was smaller than that observed on G 1. On GIII at day 7, the number of myofibroblasts was significantly higher than for GII. At day 14, a more pronounced deposition of collagen matrix was also seen, and inflammation was discrete and more advanced for GIII. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that the effect of the use of laser light was more evident at early stages of healing and that the use of polarized light improved the resolution of the inflammatory reaction, increased the deposition of collagen, increased the number of myofibroblasts, and quickened re-epithelialization during the experimental time...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetal nanoparticles, {{especially}} those {{made of the}} noble metals gold, silver and copper, show a strong optical response which can be tailored through their shape, size and composition. An intriguing aspect of these noble metal nanostructures is their influence on the photophysics of nearby molecules, as exemplified by effects such as surface-enhanced Raman scattering or the quenching of fluorescence. The strong interaction with light makes metal nanoparticles interesting objects for application in bioanalytical detection, imaging, and possibly <b>phototherapies.</b> From a materials point of view {{it is important for}} biophotonic applications to make the metal particles compatible with biological media: they need to be protected against aggregation and remain intact while exposed to the myriad of biochemical species present. We have been exploring self-assembled monolayers of hydrophilic, tetraethyleneglycol-terminated ligands for the protection of gold nanoparticles. [1] These monolayers give rise to PEGylated particles that are particularly robust in aqueous solution at high ionic strengths and even extreme pHs. Recently we found that the monolayers are also very effective in protecting silver and mixed gold/silver nanoparticles. Another aspect that we have been investigating is the introduction of functional molecular modules into water-borne nanoparticle assemblies. Such modules may be fluorescent entities, which are interesting {{for the study of the}} effect of metal nanostructures on molecular fluorescence,[2] or biological moieties for biomolecular recognition. We have applied two different strategies to achieve this integration: layer-by-layer deposition on the particle surface of functionalised polyelectrolytes, and the use of functionalised disulfides for the formation of the protecting ligand mantle. We will present recent results on the preparation, protection, functionalisation and purification of gold and silver nanoparticles, as well as ensemble photophysical investigations on particles in aqueous suspension.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoralen-UVA (PUVA) and {{narrowband}} UVB (311 -nm) therapy {{are considered}} to be first-line <b>phototherapies</b> for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. To reduce side effects as a result of systemic resorption of psoralens, topical PUVA therapies have been developed and proven to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the combination therapy of narrowband UVB plus cream PUVA on selected psoriatic plaques compared with narrowband UVB or cream PUVA alone. METHODS: A total of 30 patients (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score of 8 - 15) were included in the randomized study. The combination therapy consisting of narrowband UVB whole-body irradiation followed by cream PUVA therapy for selected psoriatic plaques was evaluated in 10 patients with chronic plaque-stage psoriasis. For comparison, the therapeutic efficacy, number of treatments, and cumulative UV doses until remission (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score < 4) of cream PUVA therapy or narrowband UVB alone was determined in 10 patients, respectively. RESULTS: Both monotherapies induced clearance of psoriatic lesions in all patients within 5 to 7 weeks. Mean number of treatments for cream PUVA was 24 +/- 5; for narrowband UVB was 21 +/- 3. The mean cumulative UVA dose was 45. 0 +/- 16. 3 J/cm(2) and the mean cumulative UVB dose was 17. 1 +/- 4. 1 J/cm(2). Combination therapy resulted in complete clearance of lesions in all patients after 3 to 4 weeks. Mean number of treatment was 14 +/- 2, mean cumulative UVA dose was 18. 7 +/- 4. 7 J/cm(2), and mean cumulative UVB dose was 8. 2 +/- 3. 3 J/cm(2). The number of treatments (P <. 001, analysis of variance), UVA dose (P <. 001, t test), and UVB dose (P <. 001, t test) were significantly reduced compared with both monotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a combination therapy of narrowband UVB plus cream PUVA appears to have a significantly higher efficacy compared with either monotherapy. The cumulative UV doses were significantly lower in the combination therapy. We conclude that cream PUVA can be used in addition to narrowband UVB for areas that tend to clear less quickly {{than the rest of the}} body...|$|R

On the other hand, delayed clamping resulted in an increased birth weight of on average about 100 g, and an increased hemoglobin concentration of on average 1.5 g/dL with half the risk of being iron deficient at three and six months, but an increased risk of jaundice requiring <b>phototherapy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|IVIG {{has been}} used to {{successfully}} treat many cases of HDN. It {{has been used}} not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well. IVIG can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of <b>phototherapy.</b> The AAP recommends [...] "In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenousγ-globulin (0.5-1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive <b>phototherapy</b> or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34-51 μmol/L) of the exchange level [...] If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms). Intravenous γ-globulin has been shown to reduce the need for exchange transfusions in Rh and ABO hemolytic disease." ...|$|E
2500|$|Generally, lichen nitidus is {{asymptomatic}} and self-limited; therefore, {{no treatment}} is required. [...] However, if persistent pruritus is present, or the appearance “...interferes with daily activities or outlook...” topical glucocorticoids may be tried. [...] If the disease process is symptomatic, generalized and extensive, oral glucocorticoids may be indicated. [...] Other reported treatments include PUVA, UVA/UVB <b>phototherapy,</b> astemizole, acitretin, and etretinate.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{have been}} reported for cutaneous lichen planus, however {{there is a general}} lack of evidence of efficacy for any treatment. Treatments tend to be prolonged, partially effective and disappointing. [...] The mainstay of localized skin lesions is topical steroids. Additional treatments include retinoids, such as acitretin, or sulfasalazine. Narrow band UVB <b>phototherapy</b> or systemic PUVA therapy are known treatment modalities for generalized disease.|$|E
