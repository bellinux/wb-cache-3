50|$|Majorica <b>pearls</b> are {{different}} from oyster <b>pearls</b> in several respects. Majorica <b>pearls</b> are man-made in a factory under strict control of the manufacturing process; whereas oyster <b>pearls</b> grow in nature with frequent irregularities uncontrolled by man. It takes only several weeks to produce a Majorica <b>pearl,</b> while it takes years to obtain a sizable oyster <b>pearl</b> and only 5% are gem quality <b>pearls.</b> Majorica <b>pearls</b> lack individuality, as every Majorica <b>pearl</b> is perfectly matched and round-shaped whereas no two oyster <b>pearls</b> are alike. Oyster <b>pearl's</b> peculiarity stems from its certain blemish, similar to birthmarks or fingerprints.|$|R
50|$|Tahitian <b>pearls,</b> {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as black <b>pearls,</b> are highly valued because of their rarity; the culturing process for them dictates a smaller volume output and they can never be mass-produced because, in common with most sea <b>pearls,</b> the oyster can only be nucleated with one <b>pearl</b> at a time, while freshwater mussels are capable of multiple <b>pearl</b> implants. Before the days of cultured <b>pearls,</b> black <b>pearls</b> were rare and highly valued {{for the simple reason}} that white <b>pearl</b> oysters rarely produced naturally black <b>pearls,</b> and black <b>pearl</b> oysters rarely produced any natural <b>pearls</b> at all.|$|R

5000|$|Keshi <b>pearls,</b> {{although}} they often occur by chance, {{are not considered}} natural. They are a byproduct of the culturing process, and hence do not happen without human intervention. They are quite small, typically only a few millimeters. Keshi <b>pearls</b> are produced by {{many different types of}} marine mollusks and freshwater mussels in China. Keshi <b>pearls</b> are actually a mistake in the cultured <b>pearl</b> seeding process. In seeding the cultured <b>pearl,</b> a piece of mantle muscle from a sacrificed oyster is placed with a bead of mother of <b>pearl</b> within the oyster. If the piece of mantle should slip off the bead, a <b>pearl</b> forms of baroque shape about the mantle piece which is entirely nacre. Therefore, a Keshi <b>pearl</b> could be considered superior to cultured <b>pearls</b> with a mother of <b>pearl</b> bead center. In the cultured <b>pearl</b> industry, the resources used to create a mistaken all nacre baroque <b>pearl</b> is a drain on the production of round cultured <b>pearls.</b> Therefore, they are trying to improve culturing technique so that keshi <b>pearls</b> do not occur. All nacre <b>pearls</b> may one day be limited to natural found <b>pearls.</b> Today many [...] "keshi" [...] <b>pearls</b> are actually intentional, with post-harvest shells returned to the water to regenerate a <b>pearl</b> in the existing <b>pearl</b> sac.|$|R

50|$|In general, cultured <b>pearls</b> {{are less}} {{valuable}} than natural <b>pearls,</b> whereas imitation <b>pearls</b> have almost no value. One way that jewelers can {{determine whether a}} <b>pearl</b> is cultured or natural {{is to have a}} gemlab perform an X-ray examination of the <b>pearl.</b> If X-rays reveals a nucleus, the <b>pearl</b> is likely a bead-nucleated saltwater <b>pearl.</b> If no nucleus is present, but irregular and small dark inner spots indicating a cavity are visible, combined with concentric rings of organic substance, the <b>pearl</b> is likely a cultured freshwater. Cultured freshwater <b>pearls</b> can often be confused for natural <b>pearls</b> which present as homogeneous pictures which continuously darken toward the surface of the <b>pearl.</b> Natural <b>pearls</b> will often show larger cavities where organic matter has dried out and decomposed.|$|R

5000|$|Keshi <b>pearls</b> {{are small}} non-nucleated <b>pearls</b> {{typically}} formed as by-products of <b>pearl</b> cultivation. A Japanese word also meaning [...] "poppy" [...] (ケシ, 芥子), {{it is used}} in Japanese for all <b>pearls</b> that grew without a nucleus. Originally, keshi <b>pearls</b> referred to those <b>pearls</b> formed when a bead nucleus was rejected. More recently, keshi {{has been used to}} refer to second harvest <b>pearls</b> and even to freshwater non-nucleated <b>pearls.</b> However the later usage referring to freshwater <b>pearls</b> is considered erroneous by many leading gem trade associations. Because they have no nucleus, keshi <b>pearls</b> are composed entirely of nacre.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that <b>pearl</b> oysters, Pinctada margaritifera, {{producing}} low quality <b>pearls</b> with concentric grooves or ‘circles’ {{are unlikely to}} produce <b>pearls</b> with improved quality if grafted again for <b>pearl</b> production. Such oysters are often discarded. However, if these oysters are capable of improved <b>pearl</b> quality when re-grafted, this would provide opportunities for improved income for <b>pearl</b> farmers. This study aimed to determine whether oysters producing circled <b>pearls</b> are able to produce <b>pearls</b> with improved quality after re-grafting. A total of 100 oysters that produced circled <b>pearls</b> and would have normally been discarded were re-grafted {{and the quality of}} successive <b>pearls</b> produced by individual oysters was compared in terms of shape, size, lustre, colour, surface perfection and overall quality. The proportion of <b>pearls</b> with circles decreased from 95 % of first graft <b>pearls</b> to 48 % after the second graft, and 18 % of second graft <b>pearls</b> were classified as ‘semi-round’ and superior in shape to all first graft <b>pearls.</b> There was a significant improvement (p = 0. 04) in the overall shape of second graft <b>pearls</b> compared to first graft <b>pearls.</b> The highest proportion of <b>pearls</b> (63 %) from the first graft were 10 - 11 mm in size while the majority of second graft <b>pearls</b> (51 %) were 11 - 12 mm in size, and the differences in <b>pearl</b> size between first and second graft were significant (p = 0. 04). Second graft <b>pearls</b> had poorer lustre than first graft <b>pearls</b> with a higher proportion of dull <b>pearls,</b> a lower proportion of medium lustre <b>pearls</b> and no <b>pearls</b> with high lustre. Despite this, the number of <b>pearls</b> in different lustre categories after the first and second graft did not differ significantly (p = 0. 07). For overall grading, most first graft <b>pearls</b> (83 %) were assessed as ‘C’ grade with 17 % categorised as ‘D’ grade. Similarly, most second graft <b>pearls</b> (78 %) were assessed as ‘C’ grade and 20 % as ‘D’ grade; however, 2 % of <b>pearls</b> were assessed as ‘B’ grade which were not present in first graft <b>pearls.</b> Nonetheless, the number of <b>pearls</b> belonging to different grades was not significant (p = 0. 08). Our data show {{for the first time that}} that production of circled <b>pearls</b> after second graft is not obligatory for P. margaritifera that produced circled <b>pearls</b> after first graft. They further show that marketable <b>pearls</b> can be produced from oysters that are normally discarded after the first <b>pearl</b> harvest and this has potential to generate increased revenue...|$|R
