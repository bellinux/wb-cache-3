Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business-cycle recession or economic organization {{of a country that}} discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency (also called Pareto efficiency) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers <b>prefer</b> <b>over</b> other points.|$|E

50|$|Automatic release: The most {{advanced}} release, where the rider maintains a soft, elastic, steady rein {{contact with a}} straight line from elbow to bit as the horse jumps. This release results in a great deal of control and communication between horse and rider, allowing the rider to signal to the horse what to do on landing. It allows the rider to better turn while in the air, to correct horses that jump crookedly, and to provide the support that some horses <b>prefer</b> <b>over</b> fences. It is also good on horses that need lots of control after landing. However, the automatic release requires perfect balance from the rider to be executed correctly. An unsteady rider will catch the horse in the mouth, and an incorrect automatic release will spoil a horse's jump and confidence. However, if a rider is able to perform it correctly, it is often best to use this release whenever possible. Very useful in show jumping and eventing, where control is very important.|$|E
5000|$|The 1996 Brownlow Medal was the 69th {{year the}} award was {{presented}} to the player adjudged the fairest and best player during the Australian Football League (AFL) home and away season. Michael Voss of the Brisbane Bears and James Hird of the Essendon Football Club both won the medal by polling twenty-one votes during the 1996 AFL season. Corey McKernan of the North Melbourne Football Club polled the same number of votes as Voss and Hird, but due to a tribunal suspension during the year, he was deemed ineligible to win the award. This caused some to call for the rules to be changed to allow suspended players to still be eligible. [...] The eligibility rules have remained the same since then, relying on the fairest section of fairest and best to continue to exclude suspended players from being able to win the award. McKernan went on {{to be a member of}} North Melbourne's 1996 AFL Grand Final winning team, something that both Voss and Hird said that they would <b>prefer</b> <b>over</b> winning the medal.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Min-max fair-share (mFS): The min-max-fair-share of {{an agent}} is the minimal utility {{that she can}} hope to get from an {{allocation}} if all the other agents have the same preferences as her, when she always receives the best share. It is also the minimal utility that an agent can get for sure in the allocation game “Someone cuts, I choose first”. An allocation is mFS-fair if all agents receive a bundle that they weakly <b>prefer</b> <b>over</b> their mFS. mFS-fairness {{can be described as}} the result of the following negotiation process. A certain allocation is suggested. Each agent can object to it by demanding that a different allocation be made by another agent, letting him choose first. Hence, an agent would object to an allocation only if in all partitions, there is a bundle that he strongly prefers over his current bundle. An allocation is mFS-fair iff no agent objects to it, i.e., for every agent there exists a partition in which all bundles are weakly worse than his current share.|$|E
