40|$|Objectives. Several {{species of}} rapidly growing {{mycobacteria}} (RGM) are now recognized as human pathogens. However, limited data on effective drug treatments against these organisms exists. Here, {{we describe the}} species distribution and drug susceptibility profiles of RGM clinical isolates collected from four southern Chinese provinces from January 2005 to December 2012. Methods. Clinical isolates (73) were subjected to in vitro testing with 31 antimicrobial agents using the cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth microdilution method. The isolates included 55 M. abscessus, 11 M. fortuitum, 3 M. chelonae, 2 M. neoaurum, and 2 M. septicum isolates. Results. M. abscessus (75. 34 %) and M. fortuitum (15. 07 %), the most common species, exhibited greater antibiotic resistance than the other three species. The isolates had low resistance to amikacin, linezolid, and tigecycline, and high resistance to first-line antituberculous agents, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, rifapentine, dapsone, thioacetazone, and <b>pasiniazid.</b> M. abscessus and M. fortuitum were highly resistant to ofloxacin and rifabutin, respectively. The isolates showed moderate resistance to the other antimicrobial agents. Conclusions. Our results suggest that tigecycline, linezolid, clofazimine, and cefmetazole are appropriate choices for M. abscessus infections. Capreomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tigecycline, clofazimine, and cefmetazole are potentially good choices for M. fortuitum infections. Our drug susceptibility data should be useful to clinicians...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Slowly growing {{mycobacteria}} (SGM) are prevalent {{worldwide and}} cause an extensive spectrum of diseases. Methods. In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibility of 33 reference strains of SGM to 19 antimicrobial agents {{was tested using}} a modified microdilution method. Results. Cefmetazole (32 / 33) and azithromycin (32 / 33) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity, and dapsone (9 / 33) exhibited the lowest activity against the tested strains. Cefoxitin (30 / 33), cefoperazone (28 / 33), and cefepime (28 / 33) were effective against {{a high proportion of}} strains, and macrolides were also highly effective as well as offering the benefit of convenient oral administration to patients. Linezolid (27 / 33), meropenem (26 / 33), sulfamethoxazole (26 / 33), and tigecycline (25 / 33) showed the highest activity; clofazimine (20 / 33) and doxycycline (18 / 33) showed intermediate activity; and rifapentine (13 / 33), rifabutin (13 / 33), and minocycline (11 / 33) showed low antimicrobial activity, closely followed by thioacetazone (10 / 33) and <b>pasiniazid</b> (10 / 33), against the tested organisms. According to their susceptibility profiles, the slowly growing species Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium simiae were the least susceptible to the tested drugs, whereas Mycobacterium intracellulare, Mycobacterium asiaticum, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium branderi, and Mycobacterium holsaticum were the most susceptible. Conclusions. In summary, cephalosporins and macrolides, particularly cefmetazole, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin, showed good antimicrobial activity against the reference strains of SGM...|$|E
