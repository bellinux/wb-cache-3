Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are {{among those who have}} had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Alvin Kass {{served as}} Rabbi from 1976-2014. Kass {{has also been}} a New York City Police Department {{chaplain}} for over 40 years, and had previously served as a United States Air Force chaplain for two years. At one point during his service as Police Department chaplain he and his family received months of 24-hour security after death threats, and at another he defused a hostage situation by providing the hostage taker with sandwiches from the Carnegie Deli. Kass, who teaches ethics at the <b>Police</b> <b>Academy,</b> was instrumental in getting Jewish police officers time off to observe the Sabbath. He also convinced the NYPD Shomrim Society (the fraternal organization of Jewish members of the New York City Police Department) to admit David Durk.

50|$|<b>Police</b> <b>academies</b> {{exist in}} every state and at the federal level. Each state has an agency which {{certifies}} <b>police</b> <b>academies</b> and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic standards for cadets to achieve before they can enter an academy and graduate. There may be additional or higher standards required for later certification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in <b>police</b> <b>academies,</b> many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend. Departments and/or state certifying agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings and qualify with a firearm and demonstrate driving skills, as conditions of employment/certification.|$|R

5|$|Fort Glanville Conservation Park {{is one of}} South Australia's most {{important}} heritage sites. It is the premier site in the state, and possibly Australia, for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications. The fort is listed on both the South Australian Heritage Register and the National Trust's classified list. It is considered significant, in national historical military terms, for its association with Jervois and Scratchley; both leading British defence experts who influenced Australian defence thinking in the late 19th century. The fort was very well constructed with high quality materials; facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation. The fort is largely intact and in original condition and is, along with Bluff Battery in Hobart, the best preserved Jervois-Scratchley designed fort in Australia. It is the only Australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament, and the only to have a regular living history program. Its companion Fort Largs does survive but in greatly modified condition, converted for use as the South Australia <b>Police</b> <b>academy.</b> The fort retains its original armament; armament that is both rare in Australia and worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Returning to education, Mao {{enrolled}} {{and dropped}} out of a <b>police</b> <b>academy,</b> a soap-production school, a law school and an economics school. His father only approved of the latter, but the lectures were in English, which Mao didn't understand, and so Mao abandoned it for the government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon {{dropped out of}} this too, finding it rooted in Confucianism. Undertaking his studies independently, he spent {{much time in the}} Changsha public library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Charles Darwin, J.S. Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Herbert Spencer. Viewing himself as an intellectual, years later he admitted that at this time he thought himself better than working people. Inspired by the work of Friedrich Paulsen, the liberal emphasis on individualism led Mao to believe that strong individuals were not bound by moral codes but should strive for the greater good; that the end justifies the means. Seeing no use in his son's intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance, forcing Mao to move into a hostel for the destitute.|$|E
