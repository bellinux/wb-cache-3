5|$|Controversy was ignited {{with the}} {{publication}} of Roland Huntford's book Scott and Amundsen (1979, re-published and televised in 1985 as The Last Place on Earth). Huntford was critical of Scott's supposedly authoritarian leadership style and of his <b>poor</b> <b>judgment</b> of men, and blamed him for a series of organisational failures that led to the death of everyone in the polar party. Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct rebuttal of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of Scott, and Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying that the dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp.|$|E

50|$|A tell in poker is {{a change}} in a player's {{behavior}} or demeanor that is claimed by some to give clues to that player's assessment of their hand. A player gains an advantage if they observe and understand the meaning of another player's tell, particularly if the tell is unconscious and reliable. Sometimes a player may fake a tell, hoping to induce their opponents to make <b>poor</b> <b>judgments</b> in response to the false tell. More often, people try to avoid giving out a tell, by maintaining a poker face regardless of how strong or weak their hand is.|$|R

25|$|Some of the {{criteria}} have obvious psychodynamic implications, such {{as a lack of}} remorse, <b>poor</b> <b>judgment,</b> failure to learn from experience, pathological egocentricity, lack of capacity for love, a general poverty in major affective reactions, and lack of insight into his own condition. Starting in 1972, newer editions of the book reflected a closer alliance with Kernberg's (1984) borderline level of personality organization, specifically defining the structural criteria of the psychopath's identity integration, defensive operations and reality testing.|$|E
25|$|Hypomania is the milder form of mania, {{defined as}} at least four days of the same {{criteria}} as mania, but does not cause {{a significant decrease in}} the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations, and does not require psychiatric hospitalization.

40|$|Auditors {{have to make}} {{materiality}} {{judgments on}} every audit. This is a difficult process, as both quantitative and qualitative factors have to be evaluated. Additionally, there is no formal guidance for how to implement the materiality concepts discussed in the auditing standards. Although they are sometimes difficult to make, good materiality judgments are crucial {{for the conduct of}} a successful audit as <b>poor</b> <b>judgments</b> can result in an audit that is ineffective and/or inefficient. This report explains the materiality concept and the relationship between materiality and audit risk, discusses factors affecting the materiality decision, and provides application examples of approaches of determining materiality at overall and account level...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{mobility}} requires appropriate decision-making. Seniors {{with reduced}} executive functioning— such as senior fallers—may {{be prone to}} <b>poor</b> mobility <b>judgments,</b> especially under dual-task conditions. We classified participants as “At-Risk ” and “Not-At-Risk ” for falls using a validated physiological falls-risk assessment. Dual-task performance was assessed in a virtual reality environment where participants crossed a simulated street by walking on a manual treadmill while listening to music or conversing on a phone. Those “At-Risk ” experienced more collisions with oncoming cars and had longer crossing times in the Phone condition compared to controls. We conclude that <b>poor</b> mobility <b>judgments</b> during a dual-task leads to unsafe mobility for those at-risk for falls...|$|R

25|$|In the election, Taylor won 47.3% of {{the popular}} vote and a {{majority}} of the electoral vote, giving the Whigs control of the presidency.

Despite the increasingly polarizing slavery debate, Taylor and Cass both won a mix of northern and southern states. However, much of Van Buren's support came from northern Democrats. Polk was very disappointed by the outcome as he had a low opinion of Taylor, seeing the general as someone with <b>poor</b> <b>judgment</b> and few opinions. Polk left office on March 4, 1849, and departed Washington on March 6.|$|E

All aboard both aircraft, {{as well as two}} children at the school, were killed. The helicopter had been dispatched to investigate a problem with the landing gear of Heinz's plane. While moving in for a closer look, the helicopter collided with the plane, causing both aircraft to lose control and crash. The subsequent NTSB investigation attributed the cause of the crash to <b>poor</b> <b>judgment</b> by the pilots of the two aircraft involved.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} {{improved}} learning when participants actively intervene rather than passively observe the stimuli in a judgment task. In two experiments the authors investigate if this improvement generalizes to multiple cue judgment tasks where judgments may be formed from abstract knowledge of cue-criterion relations or exemplar memory. More specific hypotheses were that intervention in learning should improve performance over observation, and that improvement should {{be associated with}} a relative shift from exemplar memory to cue abstraction. In contrast to previous studies, in a multiple-cue judgment task with binary cues and continuous criterion, there was poorer learning with intervention than observation, and participants actively experimenting more produced <b>poorer</b> <b>judgments.</b> The results suggest that intervention may distract from efficient exemplar encoding and improvement may be limited to tasks efficiently addressed by cue-abstraction...|$|R

25|$|The {{second day}} saw India make a heavy string of {{mistakes}} which cost them dearly. Coming in at 329/4, with Ganguly and Laxman both looking good for better scores, India began the day's play {{with much more}} confidence than their opponents. India did begin brightly, after Ganguly unfurled some glorious strokes against Nathan Bracken and Lee. However, in the 95th over bowled by Lee, which lasted 8 balls, courtesy of three no-balls from the bowler, Ganguly's weakness against fast-bowlers resurfaced as he popped a short-of-length ball to gully after knocking Lee for two fours, becoming the fifth wicket to fall, for 350. Thereafter, India completely lost their way. <b>Poor</b> <b>judgment</b> from the lower-order batsmen and Laxman's dismissal for 19 contributed to India's spectacular demise, as the last 6 wickets fell for 16 runs.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, a Land Commission was {{appointed}} {{to deal with the}} settlement of Africans on the land. The Commission recommended that two large territories be set aside for native occupation, the Shangani and Gwaai Reserves in Matabeleland, of about 2,486,000 acres. Before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans had held nearly 100,000,000 acres in what became Southern Rhodesia. The Land Commission's plan showed such <b>poor</b> <b>judgment,</b> and the bases of allocation were so ill-considered, that the attempt to confine the native population within these two areas was never really practicable. Failure to make suitable provision for African lands may {{have been one of the}} prime causes of the Matabele and Mashona rebellions of 1896. Following these rebellions, BSAC was required to assign sufficient land to Southern Rhodesian Africans for their agricultural and pastoral requirements, including access to sufficient water. Native Reserves were set up under this directive, which by 1902 had an estimated indigenous population of 530,000. Although later modifications were made, the basic pattern of land allocation persisted until independence. The European district officers who responsible for defining the reserves were advised to allow between 9 and 15 acres of arable land for each family, and adequate pasture, but they had little geographic knowledge of the country and no maps. In 1910, a Native Affairs Committee of Enquiry was set up, which made very few changes. The Committee's land apportionment was 19 million acres for Europeans and 21.4 million acres for Native Reserves with an African population of about 700,000. A further 51.6 million acres was unassigned, but available for future alienation to Europeans.|$|E

40|$|Regulation {{is often}} {{employed}} {{to encourage the}} provision of readily interpretable, explicit information to betting markets {{in an effort to}} promote their efficiency. This approach is supported by a considerable volume of laboratory-based research which suggests that individuals make <b>poor</b> <b>judgments</b> in the face of implicit, dynamic information. This article investigates to what extent horserace bettors, who have strong incentives to make good probability judgments, require the regulator’s protection from such hostile information environments. In particular, we examine the accuracy of the subjective probabilities of bettors concerning 16, 344 horses in 1671 races. We find that bettors are skilled in adopting effective heuristics to simplify their dynamic information environment and, {{even in the face of}} restricted information, develop well-calibrated judgments using outcome feedback. A number of factors that help bettors to achieve good calibration are identified and the implications for market regulation are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{failure of}} the escape plans was due {{to a series of}} misadventures, delays, misinterpretations, and <b>poor</b> <b>judgments.</b> Much was due to the King's indecision; he {{repeatedly}} postponed the schedule, allowing small problems to become big ones. Furthermore, he misjudged popular support for the traditional monarchy. He thought that only radicals in Paris were promoting a revolution that the people as a whole rejected. He believed, mistakenly, that he was beloved by the rural peasants and the common people.The king's flight was traumatic for France, inciting a wave of emotions that ranged from anxiety to violence and panic. Everyone was aware that foreign intervention was imminent. The realization that the king had effectually repudiated the revolutionary reforms made up to that point came as a shock to people who, until then, had seen him as a fundamentally well-meaning monarch who governed as a manifestation of God's will. Republicanism, from being merely a subject of coffeehouse debate, suddenly became the dominant ideal of revolutionary leaders.|$|R

[...] Its findings with regards to Cornwall were similar: his receipt of $14,500 and his expectation of $10,500 more constituted [...] "suspicious circumstances", but these [...] "point to no definite conclusion; and he has denied that he received any other benefit, or was interested in any other way in the enterprise, and it must be held that the evidence does not establish the contrary." ...|$|E

[...] Regarding Logan, they stated that [...] "she wouldn't have been raped, if not for Logan's buying the GHB." [...] On Dick, they wrote that [...] "Dick didn't intend to drug Veronica, but he did intend to drug someone."

500|$|In one noted {{example of}} an author being too eager to assign a new name, in 1902 George Francis Atkinson {{described}} a specimen he found in Texas, otherwise similar to Simblum but with a loose net drooping from the head; he initiated the new genus Dictybole to include his [...] "new" [...] species D.texense. The species was, according to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, merely a decomposing or insect-damaged specimen of L.periphragmoides that had been preserved in alcohol. Lloyd criticized Atkinson's <b>poor</b> <b>judgment</b> in his self-published journal Mycological Notes, and later, humiliated him under the pen name N.J.McGinty. William H. Long later (1907) transferred Atkinson's taxon to the genus Simblum, claiming that the yellow arms and longer spores were sufficiently distinct to consider it distinct from L.periphragmoides (then known as Simblum sphaerocephalum); however, according to Dring, D.texense should also be considered a synonym of L.periphragmoides. Despite Dring's renaming, and the subsequent acceptance of his subsuming of the genus Simblum into Lysurus, the species is still occasionally referred to Simblum sphaerocephalum.|$|E

50|$|At the {{microscopic}} level, {{the failure of}} the escape plans was due to a series of misadventures, delays, misinterpretations, and <b>poor</b> <b>judgments.</b> In a wider perspective, the failure was attributable to the king's indecision—he repeatedly postponed the schedule, allowing for smaller problems to become severe. Furthermore, he totally misunderstood the political situation. He thought {{only a small number of}} radicals in Paris were promoting a revolution that the people as a whole rejected. He thought, mistakenly, that he was beloved by the peasants and the common folk. The king's flight in the short term was traumatic for France, inciting a wave of emotions that ranged from anxiety to violence to panic. Everyone realized that war was imminent. The deeper realization, that the king had in fact repudiated the Revolution, was an even greater shock for people who until then had seen him as a good king who governed as a manifestation of God's will. They felt betrayed, and as a result, Republicanism now burst out of the coffee houses and became a dominating philosophy of the rapidly radicalized French Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{examples}} of suggestible behavior {{in everyday life}} include [...] "contagious yawning" [...] (multiple people begin to yawn after observing a person yawning) and the medical student syndrome (a person begins to experience symptoms of an illness after reading or hearing about it). Placebo response is also thought {{to be based on}} individual differences in suggestibility, at least in part. Suggestible persons may be more responsive to various forms of alternative health practices that seem to rely upon patient belief in the intervention more than on any known mechanism. Studies of effects of health interventions can be enhanced by controlling for individual differences in suggestibility. A search of the Mental Measurements Yearbook shows no extant psychological test for this personality characteristic. The Gudjonsson suggestibility scale is questionable for this kind of purpose due to its narrow focus. However, see the Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale (MISS) for a recently developed self-report scale. In addition to health-related implications, persons who are highly suggestible may be prone to making <b>poor</b> <b>judgments</b> because they did not process suggestions critically and falling prey to emotion-based advertising.|$|R
500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, <b>poor</b> <b>judgment,</b> and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all."

500|$|Before resigning, Rutherford's {{government}} had called a Royal Commission into the Alberta and Great Waterways affair, and this commission had not {{reported by the}} time that Sifton took office. [...] Between that and the proroguing of the legislature, the new Premier enjoyed a calm that lasted until November 10, when the legislature reconvened. [...] Conservative leader Edward Michener attacked the government's speech from the throne for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office. [...] In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach in his own party on the railway question. [...] Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of [...] "pioneer" [...] railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's emptier areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres. [...] Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A be built. [...] Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a [...] "responsible company". [...] These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for <b>poor</b> <b>judgment</b> even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.|$|E
