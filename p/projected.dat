40|$|Businesses and organisations are {{undertaking}} innovative <b>projects</b> to gain {{competitive advantage}} in the market. Research into innovative <b>project</b> management has been biased towards how innovative <b>projects</b> are managed {{to the detriment of}} the formulation of success criteria for innovative <b>projects.</b> There is a need to evaluate how innovative <b>projects</b> are managed. <b>Project</b> managers for innovative <b>projects</b> find it difficult to do so because success criteria for innovative <b>projects</b> have not been formulated. This paper is a theoretical study on managing different types of <b>projects</b> as different types of <b>projects</b> are managed in different ways. The paper also explores the characteristics of conventional <b>projects</b> as opposed to inno-vative <b>projects</b> and R&D <b>projects.</b> In addition, it critically analyses the differences between <b>project</b> man-agement in conventional <b>projects</b> and <b>project</b> management in innovative <b>projects.</b> By comparing the char-acteristics of conventional <b>projects</b> to those of innovative <b>projects</b> and R&D <b>projects,</b> and the way these different types of <b>projects</b> are managed, the paper attempts to formulate success criteria for innovative <b>projects</b> that can be used by <b>project</b> managers to determine the success or failure of innovative <b>projects...</b>|$|R
30|$|Whether a <b>project</b> is {{successful}} or not {{depends on the}} opinion of the responsible managers. Some of them may focus more on whether the <b>project</b> is on time or before. Some others may pay more attentions to the <b>project</b> budget. For some <b>projects,</b> e.g., China’s manned space program, the highest priority is technical performance. Generally, the success of a <b>project</b> is measured by three dimensions, i.e., time, cost, and performance (quality or agreed-upon specifications). For many <b>projects,</b> since <b>project</b> managers only need to meet some quality standards, the dimension of quality is not so important for <b>project</b> success. In this case, <b>project</b> managers are required to make trade-off between <b>project</b> cost and <b>project</b> completion time with the <b>project</b> progress. Furthermore, <b>project</b> cost and <b>project</b> completion time are always in some relation. Sometimes, <b>project</b> managers may make decisions to finish <b>projects</b> sooner with <b>project</b> cost augment by accelerating <b>project</b> schedule, which is also named as <b>project</b> crashing in <b>project</b> management. In other cases, motivated by reducing <b>project</b> costs, managers may be conscripted to sacrifice with prolonging <b>project</b> completion times. To sum up, it is natural for <b>project</b> managers to find some schedules to complete <b>projects</b> with the balance of <b>project</b> costs and <b>project</b> completion times.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Many product {{innovation}} <b>projects</b> do not adequately develop an effective <b>project</b> strategy. This leads to poor choices of <b>project</b> approaches often resulting in poor <b>project</b> outcomes. Unfortunately, business and strategic level thinking is rarely examined {{in detail in}} the <b>project</b> management literature. This paper contributes {{to the advancement of}} business and strategic thinking in {{product innovation}} <b>project</b> management by developing a conceptual model of (i) how <b>project</b> innovation type, <b>project</b> uncertainty and firm-project compatibility influence the required <b>project</b> capabilities, and (ii) how <b>project</b> strategy aligns <b>project</b> capabilities with these <b>project</b> contingencies to drive <b>project</b> success. It is argued that such a theoretically well founded and practical strategic <b>project</b> management approach will guide practitioners in making appropriate <b>project</b> strategy choices.

5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is <b>projected</b> to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is <b>projected</b> to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a <b>projected</b> net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in <b>projected</b> costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the <b>projected</b> $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs <b>projected</b> by 2020.

40|$|Efficient <b>project</b> {{execution}} {{is a key}} business {{objective in}} many domains and particularly so for capital <b>projects</b> in the process industries, but existing <b>project</b> management research gives little direction about how <b>project</b> team factors influence three important capital <b>project</b> outcomes: cost, schedule, and operability. After an extensive cross-disciplinary review of the general team and <b>project</b> management literatures, we constructed and tested a theoretically based, five-dimensional model of organizational context, <b>project</b> team design, <b>project</b> team leadership, <b>project</b> team processes, and <b>project</b> outcome factors. We examined the model {{by means of an}} empirical study of 56 newly completed capital <b>projects</b> executed by 15 Fortune 500 companies in the process industries. The results indicate the value of disaggregating <b>project</b> outcomes for research purposes. Different bundles of <b>project</b> team factors were found to drive <b>project</b> cost, schedule, and operability. <b>Project</b> team efficacy, cross-functional <b>project</b> teams, autonomous <b>project</b> team structure, and virtual office usage were the strongest predictors of <b>project</b> cost effectiveness. Continuity of <b>project</b> leadership, cross-functional <b>project</b> teams, and <b>project</b> manager incentives were the strongest predictors of <b>project</b> construction schedule. In contrast, clear <b>project</b> goals and an office design to facilitate effective communication were the main predictors of plant operability. Implications of these findings for researchers and <b>project</b> practitioners are discussed. One major practical implication of our findings is that <b>project</b> managers need to clearly focus and prioritize their goals for each <b>project</b> so they can adopt the appropriate bundles of <b>project</b> team practices that will facilitate their goal achievement.
