40|$|Background: Within-field {{multiple}} crop species intercropping is {{well documented}} and used for disease control, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. As roots are the primary organ for perceiving signals in the soil from neighboring plants, root behavior may {{play an important role}} in soil-borne disease control. Principal Findings: In two years of field experiments, maize/soybean intercropping suppressed the occurrence of soybean red crown rot, a severe soil-borne disease caused by Cylindrocladium parasiticum (C. parasiticum). The suppressive effects decreased with increasing distance between intercropped plants under both low P and high P supply, suggesting that root interactions play a significant role independent of nutrient status. Further detailed quantitative studies revealed that the diversity and intensity of root interactions altered the expression of important soybean PR genes, as well as, the activity of corresponding enzymes in both P treatments. Furthermore, 5 phenolic acids were detected in root exudates of maize/ soybean intercropped plants. Among these <b>phenolic</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> was released in significantly greater concentrations when intercropped maize with soybean compared to either crop grown in monoculture, and this spike in <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> was found dramatically constrain C. parasiticum growth in vitro.

40|$|Tree saplings in {{temperate}} forests world-wide experience intense browsing from deer and other mammalian herbivores. However, {{when compared to}} insect herbivory, our knowledge about the cues that trigger mammalian-induced defence responses in trees is limited. 2. We studied responses of field-grown saplings of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) to simulated browsing by (i) clipping apical buds or leaves and (ii) additionally applying roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) saliva to the cut surface. We analysed induced changes in phytohormones and phenolics in the saplings’ remaining buds or leaves, respectively. 3. In both species, jasmonates were activated after clipping of buds and leaves. Importantly, additional saliva application activated salicylic acid in beech leaves and led to increases in cytokinins in beech buds. Saliva application also led to an increased biosynthesis of several hydrolysable tannins (mainly ellagitannins) and flavonols in maple leaves. Condensed tannins, the most abundant phenolics in beech buds and leaves, did not change after either clipping or saliva application. However, clipping with additional saliva application decreased levels of <b>phenolic</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives) in beech buds. 4. We conclude that the two tree species perceive and respond to unknown elicitors in the deer saliva, resulting in changes in phytohormone levels and defence-associated secondary metabolites. 5.

In a previous study (Sun et al., 1998), several parameters that can affect the accuracy of the determination of condensed tannins have been examined by this method, and among them the influence of phenolic compounds other than tannins, in particular non-flavonoids such as <b>phenolic</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid,</b> p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid), but also flavonols (quercetin dihydrate, kaempferol, myricetin, rutin) and the anthocyanin malvidin- 3 -glucoside; that may interfere the reaction of proanthocyanidins with vanillin assay. According to this analytical procedure proposed by Sun et al.

In details, the phenolic compounds that have been studied were flavonols and flavones, stilbenes, various volatile phenols, and other phenols from wood such as ellagitannins, coumarins, aldehydes and still other compounds such as tyrosol and 2 -phenylethanol. The chemical compounds examined at different concentrations did not produce any reaction with the vanillin.

Under the experimental conditions used, a linear relationship was calculated between the CZE migration times and the molecular weight of polyphenols' expression of the increasing amount of their hydroxyl groups and polarity. Regression equations revealed a linear relationship (correlation coefficients > 0. 97) between the peak area of each polyphenol species and their concentration, from 6 to 120 ng. The levels of analytes in three different propolis extracts, ethanolic, aqueous-ethanolic and aqueous-glycolic, used to prepare various commercial medicinal products, were determined.

Highest esterification yield of ethyl cinnamate is obtained when initial molar ratio of substrates 1 : 3 (<b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> is limiting substrate) is used. Esterification of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> appeared to result in increasing radical-scavenging ability. The effect of esterification of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> was also confirmed by electrochemical method using ethyl cinnamate which appeared to enhance the antioxidant activity. These findings should stimulate the application of such lipase-catalyzed reactions for the preparation of food acceptable esters of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> as potential lipophilic antioxidants...|$|R

40|$|A mutant {{derivative}} {{of a novel}} pseudomonad isolated from the soil accumulated acetophenone when supplied with <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid.</b> The microorganism {{has been identified as}} an unclassified Pseudomonas sp., similar to Pseudomonas acidovorans. Mass spectrum analysis of the product acetophenone derived from catabolism of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> in the presence of 18 O 2 or H 218 O supported the conclusion that <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> degradation is initiated by addition of water to the double bond of the side chain, followed by dehydrogenation to generate 3 -keto- 3 -phenylpropionic acid. The intermediate 3 -keto- 3 -phenylpropionic acid is accumulated in cultures of the mutant during active <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> catabolism. However, this intermediate is unstable so a portion of it spontaneously decarboxylates to form acetophenone. Neither 3 -keto- 3 -phenylpropionic acid nor acetophenone is a precedented intermediate in <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> degradation. Isolation of the novel strain and mutant provide the rudiments for a process to produce natural acetophenone by biotransformation of natural <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R

Infra red spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} studies showed that the isolated compound was chemically 3, 4 dihydroxy <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid.</b> In vitro antibacterial activity of 3, 4 dihydroxy <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> was studied against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria using disc diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3, 4 dihydroxy <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> was also recorded against those bacteria by serial dilution technique. Kanamycin was used as positive control. Results showed that 3, 4 dihydroxy <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> had antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial natural {{preparations}} involving cinnamon, storax and propolis {{have been}} long used topically for treating infections. <b>Cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> and related molecules are {{partly responsible for}} the therapeutic effects observed in these preparations. Most of the <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids,</b> their esters, amides, aldehydes and alcohols, show significant growth inhibition against one or several bacterial and fungal species. Of particular interest is the potent antitubercular activity observed for some of these cinnamic derivatives, which may be amenable as future drugs for treating tuberculosis. This review intends to summarize the literature data on the antimicrobial activity of the natural <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> and related derivatives. In addition, selected hybrids between <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> and biologically active scaffolds with antimicrobial activity were also included. A comprehensive literature search was performed collating the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> or derivative against the reported microorganisms. The MIC data allows the relative comparison between series of molecules and the derivation of structure-activity relationships...|$|R
40|$|Feeding of 4 -methoxycinnamic acid, 3, 4 -dimethoxycinnamic {{acid and}} 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxycinnamic acid to cell {{suspension}} cultures of Vanilla planifolia {{resulted in the}} formation of 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, and syringic acid, respectively. The homologous 4 -methoxybenzoic acids were demethylated to the same products. It is concluded that the side chain degrading enzyme system accepts the 4 -methoxylated substrates while the demethylation occurs at the benzoic acid level. The demethylating enzyme is specific for the 4 -position. Feeding of [O- 14 C-methyl]- 3, 4 -dimethoxycinnamic acid revealed that {{the first step in the}} conversion is the glycosylation of the <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> to its glucose ester. A partial purification of a UDP-glucose: trans-cinnamic acid glucosyltransferase is reported. 4 -Methoxy substituted <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> are better substrates for this enzyme than 4 -hydroxy substituted <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid.</b> It is suggested that 4 -methoxy substituted <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> are intermediates in the biosynthetic conversion of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> to benzoic acids in cells of V. planifolia...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{metabolic disorder}} of carbohydrate metabolism. Treatment of type II diabetes is usually done by prescribing {{diet and exercise}} for the patient however {{it can also be}} treated with antidiabetic drugs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate some <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> derivative compounds which are either isolated from natural materials or the results of the chemical synthesis. In addition, their biological activities as an agent of α-glucosidase inhibitors have also been evaluated. Chemically, <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> has three main functional groups:  first is the substitution on the phenyl group, second is the additive reaction into the α-β unsaturated, and third is the chemical reaction with carboxylic acid functional groups. Chemical aspects of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> derivative compounds have received much attention in the research and development of drugs, especially modifications within three functional groups are very influential. In the last 10 years, a lot of research and development of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives as inhibitors of the α-glucosidase enzyme has been done. One example of the research done in this field is the modification of para position in the structure of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> and addition of alkyl groups in the carboxylic group which would increase the activity of the α-glucosidase enzyme therefore the level of inhibition is 100 times higher than that of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> compound itself. The novelty of this review article is to focus on the antidiabetic activity of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives...|$|R
