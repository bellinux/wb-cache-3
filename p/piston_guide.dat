40|$|Accumulator Volume Sensing Team has {{developed}} two sensor designs aimed at detecting {{the position of}} the piston within a 4024 accumulator. The two designs include the use of a Renishaw LMA 10 magnetic encoder and a SpectraSymbol HotPot linear potentiometer. The magnetic encoder solution drastically increases the accuracy of sensing the piston position compared to the current solutions of both a string-pot and linear variable differential transformer while costing slightly less. The linear potentiometer seeks to provide a solution that drastically decreases the cost compared to the present sensing methods. Both designs call for a modification to one half of the <b>piston</b> <b>guide</b> part on the 4024 piston accumulator. The purpose of this report is to outline the design process we went through in selecting our two final solutions, as well as explain how we propose the sensors be implemented in an accumulator. Also included is the testing process and resulting accuracy uncertainty. This project covers both the mechanical design of the sensor mounting, as well as the electrical signal processing or adjustment...|$|E
40|$|Condition Monitoring is an {{area that}} has seen {{substantial}} growth in the last few decades. The purpose for implementing condition monitoring in industry is to increase productivity, decrease maintenance costs and increase safety. Therefore, condition monitoring can be used not only for planning maintenance but also for allowing the selection of the most efficient equipment to minimize operating costs. Hydraulic systems are widely used in industry, aerospace and agriculture and are becoming more complex in construction and in function. Reliability of the systems must be supported by an efficient maintenance scheme. Due to component wear or failure, some system parameters may change causing abnormal behaviour in each component or in the overall circuit. Research in this area has been substantial, and includes specialized studies on artificial fault simulation at the University of Saskatchewan. In this research, an axial pump was the focus of the study. In an axial piston pump, wear between the various faces of components can occur {{in many parts of the}} unit. As a consequence, leakage can occur in locations such as between the valve plate and barrel, the drive shaft and oil wiper, the control piston and <b>piston</b> <b>guide,</b> and the swash plate and slippers. In this study, wear (and hence leakage) between the pistons and cylinder bores in the barrel was of interest. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, as well as at other research institutions, have been involved in studies to detect wear in pumps using a variety of condition monitoring algorithms. However, to verify the reliability and indeed, limitations of some of the approaches, it is necessary to test the algorithms on systems with “real” leakage. To introduce actual wear in the piston of pumps can be very difficult and very expensive. Hence, introducing piston wear in an “artificial” manner would be of great benefit in the evaluation of various condition monitoring techniques. Since leakage is a direct consequence of piston wear, it is logical to conclude that varying the leakage in some prescribed manner can be used to artificially simulate wear. A prime concern, therefore, is to be able to precisely understand the dynamic relationships between the wear and leakage and the effect it has on the output flow or pressure waveform from the pump. Introducing an artificial leakage to simulate the wear of pistons is a complex task. The creation of an artificial leakage path was not simply a process of providing a resistive short to the tank at the outlet of the pump port as was done in other studies. The objective was to create a leakage environment that would simulate leakage from a single piston (or combination of several pistons thereof). The complexity of the flow and pressure ripple waveforms (which various condition monitoring algorithms did require) was such that a more comprehensive leakage behaviour had to be modeled and experimentally created. A pressure control servo valve with a very high frequency response was employed to divert the flow from the pump outlet with a prescribed waveform directly to the tank to simulate the piston leakage from the high pressure discharge chamber to the pump case drain chamber as the simulated worn piston made contact with the high pressure chamber. The control algorithm could mimic the action of a single worn piston at various degrees of wear. The experimental results indicated that the experimental system could successfully introduce artificial leakage into the pump which was quite consistent with a unit with a “real” worn piston. Comparisons of the pressure ripples from an actual faulty pump (worn piston) and the “artificial” faulty pump (artificial leakage) are presented...|$|E

30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of {{the upper and lower}} oil pads, which result from changes in the gap between the piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the <b>piston</b> rod, <b>guide</b> sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the <b>piston</b> rod and <b>guide</b> sleeve, and <b>piston</b> and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} article {{includes the}} analysis of mechanical and thermal load criteria of combustion engine. Those criteria have been divided into tribological, technical in detail and technical in general. The above criteria have been related to piston-con-rod system, in which, two tribological centres were specified. One centre included, piston-piston rings and cylinder, in which, piston rings serve as labyrinth seal and the cylinder constitutes <b>piston</b> <b>guides.</b> Crank bearings and main bearings of engine crankshaft constitute the second centre. From the point of tribological view, piston-piston rings and cylinder constitute slide and thrust bearing lubricated hydrodynamically, while crankshaft bearings a-c-t as slide and journal bearings also lubricated hydrodynamically. In the description of thermal load of the above-mentioned tribological centres, special {{attention was paid to}} criteria that ensure their motion reliability and durability of engine operation. Whereas in the description of mechanical load of elements constituting investigated centres, some criteria were determined resulting from their functionality and fatigue strength of the material they were made of. Criteria of thermal loads were based on mean density flux of heat conducted through the walls of engine elements, paying attention to their low precision of evaluation. It has been emphasized that synthetic criteria indicators are the most precise. They are determined on the basis of engine load measurements during its operation. Those criteria allow us to describe the operating process of con-rod-piston diesel engines {{and at the same time}} it is possible to expose their technical condition which is of essential practical meaning.

The program also allows for the conduct of parameter studies in selecting optimum crank-and-connecting-rod linkage dimensions and speeds.

30|$|From Figure  13, one can {{see that}} under the same {{conditions}} as those described above, the conventional hydrostatic symmetrical support structure must provide a much greater force when the horizontal articulated servo cylinder is reciprocating. A maximum of 250 % of a given load force is required in response, which is not achievable for this structure. Furthermore, over the entire movement, the direct force fluctuation in the <b>piston</b> rod and <b>guide</b> sleeve is very large, reaching a maximum value of 232 N, which {{is much higher than}} the maximum value for the asymmetric hydrostatic support structure design proposed in this paper. From Figure  11, {{one can see}} that the response to the maximum eccentric load of 2000 N for the proposed system is less than 10 % of that value. The asymmetric static-pressure support structure proposed in this paper can effectively overcome the issues of wear, leakage, and insufficient output force caused by the weight and external load characteristics of a heavy-duty servo cylinder with a horizontal hinged installation. From Figure  12, one can see that the direct maximum force between the <b>piston</b> rod and <b>guide</b> sleeve is 50 pN for the proposed structure. Furthermore, by comparing Figures  11 and 13, one can clearly see that the proposed hydrostatic asymmetric support structure is feasible and provides excellent performance.|$|R
30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} servo cylinder with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the servo cylinder. Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the support oil cushion of the variable hydraulic pressure support structure, oil cushion of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the servo cylinder <b>piston</b> rod, <b>guide</b> sleeve, and <b>piston,</b> as well as the cylinder oil film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented. A hydraulic dynamic shear scissor is used as a research target to derive a structural dynamic model. Comparative simulations are performed using Matlab Simulink. Additionally, flow field analysis of the novel structure is performed, which verifies the rationality and feasibility of the proposed structure and system.|$|R
30|$|The servo {{cylinder}} {{is the executive}} component of a hydraulic servo system. Its performance directly affects overall system control accuracy under both dynamic and static conditions [1 – 3]. When an overloaded horizontal {{servo cylinder}} articulates an output curve force, a partial load {{is placed on the}} piston rod based on the installation and load characteristics [1, 4, 5], creating friction between the <b>piston</b> rod and <b>guide</b> sleeve, which can lead to leakage and scuffing of the cylinder bore. Additionally, this friction negatively affects the output characteristics and reliability of a servo cylinder, significantly reducing its lifespan [6 – 8].

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the Advanced Diesel Engine Component Development (ADECD) Program {{to develop and}} demonstrate critical technology needed to advance the heavy-duty low heat rejection engine concept. Major development activities reported are the design, analysis, and fabrication of monolithic ceramic components; vapor phase and solid film lubrication; electrohydraulic valve actuation; and high pressure common rail injection. An advanced single cylinder test bed was fabricated as a laboratory tool in studying these advanced technologies. This test bed simulates the reciprocator for a system having no cooling system, turbo compounding, Rankine bottoming cycle, common rail injection, and variable valve actuation to achieve fuel consumption of 160 g/kW-hr (. 26 lb/hp-hr). The advanced concepts were successfully integrated into the test engine. All ceramic components met their functional and reliability requirements. The firedeck, cast-in-place ports, valves, valve <b>guides,</b> <b>piston</b> cap, and piston ring were made from silicon nitride. Breakthroughs required to implement a 'ceramic' engine included the fabrication of air-gap cylinder heads, elimination of compression gaskets, machining of ceramic valve seats within the ceramic firedeck, fabrication of cast-in-place ceramic port liners, implementation of vapor phase lubrication, and elimination of the engine coolant system. Silicon nitride valves were successfully developed to meet several production abuse test requirements and incorporated into the test bed with a ceramic valve guide and solid film lubrication. The ADECD cylinder head features ceramic port shields to increase insulation and exhaust energy recovery. The combustion chamber includes a ceramic firedeck and piston cap.

40|$|WhisperGenTM {{heater head}} {{components}} are currently machined from the {{austenitic stainless steel}} Sandvik 253 MA. The inner surface of the heater heads is subjected to the working gas of the engine, which is a high-pressure, high-temperature nitrogen-based environment with carbonaceous impurities. As {{a result of this}} exposure, a scale forms during operation and eventually spalls. This spalled scale causes abrasive damage to <b>piston</b> seals and <b>guides,</b> which leads to pressure loss and eventual failure of the engine. The aim of the present work was to compare the performance of the austenitic alloy 253 MA with two alternative alloys, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310, thereby enabling a material recommendation. A literature review provided information about many general aspects of high temperature corrosion in similar alloys. However, little was found about the application of these alloys in environments similar to those experienced by a WhisperGenTM heater head. Therefore, laboratory experiments were conducted to indicate the relative performance characteristics of the three potential alloys (253 MA, Incoloy 800 H and AISI 310). To overcome the difficulties with testing at high temperatures and pressures, Thermo-Calc™ was used to calculate gas mixtures at 1 bar that approximated the chemical potentials of carbon and nitrogen in the working gas at 24 bar. Comparisons of the different materials were made via weight loss/gain measurements and metallographic analysis, which included optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray mapping and electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). The laboratory test sample results were also compared with results from heater heads of the same materials that were run in an actual WhisperGenTM engine. The experimental results taken in total indicate that 253 MA is the least suitable alloy for the heater head application because it exhibited poor spalling performance, internal oxidation and formation of a large amount of Cr 23 C 6. AISI 310 was shown in all cases to develop the detrimental sigma phase, although this alloy was the least susceptible to internal oxidation. Incoloy 800 H was the most resistant alloy to all forms of degradation and is thus recommended for the heater head application...|$|R
