25|$|Clearly, SA has far {{reaching}} applications, as it {{is necessary}} for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. Thus, we are beginning to see SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted {{in a wide variety of}} environments.

25|$|By-products {{of thermal}} power <b>plant</b> <b>operation</b> must be {{considered}} in their design and operation. Waste heat energy, which remains due to the finite efficiency of the Carnot, Rankine, or Diesel power cycle, is released directly to the atmosphere or river/lake water, or indirectly to the atmosphere using a cooling tower with river or lake water used as a cooling medium. The flue gas from combustion of the fossil fuels is discharged to the air. This gas contains carbon dioxide and water vapor, as well as other substances such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), mercury, traces of other metals, and, for coal-fired plants, fly ash. Solid waste ash from coal-fired boilers must also be removed. Some coal ash can be recycled for building materials.|$|E

25|$|According to the United Nations (UNSCEAR), regular {{nuclear power}} <b>plant</b> <b>operation</b> {{including}} the nuclear fuel cycle causes radioisotope releases {{into the environment}} amounting to 0.0002 millisieverts (mSv) per year of public exposure as a global average. (Such is small compared to variation in natural background radiation, which averages 2.4mSv/a globally but frequently varies between 1mSv/a and 13mSv/a depending on a person's location as determined by UNSCEAR). As of a 2008 report, the remaining legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident (Chernobyl) is 0.002mSv/a in global average exposure (a figure which was 0.04mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern Hemisphere {{in the year of}} the accident in 1986, although far higher among the most affected local populations and recovery workers).|$|E

50|$|The flow of {{data for}} I/O control {{purposes}} {{is fundamental to}} the safe and efficient function of <b>plant</b> <b>operations.</b> A clear and concise understanding of the cause and effect of this data flow is a prerequisite to <b>plant</b> <b>operations,</b> business optimization and Health and Safety governance.

2500|$|Humidity as {{a result}} of <b>plant</b> <b>operation</b> may be an issue for nearby communities. A 400 meter {{diameter}} powerplant producing wind velocity of 22 meters per second, must add about 15 grams of water per kilogram of air processed. This is equal to 41 tons of water per second. In terms of humid air, this is 10 cubic kilometers of very humid air each hour. Thus, a community even 100 kilometers away may be unpleasantly affected.|$|E
2500|$|If {{standard}} {{ambient conditions}} are used for calculations during chemical <b>plant</b> <b>operation</b> when the actual weather is very cold or hot, then certain parts of a chemical plant might {{seem to have an}} exergy efficiency of greater than 100% and without taking into account the non-standard atmospheric temperature variation can give an impression of being a perpetual motion machine.

2500|$|The {{principal}} competing process uses membranes to desalt saline water, principally applying {{reverse osmosis}} (RO). The RO membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and applied [...] pressure (on the membrane feed side) to preferentially induce water permeation through the membrane while rejecting salts. Reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal desalination processes. Desalination processes {{are driven by}} either thermal (e.g., distillation) or electrical (e.g., RO) as the primary energy types. Energy cost in desalination processes varies considerably depending on water salinity, plant size and process type. At present the cost of seawater desalination, for example, is higher than traditional water sources, but {{it is expected that}} costs will continue to decrease with technology improvements that include, but are not limited to, reduction in plants footprint, improvements to <b>plant</b> <b>operation</b> and optimization, more effective feed pretreatment, and lower cost energy sources.|$|E
