5|$|In the meantime, Tahsi is {{approached}} by a thief (Danielle Burgio), who has fled to Guam with a stolen rare jade dragon and wants to pawn it, promising to return in 24 hours. Tahsi agrees, but does not promise not to sell it. Indeed, Jane Goody, who {{turns out to be}} a friend of his, visits his shop and buys the dragon, despite Tahsi's reluctance. She later has it appraised, learning it is worth many times more than she <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> heightening her hopes of paying the tuition for her sister's medical degree. Later, an enforcer (Arnold Chon) for the yakuza group Black Dragons, the original owners of the jade dragon, appears in Tahsi's shop with the thief in a headlock, demanding the figurine's return. Tahsi refuses to reveal Jane's identity and is killed along with the thief.|$|E
5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only pay for what they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in sterling, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E
25|$|The Bales {{family was}} {{struggling}} financially and had put its home {{up for sale}} {{three days before the}} shootings. The property was listed for $229,000, approximately $50,000 less than what they had <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in 2005, and less than what they owed the bank.|$|E

25|$|Framley Parsonage proved {{enormously}} popular, establishing Trollope's reputation {{with the}} novel-reading public and amply justifying {{the high price}} that Smith had <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The early connection to Cornhill also brought Trollope into the London circle of artists, writers, and intellectuals, not least among whom were Smith and Thackeray.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the likely {{difficulty}} was simple: the chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata, along with their kinsmen of Ngāti Toa, owned the land and had not been <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> But similar disputes had been previously settled through negotiation, and Te Rauparaha was willing to negotiate on the Wairau land.|$|E

25|$|One known prior {{award for}} acts of gallantry by other ranks was the {{unofficial}} Sir Harry Smith's Medal for Gallantry, instituted by Major General Sir Henry George Wakelyn Smith in 1851.

25|$|Jan Scruggs, a Vietnam {{veteran who}} became a {{counselor}} with the U.S. Department of Labor, thought {{of the idea of}} building a National Memorial for Vietnam Veterans after seeing a screening of the film in March 1979, and he established and operated the memorial fund which <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Director Cimino was invited to the memorial's opening.|$|E

25|$|In the letter, Gates {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} most computer hobbyists who were using his company's Altair BASIC software without having <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> He asserted that such widespread unauthorized copying in effect discourages developers from investing {{time and money}} in creating high-quality software. He cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them.|$|E
25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

25|$|Up to this point, Opera was trialware {{and had to}} be {{purchased}} after the trial period ended. Version 5.0 (released in 2000) saw the end of this requirement. Instead, Opera became ad-sponsored, displaying advertisements to users who had not <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Later versions of Opera gave the user the choice of seeing banner ads or targeted text advertisements from Google. With version 8.5 (released in 2005) the advertisements were removed entirely and primary financial support for the browser came through revenue from Google (which is by contract Opera's default search engine).|$|E
25|$|He also {{received}} funding for consultation research via New York legal firm Jacob & Medinger, which was acting {{on behalf of}} the tobacco industry. Asked what he felt about tobacco industry lawyers being involved in selecting scientists for research projects, he said that research should be judged on quality, not on who <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> adding that he had not personally profited from the funds. According to the UK newspaper The Independent, Eysenck received more than £800k in this way. Eysenck conducted many empirical investigations elucidating the role of personality in cigarette smoking and disease.|$|E
25|$|Robert King High {{was born}} in 1924 in Flat Creek, Tennessee, where {{his father was a}} {{carpenter}} and farmer.

He later worked as a soda jerk. He organized a band; the members played in their ROTC uniforms until they could afford to buy tuxedos.|$|E

25|$|After a {{collectable}} {{has been}} purchased, its retail price no longer applies and its value {{is linked to}} {{what is called the}} secondary market. There is no secondary market for an item unless someone is willing to buy it, and an object's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Depending on age, condition, supply, demand, and other factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a collectable for either more or less than what they originally <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> A price guide is a resource such as a book or website that lists typical selling prices.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{aeronautical}} engineer Fred Weick was assistant {{chief of the}} aeronautics division of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). In 1934 he asked permission to build an aircraft based on the 1931 Stout Skycar, using fabric instead of aluminum covering, and control modifications based on NACA research. Weick {{and a group of}} co-workers designed and assembled the experimental aircraft with a group of his colleagues who worked on the project in their spare time and <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> themselves. The resulting aircraft, known as the W-1, featured tricycle landing gear, a parasol wing, and a pusher propeller configuration.|$|E
25|$|Although when {{designing}} it {{they have}} {{paid attention to}} detail the people of Newcastle <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be built, not the Council of the time. The theme of the building is set by lancet windows; slim {{and pointed at the}} top as in the Gothic style, they are complemented by arched borders that protrude from the brickwork. Decorative gables and bargeboards fringe the pitched slate roof on all sides of the building. A tall spire, two chimneys and numerous decorative finials once lined the top of the roof but have been damaged or lost over the years and {{were not included in the}} restorations. The rooms are large with high pitched ceilings that show solid timber rafters.|$|E
