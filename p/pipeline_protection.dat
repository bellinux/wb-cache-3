40|$|The {{aggressive}} {{scaling of}} semiconductor technology has significantly increased the radiation-induced soft error rate in modern microprocessors.

This paper proposes a complete and cost-effective <b>pipeline</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism using a self-checking architecture. The radiation hardened pipeline is achieved by incorporating SETTOFF-based self-checking cells into the sequential cells of the pipeline.

40|$|The {{aggressive}} {{scaling of}} semiconductor devices {{has caused a}} significant increase in the soft error rate induced by radiation particle strikes. This has led to an increasing need for soft error tolerance techniques to maintain system reliability, even for sea-level commodity computer products. Conventional radiation-hardening techniques, typically used in safety-critical applications, are prohibitively expensive for non-safety-critical microprocessors in terrestrial environments. Providing effective hardening solutions for general logic in microprocessor pipelines, in particular, is a major challenge and still remains open. This thesis studies the soft error effects on modern microprocessors, with the aim to develop cost-effective soft error mitigation techniques for general logic, and provide a comprehensive soft error treatment for commercial microprocessor pipelines. This thesis presents three major contributions. The first contribution proposes two novel radiation hardening flip-flop architectures, named SETTOFF. A reliability evaluation model, which can statistically analyse the reliability of different circuit architectures, is also developed. The evaluation results from 65 nm and 120 nm technologies show that SETTOFF can provide better error-tolerance capabilities than most previous techniques. Compared to a TMR-latch, SETTOFF can reduce area, power, and delay overheads by over 50 %, 86 %, and 78 %, respectively. The second contribution proposes a self-checking technique based on the SETTOFF architectures. The self-checking technique overcomes the common limitation of most previous techniques by realising a self checking capability, which allows SETTOFF to mitigate both the errors occurring in the original circuitry, and the errors occurring in the redundancies added for error-tolerance. Evaluation results demonstrated that the self-checking architecture can provide much higher Multiple-Bit-Upsets tolerant capabilities with significantly less power and delay penalties, compared to the traditional ECC technique, for protecting the register file. The third contribution proposes a novel <b>pipeline</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism, which is achieved by incorporating the SETTOFF-based self-checking cells into the microprocessor pipeline. An architectural replay recovery scheme is developed to recover the relevant errors detected by the self-checking SETTOFF architecture. The evaluation results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively mitigate both SEUs and SETs occurring in different parts of the pipeline. It overcomes the drawback of most previous <b>pipeline</b> <b>protection</b> techniques and achieves a complete and cost effective <b>pipeline</b> <b>protection.</b> <br/...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{consider}} varied engineering actions {{aimed at}} the <b>protection</b> of <b>pipelines</b> from developing erosion processes {{with a focus on}} the conditions of northern regions. Engineering solutions, considered in the article, include prevention of erosion processes along <b>pipelines,</b> <b>protection</b> from suffusion, protection of extended areas having the limit value of the slope angle, and actions {{aimed at the}} drainage of areas along pipelines. Prevention of erosion processes along pipelines consists in the restoration of the fertile layer using biological methods, as well as the volumetric soil reinforcement using geological grids. Prevention of suffusion processes consists in the employment of various types of suffusion shields accompanied by the application of geotextile. Berms are constructed as suffusion prevention actions in extended areas having a limit value of the slope angle. This action is used to reduce the water flow energy of drainage ditches and trays along the pipeline. The authors believe that a complete geotechnical monitoring network must be designed and developed to monitor the condition of pipelines and foundation soils.

It also highlights {{the extent of}} spill/pollution issues in the Niger Delta region due to intended/unin- tended damages and suggests a possible method of control. It is believed that the best option to avoid pollution due to pipeline failure {{is to ensure that}} hydrocarbon does not exit from the pipeline. With the different methods considered in this review, acoustic monitoring of change in the operational sound generated from a given pipeline section is suggested to be practicable to identifying sound abnormalities of third party encroachments. One established challenge of the acoustic system for buried <b>pipelines</b> <b>protection</b> is attenuation of acoustic transmission. An attempt to check the performance of an acoustic transmission on steel pipelines submerged in water points to a similar research on plastic water pipelines that attenuation is small compared with pipe buried in soil. Fortunately, Niger Delta of Nigeria is made of wetland, swamps and shallow water and could therefore offer an opportunity to deploy acoustic system for the safety of pipelines against third party attacks in this region. However, the numerous configuration and quantity of oil installation in this region imply that cost of application will be enormous. It is therefore suggested that a combination of impressed alternating cycle current (IACC) which traces encroachment on the pipeline coating and an acoustic system be used to manage intended and unintended pipeline potential damages. The IACC should be used for flow lines and other short distance delivery lines within the oilfield, while the relatively large diameter and long length delivery, trunk and transmission lines should be considered for acoustic protection. It is, however, noted that further efforts are required to reduce cost and improve effectiveness of these systems...|$|R

The pipelines are suffering from corrosion, cracking and other problems. External corrosion has been recognized for many years {{as one of the}} main deterioration mechanisms that may reduce the structural life of buried transmission pipelines. Corrosion of these pipes inflicts huge costs on countries, to protect their pipelines, and make them workable for the longest possible time. One of the ways followed in <b>pipelines</b> <b>protection,</b> is by coating them with special material that protect them from affecting corrosion factors, as the type of the soil, moisture, pH, temperature variations and other factors. Organic coating is used to control corrosion by isolating the external surface of the underground or submerged pipeline from environment. This organic coating should have a high electrical resistance and high dielectric strength to provide a barrier against moisture reaching the pipelines surface. Organic coatings are usually classified according to the resin binder, which controls protectiveness and resistance to degradation. The organic coating is reasonably easy to repair in the field. The present study aims to study three types of coatings assigned for <b>protection</b> of these <b>pipelines.</b> This work was carried out by placing the pipes inside a box containing soil. The study was conducted in different operating situations. Firstly, the soil was saturated by saline water (5 % NaCl).

Cathodic protection systems (CPS) are used in combination with surface coatings to protect the pipeline from external corrosion. Although cases of pipeline failure due to external corrosion remain rare, such failures can have catastrophic effects in terms of human lives, environment degradation and financial losses. The offshore industry was led to the use of risk analysis techniques subsequent to major disasters, such as Piper Alpha and Alexander Kjelland. These accidents made the development and use of risk analysis techniques of highly significant interest, and reliability analysis is presently becoming a more important management tool in that field for determining reliability of components such as pipelines, subsea valves and offshore structures.

To properly model the GIC in order to mitigate their impacts it is necessary to know the frequency dependence of the response of these systems to the geomagnetic variations which naturally span a wide frequency range.
