50|$|Maintenance of a {{railroad}} embankment may require material (soil, rock, etc.) {{to be moved}} from where it is deposited by erosion near the track {{to a place where}} the embankment has been eroded away, or {{a railroad}} may need to simply widen the cut and fill sections. One method to do this was to mount a winch on one <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> (colloquially known as the Lidgerwood Car and in some cases labeled as such) with a line connected to a plow that was configured to slide along the decks of many <b>flat</b> <b>cars.</b> Soil material was shoveled (manually or by power equipment) onto the <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> then the train of <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> was moved to where the material was to be unloaded and the plow was pulled over the decks, forcing the material laterally off the <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> where it fell to the embankment.|$|R

25|$|Although railroads {{were just}} {{beginning}} to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed on those <b>flat</b> <b>cars.</b> Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|R

P&R management formed and kept controlling stock interest in the Eustis Railroad, and then issued Eustis Railroad bonds {{to cover the costs}} of building the branch and purchasing rolling stock. Portland Company built 25 <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> for the Eustis Railroad. The <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> were 33 ft long and had a capacity of 12 tons. They were the largest [...] narrow gauge <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> in Maine at the time. Construction of the branch began at Eustis Junction in May, 1903, and was completed in 1904. P&R management leased the Eustis Railroad to the P&R as soon as the branch was completed; and used the rolling stock for normal P&R operations. Summer-only passenger service from a resort at Green Farm connected with P&R trains at Eustis Junction.|$|R
