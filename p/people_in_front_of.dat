The main {{thoroughfares}} are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street furniture and coloured ambient lighting will be colour-coded to match. A stylised map of the site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the brownfield site to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is viewable from the piazza.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} two days, Weatherman held no rallies or protests. Supporters of the RYM II movement, led by Klonsky and Noel Ignatin, held {{peaceful}} rallies of several hundred <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the federal courthouse, an International Harvester factory, and Cook County Hospital. The largest event of the Days of Rage occurred on Friday, October 9, when RYM II led an interracial march of 2,000 people through a Spanish-speaking part of Chicago.|$|E

A mix of feelings took place between the protesters, some burning {{a picture of the}} Minister of the Interior and stepping on it while another held up a sign to dismiss him. There's even a short video on YouTube asking a young girl who the daughter of the prisoner why she's there at the protest. In terms of police presence, at one point it was reported that Saudi Investigation Units were in plain clothing especially after Saudi military forces withdrew.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the studio}} {{was set up}} to allow <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the camera to see {{themselves}} on monitors, and the videotapes were available to be watched by anyone, the two used the video to critique their own performance. They would deliberately fail on their first attempt at any given demonstration, and then use the video {{to find out what was}} visible to the researchers and what was not. They would then develop a technique that would not appear on video. Edwards found that one particular camera operator was on guard to capture any attempts at sleight of hand, so he picked the man to assist him in one experiment, and he was replaced by a less competent cameraman. This was also a clear violation of one of Randi's caveats; the test run should have been stopped at this point and recorded as a failure.|$|E
500|$|Several critics drew {{comparison}} to the television series Mad Men. Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons opined that the episode blatantly mimicked the show's style, and called Eddie Cibrian's performance an imitation of Jon Hamm's Don Draper and even citing specific shots and camera angles {{similar to those in}} Mad Men. Lyons wrote, [...] " [...] can't copy the lyricism or narrative potency that make Mad Men what it is, which is more than a collection of artfully arranged period hairdos and moody pairs of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> rectangle-patterned backgrounds. [...] it's sure trying!" [...] TVLine Matt Webb Mitovich felt that despite evoking an accurate depiction of the 1960s, it did not succeed as well as Mad Men. He felt the series was too claustrophobic and that Cibrian was not strong enough for his part.|$|E
500|$|So John left Epiphany in Ireland and {{returned}} to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called [...] "A Long Journey's End" [...] surrounded by <b>people,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a shelf full of bottles {{with the names of}} the comic's staff over the years.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1960, {{the media}} dubbed these people the [...] "Memphis Mafia."

Elvis and his friends {{got out of the}} two cars and someone in the crowd yelled, [...] "Who are they, the Mafia?" [...] and a newspaper reporter picked up the story. The Memphis Mafia members themselves say on their website that Elvis liked the name and it stuck. These original Memphis Mafia members at the time the phrase was coined were Billy Smith, Sonny West, Marty Lacker, Lamar Fike, Joe Esposito, Red West, Charlie Hodge and Alan Fortas.|$|E

Reporters sent to the accident scene covered angry demonstrations by the local residents.

60|$|In October 1912 {{silent and}} {{seemingly}} uninhabited crags and chasms {{in the high}} western region of the Balkans echoed and re-echoed with a single shot. It was fired by {{the hand of a}} king--real king, who sat listening to his <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his own house (for it was hardly a palace), and who, in consequence of his listening to the people, not unfrequently imprisoned the politicians. It is said of him that his great respect for Gladstone as the western advocate of Balkan freedom was slightly shadowed by the fact that Gladstone did not succeed in effecting the bodily capture of Jack the Ripper. This simple monarch knew that if a malefactor were the terror of the mountain hamlets, his subjects would expect him personally to take arms and pursue the ruffian; and if he refused to do so, would very probably experiment with another king. And the same primitive conception of a king being kept for some kind of purpose, led them also to expect him to lead in a foreign campaign, and it was with his own hand that he fired the first shot of the war which brought down into the dust the ancient empire of the Grand Turk.|$|E

The Bishop had left a boat there some years before, and the Samoan teacher, Mark, who had been Mrs. Nihill's best friend and comforter, came out in it with a joyful party full of welcome. The Bishop and Patteson went ashore, taking with them their two Bauro scholars, to whom the most wonderful sight was a cow, they never having seen any quadruped bigger than a pig. All the native teachers and their wives were assembled, and many of the <b>people,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the house where Mr. Nihill had died. They talked of him with touching affection, as they told how diligently he had striven to bring young and old to a knowledge of his God; and they eagerly assisted in planting at his grave a cross, which the Bishop had brought from Auckland for the purpose, and which bore the words: 'I am the Resurrection and the Life.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Now Umslopogaas ate, {{and then}} they moved {{together}} slowly down the mountain and crossed the river by a ford, for he wished to save his strength. On the farther {{side of the river}} Galazi hid himself in the reeds, because his face was known, and there Umslopogaas bade him farewell, not knowing if he should look upon him again. Afterwards he walked up to the Great Place of Jikiza. Now when he reached the gates of the kraal, he saw that many people were streaming through them, and mingled with the people. Presently they came to the open space in front of the huts of Jikiza, and there the headmen were gathered together. In the centre of them, and before a heap of the skulls of men which were piled up against his door-posts, sat Jikiza, a huge man, a hairy and a proud, who glared about him rolling his eyes. Fastened to his arm by a thong of leather was the great axe Groan-Maker, and each man as he came up saluted the axe, calling it [...] "Inkosikaas," [...] or chieftainess, but he did not salute Jikiza. Umslopogaas sat down with the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the councillors, and few took any notice of him, except Zinita, who moved sullenly to and fro bearing gourds of beer to the councillors. Near to Jikiza, on his right hand, sat a fat man with small and twinkling eyes, who watched the maid Zinita greedily.|$|E
60|$|The tug-boat gossip {{informed}} me that Dick Kennet was dead--blown up, near Memphis, and killed; that several others whom I had known had fallen in the war--one {{or two of them}} shot down at the wheel; that another and very particular friend, whom I had steered many trips for, had stepped out of his house in New Orleans, one night years ago, to collect some money in a remote part of the city, and had never been seen again--was murdered and thrown into the river, it was thought; that Ben Thornburgh was dead long ago; also his wild 'cub' whom I used to quarrel with, all through every daylight watch. A heedless, reckless creature he was, and always in hot water, always in mischief. An Arkansas passenger brought an enormous bear aboard, one day, and chained him to a life-boat on the hurricane deck. Thornburgh's 'cub' could not rest till he had gone there and unchained the bear, to 'see what he would do.' He was promptly gratified. The bear chased him around and around the deck, for miles and miles, with two hundred eager faces grinning through the railings for audience, and finally snatched off the lad's coat-tail and went into the texas to chew it. The off-watch turned out with alacrity, and left the bear in sole possession. He presently grew lonesome, and started out for recreation. He ranged the whole boat--visited every part of it, with an advance guard of fleeing <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him and a voiceless vacancy behind him; and when his owner captured him at last, those two were the only visible beings anywhere; everybody else was in hiding, and the boat was a solitude.|$|E
60|$|A narrow grave-yard in {{the heart}} of a bustling, {{indifferent}} city, seen from the windows of a gloomy-looking inn, is at no time an object of enlivening suggestion; and the spectacle is not at its best when the mouldy tombstones and funereal umbrage have received the ineffectual refreshment of a dull, moist snow-fall. If, while the air is thickened by this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the blessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that no depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly felt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady who stood looking {{out of one of the}} windows of the best hotel in the ancient city of Boston. She had stood there for half an hour--stood there, that is, at intervals; for from time to time she turned back into the room and measured its length with a restless step. In the chimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and in front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying a pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into small equal squares, and he was apparently covering them with pictorial designs--strange-looking figures. He worked rapidly and attentively, sometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at arm's-length, and kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling. The lady brushed past him in her walk; her much-trimmed skirts were voluminous. She never dropped her eyes upon his work; she only turned them, occasionally, as she passed, to a mirror suspended above the toilet-table on the other side of the room. Here she paused a moment, gave a pinch to her waist with her two hands, or raised these members--they were very plump and pretty--to the multifold braids of her hair, with a movement half caressing, half corrective. An attentive observer might have fancied that during these periods of desultory self-inspection her face forgot its melancholy; but as soon as she neared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a very ill-pleased woman. And indeed, in what met her eyes there was little to be pleased with. The window-panes were battered by the sleet; the head-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed to be holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces. A tall iron railing protected them from the street, and on the other side of the railing an assemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the liquid snow. Many of them were looking up and down; they appeared to be waiting for something. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place where they stood,--such a vehicle as the lady at the window, in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had never seen before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors, and decorated apparently with jangling bells, attached to a species of groove in the pavement, through which it was dragged, with a great deal of rumbling, bouncing and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small horses. When it reached a certain point the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the grave-yard, of whom much the greater number were women, carrying satchels and parcels, projected themselves upon it in a compact body--a movement suggesting the scramble for places in a life-boat at sea--and were engulfed in its large interior. Then the life-boat--or the life-car, as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated it--went bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the helmsman (the man at the wheel) guiding its course incongruously from the prow. This phenomenon was repeated every three minutes, and the supply of eagerly-moving women in cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles, renewed itself in the most liberal manner. On the other side of the grave-yard was a row of small red brick houses, showing a series of homely, domestic-looking backs; at the end opposite the hotel a tall wooden church-spire, painted white, rose high into the vagueness of the snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it for some time; for reasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She hated it, she despised it; it threw her into a state of irritation that was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She had never known herself to care so much about church-spires.|$|E
