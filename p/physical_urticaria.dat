40|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to food are a frequently discussed cause of urticaria.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) and histamine in human skin was studied by intradermal injection of the compounds {{alone or in}} combination in healthy volunteers. Responses were recorded by measurement of areas of wheal and erythema, and changes in cutaneous blood flow quantified using a laser Doppler flow meter. The effect of a near-threshold dose of PGD 2 on histamine dose-response relationships and on the response to a single low dose of histamine were examined. Histamine caused dose-related increases in blood flow and in areas of wheal and erythema in human skin. Prostaglandin D 2 caused dose-related in- creases in blood flow and erythema area, but not wheal area, in the dose range used. When the compounds were injected together, PGD 2 did not potentiate the increase in blood flow and areas of wheal and erythema due to histamine.

The role of PGD 2 in cutaneous disorders such as the <b>physical</b> <b>urticarias,</b> in which its release has been demonstrated, is therefore uncertain.

40|$|Background: In 1769, William Cullen {{introduced}} the word "urticaria" (transient edematous papules, plaque with itching). Urticaria affects 15 - 25 &#x 0025; {{of people at}} least once in their life time. It is a clinical reaction pattern triggered by many factors causing the liberation of vasoactive substances such as histamine, prostaglandins and kinins. Urticaria is classified according to its duration into acute (&# 60; 6 weeks duration) and chronic (> 6 weeks duration). Various clinical investigations may be initiated to diagnosis the cause. Aims: To evaluate the types of chronic urticaria with reference to etiology from history and investigations. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients with chronic urticaria of more than six weeks were studied. Autologous serum skin test (ASST) was performed after <b>physical</b> <b>urticarias</b> were excluded. Standard batteries of tests were performed after ASST in all patients; and other specific investigations were done where necessary. Skin prick test was done in idiopathic urticaria. Results: The study sample consisted of 62 male and 88 female patients {{with a mean age of}} 21 - 40 years. About 50 &#x 0025; of patients showed an ASST positive reaction, 3. 9 &#x 0025; were positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA), IgE titer was elevated in 37 &#x 0025;, H. pylori antibodies was positive in 26. 7 &#x 0025;. Thyroid antibodies were positive in 6. 2 &#x 0025;. Giardia and entamoeba histolytica was reported in 3. 3 &#x 0025; on routine stool examination and on urinalysis 8 &#x 0025; had elevated WBC counts; 12 &#x 0025; showed para nasal sinusitis, with maxillary sinusitis of 7. 3 &#x 0025;. Random blood sugar was high in 5. 3 &#x 0025;. Four patients had ASOM, two had positive KOH mount for dermatophytes, abdominal USG showed cholecystitis in two patients. Recurrent tonsillitis was noted in two patients. Urticaria following intake of NSAIDs was observed in four patients and with oral contraceptive pills in one patient. Contact urticaria to condom (latex) was seen in one patient. Cholinergic (4. 7 &#x 0025;) and dermographic (4. 7 &#x 0025;) urticaria were the predominant <b>physical</b> <b>urticarias.</b> Prick test was performed in idiopathic urticaria with maximum reactions to food antigens (25 &#x 0025;) where brinjal was the commonest, 9 &#x 0025; to dust in which spider web was the most common, 8 &#x 0025; to pollen where parthenium and amaranthus were the commonest, followed by A. flavus in fungi, pigeon in epithelia and cockroach in insects. Conclusion: Nearly half of the patients had chronic autoimmune urticaria on the basis of ASST. A significant number of them had serological makers of autoimmune activity. ASST provides an easy, inexpensive investigation in CU and helps direct attention to underlying systemic auto immune diseases. The presence of these auto antibodies was significantly associated with more frequent and longer lasting urticarial attacks.

Objective: our purpose was to evaluate the skin response to mechanical stimulation obtained by a dermographometer in patients with different forms of U or psoriasis. Material and methods: 65 subjects affected with U, 40 with psoriasis, 48 control subjects and 42 patients with different cutaneous disorders, where any fundamental role {{could be attributed to}} mast cells, were evaluated. Results: on testing with a dermographometer, in all patients with dermographic U a linear wheal appeared in a few minutes.

In patients with psoriasis 10 of 40 positive responses with the instrument were obtained. Nevertheless, only one third of them reacted to pressures below normal limits (≤ 9 arbitrary units).

Compará-la entre os tipos clínicos de urticária crônica e avaliar se o {{angioedema}} piora a qualidade de vida. MÉTODOS: Participaram 62 doentes com urticária crônica, com sinais e sintomas da doença até 7 dias da consulta, que foram divididos em urticária crônica comum, urticária crônica física e urticária crônica mista. RESULTADOS: Observou-se predominância de mulheres (72, 6 %), idade média de 39, 8 anos, angioedema associado em 75, 8 % dos doentes. Apresentaram mais angioedema doentes com urticária crônica comum (p= 0, 011) e mulheres (p= 0, 024). Quanto aos tipos clínicos, 32, 3 % apresentaram urticária crônica comum, 27, 4 % urticária crônica física e 40, 3 % urticária crônica mista. O escore médio total do questionário específico foi 10, 4. No questionário específico, os domínios mais comprometidos foram "Sintomas e sentimentos" e "Atividades diárias", e, no SF- 36, "Aspectos físicos" e "Vitalidade". Houve comprometimento da qualidade de vida nas mulheres, nos doentes com até 30 anos, em primeira consulta, nos mais escolarizados, naqueles com até 1 ano de doença e naqueles com angioedema. CONCLUSÃO: A urticária crônica compromete a qualidade de vida medida pelos questionários específico e genérico.

METHODS: Sixty-two patients with chronic urticaria, who had had signs or symptoms of the disease within the preceding week, were divided into groups according to whether they had ordinary chronic <b>urticaria,</b> <b>physical</b> chronic <b>urticaria</b> or mixed chronic urticaria. RESULTS: There was a predominance of women in this study (72. 6 %). The mean age of patients was 39. 8 years and angioedema was associated with chronic urticaria in 75. 8 % of cases. Associated angioedema was more commonly found in patients with ordinary chronic urticaria (p= 0. 011) and in women (p= 0. 024). With respect to the different clinical types, 32. 3 % of the patients had ordinary chronic urticaria, 27. 4 % had <b>physical</b> chronic <b>urticaria</b> and 40. 3 % had mixed chronic urticaria. Mean overall score for the disease-specific questionnaire was 10. 4. In this questionnaire, the most affected domains were "symptoms and feelings" and "daily activities", while the most affected domains in the SF- 36 were "physical role" and "vitality". Quality of life was found to be impaired in women, in patients of up to 30 years of age, in those attending a first consultation, in those with higher education levels, in patients who had had the disease for up to one year and in those with angioedema. CONCLUSION: Chronic urticaria affects quality of life, as measured using a disease-specific questionnaire and a generic questionnaire. There was no statistically significant difference between the clinical types. The presence of angioedema impaired patients' quality of life even further. There was a statistically significant correlation between the scores obtained using the disease-specific questionnaire and those obtained using the generic questionnaire...|$|R
