5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and the Seminary began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. The seminary professors realized that students renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> for their housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union Theological Seminary or at nearby Princeton Theological Seminary. The professors surmised {{that it would be}} cheaper to build a seminary building that provided both student housing and instruction space.|$|E
5|$|Business school rankings are {{important}} to the various business schools because they are an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the course of their careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher <b>paying,</b> <b>more</b> respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to examine the relation between demographics factors with the consumers’ willingness to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for green products and the influence of values (individualism or collectivism and security or fun/enjoyment) on the consumers’ willingness to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for green products. Hypotheses testing are employed with quantitative data and the hypotheses analysis is tested using Chi Square Analysis and Multiple Regression Analysis. In this study, two facts are revealed. First, consumer demographics factors (age, gender, level of education, monthly income, employment status, house ownership, marital status and family size) are not related to the consumer’s willingness to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for green products. Second consumers’ values (collectivism) is significantly influence the consumer’s willingness to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for green products although the other values such as Individualism, Security, and Fun/Enjoyment do not significantly influence the consumer’s willingness to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> for green products...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} social comparisons of prices. It considers the effects of price comparisons on consumers when they get a better bargain and when they <b>pay</b> <b>more.</b> This study finds that satisfaction with both the store and the product purchased are lower when consumers <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> than others. Findings also suggest that prices consumers are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> easily go down than up, where as perceptions of prices stores normally charge stay the same or even increase...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Extra Mile, a band from Kentucky {{threatened}} to sue Shenandoah {{over the use of}} the name Shenandoah. After a financial settlement was made with the Kentucky band, two other bands filed lawsuits over Shenandoah's name. The lawsuits depleted the money earned by the band on the road, which led to the band asking the label and their production company to all pay one-third of their legal costs. The production company refused, and Shenandoah was forced to filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1991 after <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> than 2 million dollars on court settlements and legal fees. Although the lawsuits allowed Shenandoah to keep its name, the bankruptcy filing terminated the contract with Columbia after a 1992 Greatest Hits package. The production company's officials then filed a lawsuit against the band, claiming that it had tried to void its agreement with them. After Shenandoah's departure, there were no other bands on Columbia's Nashville division; as a result, producer Larry Strickland assembled three musicians to create a new band called Matthews, Wright & King in an attempt to keep a commercially successful band on the label.|$|E
5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
