Giovinco {{appeared}} as a substitute in the two opening group matches of the tournament against Spain and Croatia, almost assisting a goal against Spain in the opening match, as the earlier goalscorer Antonio Di Natale put his lobbed <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bar. Italy finished as runners up to Spain in the final in a 4–0 loss.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{began on}} 23 May 1944 {{with the aim}} of having the threat {{established}} by 29 May and continued until 28 June (22 days after the Normandy landings). It was implemented via double agents, in Britain and the United States, {{under the control of the}} Twenty Committee. The operation did not receive any resources from the Allied navies or airforce, so the deception had no physical element. This meant that Ironside had none of the traditional accompaniments to an invasion, including reconnaissance flights, bombardment, and naval operations. As a result, the Twenty Committee was cautious about using important agents to <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> deception.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2006, an Australian Army S-70A Black Hawk {{helicopter}} {{operating from}} Kanimbla, and carrying ten Army personnel on board, crashed whilst attempting {{to land on}} the ship's deck, killing 1 person, injuring 7 more and leaving one missing (later confirmed dead). HMAS Melville arrived on task the morning of 15 December 2006, equipped with a Towed Pinger Locating Drone supplied from the United States Navy set about locating the downed Black Hawk. Melville detected the locator beacon during its first <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crash site and pinpointed its exact location in subsequent passes. The helicopter is sitting in around 2900 metres of water.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} roads used by Europeans {{to cross}} the Sierra Nevada into California were branches of the California Trail. The first route near the present US 50 was the Carson Route, laid out in 1848 by an eastward Mormon party that wanted to avoid the Truckee Route and its deep crossings of the Truckee River. The group left Pleasant Valley, southeast of Placerville, on July 3, following Iron Mountain Ridge up to {{the crest of the}} Sierra at Carson Pass and then descending through Carson Canyon into the Carson Valley. Along the Humboldt River in Nevada, the Mormons met Joseph B. Chiles, who was leading a westward wagon train to California, and told him of their new trail. Although this new Carson Route crossed two summits— Carson <b>Pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crest of the Sierra and West <b>Pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Carson Spur just to the west, these crossings were easier than Donner Pass on the Truckee Route, and only three fords of the Carson River were required. The route became the primary westward route into California {{at the start of the}} Gold Rush. Through California, the general alignment of the Carson Route, in terms of today's highways, was State Route 88 over Carson Pass and Mormon Emigrant Trail and Sly Park Road to Pleasant Valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, {{but it was just}} too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E

50|$|A major design {{challenge}} was {{the noise of}} the public transit tracks <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lot. The solution was to enclose a 530 ft section of the tracks in a stainless steel tube <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> building. The tube's support structure is completely independent of the building's, to minimize vibration passing between them.|$|R

5|$|By 17:00, the Luftwaffe {{was ready}} to strike again. Radar {{stations}} were now plotting more German formations off the Kent coast and over the Pas-de-Calais area. Having attacked Biggin Hill and Kenley, Luftflotte 2 was now going after the Sector Station RAF North Weald and RAF Hornchurch. Some 58 Do 17s of KG 2 were sent to bomb Hornchurch and 51 He 111s of KG 53 were directed to attack North Weald. The two raiding formations were to <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> coast at the same time; so the He 111s attacking North Weald, with further to go, left 15 minutes earlier. The He 111s were to cross over at Foulness, the Dorniers at Deal. Fighter escort was provided by 140 Bf 109s and Bf 110s from JG 3, JG 26, JG 51, JG 54 and ZG 26.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts usually {{move from}} west to east, or from {{southwest}} to northeast, but rarely from the south. Because of this, these cold fronts do {{not result in}} the cold being intense since they are moderated as they <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> surrounding oceans. In the rare cases when cold fronts move northwards from the south (Antarctica), the cold air masses are not moderated by the surrounding oceans, resulting in very cold temperatures throughout the region. In general, the passage of cold fronts {{is more common in}} the south than in the north, and occurs more in winter than in summer. The movement of warm, subtropical air into the region occurs frequently in summer up to 46oS. When warm subtropical air arrives in the region, the air is dry, resulting in little precipitation, and causes temperatures to be higher than those observed in northeast Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Kaafjord's {{defenders}} {{detected the}} Lancasters approximately {{ten minutes before}} they arrived, and the protective smokescreen was beginning to form when the attack commenced at 10:55am GMT. Only {{the first group of}} Lancasters, led by Tait, were able to aim their bombs at Tirpitz before she was obscured by smoke. It is believed that the bomb dropped from Tait's aircraft struck the battleship, and the other bombs dropped by this group landed in the water nearby. All the other Force A aircraft aimed their Tallboys at the anti-aircraft gunfire rising from the ship; 17 of the weapons were dropped. Several Lancasters made more than one <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> target area as their bomb aimers sought to locate Tirpitz or technical problems prevented their Tallboy from being dropped on the initial pass.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other games}} in the genre, the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa gameplay, Stage mode, {{as he or she}} listens to a {{selected}} song. Each song's performance is limited to a predetermined idol or group of idols, unlike the franchise's previous games. During a song, a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines, called Melody Lines, toward a central target icon. To complete a song, the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from—the buttons on the console's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version, and the left and right halves of the screen for the iOS version—as they <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> target icon. The player is scored by these presses' accuracy in timing and direction, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The player's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter, which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note. Throughout the song, new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones. The note sequences may also include Long Icons, which are streaks of notes that need to be continuously held down; Simultaneous Icons, which are pairs of icons that <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> target icon simultaneously; and Shooting Stars, which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled, and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player's score and changes the song's accompanying music video when it is hit. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song; there are four difficulty levels: Debut, Normal, Pro, and Master from the easiest to the hardest.|$|E
5|$|Now {{separated}} by a landscaped median, the route progresses eastward, intersecting MacDonald Avenue and providing access to several residential and retail properties that adjoin the road. The route travels within a concrete trench and abruptly curves to the southeast as it passes beneath Victoria Avenue, with {{which there is a}} simple interchange. East of this point, the road was named Newman Hill until March 2012. Palmer Avenue and Ontario Avenue <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> route as it descends a hill towards the Niagara Gorge. At the bottom, the route curves to the southwest, where it provides access to the Rainbow Bridge border crossing into the United States as well as the tourist district of the city.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March Farnese {{deployed}} {{elements of}} his army {{in a plain}} stretching between his position at the village of Ranst and the Dutch camp at Borgerhout, which Norreys and De la Noue had fortified with moats, palisades and earthworks. The assault was divided into three columns, each one provided with a mobile bridge to <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> camp's moat. After one of the attacks, undertaken by Walloon troops, succeeded in securing a bridge, the Spanish forces were able to attack the States-General's soldiers inside their camp. Norreys and De la Noue's men opposed a strong defence, but Farnese, throwing his light cavalry to the battle, forced the Dutch troops to abandon Borgerhout and look for shelter under the artillery of Antwerp's walls. William of Orange, leader of the Dutch revolt, and archduke Matthias of Habsburg, Governor-General of the Netherlands appointed by the States General, witnessed the fight from Antwerp's walls.|$|E

5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{predicted}} Flora {{to turn to}} {{the northwest}} after entering the Windward Passage and affect the Bahamas. Forecasters advised those in The Bahamas to quickly complete preparations, though the eye of the hurricane did not <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> archipelago until four days later. When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane, and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor the hurricane. At its closest approach to Florida, the hurricane remained 330miles (530km) away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart to Key West due to the hurricane's large size.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} created the plenary power doctrine, holding {{that the federal}} court did not have {{jurisdiction}} because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away {{the rights of the}} tribe. Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation; the next major case, United States v. Kagama, (1886), upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act. The plenary power doctrine allowed Congress to enact any law that it wanted to <b>pass,</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent. The use of this power led to complaints of being subject to a lawmaking body without representation, especially prior to being granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.|$|E

5|$|The four lane road splits into {{a divided}} highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a {{complicated}} interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW / Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, the lanes from Brown's Line diverge and form the collector lanes of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps {{to and from}} the QEW / Gardiner <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes. This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express lanes provide access between the QEW / Gardiner Expressway and Highway401, while the collector lanes provide local access between those interchanges.|$|E
5|$|The prototypes {{performed}} well; however, several design failings led to {{the loss}} of WB771 on 14 July 1954, when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> runway at Cranfield, causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew. Attached to the fin using three bolts, the tailplane was subject to considerably more stress than had been anticipated, and the three bolts failed due to metal fatigue. Additionally, the prototypes were considerably tail heavy {{due to the lack of}} equipment in the nose; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes. Production Victors had a lengthened nose that also served to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes. The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the tailplane attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing.|$|E
5|$|The route {{crosses the}} Big Timber Creek into Camden County, {{running along the}} border of Runnemede and Gloucester Township. County Route 544 veers to the right onto Evesham Road, and Route 41 {{continues}} northeast on Clements Bridge Road into Runnemede. At the intersection with Route 168, Route 41 becomes county-maintained and runs concurrent with County Route 573. The two routes cross into Barrington, where they <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> New Jersey Turnpike. Upon crossing a Conrail railroad line, Route 41 and County Route 573 run along the border of Barrington and Haddon Heights, with Barrington to the southeast and Haddon Heights to the northwest. The two routes pass under Interstate 295 before meeting U.S. Route 30 at a modified traffic circle.|$|E
