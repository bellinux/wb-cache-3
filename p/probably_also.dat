5|$|Falco peregrinus nesiotes, {{described}} by Mayr in 1941, {{is found in}} Fiji and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> Vanuatu and New Caledonia. It is non-migratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} {{migration}} {{seems to be}} controlled primarily by changes in day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues {{from the sun and}} stars, the earth's magnetic field, and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> mental maps.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after this}} setback {{he still did}} some work for the firm. He tracked down and {{informed}} the firm of patent infringing copies of their engines in Leeds between 1795–1796 and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> {{did the same thing}} subsequently in Lancashire.|$|E

5|$|Prehistoric {{representatives of}} the extant Picidae genera are treated in the genus articles. An enigmatic form based on a {{coracoid}} found in Pliocene deposits of New Providence in the Bahamas, {{has been described as}} Bathoceleus hyphalus and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> is a woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphidromus are {{arboreal}} — in other words, they are tree snails. However, more {{detailed information on}} their habits is still lacking. The general feeding habits of these snails are unknown, but a few species are known to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae. Amphidromus themselves are preyed upon by birds, snakes, and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> by smaller mammals such as rats.|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged {{for the last}} few billion years, and the net rate of star formation <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> peaked approximately ten billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is typically}} inoffensive towards humans, but if disturbed, can inflict a severe bite. Across {{much of its}} range, it is a frequent catch (intentional or not) in bottom trawls and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> set nets and demersal gillnets; the meat is eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use in wood finishing.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> possessed such bundles of sensitive nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|AMPK <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> {{plays a role}} in {{increased}} peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but {{it became clear that}} the public was interested in the animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them {{into the back of}} his truck.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the great white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E

5|$|However the Eleans, Messenians and Spartans {{remained}} passive throughout 210 BC, and Philip {{continued to}} make advances. He invested and took Echinus, using extensive siegeworks, having beaten back an attempt to relieve the town by the Aetolian strategos Dorimachus and the Roman fleet, now commanded by the proconsul Publius Sulpicius Galba. Moving west Philip <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> took Phalara {{the port city of}} Lamia, in the Maliac Gulf. Sulpicius and Dorimachus took Aegina, an island in the Saronic Gulf, which the Aetolians sold to Attalus, the Pergamene king, for thirty talents, and which he was to use as his base of operations against Macedon in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|In France, however, Innocent II found {{a strong}} {{ally in the}} person of Bernard of Clairvaux. Under Bernard’s influence, almost all European monarchs and episcopates {{recognized}} the exiled Innocent II. Anacletus II, although he controlled Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter, received the support only of the Normans of southern Italy, Scotland, Aquitaine, some cities in northern Italy (incl. Milan), and perhaps Outremer and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> Poland.|$|E
5|$|In the phlaeothripids {{that feed}} on fungi, males compete {{to protect and}} mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by {{flicking}} their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again polymorphic with large and small forms, and <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.|$|E
50|$|The {{budget for}} the next year did not include funding for the Europa Lander concept, however, there was {{continued}} support for the SLS on which the Europa Lander would <b>probably</b> need. <b>Also,</b> there was continued funding for the Europa Clipper.|$|R

5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{combined}} all {{the qualities}} most admired in a Heian courtier: {{he was of}} high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. He was <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> an expert horseman, adept in arms, and a competent official. These aspects of his life are not emphasized in The Tales of Ise, but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.|$|E
5|$|Originally various {{buildings}} were {{built around the}} curtain wall. Moving clockwise from {{the entrance to the}} Inner Court, the shape of the 12th-century castle chapel can still be made out on the curtain wall. Convention at the time required a chapel to point along a north-east/south-east axis; in order to achieve this, the chapel had to extend out considerably into the bailey, similar to the design at White Castle. The chapel is adjacent {{to the site of the}} first stone hall in the castle, built around 1160; in the 16th and 17th centuries the chapel tower was <b>probably</b> <b>also</b> used as a cannon emplacement.|$|E
