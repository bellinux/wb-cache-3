50|$|A <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> is a {{flat sheet}} which bed {{occupants}} lie underneath. Blankets, quilts, duvets/comforters and other bed covers are laid over the <b>top</b> <b>sheet,</b> {{but because of}} the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> they do not directly touch the bed occupant.|$|R
50|$|However, a <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> {{has its own}} advantages. First, a tucked-in <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> {{can provide}} a {{comfortable}} feeling of snugness that duvets cannot, as duvets are not usually large enough to tuck under the mattress. Second, <b>top</b> <b>sheets</b> allow {{a wider range of}} blanket choices besides duvets, such as quilts.|$|R

50|$|<b>Top</b> <b>sheets</b> are {{standard}} in the U.S., but much of Europe prefers to use duvet covers. A duvet cover consists of two rectangles sewn together on all but one side to create a sleeve for the duvet, which can be taken off and washed. When no other blankets are lain atop the covered duvet, it can provide several advantages over a <b>top</b> <b>sheet.</b> First, respecting sanitation, with a <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> the bed occupant could accidentally in the night remove the barrier {{between himself and the}} duvet (which is less washable); with a duvet cover this is impossible. Second, for households with children, a bed with a covered duvet is easier to make: the child need only tug the corners of the duvet back towards the corners of the bed. Tucking in a <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> before arranging the duvet is an extra step. Third, switching a duvet cover is a cheaper way to change color schemes than buying a new comforter.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} examine {{objective}} evaluation equations for disposable diaper's <b>top</b> <b>sheets,</b> representative <b>top</b> <b>sheets</b> are evaluated by those equations and by subjective method comparing with reusable diaper's fabrics. Following conclusions were obtained. Objective evaluation equation for primary hand (DPCM- 1) is useful for calculation of primary hands "NAMERAKASA" and "KOSHI", however, it is not effective to "SOFUTOSA" and "FUKURAMI". Two objective evaluation equations for total hand value (THV) (DPCM- 2, 3) are both available for <b>top</b> <b>sheets.</b> THV decreased {{in the order of}} spunbond, air-through, meltblow, and spunlace for both objective and subjective values. Used fabric for reusable diapers examined here (plain weave) has higher "NAMERAKASA", "SOFUTOSA" "FUKURAMI" and THV, however, lower "KOSHI" than the original fabric.

50|$|Instead of {{inserting}} a special sheet {{in between the}} original and the intended copy, carbonless copy paper has micro-encapsulated dye or ink {{on the back side}} of the <b>top</b> <b>sheet,</b> and a clay coating on the front side of the bottom sheet. When pressure is applied (from writing or impact printing), the dye capsules rupture and react with the clay to form a permanent mark duplicating the markings made to the <b>top</b> <b>sheet.</b> Intermediary sheets, with clay on the front and dye capsules on the back, can be used to create multiple copies; this may be referred to as multipart stationery.|$|R
50|$|A new scheme which {{involves}} attaching <b>Top</b> <b>sheets</b> {{along with the}} Main answer booklet containing all details of the candidate along with barcode is introduced.|$|R
50|$|The {{solution}} {{consists of}} a digital pen, tablet and a special printed paper used as the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> on answer booklets. The digital pen is used by an examiner to write marks on the <b>top</b> <b>sheet.</b> The pen digitizes marks in real time and transfers data to the tablet. The allotted marks is displayed on the tablet in handwritten form as well as digitized format. Once the user validates marks in the tablet, the data is encrypted and transferred to the centralized server of the education board.|$|R
50|$|A {{sheet of}} carbon paper is placed between {{two or more}} sheets of paper. The {{pressure}} applied by the writing implement (pen, pencil, typewriter or impact printer) to the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> causes pigment from the carbon paper to make a similar mark on the copy sheet(s). More than one copy {{can be made by}} stacking several sheets with carbon paper between each pair. Four or five copies is a practical limit. The <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> is the original and each of the additional sheets is called a carbon copy.|$|R
5000|$|The third sheet is {{carbon paper}} (purple/blue). Pressing this coating layer with {{something}} sharp or applying heat, the ink {{is transferred to}} the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> leaving a purple/blue image.|$|R

This rapid motion is seen as vertical movement to the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> (the dynamics are governed by the layer problem, see [22, 28]). The trajectory moves to a point on P(L-) and from there is once again governed by the desingularized equations, moving along the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> until L+ is reached. The fast vertical downward motion along fast fibers returns the trajectory to a point on P(L+) on the bottom sheet, completing the cycle.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} {{involves the}} use of design to simplify the bed-making. For instance, Smart Bedding's bedding set connects the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> and duvet to make it for easy bed-making as well as a better night's sleep.|$|R
5000|$|The ditto machine (spirit duplicator) sold by Ditto, Inc., used two-ply [...] "spirit masters" [...] or [...] "ditto masters". The <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> {{could be}} typed, drawn, or written upon. The second sheet was {{coated with a}} layer of colored wax. The {{pressure}} of writing or typing on the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> transferred colored wax to its back side, producing a mirror image of the desired marks. (This acted like a reverse of carbon paper.) The wax-supply sheet was then removed and discarded, and the other sheet (containing the images) was fastened onto the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, with the waxed (back, or reverse-image) side out.|$|R

50|$|There {{was some}} limited secure communication: One method valid for sending {{classified}} information {{was a pair}} of one-time pads. These pads were each made of twin sets of pages, the top one of which had all letters and numbers on a line, perhaps 40 lines to a page. The <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> was carbonless paper. To use the sheets, one circled each letter or number row-by-row on the <b>top</b> <b>sheet.</b> This marked the second sheet, which had all the letters and numbers scrambled. The scrambled version could then be transmitted by teletypewriter or telephone to the recipient who, using his matching set of one-time pads, could reverse the process and read the secure message.|$|R
50|$|An OLICR pen and tablet set {{could be}} shared by several evaluators at an {{evaluation}} camp since the set would be required only {{at the time of}} writing the marks on the <b>top</b> <b>sheet,</b> which would take approximately less than a minute per answer script.|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of tin were {{measured}} in six different brands of disposable baby diapers by using radioisotope (americium) excited energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence. <b>Top</b> <b>sheet</b> and adhesive tape system {{were measured}} separately. The concentrations found in <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> and tape system were < 1. 5 to 23. 1 mg/kg and < 1. 5 to 22. 4 mg/kg, respectively. Almost all diapers contained tin in the adhesive tape system (four of five) {{and two of}} six samples contained tin in <b>top</b> <b>sheet.</b> Tin found in diapers may be an organotin substance: tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), monobutyltin (MBT) and/or dioctyltin (DOT), which are widely used in industrial processes as catalysts or as PVC heat stabilizers. Organotin substances have toxic effects which include neurotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. The measured concentrations were less than EU regulatory levels of 0. 1 % by weight of tin prescribed by REACH Annex XVII No 20. However, the same regulation completely bans the use of organotin substances as biocides in antifouling paints. While effects of TBT on marine organisms from antifouling paints are well known, the effects of organotin compounds in childcare products and other commercial articles receive much less attention. Children who use disposable diapers every day are particularly sensitive...|$|R

50|$|The self-pierce rivet fully pierces the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> material(s) {{but only}} {{partially}} pierces the bottom sheet. As {{the tail end}} of the rivet does not break through the bottom sheet it provides a water or gas tight joint. With the influence of the upsetting die, {{the tail end of}} the rivet flares and interlocks into the bottom sheet forming a low profile button.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodical {{study of the}} self-piercing riveting (SPR) process. The force-displacement curve is typically used in most investigations of SPR, but in this study, additional SPR process data are examined in details. Specifically, the characteristic pressure-displacement, displacement-time, force-pressure as well as force-displacement curves are analysed and correlated with cross-sections of interrupted joints obtained at different positions to determine the key different physical events that occur during SPR joining. The study shows {{that it is possible}} to identify the exact point when the rivet starts piercing the <b>top</b> <b>sheet,</b> finishes piercing the <b>top</b> <b>sheet</b> and starts flaring in the bottom sheet. It was found that all of the characteristic curves can be segmented into three distinctive stages (bending, piercing and flaring). However, the die filling event which is embedded within the piercing stage can be identified only by examining the pressure-displacement and force-displacement curves. This study also shows {{that it is possible to}} identify when the bottom sheet touches the die bottom surface...|$|R
