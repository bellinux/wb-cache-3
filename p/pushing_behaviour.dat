Understanding the mechanisms underlying motor be-haviour after a brain lesion {{is critical to}} the develop-ment of more focussed and effective interventions. Dr Karnath has for some time {{been at the forefront of}} re-search on perceptual disorders underlying the clinical phenomenon called “contraversive pushing ” that oc-curs in some individuals after stroke and the develop-ment of a standardised testing method that helps clarify diagnosis [9]. Some individuals early after stroke experience an al-tered perception of the body’s orientation in space, and they express a feeling of certainty that their body is ori-ented upright when it is in fact tilted about 18 ◦ toward the paretic side [9]. The <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour</b> observed by physiotherapists appears secondary to this impair-ment. Interestingly, reports available suggest that the incidence of <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour</b> appears to be variable, with incidence ranging as low as 10 % [10]. This may be due in part to differences in testing procedure.

40|$|AbstractPost-stroke ‘pushing’ {{behaviour}} {{appears to}} be caused by impaired perception of vertical in the roll plane. While <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour</b> typically resolves with stroke recovery, it is not known if misperception of vertical persists. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if perception of vertical is impaired amongst stroke survivors with a history of <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Fourteen individuals with chronic stroke (7 with history of pushing) and 10 age-matched healthy controls participated. Participants sat upright on a chair surrounded by a curved projection screen in a laboratory mounted on a motion base. Subjective visual vertical (SVV) was assessed using a 30 trial, forced-choice protocol. For each trial participants viewed a line projected on the screen and indicated if the line was tilted to the right or the left. For the subjective postural vertical (SPV), participants wore a blindfold and the motion base was tilted to the left or right by 10 – 20 °. Participants were asked to adjust the angular movements of the motion base until they felt upright. SPV was not different between groups. SVV was significantly more biased towards the contralesional side for participants with history of pushing (− 3. 6 ± 4. 1 °) than those without (− 0. 1 ± 1. 4 °). Two individuals with history of pushing had SVV or SPV outside the maximum for healthy controls. Impaired vertical perception may persist in some individuals with prior post-stroke pushing, despite resolution of pushing behaviours, which could have consequences for functional mobility and falls...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Effective {{control of}} (upright) body posture {{requires}} a proper representation of body orientation. Stroke patients with pusher syndrome {{were shown to}} suffer from severely disturbed perception of own body orientation. They experience their body as oriented 'upright' when actually tilted by nearly 20 ° to the ipsilesional side. Thus, it can be expected that postural control mechanisms are impaired accordingly in these patients. Our aim was to investigate pusher patients' spontaneous postural responses of the non-paretic leg and of the head during passive body tilt. Methods A sideways tilting motion {{was applied to the}} trunk of the subject in the roll plane. Stroke patients with pusher syndrome were compared to stroke patients not showing <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour,</b> patients with acute unilateral vestibular loss, and non brain damaged subjects. Results Compared to all groups without <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour,</b> the non-paretic leg of the pusher patients showed a constant ipsiversive tilt across the whole tilt range for an amount which was observed in the non-pusher subjects when they were tilted for about 15 ° into the ipsiversive direction. Conclusion The observation that patients with acute unilateral vestibular loss showed no alterations of leg posture indicates that disturbed vestibular afferences alone are not responsible for the disordered leg responses seen in pusher patients. Our results may suggest that in pusher patients a representation of body orientation is disturbed that drives both conscious perception of body orientation and spontaneous postural adjustment of the non-paretic leg in the roll plane. The investigation of the pusher patients' leg-to-trunk orientation thus could serve as an additional bedside tool to detect pusher syndrome in acute stroke patients. </p...|$|E
50|$|With a {{diagnosis}} of <b>pusher</b> <b>behaviour,</b> three important variables should be seen, the most obvious of which is spontaneous body posture of a longitudinal tilt of the torso toward the paretic {{side of the body}} occurring on a regular basis and not only on occasion. The use of the nonparetic extremities to create the pathological lateral tilt of the body axis is another sign to be noted when diagnosing for <b>pusher</b> <b>behaviour.</b> This includes abduction and extension of the extremities of the non-affected side, to help in the push toward the affected (paretic) side. The third variable that is seen is that attempts of the therapist to correct the pusher posture by aiming to realign them to upright posture are resisted by the patient.|$|R

It is unique within the order Scolopendromorpha for its slow gait, robust tergites, and highly modified gizzard and mandible morphology. Not much {{is known about}} the biology of the species but it has been speculated to be arboreal with a possibly vegetarian diet. Until now its phylogenetic position within the subfamily Otostigminae has been based only on morphological characters, being variably ranked as a monotypic tribe (Arrhabdotini) or classified with the Southeast Asian genus Sterropristes Attems, 1934. The first molecular data for E. octosulcatum sourced from a newly collected specimen from Sarawak were analysed with and without morphology. Parsimony analysis of 122 morphological characters together with two nuclear and two mitochondrial loci resolves Edentistoma as sister group to three Indo-Australian species of Rhysida, this clade in turn grouping with Ethmostigmus, whereas maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses of the molecular data on their own ally Edentistoma with species of Otostigmus. A position of Edentistoma within Otostigmini (rather than being its sister group as predicted by the Arrhabdotini hypothesis) is consistently retrieved under different analytical conditions, but support values within the subfamily remain low for most nodes. The species exhibits strong <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour,</b> suggestive of burrowing habits.

40|$|Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) is a {{destructive}} pest of stored maize and cassava that {{has recently been}} accidentally introduced into tropical Africa. Males produce an aggregation pheromone when on food, that attracts dispersing males and females. P. truncatus aggregation pheromone {{is being used to}} monitor the spread of P. truncatus (Larger Grain Borer) across Africa. The biological function of this pheromone is controversial. This thesis investigates the role of aggregation pheromone in mate choice in P. truncatus.;The literature on Coleopteran aggregation pheromones was reviewed, with particular reference to the possible adaptive functions of aggregation pheromones.;Variation in Prostephanus truncatus aggregation-pheromone signalling was detected. Conspecifics can detect these differences and are preferentially attracted to some males more than others. Both males and females 'agree' which males are most attractive (shown in a laboratory bioassay and in trapping experiments in the field). Females also discriminate between potential mates on contact by a stylised <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Some males consistently secure more matings than others when two males are presented at once to a female. Discrimination between males mediated on contact through pushing is not influenced by the male's aggregation pheromone signal (both natural variation and manipulation of the pheromone signal were studied).;Observation of adult beetles in an artificial host sandwiched between two glass plates revealed that males and females pair up, and cohabit within the same tunnel system. Pairs mate multiply (up to 20 times per 12 hours) and dissection of recently mated females revealed that males deliver an oversized ejaculate (approx. 50 000 sperm) as an oval spermatophore. Male investment in ejaculate was not found to be influenced by male crowding or the presence of Female Factor (an involatile pheromone produced by females, which can trigger aggregation pheromone shut down in males) ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pusher {{behavior}} (PB) is {{a little-known}} postural control disorder characterized by alterations {{in the perception}} of body orientation in the coronal (roll) plane. Poststroke PB poses many short- and long-term concerns in clinical practice leading to the longer length of hospital stay and slower functional recovery. The literature on specific rehabilitation training in PB is scant. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the outcomes after postural orientation training using visual and somatosensory cues versus conventional physiotherapy in patients with poststroke PB. METHODS: Sixteen patients with PB were enrolled. Eight patients received postural orientation training employing visual and somatosensory cues. Seven patients received conventional physiotherapy. Each patient underwent 20 (50 min/d) individual treatment sessions (5 d/week for 4 weeks). Primary outcome measure was the Scale for Contraversive Pushing (SCP). Secondary outcome measures were the European Stroke Scale (ESS), and the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS). Outcomes were assessed at admission, after 1 week, post-treatment, and at 1 -month follow-up. RESULTS: No significant between-group differences were measured on primary and secondary outcome measures. Significant within-group changes in performance were noted in both groups. The magnitude {{of the differences between the}} postural orientation training and the conventional physiotherapy effects, as measured on the SCP and the PASS, suggests the value of the former approach.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relationships}} between perception of verticality by different sensory modalities, lateropulsion and <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour</b> and lesion location were investigated in 86 {{patients with a}} first stroke. Participants sat restrained in a drum-like framework facing along the axis of rotation. They gave estimates of their subjective postural vertical by signalling the point of feeling upright during slow drum rotation which tilted them rightwards-leftwards. The subjective visual vertical was indicated by setting a line to upright on a computer screen. The haptic vertical was assessed in darkness by manually setting a rod to the upright. Normal estimates ranged from - 2. 5 degrees to 2. 5 degrees for visual vertical and postural vertical, and from - 4. 5 degrees to 4. 5 degrees for haptic vertical. Of six patients with brainstem stroke and ipsilesional lateropulsion only one had an abnormal ipsilesional postural vertical tilt (6 degrees); six had an ipsilesional visual vertical tilt (13 +/-. 4 degrees); two had ipsilesional haptic vertical tilts of 6 degrees. In 80 patients with a hemisphere stroke (35 with contralesional lateropulsion including 6 'pushers'), 34 had an abnormal contralesional postural vertical tilt (average - 8. 5 +/- 4. 7 degrees), 44 had contralesional visual vertical tilts (average - 7 +/- 3. 2 degrees) and 26 patients had contralesional haptic vertical tilts (- 7. 8 +/- 2. 8 degrees); none had ipsilesional haptic vertical or postural vertical tilts. Twenty-one (26 %) showed no tilt of any modality, 41 (52 %) one or two abnormal modality(ies) and 18 (22 %) a transmodal contralesional tilt (i. e. PV + VV + HV). Postural vertical was more tilted in right than in left hemisphere strokes and specifically biased by damage to neural circuits centred around the primary somatosensory cortex and thalamus. This shows that thalamo-parietal projections have a functional role in the processing of the somaesthetic graviceptive information. Tilts of the postural vertical were {{more closely related to}} postural disorders than tilts of the visual vertical. All patients with a transmodal tilt showed a severe lateropulsion and 17 / 18 a right hemisphere stroke. This indicates that the right hemisphere {{plays a key role in}} the elaboration of an internal model of verticality, and in the control of body orientation with respect to gravity. Patients with a 'pushing' behaviour showed a transmodal tilt of verticality perception and a severe postural vertical tilt. We suggest that pushing is a postural behaviour that leads patients to align their erect posture with an erroneous reference of verticality...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{movement}} {{of large numbers}} of people is critical in emergency and/or panic situations, such as during the evacuation of buildings, stadiums, theatres, and public transport stations; outdoor events such as public assemblies, open concerts, and religious gatherings; and community evacuations following natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Perhaps the most critical reason for studying collective pedestrian dynamics under emergency/panic conditions is the lack of complementary data to develop and validate an explanatory model. That lack of data is likely to explain why very few models focus on panic situations. The bulk of the literature is restricted to the study of normal evacuation processes. Even the researchers responsible for developing the few existing models of crowd panic have identified the need for more rigorous modelling frameworks and the development of approaches to assess the reliability of model predictions. The broad aim of this dissertation is to use empirical data from non-human organisms {{in the development of a}} pedestrian traffic model under emergency conditions. Experiments undertaken with non-human organisms under panic conditions are a crucial component of the research reported here. Those experiments are found to be a promising and feasible means of circumventing the limitations posed by the scarcity of complementary human data under panic conditions. Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) were used as test organisms in the experiments reported here because they are abundant and simple to maintain in the laboratory. The experiments reported in this thesis reflect an original attempt to study the effects of structural features, that is, the layout of the escape area, on the collective movement patterns of non-human entities during rapid egress and to translate those results to the study of human panic. Large potential effects from the adjustments of small structural features of the escape area have been demonstrated via experiments with panicking Argentine ants. Insights from the experiments with panicking Argentine ants, along with previous studies on animal dynamics and pedestrian dynamics, have been used in the development of a simulation model called EmSim (short for Emergency Simulation). The formulation for the model recognises the role of both attractive and repulsive forces in maintaining the coherence of collective dynamics under panic conditions. To date, consideration of both repulsive and attractive forces has received limited attention in studies of crowd panic reported in the literature. Also the granular forces for <b>pushing</b> <b>behaviour</b> were modified to consider the case of discontinuity when the relative velocity is zero or near to zero. A first attempt has also been made to scale the model parameters for collective pedestrian traffic via ant traffic, based on a scaling concept commonly used in biology. With this innovative framework combining insights from biology and traffic engineering, there is scope to compare the collective movement patterns of non-human biological entities and pedestrians in order to devise sound strategies to aid evacuation. The proposed model also provides insight into the minimal interactions or physical mechanisms required for the emergence of collective dynamics. The nature of those underlying mechanisms was investigated through experiments with panicking ants. The proposed model is first calibrated and validated (with independent data) through simulation of panicking ant traffic as observed from the experiment and then scaled up for the human panic situation. Since data does not exist for direct measurement of model parameter values appropriate for panicking humans, the parameter values in the model were allometrically scaled up from the ant values to human values. The model predictions for collective pedestrian traffic were consistent with observations of collective traffic for ants. This consistency suggests that there are fundamental features of crowd behavior that transcend the biological idiosyncrasies of the organisms involved. The effectiveness of the proposed modelling framework is also validated through the comparison of the simulation results for the pedestrian traffic with the observed data from the experiment (under non-panic conditions). For normal (non-panic) conditions, the model was validated with experimental data on pedestrian traffic; specifically through comparisons of: •headway distributions in uni-directional traffic, •speed distributions and lane formation in bi-directional traffic, and, •outflow from bottlenecks of various widths. The results provide reassurance of the robustness of the model in explaining the collective dynamics of the panicking individuals despite the differences in speed, size and other biological details between ants and humans. The results also demonstrate the capability of the EmSim model to represent both non-panic and panic conditions within the same modelling framework. The model organism approach is commonplace in medical research but not in engineering, yet it is shown in this dissertation that it has enormous potential to provide insight and theoretical understanding of crowd panic. It will enhance understanding about what properties of panic are inherent to the physical nature of crowds, and what properties depend on idiosyncratic details. Also in biology, little attention has been given to the study of the effect of nest design elements on collective movements of social insects. The experiments that are reported here address those gaps in the study of alarm traffic in social insects by focussing attention to the relationship between nest architecture and internal traffic under alarm conditions. It is expected that the experimental studies and modelling framework presented in this dissertation will appeal to a broad audience, including researchers interested in social insects and nest architecture, self-organization, evacuation and traffic dynamics and engineering...|$|E

Yet, there is large disagreement on both its consequences and drivers. Career scholars as well as policymakers believe that FJSB is important for unemployed and can improve their employment prospects. However, evidence from HR literature raises doubts whether FJSB can enhance reemployment success. Similarly, while the career literature links FJSB to positive attitudes, like career adaptability, the HR literature suggests that people searching flexibly may feel <b>pushed</b> into this <b>behaviour</b> due to more negative reasons, like few labour market perspectives. The aim of this study is examining these opposing expectations. We focus on three FJSB types: flexibility with respect to pay/hierarchical level, skill use and commuting time. Hypotheses are tested using two-wave data with 672 unemployed. Results indicate, among others, that career adaptable people are not inclined to search more flexibly.

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A growing body of research suggests that a cultural shift in education has taken place, where teachers work is being affected by the terrors of performativity (Ball, 2003, p. 215). According to research within the sociology of education field, within this culture {{what it means to be}} a teacher or to teach is based on performance criteria, surveillance, judgments and a lack of autonomy or personal choice. Physical education is a particularly interesting area of education through which this shifting culture can be explored as various competing discourses are drawn upon to enhance the field and, indeed, physical education has become somewhat of a contested terrain in terms of its purpose, definition and focus as it is at the hub of various competing interest groups (Keech, 2003). Drawing on a poststructural theoretical framework which views discourses as perpetuated by social structures and practices and implicated in teachers understandings of teaching and learning practices, this research considers how such discourses may impact on physical education teachers work, professionalism and identities and how they can be deconstructed to provide alternate readings and shifting subject positions. It explores teachers multiple position(ing) s within educational reforms and initiatives, illustrating how they interact with performative neo-liberal discourses to <b>push</b> teachers <b>behaviours</b> towards greater performance and regulation and considers how performativity, rather than narrowing the inequality gap, may be leading towards increased inequalities amongst pupils learning experiences (Ball, 2003; Youdell, 2004). The narratives of these teachers illustrate that for many of these physical education teachers, performativity was seen to give credence to the subject and increase its status within schools, while for others the shifting culture towards greater measurement and accountability was experienced as overwhelming. Through a clear awareness of the marginal status of physical education within schools these teachers negotiated different subject positions simultaneously. They reported features of performativity as constraining and challenging, yet also as simultaneously enabling and rewarding since they experienced performativity as enhancing their sense of professionalism and the status of their subject...|$|R

Since low self-esteem is a major symptom of depression, a further claim has been made that loss ofrank {{can be used as a}} model of depression. In support of this claim, it has been suggested that loss of rank can be reversed by the antidepressant imipramine. However, antidepressant treatment has not yet been shown to reverse the effects of defeat for more than a single test session. Consequently, the present study was designed to more fully assess the effects of antidepressant treatment on the behaviour of defeated animals. Six pairs of male Lister Hooded (LH) rats were observed biweekly for 30 min at the onset of the dark phase of the light-dark cycle.

40|$|In this work, I use ns- 3 {{simulations}} {{to compare}} and evaluate {{different approaches to}} web based adaptive bitrate (ABR) video streaming. In particular, I look at the difference between client pull and server push based approaches, the effects of media formatting parameters such as chunk duration and number of encoding rates, and the implementation of bandwidth estimation and request scheduling strategies. I find that client pull applications with a 2 second chunk duration are very inefficient with bandwidth compared to applications using a server push based approach. The reasons for this stem from the effect of frequent idle periods at chunk boundaries, which are absent with server <b>push,</b> on the <b>behaviour</b> of TCP. Increasing the chunk duration to 10 seconds makes a significant difference to client pull applications and allows them to perform at a level much more comparable with server push applications. I also find that ABR applications in general are vulnerable to suffering from encoding rate instability, a result that echoes findings {{from a number of}} recent studies. This problem seems to stem from the difficulty of selecting a suitable encoding rate based on transfer rates observed at the application layer. Effective remedies for encoding rate instability include ensuring that the system is not over provided for {{in terms of the number}} of available encoding rates, and using an averaging function, such as the harmonic mean, over a series of recent transfer rates in order to filter out short term fluctuations in the estimate of available bandwidth. I also show that a simple request scheduling strategy can be used to avoid over buffering and the associated problems, but that periodic request scheduling can introduce further problems related to fairness when multiple ABR flows compete. Finally, I show that a hybrid of client pull and server push, which I call pull selective, can offer a useful compromise between the two, by matching the performance characteristics of server push whilst maintaining the low server overheads and scalability attributes of client pull...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to explore how {{microstate}} human interactions produce macro level self-organization and emergence in a supply disruption scenario, as well as discover factors and typical human behaviour that bring about disruptions. This study argues that the complex adaptive system’s view of complexity is most suited scholarly foundation for this research enquiry. Drawing on the dissipative structure based explanation of emergence and self-organization in a complex adaptive system, this thesis further argues that an energy gradient between the ongoing and designed system conditions, known as adaptive tension, causes supply chains to self-organize and emerge. This study adopts a critical realist ontology operationalized by a qualitative case research and grounded theory based analysis. The data was collected using repertory grid interviews of 22 supply chain executives from 21 firms. In all 167 cases of supply disruptions were investigated. Findings illustrate that agent behaviours like loss of trust, over ambitious pursuit, use of power and privilege, conspiring against best practices and heedless performance were contributing to disruption. Impacted by these behaviours, supply chains demonstrated impaired disruption management capabilities and increased disruption probability. It was also discovered {{that some of these}} system patterns and microstate agent <b>behaviours</b> <b>pushed</b> the supply chains to a zone of emergent complexity where these networks self-organized and emerged into new structures or embraced changes in prevailing processes or goals. A conceptual model was developed to explain the transition from micro agent behaviour to system level self-organization and emergence. The model described alternate pathways of a supply chain under adaptive tension. The research makes three primary research contributions. Firstly, based upon the theoretical model, this research presents a conceptualization of supply chain emergence and self-organization from dissipative structures and adaptive tension based view of complexity. Secondly, it formally introduces and validates the role of behavioural and cognitive element of human actions in a supply chain scenario. Lastly, it affirms the complex adaptive system based conceptualization of supply chain networks. These contributions succeed in providing organizations with an explanation for observed deviations in their operations performance using a behavioural aspect of human agents...|$|R
