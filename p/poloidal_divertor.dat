The TEXTOR helical {{divertor}} is {{a magnetic}} configuration {{created by the}} application of external resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with the intention to control plasma edge transport and the resulting particle and heat fluxes to the divertor target.

40|$|The {{mission of}} FIRE is to attain, explore, {{understand}} and optimize fusion dominated plasmas to provide knowledge for designing attractive MFE systems. FIRE is envisioned {{as an extension}} of the existing advanced tokamak program leading to an attractive magnetic fusion reactor (e. g., ARIES-RS). The FIRE [1, 2] design study of a next step burning plasma experiment has the goal of developing a concept for an experimental facility to explore and understand the strong non-linear coupling among confinement, MHD self-heating, stability, edge physics and wave-particle interactions that is fundamental to fusion plasma behavior. This will require plasmas dominated by alpha heating (Q ≈ 10) that are sustained for a duration comparable to characteristic plasma time scales (≥ 10 τ E, ~ 4 τ He, ~ 2 τ skin). The FIRE pre-conceptual design activities, carried out by an U. S. national team, have been undertaken with the objective of finding the minimum size (cost) device to achieve the essential burning plasma science goals. Machine Description FIRE activities have focused on the physics and engineering assessment of a compact, high-field tokamak with the capability of achieving Q ≈ 10 in the Elmy H-mode for a duration of ~ 1. 5 plasma current redistribution times (skin times) during an initial burning plasma science phase, and the flexibility to add advanced tokamak hardware (e. g., lower hybrid current drive) later.

The plasma configuration fits present day reactor concepts (INTOR, ITER) on smaller scale. The aims of the AUG include two technical problems: Control of the non-circular bulk plasma configuration {{and control of the}} plasma boundary or divertor configuration respectively. For these purposes an exact measurement and adjustment of magnetic fields is required. Axial symmetry can be assumed for all plasma equilibria with a toroidal field component B_#phi# and two poloidal field components B_r and B_z. The measurements of field components in a vertical plane containing the axis are sufficient. Axissymmetry may be destroyed by eddy currents in metallic structure and stable or unstable plasma disturbances. Their investigations require measurements also in planes of different toroidal angles.

The design has a low aspect ratio (2. 6) and low toroidal field on axis (35. 7 kG) with 24 extended "D"-shaped super-conducting TF coils. A superconducting air core transformer is designed with windings outside TF coils while the vertical field magnets, also superconducting, are inside the extended "D's".

40|$|The {{impact of}} helical {{perturbations}} on the rotation velocity and thus {{on the energy}} confinement is calculated {{on the basis of}} the ambipolarity constraint, the parallel momentum equation of the revisited neoclassical theory and a simplified temperature equation. The helical perturbations can act as means for ergodizing the magnetic field and/or as momentum source or sinks, whereas at the separatrix (effective radius r(s)) of the <b>poloidal</b> <b>divertor</b> a temperature pedestal may arise due to the strong shear flow reducing the transport to a neoclassical level. The neoclassical theory allows the prediction of the parallel and poloidal flow speeds and thus of the 'subneoclassical' heat conductivity chi(sub) used in the heat conduction equation. This heat conductivity allows us to compute the temperature pedestal and to reproduce the power balance in ALCATOR if one assumes that chi = chi(sub) in the radial sheath with the thickness of Delta approximate to 0. 7 cm, centred around the inflection radius r(in), and chi = chi(L) for r < r(in) - Delta/ 2. chi(L) is the normal L-mode heat conductivity. Source terms account for momentum deposition by neutral beam injection (NBI), by pressure anisotropization and the j x B force density, the latter two due to Fourier components of (rotating) helical fields. Source terms for the power deposition by NBI, Ohmic heating and radiation are also included. The main results can be summarized as follows:At a dynamic ergodic divertor in TEXTOR frequency of 10 kHz, a toroidal velocity gradient of 1. 2 x 10 (6) s(- 1) may be achieved which is enough to suppress the ion temperature gradient and thus to generate an ITB. The <b>poloidal</b> <b>divertor</b> suppresses the neutral gas influx and thus effects a (sub) neoclassical sheath with a temperature pedestal of T-ped approximate to 400 eV and an increase of the central value by roughly the same amount. In the case of edge localized mode-control with an ergodic layer of Delta approximate to 2. 5 cm, generated by the helical coils, the height of the pedestal stays unaffected if in the pedestal region a transition from L-mode confinement to subneoclassical confinement is assumed...|$|E
40|$|Two mapping {{methods to}} study {{magnetic}} field lines near the separatrix of <b>poloidal</b> <b>divertor</b> tokamaks {{in the presence}} of external non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations are proposed. The first mapping method is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of field line equations in the Boozer coordinates and solving it by the canonical transformation of variables (Abdullaev et al 1999 Phys.

Measurements of <b>poloidal</b> distributions of <b>divertor</b> flows carried out with sufficiently high resolution also reveal some other specific properties of these distributions, namely, (1) {{the existence of a}} pair of non-ambipolar flows of opposite sign corresponding to the basic ambipolar flow in a divertor leg; Q) a splitting of ambipolar flow; (3) the presence of a comparatively large non-ambipolar flow with an excess of electrons outflowing near the torus midplane; (4) a comparatively high ion saturation current and corresponding negative current to a grounded electric probe in the divertor private region.

40|$|Divertor {{detachment}} may {{be essential}} to reduce heat loads to magnetic fusion tokamak reactor divertor surfaces. Yet in experiments {{it is difficult to}} control the extent of the detached, low pressure, plasma region. At maximum extent the front edge of the detached region reaches the x-point and can lead to degradation of core plasma properties. We define the `detachment window' in a given position control variable C (for example, the upstream plasma density) as the range in C within which the front location can be stably held at any position from the target to the x-point; increased detachment window corresponds to better control. We extend a 1 D analytic model[1] to determine the detachment window for the following control variables: the upstream plasma density, the impurity concentration and the power entering the scrape-off layer (SOL). We find that variations in magnetic configuration can have strong effects; Increasing the ratio of the total magnetic field at the x-point to that at the target, Bx/Bt, (total flux expansion, as in the Super-X divertor configuration) strongly increases the detachment window for all control variables studied, thus strongly improving detachment front control and the capability of the divertor plasma to passively accommodate transients while still staying detached. Increasing flux tube length and thus volume in the <b>divertor,</b> through <b>poloidal</b> flux expansion (as in the snowflake or x-divertor configurations) or length of the divertor, also increases the detachment window, but less than the total flux expansion does. The sensitivity of the detachment front location, zh, to each control variable, C, defined as dzh/dC, depends on the magnetic configuration. The size of the radiating volume and the total divertor radiation increase / (Bx/Bt) ^ 2 and / Bx/Bt, respectively, but not by increasing <b>divertor</b> <b>poloidal</b> flux expansion or field line length.

40|$|Handling {{the power}} and {{particle}} exhaust in fusion reactors based on tokamaks is a challenging problem [1, 2]. To bring the energy flux to the divertor plates to an acceptable level (< 10 MW/m 2), it is desirable to significantly increase poloidal flux expansion in the divertor area. Some recent ideas include that of a so-called X divertor [3] and a 'snowflake' divertor [4]. We use an acronym SF to designate the latter. In this paper we concentrate on the SF divertor. The general idea behind this configuration is that, by a proper selection of <b>divertor</b> (<b>poloidal</b> field) coils, one can make the null point of the second, not of the first order as in the standard divertor. The separatrix {{in the vicinity of}} the X point then acquires a characteristic hexapole structure (Fig. 1), reminiscent of a snowflake, whence the name. The fact that the field has a second-order null, leads to a significant increase of the flux expansion. It was noted in Ref. [4] that the SF configuration is topologically unstable: if the current in the divertor coils is somewhat higher than the one that provides the SF configuration, it becomes a single-null X-point configuration. Conversely, if the coil current becomes somewhat lower, there appear two separate X-points. To solve this problem, one can operate the divertor at the current by roughly 5 % higher than the value needed to create the second-order null. Then, configuration becomes robust enough and the shape of the separatrix does not change significantly if the coil current varies by 2 - 3 %. At the same time, the flux expansion still remained by a factor of {approx} 3 larger compared to a 'canonical' divertor. Following Ref. [4], we call this configuration a 'SF-plus' configuration. Specific examples in Ref. [4] were given for simple magnetic geometries The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the SF concept will also work for a strongly shaped plasma. The other set of issues considered in the present paper relates to the possible presence of the toroidal current near the null-point. To find a set of divertor coils for a system with a strongly shaped plasma, we use the following strategy. We start from a configuration with the flux surfaces similar to the desired ones in the plasma core. Then we identify the point where the poloidal field null is desired and introduce divertor coils generating this null, be it first or second order. This, of course, somewhat changes the shape of the flux surfaces in the plasma core but, if the divertor is compact, the change is modest (except for the surfaces close to the separatrix). We will illustrate this procedure in the limit of a low-aspect-ratio tokamak, replacing it by a 'rectified' torus. In this 'rectified' geometry, the direction of the plasma current and the current in poloidal field coils is z, with the axes (x, y, z) forming the right-hand triplet. The generalization to the toroidal geometry is straightforward but leads to lengthy equations. General properties of a toroidal field have been discussed in a review paper [5]...|$|R

To show the influence of magnetic perturbations on the field line escape, we integrate numerically the field line differential equations and obtain the footprints and deposition patterns on the divertor plate. Moreover, we show that the homoclinic tangle describes the deposition patterns in the divertor plate, agreeing with results observed in sophisticated simulation codes. Additionally, we show that while chaotic lines escape to the divertor plates, some of them are trapped, for many toroidal turns, in complex structures around magnetic islands, embedded in the chaotic region, giving rise to the so called stickiness effect characteristic of chaotic Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we introduce a random collisional term to the field line mapping to investigate stickiness alterations due to particle collisions. Within this model, we conclude that, even reduced by collisions, stickiness still influences the field line transport...|$|E

Detailed information with respect to hydrogen titanium film interactions under similar conditions was sought so that engineering decisions could be made with greater confidence. Pumping speeds for hydrogen on titanium films were determined by admitting a pulse of gas into the volume enclosed by the substrate and measuring the time constant of the pressure decay. The measurement was made periodically as the film was deposited, and when the maximum sticking coefficient was reached, sublimation was stopped and additional gas pulses admitted to determine the speed vs. hydrogen concentration in the Ti film. The amount of gas per pulse varied from 0. 25 to 5 monolayers. Atomic hydrogen produced by thermal dissociation in a continuous measurement gave minimum-values for the sticking coefficient of 0. 3 for a room temperature film. A summary of results is shown.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Repetitive {{bursting}} instabilities {{with strong}} frequency chirping occur in high beta, beam-heated plasmas with safety factor q> 1 in the DIII-D tokamak. Although the mode structures differ, in many ways, the off-axis fish-bones {{are similar to}} the q = 1 fishbones first observed on the <b>Poloidal</b> <b>Divertor</b> Experiment (PDX). The modes are driven by energetic trapped ions at the fast-ion precession frequency. During a burst, the frequency changes most rapidly as the mode reaches its maximum amplitude. Larger amplitude bursts have larger growth rates and frequency chirps. Unlike PDX fishbones, the decay phase is highly vari-able and is usually shorter than the growth phase. Also, the waveform is highly distorted by higher harmonics during the latter portion of a burst. The radial mode structure alters its shape during the burst. Like PDX fishbones, the modes expel trapped ions in a “beacon ” with a definite phase relationship relative to the mode. Seven types of loss detectors measure the beacon. The losses scale linearly with mode amplitude. The neutron rate changes most rapidly at maximum mode am-plitude but, depending on the loss diagnostic, the losses often peak a few cycles later. The non-ambipolar fast-ion losses cause a sudden change in toroidal rotation frequency across the entire plasma. In addition to an overall drop, the neutron sig-nal oscillates in response to the wave. Unlike the beacon of lost particles, which maintains a fixed phase relative to the mode, the phase of the neutron oscillations steadily increases throughout the burst, with the greatest phase slippage occurring in the highly nonlinear phase near maximum mode amplitude...|$|E
40|$|The {{elements}} of transport into {{and across the}} scrape-off layer in the <b>poloidal</b> <b>divertor</b> tokamak ASDEX Upgrade are analysed for different operational regimes with emphasis on enhanced confinement regimes with an edge barrier. Utilizing the existing set of edge diagnostics, especially the high- resolution multi-pulse edge Thomson scattering system, in combination with long discharge plateaus, radial sweeps and advanced averaging techniques, detailed radial mid-plane profiles of diverted plasmas are obtained. Profiles are smooth across the separatrix, indicating strong radial correlation, {{and there is no}} remarkable variation across the second separatrix either. Together with measured input, recycling, pumping and bypass fluxes, a corrected separatrix position is determined and transport characteristics are derived in the different radial zones generally identified in the profile structure. Transport in the steep gradient region inside and across the separatrix shows typical ballooning-type critical electron pressure gradient scaling and, in parallel, even a clear correlation between radial electron density and temperature decay lengths (e. g. eta(e) = d(ln T) /d(ln n) similar to 2 for type-I ELMy H-modes). These findings indicate the importance of stiff profiles in this region, while diffusion coefficients are secondary parameters, determined essentially by the source distribution. The outer scrape-off layer wing exhibits a more filamentary structure with preferential outward drift especially in high-performance discharges, with formal diffusion coefficients far above the Bohm value in agreement with results on the old ASDEX experiment. A basic mechanism involved there seems to be partial loss of equilibrium and fast curvature-driven outward acceleration, in principle well known from theory, investigated decades ago in pinch experiments and utilized recently in high- field-side pellet fuelling...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the structures of}} the magnetic field induced by the Dynamic Ergodic Divertor (DED), which was recently installed at the TEXTOR tokamak in. Sixteen perturbation coils ergodize the field lines in the plasma edge and destroy the resonant surfaces. This creates an open chaotic system in the plasma edge. The structures of the magnetic field in the ergodic and the laminar region are systematically investigated using a set of codes, called “Atlas”. In Atlas, the field lines are traced using a mapping technique, {{which is based on}} the Hamiltonian formalism. This method is a fast and accurate algorithm to study the stochastic magnetic field lines. Typically, the ergodic region is a mixture of stochastic domains and island chains. The field lines in the stochastic domain have very long connection length and each field line fills the ergodic volume. After many turns around the torus they are deflected toward the divertor wall and leave the ergodic zone via so-called fingers. The field lines in the laminar zone are characterized by their very short connection lengths (compared to the Kolmogorov length) between two intersections with the wall. The structure of the flux tubes in the laminar zone is studied with Atlas. The flux tubes have the stagnation point half way between the intersections. When hitting the wall, they form stripe-like strike zones in front of the DED coils. At higher level of ergodization they split into pairs. In between these pairs, a private flux zones are established. It is shown, that the topology of the laminar zone resembles the structure of the scrape-off layer of the <b>poloidal</b> <b>divertor.</b> The detailed plasma properties (e. g. local density, temperature, flux amplitude and direction) are, however, complicated by the adjacent areas of flux tubes with different connection length. The ergodic and laminar structures in the plasma boundary depend strongly on the global plasma properties, in particular on the safety factor profile and the plasma pressure. These quantities determine the location and the separation of the resonant surfaces. The ergodization is systematically studied by varying the plasma current and poloidal beta. The width and structure of the ergodic and laminar region is a nonlinear function of the global parameters. As general tendency it has been found, that at the higher level of ergodization (i. e. at higher plasma current and lower beta poloidal) the laminar zone is dominant in the perturbed volume, while at lower level of ergodization the ergodic region dominates. Since the plasma pressure influences the pitch of the magnetic flux tubes in front of the DED coils (at constant edge safety factor), the resonance conditions of the flux surfaces vary as well. This leads to a systematic variation of the ergodization level as function of plasma pressure. A thermographic camera was set up and used to validate the predictions made with Atlas. The system measures temperature patterns on the divertor target plates. The heat flux density distribution is strongly non-homogenous, forming the expected stripe-like pattern. One observes four helical strike zones, which are parallel to the divertor coils. The measured patterns are in rather good agreement with the results from the modelling with the Atlas. The variation {{of the structure of the}} heat flux density deposition pattern with the plasma current and poloidal beta is measured. For increasing level of the ergodization the strike zone broadens and at some point splits up as it was predicted with Atlas. The predicted splitting of the divertor strike zones was clearly manifested. Imperfections of the alignment of the divertor target tiles were used to reveal local flux directions; namely, each of the power flux stripe consists of two parts with different direction of incoming heat and particle fluxes...|$|E
