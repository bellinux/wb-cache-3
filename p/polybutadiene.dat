40|$|The {{reactions}} of polymer films with oxygen atoms are reviewed focusing on laboratory tests on <b>polybutadienes</b> with different amount of 1, 4 or 1, 2 double bonds and their polyalkenamer homologues, polyimide (Kapton), {{and a series}} of polyolefines with increasing fluorine content. It is found that etch rates increase with decrease in -CH=CH- unsaturation, starting with 1, 4 -polybutadiene and reaching the maximum rate with polyethylene or ethylene-propylene rubber. IN <b>polybutadienes</b> with both 1, 4 and 1, 2 double bonds, the rate of O(3 P) -induced etching is lower the higher the 1, 2 content. The reactions are confined to the polymer surface...|$|R

25|$|In a 1914 patent, American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard {{suggested}} {{nitrous oxide}} and gasoline as possible propellants for a liquid-fuelled rocket. Nitrous oxide {{has been the}} oxidiser of choice in several hybrid rocket designs (using solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidizer). The combination of nitrous oxide with hydroxyl-terminated <b>polybutadiene</b> fuel {{has been used by}} SpaceShipOne and others. It also is notably used in amateur and high power rocketry with various plastics as the fuel.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also used}} to stain {{copolymers}} preferentially, the best known example being block copolymers where one phase can be stained so as to show the microstructure of the material. For example, styrene-butadiene block copolymers have a central <b>polybutadiene</b> chain with polystyrene end caps. When treated with OsO4, the butadiene matrix reacts preferentially and so absorbs the oxide. The presence of a heavy metal is sufficient to block the electron beam, so the polystyrene domains are seen clearly in thin films in TEM.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{pyrotechnic}} compositions, {{for example}} MTV, give a great flame emission upon combustion and yield a temperature-dependent signature {{and can be}} understood as gray bodies of high emissivity (~0.95). Such payloads are called blackbody payloads. Other payloads, like iron/potassium perchlorate pellets, only yield a low flame emission but also show temperature-dependent signature. Nevertheless, the lower combustion temperature as compared to MTV results in a lower amount of energy released in the short-wavelength IR range. Other blackbody payloads include ammonium perchlorate/anthracene/magnesium and hydroxyl-terminated <b>polybutadiene</b> (HTPB) binder.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{well-defined}} second (G- 2) and third (G- 3) generation dendritic <b>polybutadienes</b> was synthesized {{by combining the}} anionic polymerization high vacuum techniques {{with the use of}} the dual-functional linking agent 4 -(dichloromethylsilyl) diphenylethylene (DCMSDPE). The synthesis of the second generation dendrons involves a) synthesis of macromonomer by selective replacement of the two chlorines of DCMSDPE with PBd by titration, b) addition of s-BuLi to the double bond of the in-chain macromonomer and finally c) polymerization of Bd from the newly created anionic site to create the third arm. The synthesis of the third generation dendrons requires the repetition of the aforementioned procedure two times. The final dendritic polymers were synthesized by coupling of these living dendrons with methyltrichlorosilane. Intermediate and final products were characterized via Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), Membrane Osmometry (MO), Size Exclusion Chromatography equipped with a Two Angles Laser Light Scattering detector (SEC-TALLS) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR). The rheological behavior in the linear region of four of the dendritic <b>polybutadienes</b> was studied and their glass transition temperatures (Tg) ware determined via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). We investigated the hierarchical relaxation process of the dendritic polymers, that is the subsequent relaxation of each generation from the outermost sections towards the centre of the branched tree-like molecules, we examined how it is affected by the number of generations, the length of the branches and the addition of solvent and finally we compared it with the relaxation process of the corresponding linear <b>polybutadienes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} the {{following}} polymers were exposed at ambient temperature to ground-state oxygen atoms (O(3 P)), generated by a radio-frequency glow discharge in O 2 : cis- and trans- 1, 4 -polybutadienes (CB and TB), amorphous 1, 2 -polybutadiene (VB), <b>polybutadienes</b> with different 1, 4 / 1, 2 contents, trans polypentenamer (TP), cis and trans polyoctenamers (CO and TO), and ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM). Transmission infrared spectra of CB and TB films revealed extensive surface recession, or etching, unaccompanied by any microstructural changes within the films, demonstrating that the reactions were confined to the surface layers. Contrary to the report by Rabek, Lucki, and Ranby (1979), there was no O(3 P) -induced cis-trans isomerization in CB or TB. From weight-loss measurements, etch rates for <b>polybutadienes</b> {{were found to be}} markedly dependent on vinyl content, decreasing by two orders of magnitude from CB (2 % 1, 2) to structures with 30 to 40 % 1, 2 double bonds, thereafter increasing by half an order of magnitude to VB (97 % 1, 2). Relative etch rates for EMP and the polyalkenamers were in the order: EMP is greater than CO (or TO) is greater than TP is greater than CB. The sole non-elastomer examined, TB, had an etch rate about six times that of CB, ascribable to a morphology difference. Cis/trans content had a negligible effect on the etch rate of the polyalkenamers. Mechanisms involving crosslinking through units are proposed for the unexpected protection imparted to <b>polybutadienes</b> by the 1, 2 double bonds...|$|R
25|$|Several other {{copolymers}} {{are also}} used with styrene. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or ABS plastic is similar to HIPS: a copolymer of acrylonitrile and styrene, toughened with <b>polybutadiene.</b> Most electronics cases are made of this form of polystyrene, as are many sewer pipes. SAN is a copolymer of styrene with acrylonitrile, and SMA one with maleic anhydride. Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers; for example, divinylbenzene {{can be used for}} cross-linking the polystyrene chains to give the polymer used in Solid phase peptide synthesis.|$|E
500|$|They {{are widely}} used to prevent the {{oxidative}} degradation of polymers such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and <b>polybutadiene,</b> are especially susceptible to oxidation and ozonolysis. They can be protected by antiozonants. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a [...] "crazy paving" [...] effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned {{at right angles to}} the tensile strain in the product. [...] Oxidation and UV degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because UV radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in low-density polyethylene.|$|E
2500|$|Pure {{polystyrene}} is brittle, {{but hard}} enough that a fairly high-performance product {{can be made}} by giving it some of the properties of a stretchier material, such as <b>polybutadiene</b> rubber. The two such materials can never normally be mixed because of the small mixing entropy of polymers (see Flory-Huggins solution theory), but if <b>polybutadiene</b> is added during polymerisation it can become chemically bonded to the polystyrene, forming a graft copolymer, which helps to incorporate normal <b>polybutadiene</b> into the final mix, resulting in high-impact polystyrene or HIPS, often called [...] "high-impact plastic" [...] in advertisements. One commercial name for HIPS is Bextrene. Common applications of HIPS include toys and product casings. HIPS is usually injection molded in production. Autoclaving polystyrene can compress and harden the material.|$|E

40|$|Industrial <b>polybutadienes</b> {{synthesized}} by Ziegler-Natta catalysts may exhibit {{very high}} molar masses, significant degrees of branching, and gel species. Such samples {{were analyzed by}} size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF 4). Both fractionation techniques were coupled to a multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector {{as well as a}} refractive index (RI) detector. The initial results obtained from SEC measurements completely contradicted the processing behavior of the materials. SEC seemed not to be suitable for accurate characterization of these materials. SEC separation was strongly influenced by coelution of linear (low molar mass) and branched (high molar mass) macromolecules, shear degradation of the larger macromolecules, and filtration of the gel fraction. For this reason the <b>polybutadienes</b> were subsequently analyzed by AF 4 in order to compare the results and identify the limitations of SEC. The results showed that, as a specialized tool, AF 4 can be used for the extended and more accurate analysis of synthetic rubber materials, {{especially in the case of}} very high molar masses. SEC is not suitable for such samples because it does not properly address the high molar mass fraction and the branched macromolecules. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R
