5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> clergy. During the 13th century, two events {{happened}} that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of legal education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} hours of March28, 2000, a {{powerful}} F3 tornado struck downtown Fort Worth, Texas, United States and adjacent areas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers {{as well as}} two deaths. The tornado {{was part of a larger}} severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> moist and unstable atmospheric environment over the South Central United States as a result of an eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well-forecasted by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came into focus on March28 as the conditions favorable for tornadic development quickly took hold.|$|E
5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. The initial action was fought <b>primarily</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action.|$|E
