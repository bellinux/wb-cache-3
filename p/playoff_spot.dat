5|$|The 1979 team {{not only}} posted their first winning record, but earned a <b>playoff</b> <b>spot</b> {{by winning the}} NFC Central {{division}} title. The <b>playoff</b> <b>spot</b> was secured in the final week in a rain-sodden game against the Kansas City Chiefs, with the only score being a 19-yard field goal by Neil O'Donoghue. They then recorded their first-ever playoff win by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles behind Bell's 142 yards rushing. Tampa Bay hosted the 1979 NFC Championship Game the following week, but lost 9–0 to the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{missed the}} playoffs entirely in 1969–70, losing the last <b>playoff</b> <b>spot</b> in the East on a tiebreaker. On {{the last day}} of the season, New York {{defeated}} the Red Wings 9–5, tying Montreal in points and obtaining a five-goal lead on the Canadiens in total goals scored for the season. Montreal needed to win its game against the Black Hawks, or score at least five goals to qualify for the postseason. Trailing 5–2 with eight minutes to play, head coach Claude Ruel pulled his goaltender for an extra skater and watched Montreal surrender five empty net goals while scoring none to lose the game 10–2 and the final <b>playoff</b> <b>spot</b> to the Rangers. It was the only time between 1948 and 1995 that the Canadiens failed to make the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Entering April, the Capitals had {{a chance}} to clinch a <b>playoff</b> <b>spot</b> against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The game was tied 2–2 with 1:03 {{remaining}} when Steven Stamkos scored, leading Tampa to the eventual 4–2 victory. Facing the Division-leading Panthers in their next game, Washington succeeded in clinching a <b>playoff</b> <b>spot</b> with a 4–2 win of their own. The victory also gave the Capitals a chance at winning their Division in their final game. During the game, Neuvirth was hurt when former Capital Marco Sturm fell on top of him while he was making a save. Neuvirth left after the incident and did not return. Neuvirth suffered a lower body injury and was not ready to return for the final game or the start of the playoffs. Washington won its final game of the year behind a 35-save performance from Holtby, clinching at least the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference pending the outcome of Florida’s game. A win by the Panthers in their final game, however, prevented Washington from winning their fifth-straight Division title and moving into the third playoff seed.|$|E
