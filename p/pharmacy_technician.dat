25|$|A <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>Technician</b> in the UK has {{recently}} been referred to {{by some as a}} professional. Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician's activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy premises.|$|E
25|$|Script Pro {{manufactures}} a robot {{designed to}} help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form. The pharmacist or <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technician</b> enters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining {{whether or not the}} drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined {{by the size of the}} pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient's medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it's the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up. The robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: It {{has been}} {{reported}} that supportive personnel, such as <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians,</b> are key participants in the use of health information technology. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe how <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> use e-prescribing and to explore the characteristics of technicians that support pharmacists in ensuring patient safety. Methods: This was a qualitative study that used observations, interviews, and focus groups to understand the role of <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> in e-prescribing. Fourteen <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> and 13 pharmacists from five community pharmacies participated. Observations lasted about nine hours in each pharmacy. Follow-up interviews and two separate focus groups were later conducted. Observation field notes and audio recordings were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Results: <b>Pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> were primarily responsible for all steps leading up to pharmacist review of the e-prescription and dispensing of medications to the patient. Technician characteristics, including experience, certification status, and knowledge of appropriate medication use, were reported as important factors in supporting a pharmacist’s role in ensuring patient safety with the use of e-prescribing. Conclusion: Study findings indicate that <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> have an important role in supporting pharmacists to prevent medication errors. Certain characteristics of <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> were identified with the potential to improve the e-prescription medication dispensing process and decrease patient harm through the identification and resolution of errors...|$|R

For example, a hospital corpsman who completes Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) and earns the NEC HM-8404, moves that NEC to primary and has a secondary NEC of HM-0000. If that hospital corpsman attends a [...] "C" [...] School, then the NEC earned at the [...] "C" [...] School becomes their primary and HM-8404 becomes the secondary. Some hospital corpsmen go on to receive more specialized training in roles such as medical laboratory technician, radiology technician, aerospace medicine specialist, <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technician,</b> operating room technician, etc. This advanced education is done through [...] "C" [...] schools, which confer additional NECs.

40|$|Objective: Product Information Leaflets (PILs) are an {{important}} source of information for patients on their medication, but may cause confusion and questions. Patients then may seek clarification, for instance from <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} explore which questions <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> get about PIL-related issues, why and when, and how they handle such questions. Methods: an online survey in a panel of 785 Dutch <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians.</b> Key results: Net response rate was 37 %. PIL-related questions frequently concerned drug actions, problems with use, side effects, intolerances and pregnancy and lactation. Patients who received generic alternatives instead of the branded product they had received previously, also came more often to pharmacy staff with PIL-related questions. The requested information could not always be found in the PIL itself, not even by the <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> themselves. They mentioned that the PIL is not easy to read, understand or recall. Conclusions: Pharmacy staff is often approached by patients having difficulties in understanding PILs.

Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted among community pharmacists and <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> in the capital of Yemen, Sana’a. A total of 289 community pharmacies were randomly selected. The validated and pilot-tested questionnaire consisted of six sections: demographic data, knowledge about pharmacovigilance, experience with ADR reporting, attitudes toward ADR reporting, and the facilitators to improve ADR reporting. Results: A total of 428 <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> and pharmacists were contacted and 179 went on to complete a questionnaire (response rate: 41. 8 %). Of the 179 respondents, 21 (11. 7 %) were pharmacists and 158 (88. 3 %) were <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians,</b> of which, 176 (98. 3 %) were male and 3 (1. 7 %) were female. The mean age of the respondents was 25. 87 ± 2. 63 years. There was a significant difference between the pharmacists and <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> in terms of knowledge scores (P< 0. 05). The mean knowledge scores for pharmacists was 3. 33 ± 2. 852 compared to 0. 15 ± 0. 666 for <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians.</b> With regard to attitudes toward ADR reporting, all pharmacists (100 %) showed a positive attitude, while only 43 % of <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> showed a positive attitude. Conclusion: Pharmacists have a significantly better knowledge than <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> with regard to pharmacovigilance. More than half of <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> showed a negative attitude toward ADR reporting. Therefore, educational interventions and training is very important for community pharmacists and <b>pharmacy</b> <b>technicians</b> in Yemen to increase their awareness and participation in ADR reporting.
