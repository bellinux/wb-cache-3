50|$|In economics, <b>profit</b> in the {{accounting}} {{sense of the}} excess of revenue over cost {{is the sum of}} two components: normal <b>profit</b> and economic <b>profit.</b> Normal <b>profit</b> is the <b>profit</b> that is necessary to just cover the opportunity costs of the owner-manager or of the firm's investors. In the absence of this much <b>profit,</b> these parties would withdraw their time and funds from the firm and use them to better advantage elsewhere. In contrast, economic <b>profit,</b> sometimes called excess <b>profit,</b> is <b>profit</b> in excess of what is required to cover the opportunity costs.|$|R

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, stimulated by the railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas <b>profiting</b> from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to income tax, companies were also {{subject to a}} <b>profits</b> tax, which was deducted from company <b>profits</b> when determining the income tax liability. It was a differential tax, with a higher tax rate on dividends (<b>profits</b> distributed to shareholders) than on <b>profits</b> retained within the company. By penalising the distribution of <b>profits,</b> it was hoped companies would retain <b>profits</b> for investment, which was considered a priority after the Second World War. The tax {{did not have the}} desired effect, so the distributed <b>profits</b> tax was increased by 20% by the post-war Labour government to encourage companies to retain more of their <b>profits.</b> At the time of Hugh Gaitskell's 1951 budget, the <b>profits</b> tax was 50% for distributed <b>profits</b> and 10% for undistributed <b>profits.</b>|$|R

40|$|On the {{traditional}} microeconomic theory, firms {{are supposed to}} maximise the aggregate pure <b>profit.</b> We study other objective functions which are ratios <b>profit</b> over capital.

The cases of monopoly with variable coefficient of capital, monopoly with fix coefficient of capital, competition with fix coefficient of capital, are studied. The solutions given by the maximisation of the aggregate pure <b>profit</b> and the maximisation of the rate o f <b>profit</b> are compared. We conclude to a usually lower volume of production with the maximisation of the rate o f <b>profit.</b> Thus, as firms are smaller, competition may be greater; however the clearing of the market must be studied; in competition at the very long term, with the rate o f <b>profit</b> maximisation, the pure <b>profit</b> remain positive. 26 pages, figures, graphique...|$|R

5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from <b>profiting</b> from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the second round, {{as one of the}} 22 teams from the Football League First Division. They were drawn against Doncaster Rovers; the first leg was staged at Belle Vue on 23 September 1987. Arsenal eased to a 3–0 win, with goals from Perry Groves, Alan Smith and Steve Williams. A fortnight later, midfielder David Rocastle scored the only goal in the second leg to give Arsenal a 4–0 aggregate scoreline win. Bournemouth were Arsenal's opponents in the third round. The match was played at Highbury on 27 October 1987. Arsenal needed 33 minutes to open the scoring, when Michael Thomas converted a penalty kick. Smith extended their lead and in the second half, Kevin Richardson scored Arsenal's third, <b>profiting</b> from a mix-up between the Bournemouth defenders. The win was Arsenal's tenth in succession at Highbury, setting a new club record in the process.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people <b>profiting</b> from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road trip across the United States, speaking out to people in towns {{about the state of}} the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Outmaneuvering the {{opposition}} of Vogoride and his group of conservative followers during new elections for the Divan, Kogălniceanu was able to promote Cuza in Moldavia on January 17, 1859, leading to Cuza's election for a similar position in Wallachia (February 5)—the de facto union {{of the two countries}} as the United Principalities. In October 1858, he made a clear proposal regarding the unification, which, as he noted, carried the vote with only two opposing voices (Alecu Balș and Nectarie Hermeziu, the Orthodox vicar of Roman Bishopric), being publicly acclaimed by Ion Roată, the peasant representative for Putna County. During 1859, Kogălniceanu again stood in the ad hoc Divan and rallied support for Cuza from all factions of the unionist camp, while promoting his candidature in Bucharest—thus <b>profiting</b> from ambiguities in the Paris Treaty. On the day Cuza took the throne, to begin his rule as Domnitor, Mihail Kogălniceanu welcomed him with an emotional speech.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges had two more {{children}} and settled in Paris and Normandy, <b>profiting</b> from their celebrity with gifts and investments. In 1390, Carrouges was promoted to a chevalier d'honneur as a bodyguard of the King, a title which came with a substantial financial stipend and was a position of important social standing. The following year he was dispatched to Hungary {{on a mission to}} investigate the severity of the threat from the Ottoman Empire, the boundaries of which had been steadily spreading under Sultan Bayezid I. In this mission he was second in command to Jean de Boucicant, a Marshal of France and famous soldier, indicating the elevated social position Carrouges enjoyed following the duel.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} was never financially stable and had difficulty <b>profiting</b> from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model {{based on the}} socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing The Harbinger as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, the {{community was}} financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands. Nathaniel Hawthorne was {{a founding member of}} Brook Farm, though he was not a strong adherent of the community's ideals. He later fictionalized his experience in his novel The Blithedale Romance (1852).|$|E
5|$|The current Raglan Castle {{was begun}} by Sir William ap Thomas, the lesser {{son of a}} minor Welsh family who rose {{through the ranks of}} mid-15th century politics, <b>profiting</b> from the {{benefits}} of the local offices he held. William married first Elizabeth, a wealthy heiress, and then Gwladus ap Thomas, another heiress who would prove to be a powerful regional figure in her own right. In 1432 William purchased the manor of Raglan, where he had already been staying as a tenant, for 1,000 marks (£666) and commenced a programme of building work that established the basic shape of the castle as seen today, although most of it— {{with the exception of the}} South Gate and the Great Tower— was later built over.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{following}} questions associated with outsourcing and <b>profit</b> sharing under imperfect labour markets.

What {{is the relationship between}} outsourcing, <b>profit</b> sharing, and equilibrium unemployment depending on whether in other industries <b>profit</b> share is or is {{not a part of the}} compensation scheme. What is the optimal production mode in terms of strategic outsourcing. We find that if firms will decide on <b>profit</b> sharing before the wage formation, higher outsourcing decreases wage whereas <b>profit</b> sharing has an ambiguous effect. Under flexible <b>profit</b> sharing wage is higher if optimal <b>profit</b> share is small enough. For equilibrium unemployment, we find that if there is no <b>profit</b> sharing in other industries, outsourcing will decrease the unemployment rate.
