25|$|The fishing schooner, Elizabeth W. Hunan, was {{the last}} of a series of five vessels built for the Nunan family, which ran a fishing {{enterprise}} out of Cape Porpoise, Maine. The 96-foot auxiliary <b>powered</b> <b>vessel</b> was launched in 1908 and reportedly was in service for 30 years. It had an 80-horsepower Globe auxiliary engine, which could propel her at 9 miles per hour.|$|E
25|$|Ebersole {{entered the}} U.S. Navy in July 1948 and trained in undersea medicine. As a future {{submarine}} doctor, Ebersole received extensive nuclear training. From 1949 to 1959, Ebersole {{was associated with}} nuclear submarines and had special training in nuclear physics at Duke University and at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Ebersole was commissioned in the U.S. Navy and served on the USS Nautilus (SSN-571) and the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), the first two nuclear submarines. Ebersole was selected by Admiral Rickover as the medical officer for the USS Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine and served under commanding officer Commander Eugene Parks Wilkinson. Ebersole {{was a member of}} the launching crew for the USS Nautilus. He went on to serve as medical officer aboard the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), the second nuclear submarine for the U.S. Navy. Ebersole was the first person to serve on more than one nuclear <b>powered</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E

25|$|Technologies {{that contributed}} to the {{collapse}} of Atlantic Cod include engine <b>power</b> <b>vessels</b> and frozen food compartments aboard ships. Engine <b>power</b> <b>vessels</b> had larger nets, larger engines, and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave an edge to catching and detecting fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom-trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of Atlantic Cod. They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.|$|R

2500|$|On 27 October 1964, USS Seadragon {{became the}} first nuclear <b>powered</b> <b>vessel</b> to visit Hong Kong. This was {{followed}} shortly by an historic entry into Japanese waters and a port visit to Sasebo, Japan, on 12 November 1964. The visit was protested by China and the Soviet Union; the Soviets in particular warned that the visit would eventually lead {{to the introduction of}} nuclear weapons to Japan and alter the security status quo in East Asia. On 4 March 1965, she returned to Pearl Harbor. Again, in the fall of 1966 and early 1967, SEADRAGON {{became the first}} SSN to visit Yokosuka, Japan. She was the first nuclear <b>powered</b> <b>vessel</b> the Japanese government permitted to enter her home waters. This achievement has since often been compared with Commodore PERRY's first expedition to Japan in 1853 as an achievement in international diplomacy. SEADRAGON again set the standard by being the first SSN to visit Hobart, Australia in January 1983. [...] In twenty-four years of active service, SEADRAGON steamed over 200,000 miles, dove and surfaced 1800 times, made thirteen deployments to the Western Pacific, and conducted four under ice operations. SEADRAGON was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. The ship was overhauled three times, refueling at each overhaul. Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard was her home for all the overhauls and performed the inactivation commencing 1 October 1983. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, which she visited on occasional trips to the North Polar region, performed the recycling.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantages}} of an SSN over a conventionally powered SSK are much longer endurance (limited {{more by the}} crew than the boat, a nuclear submarine can stay submerged for months and does not need refueling in their 25-year lifespans), and higher speed. Unlike most SSKs, SSNs {{do not have to}} surface periodically for air, which would compromise their stealth. Some of the newest conventional submarines approach these advantages: Stirling engine <b>powered</b> <b>vessels</b> can cruise underwater for up to two weeks and, like diesel/electric vessels (and in theory LOX <b>powered</b> <b>vessels),</b> are significantly quieter than nuclear submarines, since they do not need to run the powerful (and noisy) pumps associated with the cooling circuits of pressurized water reactors.|$|R
50|$|Shore power saves {{consumption}} of fuel {{that would otherwise}} be used to <b>power</b> <b>vessels</b> while in port, and eliminates the air pollution associated with {{consumption of}} that fuel.
