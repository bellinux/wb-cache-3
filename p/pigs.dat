5|$|Guinea <b>pigs</b> do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea <b>pigs</b> with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea <b>pigs</b> as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea <b>pigs</b> and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea <b>pigs</b> and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea <b>pigs</b> are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E

5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea <b>pigs</b> have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea <b>pigs</b> may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea <b>pigs</b> have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of livestock breeds {{plays an important}} role in livestock production, but the significant loss of breeds is threatening {{genetic diversity}} of farm animal genetic resources (AnGR). The Weitzman approach which was accepted as a framework for assessment of genetic diversity on AnGR was exploited. In this study, several measurement indexes of genetic diversity, involving total genetic diversity, contributions of each breed to the total diversity, marginal diversities, conservation potential, were calculated based on microsatellite marker data of 20 Central-China type <b>pig</b> populations. Total genetic diversity of twenty Central-China <b>pig</b> breeds was 11, 707 and expected diversity was 66. 96 % of the total genetic diversity. Jinhua <b>pig</b> had the greatest contribution to overall genetic diversity (8. 90 %), followed by Wannan Spotted <b>pig</b> (7. 46 %), Shengxian Spotted <b>pig</b> (7. 40 %), and Leping <b>pig</b> (7. 04 %). Jinhua <b>pig</b> also had the highest conservation potential (783. 53), followed by Shengxian Spotted <b>pig</b> (454. 53), Hang <b>pig</b> (366. 68), and Large Black-White <b>pig</b> (343. 17).

This {{may be the result}} of conflicting attitudes toward <b>pig</b> husbandry between citizens and other stakeholders. To obtain knowledge about these attitudes, the objectives of this study were (1) to determine and compare attitudes of various stakeholders toward animals, humans and the environment in the context of <b>pig</b> husbandry and (2) to determine and compare the acceptability of publically discussed issues related to <b>pig</b> husbandry of various stakeholders. A questionnaire was distributed to citizens, conventional <b>pig</b> farmers, organic <b>pig</b> farmers, <b>pig</b> husbandry advisors and <b>pig</b> veterinarians. Respondents could indicate their attitude toward aspects related to animals, humans and the environment in the context of <b>pig</b> husbandry and they could indicate their opinion about the acceptability of issues of <b>pig</b> husbandry, e. g. piglet mortality and inside <b>pig</b> housing.

Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea <b>pigs</b> have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
5|$|Guinea <b>pigs</b> (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea <b>pigs</b> require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as <b>pigs</b> and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea <b>pigs</b> for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E

5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green <b>pigs.</b> In each stage of the gameplay, enemy <b>pigs</b> are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the <b>pigs</b> on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy <b>pigs</b> directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the <b>pigs.</b> The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach <b>pigs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea <b>pigs</b> cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea <b>pigs</b> do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea <b>pigs</b> require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea <b>pigs</b> require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea <b>pigs</b> tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea <b>pigs</b> feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents.
