25|$|Because of the inverse-square law {{in radio}} communications, the digital data rates {{used in the}} downlinks from the Voyagers have been {{continually}} decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then. Some measures were taken on the ground {{along the way to}} reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three main <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> antennas of the Deep Space Network were increased from 64m to 70m, dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{principal}} sensor was an Ericsson PS 37 X-band monopulse radar, {{which used}} a mechanically steered <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> {{housed in a}} radome. This radar performed several functions, including air-to-ground and air-to-air telemetry, search, track, terrain-avoidance and cartography. On the JA 37 fighter-interceptor model, the PS 37 radar {{was replaced by the}} more capable Ericsson PS 46 X-band pulse repetition frequency, which had an all-weather look-down/shoot-down capability reportedly in excess of 50 kilometers and continuous-wave illumination for the Skyflash missiles as well as the ability to track two targets while scanning. According to Ericsson, it had a 50 per cent chance of spotting a low-flying McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II within a single scan and possessed a high level of resistance to interference from ECM.|$|E

25|$|CSP-Stirling {{is known}} to have the highest {{efficiency}} of all solar technologies (around 30%, compared to solar photovoltaic's approximately 15%), and is predicted to be able to produce the cheapest energy among all renewable energy sources in high-scale production and hot areas, semi-deserts, etc. A dish Stirling system uses a large, reflective, <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> (similar in shape to a satellite television dish). It focuses all the sunlight that strikes the dish up onto a single point above the dish, where a receiver captures the heat and transforms it into a useful form. Typically the dish is coupled with a Stirling engine in a Dish-Stirling System, but also sometimes a steam engine is used. These create rotational kinetic energy that can be converted to electricity using an electric generator.|$|E
25|$|Many other solar kitchens in India {{use another}} unique concentrating {{technology}} {{known as the}} Scheffler reflector. This technology was first developed by Wolfgang Scheffler in 1986. A Scheffler reflector is a <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> that uses single axis tracking to follow the Sun's daily course. These reflectors have a flexible reflective surface that is able to change its curvature to adjust to seasonal variations in the incident angle of sunlight. Scheffler reflectors {{have the advantage of}} having a fixed focal point which improves the ease of cooking and are able to reach temperatures of 450-650°C. Built in 1999 by the Brahma Kumaris, the world's largest Scheffler reflector system in Abu Road, Rajasthan India is capable of cooking up to 35,000 meals a day. By early 2008, over 2000 large cookers of the Scheffler design had been built worldwide.|$|E
25|$|A {{parabolic}} antenna is an antenna {{that uses a}} parabolic reflector, a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish.</b> The main advantage of a {{parabolic antenna}} {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. Parabolic antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the parabolic reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so parabolic antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E

25|$|The {{system worked}} by having two dipole antennas instead of one, {{slightly}} offset {{on either side}} of the mounting mast projecting through the middle of the <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish.</b> Being offset, the beams produced by the two dipoles were angled away from each other, to either side of the dish centreline. Normally the signals from both were added together and displayed, producing an output largely identical to the single-dipole case. The dipole shaft was mounted on another motor that rapidly spun them at 800rpm. A switch was placed so that it was triggered by the motor when the dipoles were roughly vertical or roughly horizontal, triggering a second circuit that subtracted the signals from each other instead of adding. The result was the difference in signal strength, which indicated which of the two dipoles was receiving more energy at that instant. This signal was fed into the scanner motors, driving it in the right direction.|$|E
25|$|Terry Nation's {{original}} plan {{was for the}} Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon castors, propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios, for The Dalek Invasion of Earth Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed {{on the streets of}} London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature tricycles with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base. The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and {{it was not possible to}} remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish</b> was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on static electricity drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.|$|E

500|$|Solar concentrating {{technologies}} such as <b>parabolic</b> <b>dish,</b> trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400kW of electricity plus thermal {{energy in the form}} of 401kW steam and 468kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage.
