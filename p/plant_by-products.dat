40|$|Recycling {{of steel}} <b>plant</b> <b>by-products</b> is a {{critical}} area that needs careful assessment and development if the integrated steel plant is to remain environmentally and economically sustainable into the future. A research program is being embarked upon in the Australian Steel Research Hub with aims to realise {{the value of the}} by-products to the Australian Steel industry and minimise volumes being stockpiled.

In this paper, microscopy (SEM and EDS analysis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of a by-product material are presented and discussed with a view of understanding the behaviour of the material in use and on plant and its limits for further processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{recycling}} of steel <b>plant</b> <b>by-products</b> {{is a critical}} issue that needs thorough assessment and development for the sustainability of the integrated steel plant, from both environmental and economical perspectives. Research is being undertaken in the Steel Research Hub that aims to realise the value of by-products to the Australian steel industry and minimise the amount of by-product going to long term stockpile. As the first step, dust from basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS), a major steel plant by-product stream, is being characterised so that its potential use on plant or elsewhere can be assessed and evaluated. BOS dust contains components including iron, flux and zinc units, which have value on plant and elsewhere. Realising this value by recycling or other processing will help to minimise emissions and reduce costs by replacement of raw materials. However, some components, such as zinc, can {{limit the amount of}} possible recycling within the steel manufacturing process, causing both process and/or occupational health and safety issues. In this paper, characterisation of the BOS dust by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential calorimetry (DSC) is presented and discussed with a view of understanding the behaviour of the materials in use and on plant and its limits for further processing...|$|E
30|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{sustainable}} agricultural practices can supply synergies that limit serious effects of the climate change. The report of the FAO stated that sustainable agriculture helps to counteract climate change by restoring soil organic matter content as well as reducing soil erosion and improving soil physical structure (Scialabba and Hattam 2002). Furthermore, global warming increases the rate of soil organic matter mineralization. The evidence for increased carbon sequestration in organic soils seems clear: the addition of manures, compost, mulches, and cover crops restored organic matter (Mae-Wan and Li Ching 2008). Enormous quantities of vegetable wastes are produced annually from the horticultural industries. Composting can be a feasible treatment to stabilize horticultural wastes and, thus, to improve their properties for use as organic fertilizers (Gavilanes et al. 2016). The organic agricultural waste from animal breeding and horticultural production consist mainly of (1) cattle manure and (2) crop residues. The crop residues are considered as <b>plant</b> <b>by-products</b> (Ballerini 2006). In the Souss-Massa region (South Western Morocco), the production of such plant by-product has reached 406, 045 tons·year− 1 (ORMVA/SM 2009). The development of the agricultural production can cause several types of pollution (Elasri and Afilal 2016). Those agricultural wastes, which are not well managed, can lead to serious sanitary and environmental complications, such as soil, air, and groundwater pollution. The good management of those wastes would be an effective means of organic matter restoration through carbon restitution of the depleted soils through organic amendments.|$|E

Therefore, finding alternative use of this waste material and its use in construction is one of the effective methods of utilization. Increase in demand and decrease in natural resource of fine aggregate (e.g., sand) for construction have resulted in the need of identifying a new source of fine aggregate. The possibility of utilization of thermal power <b>plant</b> <b>by-product</b> pond ash as replacement to find aggregate in construction is taken into consideration (Kim et al. 2014 and Do et al. 2015).

30|$|The pretreated liquids and {{extracts}} studied thus exhibited {{antibacterial properties}} towards the LAB, {{which is one}} of the major bacterial contaminant in the yeast fermentations. These extracts also showed not to inhibit the yeast growth, which makes the samples a potential candidate to replace the commercial antibiotics in yeast fermentation industries. These alternate antimicrobials could control the after effects of misusing the antibiotics in industries, such as emergence of antimicrobial resistant microbes to some extent. Antibacterial properties of A.marina has been proven against urinary tract infection bacterial pathogens by (Ravikumar et al. 2010) and against Staphylococcus aureus by (Dhayanithi et al. 2012); however, no study has been carried out against the LAB contaminants. Similarly, Al-Zoreky and Al-Taher (2015) demonstrated the antibacterial activity of the spathe of the date palm against food borne pathogens and Kchaou et al. (2016) studied the antibacterial property of second grade extracts of date palm against human pathogens. No antibacterial property of the halophytes S.bigelovii and S.sinus persica against LAB has been reported before. Other plant derived compounds which have proven to prevent contamination include essential oils. Neyret et al.

Methods Twenty seven steers (body weight = 573 ± 57 kg) were randomly divided into three treatments with a control group and two tested groups as follows: control, 1, 000 g/kg TMR; treatment 1 (MPBP 30), 970 g/kg TMR and 30 g/kg MPBP; treatment 2 (MPBP 50), 950 g/kg TMR and 50 g/kg MPBP. Results Average daily gain, feed conversion ratio and the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage L* of muscle were improved (p< 0. 05, respectively) by MPBP 30. Stearic acid (C 18 : 0) was decreased (linear effect, p = 0. 012), while oleic acid (C 18 : 1) was increased (linear effect, p = 0. 055) by MPBP level. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) were decreased for MPBP 50 while unsaturated fatty acid (USFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) were increased for MPBP 50. USFA and SFA ratio was increased for MPBP 50 as well. Conclusion These results indicated that MPBP supplementation in Hanwoo steers fed a TMR increased feed efficiency and meat color (lightness) with altering fatty acid proportions.

Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were prepared by adding three levels of PBM at 0, 5 and 10 % and two levels of BC at 0 and 4 %. Triplicate groups of juvenile amberjack (3. 00 g, 20 fish per tank) were fed the respective test diets twice daily to apparent satiation for 45 days. Results indicated that PBM had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on growth performance and feed utilization of fish. Inclusion of BC significantly (P< 0. 05) improved the performance of fish. However, no interaction was found between PBM and BC. Survival was not affected by PBM, BC or their interaction. Whole body proximate composition was also significantly influenced by BC supplementation. Blood chemistry showed some differences but the values were comparable among the dietary groups. The present study demonstrated that BC supplementation is effective for improving the utilization of a plant by-product mixture in low fishmeal and comparatively higher level of plant protein based diet for juvenile amberjack. It is assuming that BC could absorb the noxious substances present in PBM which might improve the utilization of diets. Based on the present experiment, it is concluded that 5 - 10 % PBM along with 4 % BC in 25 % fishmeal based diet is effective supplementation for better performances of juvenile amberjack. ...|$|E
40|$|Plants, {{animals and}} {{micro-organisms}} represent {{a reservoir of}} natural products, the so called “natural source-derived compounds”. This is particularly true for the plant kingdom, as it {{offers a variety of}} species still used as remedies for several diseases {{in many parts of the}} world. Nevertheless, the bioactive potential of many plant species remains largely unexplored. Thus, biodiversity represents an unlimited source of chemical entities with potential beneficial effects on human health. These compounds are usually secondary metabolites often present in low quantity in plant material and their extraction, purification and quantitation still remain a great challenge for analytical scientists. The research activity carried out during these three years of PhD Programme was focused on the development, validation and application of original methods aimed at the quali-quantitative analysis of compounds with potential bioactive interest in plant matrices, foods, drinks and related products, as well as the analytical screening of <b>plant</b> <b>by-products</b> from cosmetic manufacture. Bioactive substances, belonging to the classes of polyphenols, aminoacids, coumarins, triterpenes and phytohormones, have been investigated as authenticity markers, in order to identify high quality products and to valorise niche products.

Twenty seven steers (body weight [BW], 573 ± 57 kg) were assigned to 3 treatment groups so that each treatment based on BW contained 9 animals. All groups received ad libitum TMR throughout the feeding trial until slaughter (from 24 to 30 months of age) and treatments were as follows: control, 1, 000 g/kg TMR; treatment 1 (T 1), 970 g/kg TMR and 30 g/kg MPB; treatment 2 (T 2), 950 g/kg TMR and 50 g/kg MPB. Initial and final BW were not different among treatments. Resultant data were analyzed using general linear models of SAS. Average daily gain and feed efficiency were higher (p< 0. 05) for T 1 than control, but {{there was no difference between}} control and T 2. Plasma albumin showed low-, intermediate- and high-level (p< 0. 05) for control, T 1 and T 2, whereas non-esterified fatty acid was high-, intermediate- and high-level (p< 0. 05) for control, T 1 and T 2, respectively. Carcass weight, carcass rate, backfat thickness and rib eye muscle area were not affected by MPB supplementation, whereas quality and yield grades were highest (p< 0. 05) for T 1 and T 2, respectively. Daily feed costs were decreased by 0. 5 % and 0. 8 % and carcass prices were increased by 18. 1 % and 7. 6 % for T 1 and T 2 compared to control, resulting from substituting TMR with 30 and 50 g/kg MPB, respectively.

40|$|The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the Department of Energy-National Energy Technologies Laboratory (DOE-NETL) are {{evaluating}} {{and demonstrating}} integration of terrestrial carbon sequestration techniques at a coal-fired {{electric power plant}} {{through the use of}} Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) system gypsum as a soil amendment and mulch, and coal fly ash pond process water for periodic irrigation. From January to March 2002, the Project Team initiated the construction of a 40 ha Carbon Capture and Water Emissions Treatment System (CCWESTRS) near TVA's Paradise Fossil Plant on marginally reclaimed surface coal mine lands in Kentucky. The CCWESTRS is growing commercial grade trees and cover crops and is expected to sequester 1. 5 - 2. 0 MT/ha carbon per year over a 20 -year period. The concept could be used to meet a portion of the timber industry's needs while simultaneously sequestering carbon in lands which would otherwise remain non-productive. The CCWESTRS includes a constructed wetland to enhance the ability to sequester carbon and to remove any nutrients and metals present in the coal fly ash process water runoff. The CCWESTRS project is a cooperative effort between TVA, EPRI, and DOE-NETL, with a total budget of $ 1, 574, 000. The proposed demonstration project began in October 2000 and has continued through December 2005. Additional funding is being sought in order to extend the project. The primary goal of the project is to determine if integrating power plant processes with carbon sequestration techniques will enhance carbon sequestration cost-effectively. This goal is consistent with DOE objectives to provide economically competitive and environmentally safe options to offset projected growth in U. S. baseline emissions of greenhouse gases after 2010, achieve the long-term goal of $ 10 /ton of avoided net costs for carbon sequestration, and provide half of the required reductions in global greenhouse gases by 2025. Other potential benefits of the demonstration include developing a passive technology for water treatment for trace metal and nutrient release reductions, using power <b>plant</b> <b>by-products</b> to improve coal mine land reclamation and carbon sequestration, developing wildlife habitat and green-space around production facilities, generating Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) credits for the use of process water, and producing wood products for use by the lumber and pulp and paper industry. Project activities conducted during the five year project period include: Assessing tree cultivation and other techniques used to sequester carbon; Project site assessment; Greenhouse studies to determine optimum plant species and by-product application; Designing, constructing, operating, monitoring, and evaluating the CCWESTRS system; and Reporting (ongoing). The ability of the system to sequester carbon will be the primary measure of effectiveness, measured by accessing survival and growth response of plants within the CCWESTRS. In addition, costs associated with design, construction, and monitoring will be evaluated and compared to projected benefits of other carbon sequestration technologies. The test plan involves the application of three levels each of two types of power <b>plant</b> <b>by-products</b> [...] three levels of FGD gypsum mulch, and three levels of ash pond irrigation water. This design produces nine treatment levels which are being tested with two species of hardwood trees (sweet gum and sycamore). The project is examining the effectiveness of applications of 0, 8 -cm, and 15 -cm thick gypsum mulch layers and 0, 13 cm, and 25 cm of coal fly ash water for irrigation. Each treatment combination is being replicated three times, resulting in a total of 54 treatment plots (3 FGD gypsum levels X 3 irrigation water levels x 2 tree species x 3 replicates). Survival and growth response of plant species in terms of sequestering carbon in plant material and soil will be the primary measure of effectiveness of each treatment. Additionally, the ability of the site soils and unsaturated zone subsurface materials will be evaluated for their effectiveness at treating the irrigation water for various pollutants...|$|E

In vitro digestion may {{assist in the}} characterization and quality control of protein in feedstuffs for fish species once standardized species-specific digestive enzyme extracts are available. This study aimed to develop a species-specific in vitro enzymatic method to assess protein digestion in fish under the pH-stat concept. Two carnivorous (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and cobia, Rachycentron canadum) and one omnivorous (Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus) fish species were used as models. Crude digestive enzyme extracts were recovered from stomach and pyloric caeca or intestine of individuals of different weight groups, feeding status, and farming systems. The hydrolytic capacity of the species-specific enzyme extracts was standardized on purified protein substrates and measured as degree of protein hydrolysis (DH) in the pH-stat assay. A group of twenty-four feed ingredients, including fish meals and by-products {{of plant and animal}} origin, was assessed for DH using the recovered enzymes from stomach and pyloric caeca/intestine. Ingredients were hydrolyzed with fish (i) stomach extract, (ii) pyloric caeca/intestine extract or (iii) stomach enzymes followed by pyloric caeca/intestine extract. Among <b>plant</b> <b>by-products,</b> cotton seed meal presented the highest DH with stomach plus pyloric caeca/intestine enzymes, followed by soy protein concentrate and soybean meals. Blood meals were the land animal by-product with higher DH outputs compared to poultry by-product meals and feather meals. No significant difference was observed among the DHs of fish meals. The significance of measuring the DH with stomach enzyme extract is still not well understood but, overall, the pre-hydrolysis of feedstuffs with stomach enzymes increased pyloric caeca/intestine DH value. For cage and pond farmed Nile tilapia, ingredient DHs followed the same trend, describing a significant correlation and a high determination coefficient regression. Routine use of the method may yet depend on the prompt availability of more practical sources of enzymes. The determination of the degree of protein hydrolysis by the in vitro pH-stat with species-specific enzymes has shown to be a precise method that may be a useful tool to rank feed ingredients, and also an accessory method in the quality control of feedstuffs...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} aim of {{the study}} was to evaluate the nutritional value of animal and <b>plant</b> <b>by-products,</b> with the objective of improving the cost effectiveness of diets for culturing seabream (Sparus aurata). The programme of work was initially directed towards applying the current methodology used in fish nutrition research to establish reliable digestibility coefficients for various feed ingredients. A selection of animal and plant materials were tested for digestibility within a reference basal diet designed for seabream. Ingredients for special consideration included poultry by-product meal, feather meal, meat and bone meal, solvent extracted and full fat soyabean meal as well as various other plant derived mater 1 als. Comparative values for protein, energy and lipid digestibility coefficients were assessed. On the basis of these measurements, experiments were undertaken to evaluate the optimum inclusion levels of promising protein and energy sources as a replacement for the fishmeal component in diets for seabream. Emphasis was made on recent advances in feed processing technology. Raw materials were evaluated in terms of proximate analysis, amino acid profiles and the degree of heat treatment effects on protein quality and availability. Several indices relating to these included lysine availabil 1 ty, cresol red values and trypsin inhibitor levels for soya products. Growth performance and feed utilization trials were conducted mainly on juvenile fish in recirculation systems under controlled conditions of temperature and salinity. Nutritional parameters such as specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency ~FE) and protein utilization parameters were determined 1 n each successive trial. The results were favourable with respect to the partial inclusion of animal products in seabream diets. Poultry byproduct meals proved encouraging even at high inclusion levels. The growth performance of fish fed soyabean meal and full fat soya were initially favourable and merited further consideration. These preliminary trials led to a series of practical diet formulations to contain multi-in 9 redient components, which confirmed previous findings. Var 1 able results, however, were reported for full fat soyabean meal in this experiment. Finally, the programme of research was presented in the context of the rapidly expanding mariculture industries of southern Europe w 1 th a particular relevance to Greece.

40|$|Bottom ash is a coal <b>plant</b> <b>by-product</b> that is {{abundant}} and underutilized. There {{is the potential}} use of bottom ash as a fine aggregate replacement in concrete mixtures; however, the problems of water absorption and uniformity of quality of the material need to be overcome first. In this study, bottom ash was treated by sieve separation and pounding to smaller particle size {{for use as a}} sand substitute. The physical and chemical characteristics of bottom ash were tested after treatment including water absorption, sieve analysis, and fineness modulus. Highvolume fly ash (HVFA) mortar specimens were made and the compressive strength and flowability test using bottom ash after treatment are compared with that of the sand specimen. Low water to cementitious ratio was used to ensure higher strength from the cementitious paste and superplasticizer demand was determined for each treatment. The result showed that bottom ash can be used as fine aggregate replacement material. Sieve separation of the bottom ash could produce 75 % of the compressive strength compared with the control sand specimen, whereas pounded bottom ash could have up to 96 % of the compressive strength of the control specimen. A 28 -day compressive strength of 45 MPa was achievable with 100 % replacement of fine aggregate with bottom ash...|$|R
