40|$|To {{clarify the}} phenotypes of various classes of human he-matopoietic {{progenitor}} cells, {{we used a}} multicolor staining protocol in conjunction with CD 34 and a newly developed mouse antihuman c-kit proto-oncogene <b>product</b> (<b>KIT)</b> monoclonal antibody (MoAb). We characterized three cell fractions in CD 34 + cells that express K 171 " and KIFigh cells in addition to KIT- cells. A clonogenic assay showed that most granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) were present in CD 34 + KIFigh populations, whereas erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E) were de-tected mainly in the CD 34 +KIT"'" ' population. CD 34 +-KIT- fraction contained {{a small number of}} BFU-E. Morpho-logic analysis showed that blast-like cells were more enriched in the CD 34 +KIT'OW fraction.

40|$|We {{examined}} the dose from 99 mTc contained in syringes and shielded vials to assess {{in detail the}} dose burdens in a central pharmacy. Methods: Absorbed-dose rates {{at the end of}} the plunger of a shielded syringe, when 99 mTc is contained either in the syringe or in a shielded vial from which the activity would be drawn, were measured with CaF 2 dosimeters. The dose rates also were calculated with a Monte Carlo model. Results: When activity was contained in either 3 -ml or 1 0 -ml disposable syringes shielded by lead glass, the absorbed-dose rates were 1. 35 - 1. 62 mGy hr- 1 GBq- 1 (5 - 6 mrad hr- 1 mci- 1 }. When the activity was contained in either a shielded elution or <b>product</b> <b>kit</b> vial, the absorbed-dose rates {{at the end of the}} syringe plunger were about 0. 40 mGy hr- 1 GBq- 1 (1. 4 - 1. 5 mrad hr- 1 mci- 1 }.

40|$|Mastocytosis is a {{neoplastic}} disease caused {{at least in}} part by somatic mutations of the c-KIT proto-oncogene resulting in constitutive activation of its protein <b>product,</b> <b>KIT,</b> the receptor tyrosine kinase for stem cell factor. KIT stimulates mast cell proliferation and prevents apoptosis of neoplastic mast cells. To develop potential therapies for mastocytosis we used indolinones, small molecules that inhibit tyrosine kinases. Four indolinone derivatives (SU 4984, SU 6663, SU 6577, and SU 5614) inhibited wild-type KIT, but variably inhibited constitutively activated KIT mutants. SU 4984, SU 6577, and SU 5614 were effective against KIT with juxtamembrane activating mutations, whereas only SU 6577 could suppress KIT containing either juxtamembrane or kinase domain activating mutations. Furthermore, SU 4984, SU 6577, and SU 5614 killed neoplastic mast cells expressing a juxtamembrane-mutated KIT, whereas SU 4984 and SU 6577 killed neoplastic mast cells expressing KIT bearing a kinase domain mutation. These data show a direct correlation between inhibition of constitutively activated KIT and the death of neoplastic mast cells, and point to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a potential therapy aimed directly at a cause of mastocytosis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDespite {{advances}} in revascularization techniques, {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) still carries significant morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, the use of regenerative medicine methodologies, and specifically bone marrow derived progenitor cell therapy has been tested in more than 35 Phase I and Phase II clinical studies demonstrating overall safety and measurable clinical benefit, 12 – 61 months post-treatment as evaluated by improvement in the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and changes in infarct size post AMI. Recent meta-analysis on the subject highlighted several important parameters that include timing of the cell therapy post AMI, the cell dose, and the baseline LVEF on enrollment. We further postulate that the mythologies and timing for cell handling and delivery including the specific devices are essential for clinical efficacy. Addressing this we have developed a rapid 60 to 90 minute process and integrated system which is {{carried out in the}} heart catheter lab, using a combination product (U. S. Food and Drug broadly defined as the combination of co-labeled optimized “cell friendly” devices, effective cell/biological formulation and dose) for harvesting, processing, verifying, and delivering an autologous dose of bone marrow progenitor/stem cells via the intracoronary artery proximal to the infarct myocardial region. The methodology has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible for autologous in vivo use and presented by our groups' earlier studies 1 – 3 and most recently used in a Phase Ib critical limb ischemia trial of 17 subjects (NCT 01472289) (manuscript under preparation). This is the first case study prior to beginning the AMIRST trial [Acute Myocardial Infarction Rapid Stem cell Therapy], specific to our proprietary combination <b>product</b> <b>kit</b> for acute myocardial infarction, and was completed under the Independent Ethics Committee and Institutional Committee for Stem Cell Research and Therapy approval (TIEC/ 2011 / 32 / 02) for process and safety endpoints post-treatment...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho avaliou o {{material}} de higiene bucal usado em escolas para estabelecer um protocolo às ações de higiene bucal coletiva. O estudo foi dividido em duas etapas: 1 ª- 20 responsáveis pelos procedimentos coletivos com escolares de Bauru e São José dos Campos - SP responderam a dois questionários sobre o uso de cinco kits de higiene bucal coletiva. A análise estatística foi realizada através do teste Wilcoxon (p The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the storage and distribution of toothbrushing material for school children. Twenty individuals responsible for the collective oral hygiene of school children from Bauru - SP and São José dos Campos - SP participated in the first stage of the study, answering 2 questionnaires about five different kits for use by school children. The statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon (p< 0, 05). In the second stage, the amount of toothpaste or liquid cleanser applied to the toothbrush by 178 school children aged 4 to 8 years from 2 cities from the state of São Paulo (Bauru e Bariri) was weighed using a portable balance. The statistical analysis was obtained by using Pearson's correlation coefficient and analysis of covariance (p < 0, 05). Kit 5 obtained levels of satisfaction and high satisfaction when compared with the others kits (1 - 4). The school children from Bauru (0, 41 g) used smaller amounts of toothpaste than the school children from Bariri (0, 48 g). The average of the amount of liquid cleanser applied by the sample was 0, 15 g.

40|$|With {{millions}} of possible final product configurations offered to customers, MarelliMotori is undoubtedly a customizer in the induction motor manufacturing sector. MarelliMotori has always leveraged the completeness of its product range {{and the possibility}} of product customization offered to its customers to differentiate itself from competitors. However, {{over the last few years}} MarelliMotori’s differentiation strategy has been challenged by the increasing pressure placed on costs and delivery times by the entry of low cost manufacturers, mostly located in the Far East, and by the proliferation of highly responsive small companies operating on a regional scale in Italy and other European countries that assemble motors from imported components or just market imported motors under their own brand. As a result, combining product customization with rapid deliveries and acceptable prices has become a must for MarelliMotori. In its effort to become a mass customizer, MarelliMotori considered changing both the product configuration process and the materials flow. The case illustrates how and why kitting has enabled both the implementation of a software-based product configuration system and the postponement of product differentiation along the material flow. By changing the way products are represented within the company’s information system, kitting allowed for minimizing the initial investment needed to develop the product model required by the configuration system. By changing the way kit components are managed and added to the <b>product,</b> <b>kitting</b> allowed for delaying product differentiation along the manufacturing process. Ultimately, by enabling the implementation of a software-based product configuration system and the postponement of <b>product</b> differentiation <b>kitting</b> has played a key role in enhancing MarelliMotori’s mass customization capability...|$|R
