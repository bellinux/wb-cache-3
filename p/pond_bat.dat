40|$|Although water {{availability}} {{is known to}} affect landscape-scale patterns of wildlife diversity and distribution in arid environments, {{little is known about}} the microhabitat characteristics that shape the local-scale distribution of desert bats. We examined the relative importance of pond microhabitat characteristics for the conservation of bats, and hypothesized that in arid environments, patterns of bat diversity and community composition relate to the size of the pond and its hydroperiod (the number of months a pond holds water), a term we use to distinguish between permanent, semi-permanent and temporary ponds. We combined acoustic monitoring with video recording and an experimental approach to study bat activity over natural ponds in the Negev Desert, Israel. We found that both within and between <b>ponds</b> <b>bat</b> species richness and activity significantly increased with pond size. An experimental reduction of pond size led to a significant reduction in bat species richness and activity and affected the bat community composition. In contrast to pond size, pond hydroperiod did not affect bat diversity, as temporary ponds had equivalent levels of bat species richness and activity to permanent ponds. However, hydroperiod did couple with pond size to affect the bat community composition, whereby non-desert bat species that have a higher frequency of drinking were associated with larger and more permanent ponds. Our results highlight the importance of larger temporary ponds (ponds over 15 m in length and 0. 5 m in depth) for the conservation of biodiversity in arid environments...|$|R

40|$|Rabies is {{the oldest}} known {{zoonotic}} disease and {{was also the first}} recognized bat associated infection in humans. To date, four different lyssavirus species are the causative agents of rabies in European bats: the European Bat Lyssaviruses type 1 and 2 (EBLV- 1, EBLV- 2), the recently discovered putative new lyssavirus species Bokeloh Bat Lyssavirus (BBLV) and the West Caucasian Bat Virus (WCBV). Unlike in the new world, bat rabies cases in Europe are comparatively less frequent, possibly as a result of varying intensity of surveillance. Thus, the objective was to provide an assessment of the bat rabies surveillance data in Europe, taking both reported data to the WHO Rabies Bulletin Europe and published results into account. In Europe, 959 bat rabies cases were reported to the RBE in the time period 1977 - 2010 with the vast majority characterized as EBLV- 1, frequently isolated in the Netherlands, North Germany, Denmark, Poland and also in parts of France and Spain. Most EBLV- 2 isolates originated from the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands, and EBLV- 2 was also detected in Germany, Finland and Switzerland. Thus far, only one isolate of BBLV was found in Germany. Published passive bat rabies surveillance comprised testing of 28 of the 52 different European bat species for rabies. EBLV- 1 was isolated exclusively from Serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus and Eptesicus isabellinus), while EBLV- 2 was detected in 14 Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) and 5 <b>Pond</b> <b>bats</b> (Myotis dasycneme). A virus from a single Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) was characterized as BBLV. During active surveillance, only oral swabs from 2 Daubenton's bats (EBLV- 2) and from several Eptesicus bats (EBLV- 1) yielded virus positive RNA. Virus neutralizing antibodies against lyssaviruses were detected in various European bat species from different countries, and its value and implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the habitat condition {{is the first step}} of conservation actions and several tools are available to assess wetlands. However, only a few tools are adapted to the priority habitat Mediterranean temporary ponds. Thus, our objectives were (i) to identify biological indicators associated with the different conservation status of Mediterranean tem- porary ponds and (ii) to create an efficient evaluation tool for non-experts using indicators of conservation status. A total of 87 ponds were sampled in southwest Portugal to assess the presence of plants, large branchiopods, amphibians, threatened voles and <b>bats.</b> <b>Ponds</b> with favourable conservation status showed higher species richness of plants, large branchiopods and amphibians. We identified eighteen indicators for favourable ponds: 15 plants, one large branchiopod and two amphibian taxa. We propose a new tool to assess the conservation status of Mediterranean tem- porary ponds based on the presence of these indicators. This tool is an alternative to other common, but time- consuming, methods and can be readily used by trained practitioners. The replication and adaptation of this tool to other regions and habitats enables the collection of comparable data and the geographical scaling-up of the assessments.

40|$|Abstract: The paper summarises the {{distribution}} and abundance of the globally vulnerable and nationally endangered <b>pond</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis dasycneme) in Poland {{and is based on}} all the available published and unpublished data. The species was recorded in 105 UTM squares, scattered across almost the whole of Poland. In addition fossil remains, mostly from the Holocene age, were found in 13 squares. Evidence of <b>pond</b> <b>bat</b> breeding (nursing) was obtained from 10 UTM squares, restricted to the lakelands of northern Poland and the valleys of the large rivers in {{the central part of the}} country. Only two nursery roosts, used respectively by a maximum of 481 and 391 individuals, were found. The remaining summer records (41 UTM squares) were sightings or captures of adult males, non-breeding females or unsexed individuals and were widely dispersed in areas located far from known reproduction sites. The summer roosts (n= 21) were located mainly in buildings, bridge crevices and bird and bat boxes. Sixty-seven hibernation sites of <b>pond</b> <b>bat</b> were found, mainly in old fortifications, cellars and caves. 63 % (n= 42) of them were used by single individuals and only three held 10 or more individuals (maximum n= 34). In the two regularly monitored sites the number of pond bats has fluctuated in recent years and in one site it even increased. Most of the available bat data (winter censuses, bird and bat boxes, owl pellets, road casualties, fossil remains, mist netting) shows that pond bats account for less than 1 % of the Polish bat assemblages. However this figure reached 2. 1 - 2. 7 % (and in one instance 17. 5 %) of the total number of bats netted in some regions of the northern lakelands. Many areas that are potentiall...|$|E
40|$|The summer {{distribution}} of the <b>Pond</b> <b>bat</b> Myotis dasycneme in the west of Flanders was assessed by bat detector surveys and a radiotracking project focusing on hunting activity as well as commuting activity.

This study revealed new records of pond bats in the area including a small maternity roost. Recorded activity was high over broad waterways, lower over large ponds and medium sized waterways and very low over small waterways. Pond bats were observed hunting over waterways with different pollution levels from mild to heavier pollution.

40|$|Like most bat species, the <b>pond</b> <b>bat</b> (Myotis dasycneme (Boie, 1825)) {{lives in}} roosts {{more or less}} in the centre of their {{foraging}} habitat and are considered central-place foragers. Commuting routes, or flyways, between roosts and hunting areas have an essential ecological function for bats. We summarize the results of research performed on the commuting routes of pond bats between 2002 and 2009. We give, among others, a description on how bats disperse, how to recognize a commuting route, and details about the effort needed to make a complete survey of one commuting route. Furthermore, we make a relation between number of animals on the route and size of their respective roost. The results suggest pond bats are not completely reliant on waterways for reaching their foraging habitat; they use directional dispersal, following commuting routes over waterways in combination with shortcuts over land. These results provide information {{that can be used to}} better understand how bats use their commuting routes. Also, the knowledge can be applied to survey work...|$|E

Similarly, females of M. petax have 1. 7 (1. 2 – 2. 4) times higher density of N. quasiocellata and/or B. rybini.
