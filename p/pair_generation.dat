40|$|Crew {{planning}} {{is a typical}} problem arising {{in the management of}} large transit systems (such as railway and airline companies). Given a set of train services to be performed every day, the problem calls for a set of crew rosters covering the train services at minimum cost. Although the cost may depend on several factors, the main objective is to minimize the number of crews needed to perform the rosters. The process of constructing the rosters from the train services has been historically subdivided into three independent phases, called <b>pairing</b> <b>generation,</b> <b>pairing</b> optimization, and rostering optimization, as is the case for the approach presented in Caprara et al. (1999 a) for the Italian railways. In that paper, the authors suggest that a feedback between the last two phases may signicantly improve the quality of the nal solution. In this paper, we illustrate the implementation of a new crew planning system within the EU Project TRIO. In particular, we describe the design of a new module for <b>pairing</b> <b>generation,</b> as well as an eective technique for integrating the pairing and rostering optimization phases into a unique one. The improvements over the previous approach are shown through computational results on real-world instances. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} <b>paired</b> <b>generation</b> of {{a single}} photo-electron in a quantum dot and a single photon from a single polarization-entangled photon pair that is generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion. The electron is reated in a GaAs quantum dot via inter-band resonantexcitation by irradiating one of the paired photons on the dot, while the remaining photon is detected by a single photon counter. Because the paired photons are generated simultaneously, the photo-electron and the remaining photon should be observed as a coincident event if the traveling distance is equivalent between them. The coincidence is probabilistic due to the probabilistic <b>generation</b> of the <b>paired</b> photon. We observe the probability of finding the photon with the photo-electron detection substantially higher then that without the photo-electron detection and derive the coincident rate comparable to the emission rate of the original photon pairs...|$|R

Crew scheduling constraints in which the crew {{have to return to}} their home depot {{at the end of the}} shift are included in the model.

In this case, the advantage of using a PIN structure over conventional semiconductor p-n junction is the better long wavelength response of the former.

The depletion region of a PIN structure extends across the intrinsic region, deep into the device. This wider depletion width enables electron-hole <b>pair</b> <b>generation</b> deep within the device. This increases the quantum efficiency of the cell.|$|E
