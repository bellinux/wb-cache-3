50|$|Even {{more people}} showed {{interest}} in Coin’s financial school, and more bimetallists joined Coin’s lessons every day. Coin started off the day’s lecture by distinguishing {{between the two}} kinds of credit money: paper money, which include bank notes, and token money, which are forms of metal that do not enjoy free coinage. Credit money was used as promises {{that the government will}} redeem the owner with the <b>primary</b> <b>money,</b> which in this case was gold. Coin pointed out that by abolishing free coinage of silver, the government turned silver from one of the <b>primary</b> <b>money</b> to a token money, no longer redeemable by itself. This, in turn, reduced the nation’s supply of <b>primary</b> <b>money</b> by half. By reducing the nation’s <b>primary</b> <b>money</b> supply, the government effectively rendered many checks and greenback bank notes more volatile, since they were no longer backed by properties, but by speculation and federal government’s credit.|$|E

50|$|Coin then {{defined the}} three main forms of credit: credit, checks and bonds. Coin defined credit as paper bills and token money redeemable in <b>primary</b> <b>money,</b> checks as forms of paper payable on demand, and bonds as credit payable {{at some point in}} the future. Ideally, one would prefer to keep the amount of the three forms of credit as same as the amount of <b>primary</b> <b>money</b> backing them up. Coin {{explained}} that during a period of prosperity, more and more businessmen and entrepreneurs took debts to further investments in their businesses. When too much of the credit money was purchased compared to the available supply of redemption money, this created a loss of confidence in the banks as more and more buyers run to the bank to collect their money and debt payments before the banks run out of money. This, combined with the halved supply of <b>primary</b> <b>money</b> from silver losing its free coinage, made new debt all the riskier.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the <b>money</b> <b>primary,</b> {{also known}} as the {{invisible}} primary, is the period between (1) the first well-known presidential candidates with strong political support networks showing interest in running for president and (2) demonstration of substantial public support by voters for them in primaries and caucuses. During the <b>money</b> <b>primary</b> candidates raise funds for the upcoming primary elections and attempt to garner support of political leaders and donors, as well as the party establishment. Fund raising numbers and opinion polls are used by the media to predict who the front runners for the nomination are. This is a crucial stage of a campaign for the presidency, as the initial frontrunners who raise the most money appear the strongest and will be able to raise even more money. On the other hand, members of the party establishment who find themselves losing the invisible primary, such as Mitt Romney in the 2016 race, may abandon hope of successfully running.|$|R

50|$|A major {{aspect of}} For the Glory is {{managing}} domestic policies. Every ten in-games years, and through events, the player can use sliders to determine domestic policies, which impact the game. Balancing the nation's budget and keeping {{a lid on}} inflation is another <b>primary</b> objective. <b>Money</b> is used for multiple things including funding the military, trade, and research. The player can invest funds in their country's stability as well, and stability affects just about every aspect of a nation's performance. Instability is usually the result of in-game actions, such as declaring war on a neighboring country without a casus belli, and {{it can also be}} influenced by events. Low stability means land and naval forces stand a greater chance of losing battles; the frequency of internal rebellions rises; diplomatic actions are less successful; and the founding and expansion of colonies are more likely to fail.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the monetary instrument choice for local equilibrium determinacy under sticky prices and different fiscal policy regimes. Corresponding to Benhabib et al. 's (2001) results for interest rate feedback rules, the money growth rate should not rise by more than one for one with inflation when the primary surplus is raised with public debt. Under an exogenous <b>primary</b> surplus, <b>money</b> supply should be accommodating [...] such that real balances grow with inflation [...] to ensure local equilibrium determinacy. When the central bank links the supply of money to government bonds by controlling the bond-to-money ratio, an inflation stabilizing policy can be implemented for both fiscal policy regimes. Local determinacy is then ensured when the bond-to-money ratio is not extremely sensitive to inflation, or when interest payments on public debt are entirely tax financed, i. e., the budget is balanced.
