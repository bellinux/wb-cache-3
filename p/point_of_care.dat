25|$|The goal of most {{emergency}} medical services is to either provide treatment to those in need of urgent medical care, {{with the goal of}} satisfactorily treating the presenting conditions, or arranging for timely removal of the patient to the next point of definitive care. This is most likely an emergency department at a hospital. The term {{emergency medical}} service evolved to reflect a change from a simple system of ambulances providing only transport, to a system in which preliminary medical care is given on scene and during transport. In some developing regions, the term is not used, or may be used inaccurately, since the service in question does not provide treatment to the patients, but only the provision of transport to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{traditional}} thromboelastography is {{a global}} assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays. They allow testing {{in the presence of}} therapeutic heparin concentrations and provide differential diagnostic information to support decisions in therapy. In numerous publications the validity of the method is shown. Application of TEM at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> (POC) or in emergency laboratories is getting more and more popular. TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable rapid test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the fibrin stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true haemostasis disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and protamine, hemostyptic and antifibrinolytic drugs. Several reports confirm that application of TEM is cost effective by reducing the consumption of blood products.|$|E
500|$|Dosing of {{warfarin}} {{is complicated}} {{because it is}} known to interact with many commonly used medications and certain foods. These interactions may enhance or reduce warfarin's anticoagulation effect. To optimize the therapeutic effect without risking dangerous side effects such as bleeding, close monitoring {{of the degree of}} anticoagulation is required by a blood test measuring an INR. [...] During the initial stage of treatment, INR is checked daily; intervals between tests can be lengthened if the patient manages stable therapeutic INR levels on an unchanged warfarin dose. Newer point-of-care testing is available and has increased the ease of INR testing in the outpatient setting. Instead of a blood draw, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> test involves a simple finger prick.|$|E

Finally, we present the implementation of a semantic-web-based system, which aims to facilitate the exchange of Clinical Information among various <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>care,</b> and we also present a solution that provides for the shared understanding of Medical Data between diverge information systems, and overcomes, both, the problems of incompatible formats in messages and of the use of diverse vocabularies.

40|$|In {{clinical}} practice, pharmacists play a {{very important}} role in identifying and correcting medication discrepancies as older patients move across transition <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> With increasing complexity <b>of</b> health <b>care</b> needs <b>of</b> older people, these discrepancies are likely to increase. The major concern with identifying and correcting medication discrepancies is that medication reconciliation is considered a retrospective problem - that is, dealing with medication discrepancies after they have occurred. It is argued here that a more proactive stance should be taken where doctors, nurses and pharmacists collectively work together to prevent medication discrepancies from happening in the first place. Improved involvement of patients and family members will help to facilitate better management of medications across transition <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> Efficient use <b>of</b> information technology aids, such as electronic medication reconciliation tools, should also assist with organizational systems problems associated with the working culture, heavy workloads, and staff and skill mix of health professionals...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: As {{patients}} {{move across}} transition points, effective medication management {{is critical for}} patient safety. The aims {{of this study were}} to examine how health professionals, patients and family members communicate about managing medications as patients moved across transition <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> and to identify possible sources of communication failure. METHOD: A descriptive approach was used involving observations and interviews. The emergency departments and medical wards of two hospitals were involved. Observations focused on how health professionals managed medications during interactions with other health professionals, patients and family members, as patients moved across clinical settings. Follow-up interviews with participants were also undertaken. Thematic analysis was completed of transcribed data, and descriptive statistics were used to analyse characteristics of communication failure. RESULTS: Three key themes were identified: environmental challenges, interprofessional relationships, and patient and family beliefs and responsibilities. As patients moved between environments, insufficient tracking occurred about medication changes. Before hospital admission, patients participated in self-care medication activities, which did not always involve exemplary behaviours or match the medications that doctors prescribed. During observations, 432 instances of communication failure (42. 8 %) were detected, which related to purpose, content, audience and occasion of the communication. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive challenges exist involving the management of medications at transition <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>care.</b> Bedside handovers and ward rounds can be utilized as patient counselling opportunities about changes in the medication regimen. Greater attention is needed on how patients in the community make medication-related decisions...|$|R

40|$|Background: A s {{patients}} {{move across}} different clinical settings, medication changes {{are likely to}} occur. Aim: To identify patient-, medication- and environment-related factors associated with unintentional medication discrepancies in older patients, who were admitted to hospital via an emergency department and who had a subacute care admission at some point following hospital admission. Methods: A retrospective clinical audit was undertaken using a stratified random sampling approach over a 14 -month period. Medical records of patients aged 65 years or over were collected from five hospitals. Findings: Data were collected from 426 older patients. Of these patients, 169 (39. 7 %) {{had at least one}} unexplained medication discrepancy. Patients without social supports had 2. 956 greater odds of experiencing an unexplained medication discrepancy (95 % CI 1. 870 - 4. 671), p< 0. 0001. As the number of prescribed medications increased upon admission to the emergency department, patients had 1. 125 greater odds of experiencing an unexplained medication discrepancy (95 % CI 1. 035 - 1. 223), p= 0. 006. Patients discharged to destinations other than their home had 2. 714 increased odds (95 % CI 1. 317 - 5. 594), p= 0. 007 while those experiencing more than four transition <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> had 2. 476 increased odds (95 % CI 1. 208 - 5. 074), p= 0. 013, of experiencing an unexplained medication discrepancy. A significant association existed between the prevalence of unexplained medication discrepancies and hospital readmission within six months, χ 2 = 36. 496, df= 1, p< 0. 001.
