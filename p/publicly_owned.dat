5|$|Turkey has {{gradually}} opened up its markets through economic reforms by reducing government controls on foreign {{trade and investment}} and the privatisation of <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> industries, and the liberalisation of many sectors to private and foreign participation has continued amid political debate. The public debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 75.9 percent during the recession of 2001, falling to an estimated 26.9 percent by 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the First World War the council's Markets Committee began a {{programme}} of gradually buying back all the privately owned stalls, with the intention of encouraging demobilised servicemen to work on the market. Within a few years the market was entirely <b>publicly</b> <b>owned,</b> and the council took responsibility for the upkeep of the market. The city also bought out and closed many of the 30 or more inns in the area, transferring their licences to the growing suburbs.|$|E

50|$|The socialist mode of {{production}} is the post-capitalist economic system that emerges when {{the accumulation of}} capital is no longer sustainable due to falling rates of profit in (real) production, and social conflict arising from the contradictions between the level of technology and automation in the economy with the capitalist form of social organization. A socialist society would consist {{of production}} being carried out, organized in a manner to directly satisfy human needs, with the working-class cooperatively or <b>publicly</b> <b>owning</b> the means of production.|$|R

5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|As of May 2014, {{there are}} eleven {{nationwide}} free-to-air DVB-T television channels, with HRT's four channels, RTL Televizija operating three, Nova TV operating two {{and the remaining}} two operated by the Croatian Olympic Committee and Author d.o.o. companies and the government's Central State Administrative Office for e-Croatia. All ten DVB-T television channels are free-to-air and privately owned, except for HRT's channels and the Moja uprava channel (which are <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> broadcasters). Doma TV {{is part of the}} Nova TV group. Since 2007 television audience measurement is conducted by the Nielsen Company using 1,086 peoplemeters, and it is applied to terrestrial, cable and satellite TV.

5|$|From 1908 to 1909, {{a hundred}} {{electric}} trams were manufactured by Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide {{at a cost}} of approximately £100 each. Up to its last tram purchase in 1953, the MTT commissioned over 300 electric trams, some of which have been kept in service for over seventy-five years. TransAdelaide, the <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> company now operating Adelaide trams, began introducing a new type of tram in January 2006 {{in the form of the}} Bombardier Flexity Classic. Another new series of trams (Alstom Citadis) started to enter service in December 2009. A further three trams are to be delivered in 2018.|$|E

5|$|On Long Island, {{thousands}} {{were left}} without power {{for over a}} week, until the last outages were restored {{two weeks after the}} storm on October8. The long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close, extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings, and price gouging on food, ice, and generators. The lack of power led to a general disdain for the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), which increased further when the company left the $40million (1985USD) repair bill to the ratepayers, citing the company's lack of hurricane insurance. Citizens quickly protested LILCO's decision, and within years the <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> Long Island Power Authority was formed.|$|E
5|$|Plant life is {{extremely}} diverse and ranges from sun-loving species {{to those that}} grow in dense shade. Tree cover dominates the <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> acreage, and is a significant component on privately owned lands. Oak-hickory is the predominant timber type, however, many other commercially important timber species also occupy significant acreages. More than 500 wildlife species {{can be found in}} the Forest, including 48 mammals, 237 birds, 52 reptiles, 57 amphibians, and 109 species of fish. There are seven federally listed threatened and endangered species that inhabit the Forest, as well as 33 species which are considered regionally sensitive, and 114 Forest-listed species.|$|E
5|$|When Mike Harris {{was elected}} Premier in 1995 on his {{platform}} of the Common Sense Revolution, the Ontario government faced a $11billion annual deficit and a $100billion debt.

Although initially spared, Highway407 was sold quickly in the year {{leading up to the}} 1999 provincial elections. The highway was leased to a conglomerate of private companies for $3.1 billion. The Ontario corporation, known as 407International Inc., is jointly owned by the Spanish multinational Cintra Infraestructuras (43.23%), as well as various subsidiaries of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (40%) and the Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin (16.77%).|$|E

5|$|Construction of the SR 125 {{toll road}} started in September 2003; it was {{projected}} {{to open in}} 2006. Over the next few years, 1.5 million cubic meters of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions {{to allow for the}} interchange with SR 54 to be built. In 2005, the road was given the South Bay Expressway name. The South Bay Expressway extended SR 125 southward from SR 54 to Otay Mesa. This toll road was one of four privately financed toll highway projects, including the 91 Express Toll Lanes, that were approved in 1990; it was also one of two toll roads financed and controlled by both public and private sources, although the 91 Express Lanes, the other road, soon became entirely <b>publicly</b> <b>owned.</b> A partnership known as the South Bay Expressway operated the road, while an Australian company, Maquarie Group Ltd., handled financial and construction matters.|$|E
5|$|Early public {{education}} in Meridian {{was based on the}} 1870 Mississippi Constitution. From 1870 to 1885, trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors, which had authority to operate the schools. Although there were several schools in the city before 1884, they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students. The city did not build its first <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> school until September 1884. The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church. The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district, and in March of the same year $30,000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools. From this bond, the Wechsler School was built in 1894, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks.|$|E
5|$|Many {{overlapping}} entities including city, county, state, {{and federal}} governments share jurisdiction for parts of the watershed. About 60percent of the basin is <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> and is managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), assisted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and other agencies in both states, is charged with controlling water pollution in the basin. United States National Forests and other forests cover about 83percent of the basin; another 6percent is grassland, 3percent shrub, and only 0.2percent wetland. Urban areas account for slightly less than 1percent and farms for about 6percent.|$|E

5|$|WMATA's {{bus system}} is a {{successor}} to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA's original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls for authority to overhaul the entire bus system as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price, on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George's County for $4.5 million. While AB and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than DC Transit, their owners {{did not wish to}} compete with a <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> bus system, and requested takeover.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} {{stations}} {{on the line}} from Lincoln west, Ayer has no dedicated station parking, despite serving over 400 passengers per day. The lots adjacent to the station are privately owned and serve local businesses, but are often illegally used by commuters using the station. The 30-space Nashua River Rail Trail parking lot is available for commuters on weekdays; some commuters also use street parking and other business lots. In 2003, the town and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) began planning how to increase parking capacity. Five studies in six years concluded with plans for an $11 million, 400-space garage off Park Street, accessibility improvements to the station, and streetscape improvements for pedestrian access. The plans were reduced in scale due to traffic concerns and other issues. $3.2 million in FTA funds (originally intended for expanded parking at Littleton/Route 495 but later rejected) was committed to build a $4 million surface lot. However, the lot was delayed due to conflicts with businesses that would be displaced and the lack of a <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> pedestrian entrance (a requirement to use the federal funds).|$|E
5|$|Filming for The Proposal {{initiated}} in April 2008 in Rockport, Massachusetts. In the oncoming days leading to production, {{areas of the}} town were temporarily remodeled to represent Sitka, Alaska, the setting {{of most of the}} film. Principal photography officially began on April 9 at Bearskin Neck, where it continued over a period of 24 hours. Filming continued at the Motif Number One building on Bradley Wharf (April 14–16), the Haskins Building (April 15–18), and the central business district of Rockport (April 17). Principal photography relocated to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts on April 22, where it resumed over an approximate period of two weeks. In response, city officials accommodated the producers by renting out all <b>publicly</b> <b>owned</b> parking lots. Filming for The Proposal was shortly delayed after Bullock and her husband were involved in a car accident. The wedding scene was filmed in a three-story twentieth century Victorian home; photography took place at the residence for three weeks. In an interview with the New York Times, the owners of the home stated that Nelson Coates knocked on their door asking for leaves. Initially, the owners directed Coates to other residences in the area; however, they eventually gave the film's producer a tour of the house. Production occurred {{on the first floor of}} the home. Outside of the Cape Ann area, filming took place in Boston, Massachusetts at the State Street Bank Building and in Lower Manhattan in New York City. The Proposal contained 350 special effect shots, and some parts were edited using computer-generated imagery. The score to The Proposal was composed by Aaron Zigman, who recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.|$|E
