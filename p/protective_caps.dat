While the chromosomes in most eukaryotic organisms are capped with telomeres, mega-telomeres are only found in a few species, such as mice and some birds. The specific function of mega-telomeres in vertebrate cells is still unclear.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{fire hydrant}} valves are not {{designed}} to throttle the water flow; {{they are designed to}} be operated full-on or full-off. The valving arrangement of most dry-barrel hydrants is for the drain valve to be open at anything other than full operation. Usage at partial-opening can consequently result in considerable flow directly into the soil surrounding the hydrant, which, over time, can cause severe scouring. Gate or butterfly valves can be installed directly onto the hydrant orifices to control individual outputs and allow for changing equipment connections without turning off the flow to other orifices. These valves can be up to 12 inches in diameter to accommodate the large central [...] "steamer" [...] orifices on many US hydrants. It is good practice to install valves on all orifices before using a hydrant as the <b>protective</b> <b>caps</b> are unreliable and can cause major injury if they fail.|$|E

40|$|Aspergilli possess {{short and}} tightly {{regulated}} telomeres, the <b>protective</b> <b>caps</b> {{at the ends}} of chromosomes. A protein (Pot 1 /NIMU) has been identified in Aspergillus nidulans that may bind to the single-stranded overhang of the telomeres. No studies have been done regarding the importance of Pot 1 /NIMU to telomere maintenance in Aspergillus. I work with a temperature sensitive mutant of A. nidulans, which does not possess functional Pot 1 /NIMU at elevated temperatures. This mutant displays extremely variable telomere length, evident when compared to the tightly regulated telomeres of the wild type strain. These findings identify Pot 1 /NIMU as a key player in telomere length regulation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—In {{order to}} more fully {{understand}} associations between psychological stress and health, {{it is helpful}} for researchers to identify ‘‘psychobiomarkers,’ ’ or biological measures that are regulated in part by psychological function and that predict longevity. Telomere length ap-pears {{to be such a}} measure. Telomeres, the <b>protective</b> <b>caps</b> at the tips of chromosomes, shorten with age, and this shortening predicts disease and longevity. Leukocyte telo-mere length may be best viewed through a life-span ap-proach, as it reflects in part the cumulative number of cell divisions that have occurred and the long-term biochemi-cal environment. Recently, a critical mass of studies dem-onstrated that telomeres appear to shorten with chronic stress, although the mechanisms are unknown. This paper reviews what appear to be malleable determinants of rat...|$|E

40|$|Drs. J. Watson and A. M. Olovnikov {{described}} the natural phenomenon of an “end replication problem” in the 1970 s.

The shortening of telomeres, the <b>protective</b> <b>caps</b> {{at the ends of}} chromosomes, due to the end replication problem and exonuclease activity has been hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the aging process, as a 'senescence' setpoint is progressively impinged upon. This thesis will review the role of the telomeres and telomerase, an enzyme which acts to elongate the telomeres, in cancer biology and in aging.

40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} DNA/protein {{structures that}} act as <b>protective</b> <b>caps</b> to prevent end fusion events and to distinguish the chromosome ends from double-strand breaks. We report that TRF 1 and Ku form a complex at the telomere. The Ku and TRF 1 complex is a specific high-affinity interaction, as demonstrated by several in vitro methods, and exists in human cells as determined by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Ku does not bind telomeric DNA directly but localizes to telomeric repeats via its interaction with TRF 1. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are deficient for Ku 80 accumulated {{a large percentage of}} telomere fusions, establishing that Ku plays a critical role in telomere capping in mammalian cells. We propose that Ku localizes to internal regions of the telomere via a high-affinity interaction with TRF 1. Therefore, Ku acts in a unique way at the telomere to prevent end joining...|$|E
