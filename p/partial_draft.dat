40|$|This {{talk was}} {{presented}} as part of Breakout Session 1 | Panel 2 : "Critical Reading for the FYW Classroom. " These are the speaking notes from the talk. Last semester, I discovered two techniques that are revolutionizing my teaching. The first technique is that of requiring students to write informal, one-page responses to all readings in a given unit.  Each unit is comprised of six to ten texts read {{over a period of}} several weeks.  By reading and responding to these low-stakes pieces of homework [...] a total of five to six pages for each unit [...] I can spot student challenges, such as reading comprehension problems or grammar needs, and can start helping students address them as soon as Week 1.  In addition, this low-stakes writing functions as a kind of “warm-up” for students.  Somehow, their writing seems to improve on its own over the first few weeks before any formal essays are due! Instead of having students submit an entire essay, I break essays into parts, and ask students to submit one part at a time as homework. I then respond to each part as described above.  This allows me another opportunity to address student challenges before high-stakes essays are due, and also allows me to tailor class content to class needs, using examples from their own homework. Although these methods may seem time-consuming, I can respond to homework and <b>partial</b> <b>drafts</b> fairly quickly on an easy-to-use platform like Google classroom, and by the time I get those final essays on Turnitin, my work is largely done...|$|R

500|$|Due to time constraints, a team {{of writers}} was {{assigned}} to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers {{to appear in the}} credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A <b>partial</b> first <b>draft</b> was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. [...] "Even though it was an alternate universe, [...] and I got all excited because we realized we were going to kill everyone on screen", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.|$|R

40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) {{technologies have}} made high-throughput sequencing available to medium- and small-size laboratories, {{culminating in a}} tidal wave of genomic information. The quantity of sequenced bacterial genomes has not only brought excitement to the field of genomics but also heightened expectations that NGS would boost antibacterial discovery and vaccine development. Although many possible drug and vaccine targets have been discovered, the success rate of genome-based analysis has remained below expectations. Furthermore, NGS has had consequences for genome quality, resulting in an exponential increase in <b>draft</b> (<b>partial</b> data) genome deposits in public databases.

Partial objectives include tasks focused on a literature review, characterizing the company, realizing questionnaire survey and personal interviews with employees, evaluation and display of the acquired information.

More deeply are described personnel activities, which are related to the provision of human resources for the company.

40|$|Abstract Background Relatively little {{information}} is available for sequence variation in the pig. We previously used a combination of short read (25 base pair) high-throughput sequencing and reduced genomic representation to discover > 60, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in cattle, but the current lack of complete genome sequence limits this approach in swine. Longer-read pyrosequencing-based technologies {{have the potential to}} overcome this limitation by providing sufficient flanking sequence information for assay design. Swine SNP were discovered in the present study using a reduced representation of 450 base pair (bp) porcine genomic fragments (approximately 4 % of the swine genome) prepared from a pool of 26 animals relevant to current pork production, and a GS-FLX instrument producing 240 bp reads. Results Approximately 5 million sequence reads were collected and assembled into contigs having an overall observed depth of 7. 65 -fold coverage. The approximate minor allele frequency was estimated from the number of observations of the alternate alleles. The average coverage at the SNPs was 12. 6 -fold. This approach identified 115, 572 SNPs in 47, 830 contigs. Comparison to <b>partial</b> swine genome <b>draft</b> sequence indicated 49, 879 SNP (43 %) and 22, 045 contigs (46 %) mapped to a position on a sequenced pig chromosome and the distribution was essentially random. A sample of 176 putative SNPs was examined and 168 (95. 5 %) were confirmed to have segregating alleles; the correlation of the observed minor allele frequency (MAF) to that predicted from the sequence data was 0. 58. Conclusion The process was an efficient means to identify a large number of porcine SNP having high validation rate to be used in an ongoing international collaboration to produce a highly parallel genotyping assay for swine. By using a conservative approach, a robust group of SNPs were detected with greater confidence and relatively high MAF that should be suitable for genotyping {{in a wide variety of}} commercial populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{complements}} McCarthy's “The {{well designed}} child”, {{in part by}} putting it in a broader context, a space of sets of requirements and a space of designs, and in part by relating design features to development of mathematical competences. I moved into AI hoping to understand myself, especially hoping to understand how I could do mathematics. Over the ensuing four decades, my interactions with AI and other disciplines led to: design-based, cross-disciplinary investigations of requirements, especial those arising from interactions with a complex environment; a <b>draft</b> <b>partial</b> ontology for describing spaces of possible architectures, especially virtual machine architectures; investigations of how different forms of representation relate to different functions; analysis of biological nature/nurture tradeoffs and their relevance to machines; studies of control issues in a complex architecture; and showing how what can occur in such an architecture relates to our intuitive concepts of motivation, feeling, preferences, emotions, attitudes, values, moods, consciousness, etc. I conjecture that working models of human vision can lead to models of spatial reasoning that would help to support Kant's view of mathematics by showing that human mathematical abilities are {{a natural extension of}} abilities produced by biological evolution that are not yet properly understood, and have barely been noticed by psychologists and neuroscientists. Some requirements for such models, are described, including aspects of our ability to interact with complex 3 -D structures and processes that extend Gibson's ideas concerning action affordances, to include proto-affordances, epistemic affordances and deliberative affordances. Some of what a child learns about structures and processes starts as empirical then, as a result of reflective processes, can be recognised as necessary (e. g., mathematical) truths. These processes normally develop unnoticed in young children, but provide the basis for much creativity in behaviour, as well as leading, in some, to development of an interest in mathematics. We still need to understand what sort of self-monitoring and self-extending architecture, and what forms of representation, are required to make this possible. This paper does not presuppose that all mathematical learners can do logic, though some fairly general form of reasoning seems to be required...|$|R
