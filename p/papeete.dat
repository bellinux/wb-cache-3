5|$|After withdrawing, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau rendezvoused with Nürnberg and Titania at Nuku Hiva, {{where they}} resupplied and their crews took shore leave {{before moving on}} to meet the rest of the {{squadron}} at Easter Island. Although the Germans had destroyed the shipping at <b>Papeete</b> and wreaked havoc in the town, they had been denied their primary objective of seizing the French coal piles and replenishing their own stocks. Von Spee's raid allowed the British Admiralty to receive word on his position and heading, allowing them to inform Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the German intentions thus leading to the Battle of Coronel. Another effect was the reduction of ammunition available to the two German cruisers. The hundreds of shells fired by von Spee's ships at <b>Papeete</b> were irreplaceable. The depletion of ammunition {{as a result of the}} action at <b>Papeete</b> contributed to the German East Asia Squadron's failure to adequately defend itself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands against British battlecruisers. Lieutenant Destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during the defense of <b>Papeete</b> and for the loss of the gunboat Zélée. He was summoned back to Toulon under arrest to be court-martialled, but died of illness in 1915 before the trial. In 1918, Destremau was finally recognized for his actions at <b>Papeete</b> and was posthumously awarded the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
5|$|The French commander—Destremau—had {{ordered the}} coal piles {{burned at the}} start of the action and now smoke began {{billowing}} over the town. Zélée and Walkure were sighted and fired upon by the Germans. The French had begun to scuttle their vessels when the action had begun, but both were still afloat when Scharnhorst and Gneisenau began firing upon them and finished the two ships off. By now, most of the Papeete's inhabitants had fled and the town had caught fire from the German shelling, with two blocks of <b>Papeete</b> set alight. With the coal piles destroyed and the threat of mines in the harbor, von Spee saw no meaningful purpose in making a landing. Accordingly, the German admiral withdrew his ships from Papeete's harbor by 11:00. After leaving <b>Papeete,</b> the ships steamed out towards Nuku Hiva to meet Nürnberg, Titania, and colliers waiting there.|$|E
5|$|To {{keep the}} German high command informed, on 8 September von Spee {{detached}} Nürnberg to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. Nürnberg returned {{with news of}} the Allied capture of German Samoa, which had taken place on 29 August. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau sailed to Apia to investigate the situation. Spee had hoped to catch a British or Australian warship by surprise, but upon his arrival on 14 September, he found no warships in the harbor. On 22 September, Scharnhorst {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron arrived at the French colony of <b>Papeete.</b> The Germans attacked the colony, and in the ensuing Battle of <b>Papeete,</b> they sank the French gunboat Zélée. The ships came under fire from French shore batteries but were undamaged. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented von Spee from seizing the coal in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, French {{observers}} remarked favorably on the industriousness {{and intelligence}} {{of the people of}} Rurutu, as well as the success of Teuruarii in increasing revenues through maritime trade with neighboring islands. In 1899, Rurutu's annual exports were valued at 59,881 French francs, of which 37,919 were exported to the Tahitian port of <b>Papeete</b> - exceptionally high trade volumes in light of the relatively small size of the island and its population.|$|E
5|$|The German vessels {{were largely}} {{undamaged}} but the French lost their gunboat. Several of Papeete's buildings were destroyed and the town's economy was severely disrupted. The main strategic {{consequence of the}} engagement was the disclosure of the cruisers' positions to the British Admiralty, {{which led to the}} Battle of Coronel where the entire German East Asia Squadron defeated a Royal Navy squadron. The depletion of Scharnhorsts and Gneisenaus ammunition at <b>Papeete</b> also contributed to their subsequent destruction at the Battle of the Falklands.|$|E
5|$|The {{protectorate}} status had {{a negative}} effect on the island's trade with Tahiti. Ships from Rurutu, as from other protectorates, were considered foreign vessels at the ports of France and its overseas territories such as the Tahitian port capital of <b>Papeete,</b> Rurutu's nearest significant trading partner. Consequently, Rurutu's agricultural exports were subject to tariffs from which the exports of annexed territories were exempted. The economic disadvantages of the protectorate status became even more evident when France closed the Tahitian ports to all foreigners in 1899, including merchants from Rurutu, in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco. This disruption of trade between the two islands occurred in a period during which Rurutu became increasingly reliant economically on Tahiti. The growing prominence of Tahiti was evidenced in the activities of Teuruarii, who regularly visited <b>Papeete</b> for trade and entertainment. Teuruarii incurred much debt during these trips, and the need to pay off his creditors along with the restriction on trade prompted him to consider formal annexation to France.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla, {{originally}} a crop endemic to South America, {{was introduced in}} French Polynesia in 1848 by Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, a French commander in the Pacific. The admiral delivered several dozen specimens of the plant to the Tahitian Governor's garden in <b>Papeete.</b> A new variety of vanilla was subsequently developed {{in the area and}} came to be popularly known as Tahitian vanilla. This has special characteristics compared to the varieties such as Vanilla planifolia grown {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in respect to taste and scent. It has resulted in greater demand for the Tahitian variety.|$|E
5|$|In May 1900, Teuruarii journeyed {{with a few}} island dignitaries to <b>Papeete</b> on the {{invitation}} of Gustave Gallet, the French governor, to discuss the possibility of annexing the island. On May 11, Teuruarii signed a statement of annexation, officially bringing Rurutu under French control. Months later, the L'Aube brought Gallet to Rurutu, where he officially took possession of the island. On August 25, in a formal ceremony witnessed by Governor Gallet, the officers of the L'Aube, the French officials aboard, the former king and the native population, {{the flag of the}} protectorate was lowered and the French tricolor raised in its place; this moment, like the ceremony of 1888, was celebrated by a 21-gun salute from the French vessel.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September, Spee {{decided to}} use his two armored cruisers to raid the British base at Apia; he sent Nürnberg to escort the squadron's colliers to the {{rendezvous}} location. At the Battle of <b>Papeete</b> on 22 September, Nürnberg {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron bombarded the colony. During the bombardment, the French gunboat Zélée was sunk by gunfire from the German ships. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented von Spee from seizing the coal that lay in the harbor. By 12 October, the squadron had reached Easter Island. There they were joined by Dresden and Leipzig, which had sailed from American waters. After a week in the area, the ships departed for Chile.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} von Spee withdrew his ships, large {{portions}} of the town had been destroyed. Two entire blocks of <b>Papeete</b> had burnt to the ground before the fires were finally put out. A copra store, a market, and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno. While the majority of Papeete's civilians fled to {{the interior of the}} island as soon as the fighting began, a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire. Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk, there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage. Overall, the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2million francs' worth of property damage, some of which was recouped through the seizure of a German store on the island. In addition to the seizure of their property, several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee's squadron had caused. Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of copra prices in the region, as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to German merchants in the area who were now interned. Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee's squadron had left, when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin.|$|E

25|$|The OFC qualifiers {{took place}} from 23–26 February 2011 in <b>Papeete,</b> Tahiti, {{the place where}} the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup will be held. This was the third time the island hosted the qualifiers {{following}} 2006 and 2009, but the first in <b>Papeete,</b> as it had been held in Moorea previously. Once again, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Tahiti competed however Vanuatu were forced to withdraw due to being stranded at their airport because of a cyclone that had passed through the area. Despite the Solomon Islands looking the dominant team, winning both their games in the group stage, they lost to hosts Tahiti in the final, meaning {{for the first time since}} the qualifiers began in 2006, the Solomon Islands will not be competing in the World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Total {{population}} at the August 2012 census was 268,270 inhabitants. At the 2012 census, 68.5% {{of the population}} of French Polynesia lived on the island of Tahiti alone.

25|$|The church {{operated}} an LDS {{school that}} opened in 1914. It was closed during World War II and reopened in 1964. All classes were offered in French. The school was closed permanently in 1982 and the site later became the ground for the <b>Papeete</b> Temple. The church began offering home-study seminary in the 1970s to high school students.|$|E
25|$|Chinese, Demis, and {{the white}} populace are {{essentially}} concentrated {{on the island of}} Tahiti, particularly in the urban area of <b>Papeetē,</b> where their share of the population is thus much greater than in French Polynesia overall.

25|$|Paris-San Francisco {{became the}} first route UTA served in {{competition}} with Air France non-stop from Paris. Air France responded by extending some non-stop Paris-Los Angeles services to <b>Papeete,</b> Tahiti, which competed with UTA on Los Angeles-Papeete. UTA's ability to secure traffic rights outside its traditional sphere in competition with Air France {{was the result of}} a campaign to lobby the government to enable it to grow faster, becoming more dynamic and more profitable. This infuriated Air France.|$|E
25|$|King Pōmare II of Tahiti {{was forced}} to flee to Mo'orea in 1803; he and his {{subjects}} were converted to Protestantism in 1812. French Catholic missionaries arrived on Tahiti in 1834; their expulsion in 1836 caused France to send a gunboat in 1838. In 1842, Tahiti and Tahuata were declared a French protectorate, to allow Catholic missionaries to work undisturbed. The capital of <b>Papeetē</b> was founded in 1843. In 1880, France annexed Tahiti, changing the status {{from that of a}} protectorate to that of a colony. The island groups were not officially united until the establishment of the French protectorate in 1889.|$|E
25|$|Missionaries began {{teaching}} the French-speaking population beginning in 1955. The first French-speaking branch began in October 1957. The Hamilton New Zealand Temple {{was completed in}} 1958 {{and members of the}} church were able to travel there. An elementary school was built by the church in 1964 in Tahiti. In 1972 the first stake was organized in French Polynesia in Tahiti by President Spencer W. Kimball, and by 1983 the <b>Papeete</b> Tahiti Temple was finished and dedicated. The stake met in the meetinghouse that had been dedicated by Cowley. The church continued to grow there and Tahiti had its second stake created in 1982, followed by a third one in 1990.|$|E

This was the third time the island had hosted the competition, following the 2006 and 2009 tournaments in Moorea. Only {{the winners of the}} tournament, Tahiti, qualified to play in the 2011 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. The Solomon Islands were the favorites, having won the last 3 other qualifying championships in 2006, 2007 and 2009, but surprisingly lost in the final to Tahiti, despite beating them in the group stage.

25|$|Matthew Cowley {{dedicated}} a meetinghouse and a {{new mission}} home in <b>Papeete</b> just four years later on January 22, 1950. Later that same year, the church purchased a two-masted schooner {{that was used to}} aid in transporting missionaries and members from the various islands in French Polynesia. The boat was called Paraita which was the Tahitian name for Addison Pratt. The schooner was scheduled to take a group of members to Hawaii to visit the temple. President McKay instructed the members to cancel the trip in 1959. The boat sank a few days later and never would have made the trip. In 1963, the church experienced a tragedy when a boat that was transporting members back to Maupiti crashed. 15 church members were killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{route that}} Flavia took on her {{round the world}} voyages was Bremerhaven - Rotterdam - Tilbury - Curaçao - Panama Canal - <b>Papeete</b> - Auckland - Sydney - Melbourne - Fremantle - Aden - Suez Canal - Port Said - Cannes - Tilbury - Rotterdam - Bremerhaven. With {{the closure of the}} Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of the}} Six Day War, Flavia sailed via South Africa on her return to Europe. In 1968, the Cogedar Line was taken over by the Costa Line. She was {{refitted}} with her accommodation upgraded and a reduction in berths to 850 passengers transformed her into a cruise ship. She was used for cruises from Miami to the Bahamas until July 1977. She was then used for cruises in South America until April 1978, followed by Mediterranean cruises until September 1978, following which she resumed service on the Miami - Bahamas cruises. By the early 1980s, Flavia was showing her age and was becoming too expensive to operate.|$|E
25|$|Many of the toponyms in {{the island}} go back to Father Emmanuel Rougier, a French priest who leased the island from 1917 to 1939 and planted some 800,000 coconut trees there. He lived in his Paris house (now only small ruins) located at Benson Point, across the Burgle Channel from Londres (today London) at Bridges Point where he {{established}} the port. Joe's Hill was named by Joe English, who served as plantation manager for Rougier between 1915 and 1919. English was left alone on the island {{for a year and}} a half (1917–19), with two teens, when cholera broke out in <b>Papeete</b> and transport stopped due to the First World War. English was later rescued by Lord John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, admiral of the British Fleet. English, still thinking the war was in effect and that the ship was German, pulled his revolver on the British admiral, causing a short standoff until some explanation defused the situation. Upon his rescue, English's adventures were later chronicled in the Boston Globe.|$|E
25|$|The German cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{hastened to}} Samoa after Admiral von Spee {{learned of the}} occupation. He arrived off Apia on 14 September 1914, {{three days after the}} {{departure}} of the last of the Allied cruisers and transports. The approach of the German ships was observed and the New Zealanders promptly manned their defences while many civilians, fearing exchanges of gunfire, made for the hills. By this stage artillery has been set up on the beach but there was no exchange of gunfire. One historian, Ian McGibbon, wrote that this was likely due to von Spee's fears of damage to German property should he open fire. Instead, von Spee steamed off and landed a small party further down the coast and learned from a German resident there the apparent strength of the occupation. Patrols dispatched to the area later interned the German resident. According to the historian J. A. C. Gray, von Spee considered a landing by the forces under his control would only be of temporary advantage in an Allied-dominated sea and so the German ships then made for Tahiti, a French possession. Here, not having to be concerned with the welfare of the local population and their property, von Spee would direct the bombardment of <b>Papeete.</b> He then rejoined the rest of his fleet and headed for South America.|$|E
500|$|The Bombardment of <b>Papeete</b> {{occurred}} in French Polynesia when German warships attacked on 22 September 1914, during World War I. The German armoured cruisers [...] and [...] entered {{the port of}} <b>Papeete</b> {{on the island of}} Tahiti and sank the French gunboat [...] and freighter Walkure before bombarding the town's fortifications. French shore batteries and a gunboat resisted the German intrusion, but were greatly outgunned. The main German objective was to seize the coal piles stored on the island, but these were destroyed by the French {{at the start of the}} action.|$|E
500|$|The French had no heavy {{defenses}} at <b>Papeete</b> but {{had been}} warned that von Spee's squadron might raid Tahiti and that a German squadron had been sighted off Samoa. Although <b>Papeete</b> was {{the capital of the}} French Settlements in Oceania, by 1914 it had become a colonial backwater, lacking a wireless station and having a garrison of only 25 colonial infantry and 20 gendarmes. In order to bolster the town's defenses, Lieutenant Maxime Destremau—commander of the old wooden gunboat [...] and the ranking officer at Papeete—had his ship's [...] stern gun and all of her [...] and [...] guns removed from his vessel and placed ashore to be used in place of Papeete's antiquated land batteries. Several Ford trucks were turned into impromptu armored cars by mounting them with Zélées 37-mm guns and 160 sailors and marines drilled in preparation to repel any German attempt at landing. Zélée retained only her 100-mm bow gun and 10 men under the ship's second in command. In addition to the gunboat and harbor fortifications, the French also had at <b>Papeete</b> the unarmed German freighter Walkure, which had been captured by Zélée {{at the start of the}} war. Despite the French preparations, the two German cruisers were more than a match for the forces Destremau commanded at <b>Papeete.</b> Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau heavily outgunned Zélée, each being armed with eight [...] guns, six [...] guns, eighteen [...] guns, and four torpedo tubes. Von Spee's forces also outnumbered the French with over 1,500 sailors aboard their vessels, more than enough to form a landing party and overwhelm the forces Destremau had to oppose them.|$|E
500|$|Von Spee {{decided to}} raid <b>Papeete</b> in Tahiti {{on his way}} to {{rendezvous}} {{with the rest of his}} squadron at Easter Island. The French held over [...] of high-quality Cardiff coal at the port, and von Spee hoped to seize the coal piles to replenish his squadron's supply. Additionally, von Spee aimed at destroying what allied shipping he could find in the harbour, and thought the raid might help raise his men's morale. Von Spee intended to coal at Suwarrow Atoll before sailing to <b>Papeete,</b> but was prevented by foul weather. Instead, von Spee decided to take Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and attempt to resupply at Bora Bora while Nürnberg and Titania were dispatched to Nukuhiva to guard the fleet's colliers. The German admiral intended to keep his vessels' identities secret by disguising them as French ships, flying French flags, and only allowing French- and English-speaking members of his crew contact with the Frenchmen present there. Von Spee managed to replenish his food stores using gold seized by Titania and Nürnberg during their raid of Fanning, and was able to discover the strength of the French military in the region as well as the exact size and positions of the coal piles at <b>Papeete.</b>|$|E
500|$|To {{keep the}} German high command informed, on 8 September Spee {{detached}} Nürnberg to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries.

Spee had hoped to catch a British or Australian warship by surprise, but upon his arrival on 14 September, he found no warships in the harbor. Spee decided against attacking the Allied troops ashore, since doing so would risk killing Samoans and damaging German property. On 22 September, Scharnhorst {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron arrived at the French colony of <b>Papeete.</b> The Germans attacked the colony, and in the ensuing Battle of <b>Papeete,</b> they sank the French gunboat Zélée. The ships came under fire from French shore batteries but were undamaged. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented Spee from seizing the coal in the harbor. Spee then continued across the Pacific, passing through the Marquesas Islands, where his ships acquired supplies including fresh meat by barter, purchase, or confiscation. On 12 October, the squadron reached Easter Island, where it was reinforced by Leipzig, , and four more colliers. Spee's ships were off the coast of Chile by 1 November, when he learned that the British cruiser [...] was moored in Coronel, ostensibly alone; he decided to try to sink the ship.|$|E
