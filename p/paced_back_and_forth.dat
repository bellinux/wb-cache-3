500|$|Days {{before the}} battle a {{telegraph}} cable was laid between Fortress Monroe, which overlooked Hampton Roads, and Washington. Washington was immediately {{informed of the}} dire situation after the initial battle. [...] Many were now concerned Virginia would put to sea and begin bombarding cities such as New York while others feared she would ascend the Potomac River and attack Washington. In an emergency meeting among President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary Welles and other senior naval officers, inquiries were made about Monitors ability to stop Virginias prospect of further destruction. When the temperamental Stanton learned that Monitor had only two guns he expressed contempt and rage as he <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> further increasing the anxiety and despair {{among members of the}} meeting. Assurances from Admiral Dahlgren and other officers that Virginia was too massive to effectively approach Washington and that Monitor was capable of the challenge offered him no consolation. After further deliberations Lincoln was finally assured but Stanton remained almost in a state of terror and sent telegrams to various governors and mayors of the coastal states warning them of the danger. Subsequently, Stanton approved a plan to load some sixty canal boats with stone and gravel and sink them in the Potomac, but Welles was able to convince Lincoln at the last moment that such a plan would only prevent Monitor and other Union ships from reaching Washington and that the barges should only be sunk if and when Virginia was able to make her way up the Potomac.|$|E
500|$|Throughout January 1944, AirSols {{aircraft}} {{based in}} the Solomon Islands and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft based on Kiriwina kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul. Under steady and relentless pressure, the Japanese air defence began to weaken, allowing a landing {{to be made on}} 15 February by New Zealand troops on the Green Islands, which lie little more than [...] from Rabaul. On 16 and 17 February, the US Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 attacked the main Japanese base at Truk. Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul. Meanwhile, on 13 February, General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands, codenamed Operation Brewer, which was now scheduled for 1 April. Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division; No.73 Wing RAAF, providing close air support; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the US Marines' 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion; and US Naval Construction Battalions ("Seabees") to build the naval base—a total of 45,000personnel. However, on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bombers flew low over Los Negros. The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated. Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force. According to Kenney: [...] "The General listened for a while, <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as I kept talking, nodded occasionally, then suddenly stopped and said: That will put the cork in the bottle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gromyko was {{appointed}} Soviet {{ambassador to the}} United Kingdom at a June 1952 meeting with Joseph Stalin in the Kremlin. Stalin <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> as normal, telling Gromyko {{about the importance of}} his new office, and saying [...] "The United Kingdom now has the opportunity to play a greater role in international politics. But it is not clear in which direction the British government with their great diplomatic experience will steer their efforts [...] This is why we need people who understand their way of thinking". Gromyko met with Winston Churchill in 1952 not to talk about current politics but nostalgically about World War II. Gromyko met Churchill again in 1953 to talk about their experiences during World War II before returning to Russia when he {{was appointed}} Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E

2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw {{the reflection of the}} twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E

60|$|Then indeed did Numa roar. Angry, threatening, hungry, he <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{beneath the}} taunting ape-man.

60|$|He {{walked by}} on the {{opposite}} side of the street, and climbed the mesa back of the house to spy upon it from the rear, hoping to detect his loved one walking about under the pear-trees.

60|$|As he searched, Clayton {{continued}} {{to call the}} girl's name aloud, but the only result of this was to attract Numa, the lion.

This put an end to his search for the balance of the afternoon, as the lion <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> beneath him until dark.|$|E
60|$|But Unc' Billy wasn't. He was {{so anxious}} that he couldn't keep still.

5000|$|The town of Angola, Indiana {{has several}} {{locations}} where residents have {{claimed to have}} sighted specters.

60|$|Moving {{to and fro}} {{throughout}} the temple were sleek black Waz-don slaves, fruits of the Ho-don raids upon the villages of their less civilized neighbors.

60|$|Pesita {{was looking}} questioningly at Byrne. Since the gringo had {{returned}} from Cuivaca with the loot of the bank and turned the last penny of it over to him the outlaw had looked upon his new captain as something just short of superhuman. To have robbed the bank thus easily while Villa's soldiers <b>paced</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> before the doorway seemed little short of an indication of miraculous powers, while to have turned the loot over intact to his chief, not asking for {{so much as a}} peso of it, was absolutely incredible.|$|E
60|$|His efforts {{had been}} for naught.
