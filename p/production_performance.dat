500|$|The {{music of}} Human Revolution was {{composed}} by Michael McCann, {{who worked on}} the score from 2008 to 2011. McCann also handled <b>production,</b> <b>performance,</b> mixing and arranging. Additional arrangements were done by Francois Arbour and Eric Arvisais. Vocals were provided by Andrea Revel and Courtney Wing. McCann, when comparing Human Revolution with his prior work on Ubisoft's , stated that the latter could be scored more like a feature film due to its linear nature, while Human Revolutions non-linear approach to both gameplay and story made composition more challenging. McCann's music for Human Revolution was focused around the game's multilayered dualistic themes, which he described as [...] "technology/nature, past/future, wealth/poverty", all of which were encompassed by the general transhumanist theme. McCann and sound director Steve Szczepkowski initially started out using dark electronic scoring typical of the cyberpunk genre, but during the three-year period he worked on the game the music gradually became more [...] "organic". He was influenced by the visuals' Renaissance styling, convincing him to blend organic and traditional cyberpunk elements. The electronic elements were influenced by the film music of John Carpenter, Vangelis, and the band Tangerine Dream. The acoustic mood elements were inspired by the work of Lisa Gerrard, Ennio Morricone and Elliot Goldenthal. Outside films, he was strongly influenced by electronic bands and musicians, such as Amon Tobin and the band Massive Attack.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the late}} {{introduction}} of the GSX, a prototype was displayed at the Chicago Motor Show in February 1970, very little model specific advertising was done. The GSX did not appear {{in any of the}} model catalogs for 1970 having been released long after catalog printing had been completed. Only 678 GSXs were produced {{in the second half of}} the 1970 model year beginning in March 1970. Just 278 were equipped with the standard 455, a further 400 purchasers selected the optional Stage 1 performance package. The performance of a GSX (or GS) Stage-1 is comparable to and possibly surpasses that of the HemiCuda, but in a much more luxurious car. The impressive performance is partly due to the light weight of the 455 which is roughly [...] less than the 426 Hemi or Chevrolet 454. At 510lb-ft the Buick 455 produced the highest torque output of any American <b>production</b> <b>performance</b> car, a record held for 33 years until finally surpassed by the Series 2 V10 Viper in 2003.
