40|$|Model {{building}} with rigid D 6 -branes on the Type IIA orientifold on T 6 /Z 2 ×Z′ 6 with discrete torsion is considered. The systematic search for models of parti-cle physics is significantly reduced by proving new symmetries among different lattice orientations. Suitable rigid D 6 -branes without matter in adjoint and symmetric representations are classified, and SO(2 N) and USp(2 N) gauge factors on orientifold invariant D 6 -branes are distinguished {{in terms of}} their discrete Wilson line and displacement parameters. Constraints on the non-existence of exotic <b>matter</b> <b>prohibit</b> global completions of local MSSM and left-right symmetric models, while globally defined supersymmetric Pati-Salam models are found.

Last but not least, it is shown that for all three two-torus volumes of about the same order of magnitude, gauge coupling unification at one-loop can be achieved, while for highly unisotropic choices a low string scale in the TeV range is compatible with the observed strengths of gauge and gravitational couplings. ar X i...|$|R

Several methods have been proposed to counter this difficulty, but their results are widely discrepant. In this paper, I revisit one of these methods, which relies on {{the relation between the}} halo density and the decrease of the bar pattern speed. The latter is routinely characterized by the ratio R of the corotation radius R-CR to the bar length L-b, R = R-CR/L-b. I use a set of N-body+SPH simulations, including subgrid physics, whose initial conditions cover a range of gas fractions and halo shapes. The models, by construction, have roughly the same azimuthally averaged circular velocity curve and halo density and they are all submaximal, i. e. according to previous works, they are expected to have all roughly the same R value, well outside the fast bar range (1. 2 +/- 0. 2). Contrary to these expectations, however, these simulations end up having widely different R values, either within the fast bar range or well outside it. This shows that the R value cannot constrain the halo density, nor determine whether galactic discs are maximal or submaximal. I argue that this is true even for early-type discs (S 0 s and Sas) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectral}} range of extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV or EUV) {{is an active}} area of research incorporating many scientific fields such as microscopy, lithography or reflectometry. During the last decade, {{a lot of effort}} has been put into transferring many of the known techniques developed at linear accelerators into the laboratory using discharge-produced plasmas (DPPs) or laser-produced plasmas (LPPs) as an alternative light source. In particular, the semiconductor industry is in need of on-site tools in the shorter wavelength range for production and inspection of structured surfaces with nanometer resolution. Here traditional charge coupled device (CCD) image sensors are inapplicable as detectors because of the strong absorption of XUV by <b>matter</b> <b>prohibiting</b> any generation of electron-hole pairs inside a deep lying p-n junction. As a solution, two-dimensional backthinned CCDs are available in the market offering high sensitivity to XUV light. Although for many applications a one-dimensional line scanning image sensor would be sufficient, they are non-existent for XUV. It is only lately that manufacturers have started to adopt the principle of backthinning to CCD line sensors to enhance sensitivity in the long wavelength UV range (> 200 nm). Here we show that generally these compact sensors offer good quantum efficiencies in the XUV which make them a candidate for many spectroscopic applications and future industrial inline inspection tools for which costly two-dimensional CCDs are oversized. We have successfully implemented a compact sensor device into a laboratory XUV spectrometer and reflectometer. Our measurements compare the quantum efficiency of a state-of-the-art XUV array CCD to a phosphor-coated line sensor and a new backthinned line sensor. Additionally, we show recorded spectra from a laboratory DPP source to demonstrate the potential {{of a wide range of}} applications...|$|R

Products including inhalants are cheap, accessible, legal substances and are prevalently used in community. The prevalence of inhalant use in secondary schools in Turkey is about 5. 1 %. Inhalant substance dependence is generally observed within 14 - 15 age group. Age at first use could be as low as 5 to 6 years of age. Substance dependence is more probable in adults working in substance existing places. Inhalant usage is common in disadvantaged groups, children living in street, people with history of crimes, prison, depression, suicide, antisocial attitudes and conflict of family, history of abuse, violence and any other drug dependence and isolated populations.

40|$|At the United Nations Conference on International Organization in April 1945 South Africa {{affirmed the}} {{principle}} of {{respect for human rights}} in a Preamble it proposed for inclusion in the Charter of the United Nations. The proposal was approved and the Preamble was accorded binding force. While South Africa participated in the earliest attempts of the United Nations to draft a bill of rights, it abstained on the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights because its municipal legislation was incompatible with some articles. Similarly, South Africa did not become a party to the international human rights instruments the declaration inspired, and avoided an active role in their elaboration. Subsidiary organs of the General Assembly undertook several studies on discrimination in the field of human rights. They provided evidence that racial discrimination in South Africa intensified after the National Party came to power in May 1948 on the platform of apartheid and diverged from global trends in humanitarian law. The gap between the Union and the United Nations widened. At the first General Assembly in 1946, India successfully asked that the treatment of persons of Indian origin in South Africa be inscribed on the agenda. The Indian question was later subsumed in the charge that South Africa's racial policies violated the Charter and in 1952 the General Assembly began to discuss apartheid. South Africa protested that these actions contravened Charter Article 2 (7), which <b>prohibited</b> intervention in <b>matters</b> of domestic jurisdiction, and were ultra vires. Criticism of the Union increased in intensity, until in 1960 it culminated in calls for economic and diplomatic sanctions. Research shows that South Africa was the main architect of its growing isolation, since it refused to modify domestic policies that alienated even its potential allies. Moreover, it maintained a low profile in United Nations debates on human rights issues, abstaining on all substantive clauses in the two draft covenants on human rights. These actions were interpreted as lack of interest in global humanitarian affairs. South Africa had little influence on the development of customary international law in the field of human rights but was a catalyst in the evolution of international machinery to protect them.

Nadležnost Međunarodnog kaznenog tribunala za bivšu Jugoslaviju glede upotrebe nekih zabranjenih vrsta oružja i ciljeva u akcijama NATO-a. Most legal {{writers in}} their {{writings}} confuse notions of humanitarian intervention, intervention of a State {{in order to}} protect its citizens abroad and humanitarian relief. The use of force for protection of citizens abroad, when they are in immediate danger of losing their lives or suffering serious injury, can exceptionally be justified by a state of necessity as regulated in article 33 of Drafts Article on State Responsibility by the International Law Commission. Further conditions for such an intervention are provided in the wording of the US State Secretary Daniel Webster in the Caroline case of 1837, relating to the self-defence. Actions of humanitarian relief have nothing unlawful in their character, but a question can arise of the obligation of parties to a conflict to receive and allow its distribution to all who are in need. The 1949 Geneva Conventions and the First Protocol of 1977, provide in this respect a legal obligation of all parties to international armed conflicts. Such relief actions can be imposed as obligation to parties to internal armed conflicts as well, by UN Security Council resolutions based on Chapter VII of the UN Charter. In the view of this author there is no rule of positive international law granting a “right” to foreign States to intervene by force, either in protection of their citizens, or when a humanitarian intervention is required. The matter can only be of exceptional circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the use of force, which otherwise remains <b>prohibited.</b> When the <b>matter</b> is of humanitarian intervention, circumstances precluding the wrongfulness would, according to this author, be the following: (i) There should be a situation of systematic, repeated and widespread commission of international crimes by a State authority against its own citizens. Special problems are created to the international community by widespread practices of ethnic cleansing. (ii) Such a situation constitutes itself a “threat to the peace” calling for an enforcement action by the Security Council according to the Chapter VII of the UN Charter. (iii) In case that the Security Council fails in its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security and when there are no other means, a group of States or an organization can undertake a humanitarian intervention by use of force in order to stop the commission of crimes. In these circumstances it acts as de facto organ of the entire international community of States. (iv) In these extreme and exceptional circumstances, States taking part in such an action cannot obtain any advantages in their profit. (v) Collective intervention by a group of States should have priority over intervention by a single State acting in the name of several other States or an or ganization. However, even such an intervention should have priority over humanitarian intervention undertaken by a State acting in its own name. (vi) It is self-evident that in performing a humanitarian intervention there should not be committed international crimes especially against protected persons, including civilian population. The situation in Kosovo up to 1999, and all attempts which failed in order to find a just and lasting solution for that problem, have fully justified the above criteria for a lawful humanitarian intervention which was undertaken by the NATO forces against the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It seems, however, that the responsible persons in the NATO were not aware of the competence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to investigate to prosecute persons responsible for use of prohibited arms and for destruction of some objects. Some of these unlawful acts constitute grave breaches of the 1959 Geneva Conventions and violations of laws and customs of war. In these circumstances it is the legal duty of the Prosecutor to undertake an investigation. In case that he even fails in his duty, there are no statutory limits in respect of the crimes provided in the Statute of the Tribunal...|$|R
