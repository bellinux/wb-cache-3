40|$|Abstract Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} (IIF) {{plays an}} important role in immunological and immunometric assays for detecting and measuring autoantibodies. This technol-ogy was the first multiplex method used to detect cardinal autoantibodies for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. Over the last 20 years, research has enabled the progressive identification of cell and tissue autoantigens which are the target of autoantibodies originally detected by IIF. Accordingly, newer immunometric methods, capable of measuring concentrations of specific autoantibodies direc-ted against these autoantigens, allowed for a gradual replacement of the IIF method in the autoimmunology laboratory. Currently, IIF remains the method of choice only in selected fields of autoimmune diagnostics. Fol-lowing the recent statement by the American College of Rheumatology that the IIF technique should be considered as the standard screening method for the detection of ANA, the biomedical industry has developed technological solu-tions which significantly improve automation of the pro-cedure, not only in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>substrates</b> and slides, but also in microscope reading.
