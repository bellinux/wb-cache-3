25|$|The reverse parking {{procedure}} is virtually {{identical to the}} parallel parking procedure. The driver approaches the parking space, moving forward and turning, positioning the car in place for backing into the reverse <b>parking</b> <b>spot.</b> The vehicle rear has to be facing the reverse <b>parking</b> <b>spot,</b> allowing the backup camera to 'see' the parking area. Shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the driver selects the reverse park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing {{the corner of the}} <b>parking</b> <b>spot,</b> and adjustment arrows; reverse parking adds rotation selection). After checking the parking space and engaging the reverse park procedure, the same exact parking process occurs as the car reverse parks into the spot.|$|E

25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a <b>parking</b> <b>spot</b> in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a <b>parking</b> <b>spot</b> in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

They also confide that Michael and Samir's jobs will be eliminated; Peter relays this news to them, and the trio decide to get even by infecting Initech's accounting system with a computer virus designed to divert fractions of pennies into a bank account. They believe that such transactions are small enough to avoid detection but {{will result in a}} substantial amount of money over time. Peter takes one last item on Michael and Samir's last day at Initech: a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three take to a field and smash to pieces to vent their frustration.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{was best}} known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to {{demonstrate}} the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast {{all the way back to}} his <b>parking</b> <b>spot</b> in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.|$|E

On the December 28 SmackDown, Mendes managed Primo in a loss to Brodus Clay. After the match, Mendes confronted Clay and was assaulted by The Funkadactlys (Naomi and Cameron).

500|$|With this information, however, {{several members}} of the group of conspirators watched Turner's office, home and car, and {{discussed}} methods to assassinate him, hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into Rajneeshpuram. Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked, in Portland, Oregon, but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home. After spending multiple nights watching Turner's house, the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work, or in front of his home. Turner had a reserved <b>parking</b> <b>spot</b> in a federal garage underneath Terry Schrunk Plaza in Portland, Oregon.

500|$|Although {{he noted}} that {{his support for the}} majority's opinion was [...] "unqualified", Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion in which he questioned the propriety of solitary confinement. Justice Kennedy observed that since 1989, Ayala had spent more than twenty five years in solitary confinement. Although the conditions of Ayala's confinement were not established in the record, Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "it is likely [...] has been held for all or most of the past 20 years or more in a windowless cell no larger than a typical <b>parking</b> <b>spot</b> for 23 hours a day; and in the one hour when he leaves it, he likely is allowed little or no opportunity for conversation or interaction with anyone". Justice Kennedy wrote that [...] "he human toll wrought by extended terms of isolation long has been understood, and questioned, by writers and commentators" [...] and that solitary confinement [...] "bears a further terror and peculiar mark of infamy". Justice Kennedy conceded that [...] "in some instances temporary, solitary confinement is a useful or necessary means to impose discipline and to protect prison employees and other inmates", but that courts should ultimately determine [...] "whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them".|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} reliably detecting <b>parking</b> <b>spots</b> in semi-filled <b>parking</b> lots using onboard laser line scanners. In order to identify <b>parking</b> <b>spots,</b> one needs to detect parked vehicles and interpret the parking environment. Our approach uses a supervised learning technique to achieve vehicle detection by identifying vehicle bumpers from laser range scans. In particular, we use AdaBoost to train a classifier based on relevant geometric features of data segments that correspond to car bumpers. Using the detected bumpers as landmarks of vehicle hypotheses, our algorithm constructs a topological graph representing {{the structure of the}} parking space. Spatial analysis is then performed on the topological graph to identify potential <b>parking</b> <b>spots.</b> Algorithm performance is evaluated through a series of experimental tests...|$|R
