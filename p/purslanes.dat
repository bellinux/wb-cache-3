40|$|Polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) are crucial {{for human health}} and {{nutrition}} since they cannot be synthesized {{in the body and}} hence must be provided by the diet. Portulaca oleracea L. (purslane) is the eighth most commonly distributed plant in the world. It is a heat- and drought-tolerant plant and our previous study demonstrates that their leaf provide high amounts of antioxidants, minerals, vitamins and proteins. In the present study, we set out to characterize the oxalic acid and the fatty acid composition (particularly the ratio 3 / 6) in saline stress studies on two purslane cultivars cultured in a hydroponics system, with the main goal of determine the effects of the exposure of the plant to saline environment on those constituents in leaves (edible part of the plant). Five saline treatments were applied: 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 mmol NaCl; the control had only the base nutritive solution. In both <b>purslanes,</b> a sharp decrease on total oxalic acid concentration was observed when the salt concentration increase in the hydroponic solution after 30 days of saline stress. Palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) and linolenic acid (C 18 : 3) here the major fatty acids detected and they amounts slightly increases with the increase of salinity until approximately 40 mmol of NaCl. The ratio of ω 6 to ω 3 was similar in both cultivars and did not change with saline stress. Consumption of purslane will contribute to dietary ω 3 PUFA intake, with benefits to human health...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the protective effect of <b>purslane</b> with carbamazepine treatment. Methods: Male albino rats were modulated by pilocarpine to be epileptic.

40|$|Common <b>purslane</b> (Portulaca oleracea L.) is {{a summer}} annual with wide {{geographic}} and environmental distribution. <b>Purslane</b> is typically {{regarded as a}} weed in North America, but it is consumed as a vegetable {{in many parts of}} the world. One of the characteristics that make <b>purslane</b> difficult to control as a weed is its ability to vegetatively reproduce. Severed sections of <b>purslane</b> stem containing a node will produce adventitious roots from the cut end of the stem. Isoxaben and simazine were the only two effective preemergence herbicides for controlling <b>purslane</b> in our studies when applied at maximum or one-half maximum label rates. Of the 25 postemergence herbicides evaluated, fluroxypyr, triclopyr, dicamba, and metsulfuron-methyl were the most effective for controlling <b>purslane.</b> <b>Purslane</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ability to adapt to a broad range of environmental conditions is due, in large part, to its unique photosynthetic metabolism. Under well-watered conditions, <b>purslane</b> utilizes C 4 photosynthetic metabolism. However, <b>purslane</b> will shift to a CAM-like photosynthetic metabolism under droughty conditions, with nocturnal acid accumulation in the leaves and reduced CO 2 uptake. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) catalyzes the initial step in photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric CO 2 in C 4 and CAM plants. Regulation of PEPC is primarily via phosphorylation by PEPC kinase (PEPCK). For well-watered <b>purslane,</b> PEPC and PEPCK transcript abundance are indicative of C 4 metabolism, but in water-stressed <b>purslane,</b> PEPCK transcripts accumulate at night suggesting a shift in the phosphorylation pattern of PEPC to CAM-like metabolism. By understanding <b>purslane</b> 2 ̆ 7 s unique photosynthetic metabolism, we can gain insight into how it effectively adapts to water limiting environments. ...|$|R

Mice were randomly assigned to four groups: control group, NDEA group, NDEA + <b>Purslane</b> (100 [*]mg/kg) group, and NDEA + <b>Purslane</b> (200 [*]mg/kg) group. The animal of each group was given NDEA (100 [*]ppm) in drinking water. 1 [*]h later, <b>Purslane</b> dissolved in PBS was intragastrically administered for continuous seven days. The results showed that <b>Purslane</b> reduced the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in liver and serum. <b>Purslane</b> also reduced the contents of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) and restored the activity of superoxygen dehydrogenises (SOD) in serum. <b>Purslane</b> could obviously attenuate the hepatic pathological alteration. Furthermore, treatment with <b>Purslane</b> effectively inhibited the phosphorylations of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI 3 K), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα) and upregulated the expressions of NF-E 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) and heme oxygenase- (HO-) 1.

Portulaca oleracea (<b>Purslane)</b> may have protective effect against oxidative stress. Objective: <b>Purslane</b> ethanolic extract effects were evaluated on antioxidant indices and sex hormone in D-gal aging female mice. Materials and Methods: 48 female NMRI mice (25 - 35 gr) were randomly divided into, 6 groups: 1 - control (normal saline for 45 days), 2 - <b>Purslane</b> (200 mg/kg for last 3 weeks), 3 -D-gal (500 mg/kg for 45 days), 4 -D-gal+Purslane, 5 - Aging, 6 -Aging+Purslane. Sex hormones, antioxidants and malondialdehyde (MDA) level of ovary and uterus were measured. Histological assessment was also done. Results: In D-gal treated and aging animals, LH and FSH levels were significantly increased (p< 0. 001) while estrogen and progesterone levels were significantly reduced (p< 0. 001) {{in comparison with}} control group. MDA contents were significantly increased in ovaries and uterus of D-gal and aging groups (p< 0. 01). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p< 0. 001) and catalase (p< 0. 01) activities were significantly decreased in both aging and D-gal treated animals. Ovarian follicles were degenerated and atrophy on uterine wall and endometrial glands was observed in D-gal and aging groups. Alteration in hormone levels, MDA contents and antioxidant activity were significantly reversed by <b>Purslane</b> (p< 0. 05). <b>Purslane</b> could also improve histological changes such as atrophy of endometrium. Conclusion: These findings indicate that <b>Purslane</b> can attenuate aging alternations induced by D-gal and aging in female reproductive system...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>purslane</b> extract on performance, cecal microflora composition and immune responses of broiler chickens. One hundred and ninety two 1 –day old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were allocated randomly in 4 groups with 4 replicates to receive diets supplemented with 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 ppm of <b>purslane</b> extract for 42 days. Body weight gain, feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio were measured weekly and calculated for starter (1 - 21 d), grower (22 - 42 d) and overall periods (1 - 42 d). All diets were isocaloric, isonitrogenous and provided ad libitum. Antibody response against sheep red blood cell (SRBC) was measured on d- 28 and d- 42. At the age of 42 d, eight chicks per treatment killed aseptically for enumeration of cecal bacteria. The results of this experiment indicated that FI increased significantly with inclusion of <b>purslane</b> extract in grower and overall period (p≤ 0. 05). <b>Purslane</b> extract did not affect coliform and Escherichia coli populations but increased Lactobacillus population of cecal content significantly (p≤ 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} primary and secondary antibody titer against SRBC and no differences among the treatments for relative weight of thymus and spleen (p> 0. 05). Relative weight of bursa was affected with inclusion of <b>purslane</b> extract in the diet. Therefore, it was concluded that <b>purslane</b> inclusion had a positive significant effect on cecal microflora composition, but had no effect on immune response of broiler chickens...|$|R
