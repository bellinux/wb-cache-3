Naturally and artificially contaminated soil samples were used to study the recovery percentage of and variation in numbers of winter sporangia. The effects of soil type and inoculum density were studied.

'Plant Clinics' is a summary report of an expert consultation organized by the German Foundation for International Development (DES), in collaboration with CTA, the International Society of <b>Plant</b> <b>Protection</b> (ISPP) and the FAO. The meeting discussed the concept of 'establishing and operating plant clinics integrated with extension services in developing countries'. This booklet, however, is not merely a conference report. It is a practical guide on how to set up a plant clinic, its relation with extension and other crop <b>protection</b> <b>services,</b> and how to organize plant clinics into a country-wide network for more effective <b>plant</b> <b>protection.</b> It includes information on the size and scope of plant clinics in different circumstances the facilities required, procedures for processing inquiries, data collection and evaluation as well as specimen collection, processing, storage and despatch. The role of plant clinics within the overall framework of <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> is discussed in detail. Plant clinics can play a very important role by acting as a link between research and extension services. Interaction between clinic staff and crop advisers, and between clinic staff and research workers, must be strong and effective. There must be a two-way flow of information. Examples of country-wide networks of clinics show that they make it possible to trace the spread of pests and diseases over the whole country and lead to considerable savings in monitoring expenses. In addition, when organized on a country-wide scale, the clinics could form nuclei for more effective <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>services.</b> They could develop into regional crop protection centres which would serve several purposes, from identification of pests and pathogens, data collection and storage to monitoring disease and pest occurrence and training extension personnel.

30|$|Farmers {{who fail}} {{to comply with the}} legally binding PPP-specific risk {{mitigation}} measures {{for the protection of the}} environment are subject to fines. Key requirements concern the maintenance of untreated margins of fields adjacent to bodies of water and terrestrial habitats (e.g., marginal biotopes and forest margins). As a rule, however, the yield and crop quality is lower for these untreated areas of farmland, resulting in financial losses as a consequence of compliance with result from observing the spacing requirements [57]. Just as road speed limits tend to be ignored if there are no regular speed checks, there is a risk here too that without regular checks and the prosecution of transgressions, these “inconvenient” regulations will lose their effectiveness and the number of transgressions will increase. However, the extent to which <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> products are applied in accordance with the regulations in Germany is unclear. The results of the checks carried out by the Federal States are documented in annual reports on the <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> monitoring programme (www.bvl.bund.de/psmkontrollprogramm), but these do not provide a basis for drawing conclusions. The 2013 report shows that relatively few checks were carried out. Compliance with the spacing requirements for the protection of surface water bodies was only checked for 423 application areas of 421 agricultural holdings in Germany—less than 1 % of all German farms. The main reason for this is the understaffing of the Federal States <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>services.</b> However, the results from 2013 also point to non-compliance with legal requirements: Transgressions were identified in 10 % of the inspections, but the report does not specify whether these were intentional or due to a lack of relevant knowledge. Intentional breaches of the legal requirements must be countered with increased controls and the penalisation of all transgressions. However, if a lack of specialist knowledge is the root cause, then this calls for a review of the further training courses offered for professional PPP users seeking to obtain the legally required certificate of competence. A central module of the curriculum should explain the importance of nature conservation and environmental protection and the obligation to comply with the relevant legal stipulations.|$|R

Information on the periods of locusts hatching, growing to dominant species and their fertility {{can be used}} by <b>plant</b> <b>protection</b> <b>services</b> for the objective assessment of harmful species populations and predict their numbers in the region. Methods. The studies were conducted in the southern, central and northern regions of the republic. Studied material includes more than 6000 locust larvae and imago. Annually we conducted route study of locusts and multiple transect surveys which covered 36 most characteristic habitats. In the field and laboratories, we carried out experiments and studies on egg capsules and larvae. Results. The study revealed features of ontogeny and population dynamics of all the phases of development (egg, larva, imago) of five species of locusts (Omocestus haemorrhoidalis Ch., Chorthippus albomarginatus Deg., Chorthippus bigutullus L., Chorthippus apricarius L., Chorthippus mollis Ch.) in a variety of habitats. Conclusions. The average number of eggs in the egg capsules in the south region is more than in the north; the hatching of larvae is between 11 am and 4 pm, the average developmental period varies by age and region. From the hatched larvae (not more than 80 % of the number of eggs laid) usually considerably more than half dies. For the existence of a stable population of the species under study, the annual number of eggs should be 10 - 20 times the number of adults.
