5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds.

This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E

John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, joined the revolt, probably anticipating that it would further his own ambitions to the throne, but {{he was killed in}} the suppression of the uprising at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487. Warwick was implicated by two further failed invasions supported by Margaret using Perkin Warbeck <b>pretending</b> <b>to</b> be Edward IV's son Richard of Shrewsbury, and Warbeck's later planned escape for them both; Warwick was executed in 1499. Edward's execution may simply have been a precondition for the marriage of Arthur, Prince of Wales to Katherine of Aragon in 1501.|$|E
