40|$|To {{perform the}} {{femtosecond}} pump-probe spectroscopy under high pressure and low temperature, we constructed a measurement {{system with a}} <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>type</b> pressurecell installing an optical fiber bundle. The applied pressure was achieved to 6 kbar and the cell was cooled down to 15 K. Several demonstrations revealed that broadening and change of polarization of pulse (duration of ∼ 120 fs) owing to the dispersions in the fiber bundle are much small indicating that those have little influence on the measurement of carrier relaxation dynamics. In the measurements of κ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 Cu(NCS) 2 under 1. 3 kbar at 43 K, we have successfully detected the polarization anisotropy of the carrier relaxation dynamics and estimated the decay time {{in the same way}} as the normal measurement...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{main issue}} {{of this paper is}} to present results of {{strength}} and fatigue limit analysis applied to <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders.</b> It will also shows advantages of application of the up-to-date digital chain of engineering analysis within which CAD tools are being used as well as strength and fatigue limit analysis. Design/methodology/approach: Computer analysis of the strength analysis by using Finite Element Method (FEM) and fatigue life analysis by using Fatigue Life Prediction Method (FLP) were carried out. Findings: The most strenuous and at the same time opened to a damage risk cylinder zones were localized. Two construction solution possibilities of fixing the tongue stub with a hydraulic cylinder jacket were analysed. Finally Wöhler fatigue graphs for a different values of operating average pressure and stress concentration factor were presented. Research limitations/implications: Further researches should concentrate on modifications and analysis which will help to recognize the best possible zones of fixing a tongue stub with a hydraulic cylinder jacket in order to find the best configuration of construction kinematic pair. Practical implications: Modern engineering construction analyze require not only standard strength analysis but also calculation of fatigue life. Originality/value: The paper can be useful for person who performs strength analysis with a use of finite element method but has never used digital fatigue life analysis method. It might be also useful for a person interested in recognizing of both methods...|$|R
50|$|Both {{hydraulic}} and {{pneumatic power}} {{may be used}} to drive an actuator, usually the larger and more powerful types. As their internal construction is generally similar (in principle, if not in size) they are often considered together as fluid power actuators. Fluid power actuators are of two common forms: those where a linear piston and cylinder mechanism is geared to produce rotation (illustrated), and those where a rotating asymmetrical vane swings through a cylinder of two different radii. The differential pressure between {{the two sides of the}} vane gives rise to an unbalanced force and thus a torque on the output shaft. Vane actuators require a number of sliding seals and the joints between these seals have tended to cause more problems with leakage than for the <b>piston</b> and <b>cylinder</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R
40|$|An alpha type {{stirling}} engine of two <b>pistons,</b> two <b>cylinders</b> <b>type</b> is theoretically explained.

Limitations which doesn’t permit this engine to be used commercially in automotive applications are briefly analyzed and a study to overcome this limitations are made. A transient variation in engine working is explained by the alterations in engine’s components and via the coupling of an venturi based working fluid control system.

As the results, the leakage depended on correlation among density, viscosity, clearance area by the low temperature. In {{order to reduce the}} leakage, {{it was found that the}} air-tightness can be improved by minimizing contact surface between piston and cylinder, and also increasing pressure in-cylinder can reduce piston clearance. Among the proposed <b>piston</b> shapes, D <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> shape had the most air-tightness.

40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of dry granite {{has been studied}} at 300 to 1500 °C and at 6 to 22 Kb {{by means of a}} <b>piston</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>type</b> high pressure apparatus. Investigations have been made in both a non-powdered sample and a powdered sample in order to study intercrystalline effects. In a solid state, measurements were made in the three runs: the first heating run, the first cooling run and the second heating run. The activation energies for both samples at pressures up to about 10 Kb decreased in both the first cooling run and the second heating run compared with that in the first heating run, and at pressures more than 10 Kb, the conductivity curves in these three runs for the non-powdered sample agreed well with each other, while the proportionality constant for the powdered sample decreased by a factor of about 10 in both the first cooling run and the second heating run compared with that in the first heating run. Melting temperatures were determined from the discontinuous changes in the slope of the conductivity curve. The melting temperatures for dry granite increase with pressure and the melting intervals are about 200 °C. The increase in the {{electrical conductivity}} for the dry granite at the time of melting is about 2 orders of magnitude at high pressures experienced. In a liquid state, not only the activation energy, E, but also the proprotionality constant, o_ 0, increase with pressure in such ways as aE/aP= 4. 14 X 10 ^- 5 eV/bar and a log o_ 0 /aP= 1. 114 X 10 ^- 4 ohm^- 1 cm^- 1 /bar...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The water {{hydraulic}} reciprocating {{plunger pump}} driven by linear motor is suitable to deep sea application with high efficiency and variable control. Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed. And the control method and the performance were analyzed by simulation based on the AMESim model. The {{results show that the}} pressure and flow pulsation of <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump are much smaller than the valve type, even though the <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a valve distribution tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear motor reciprocating plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, and the flow pulsation rate is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007. These results contribute to the research on deep-sea water hydraulic power pack and direct drive pump with high efficiency and energy conservation...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. <b>Piston</b> <b>type</b> pumps are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this type of pump due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump. The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different types of pumps. From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> pump by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different types of pumps. QC 20121221 </p...|$|R
