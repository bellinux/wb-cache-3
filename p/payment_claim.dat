40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in to Australia fifteen years ago, statutory adjudication {{has become increasingly}} used by parties seeking to recover <b>payment</b> <b>claims</b> which are large in amount and technically and legally complex in nature. This has inevitably led to the formalisation of the adjudication process with parties often submitting, amongst other documents, expert witness reports to support their arguments. The increase in documentation that an adjudicator must consider {{poses a threat to}} the integrity of the adjudicator’s determination. This paper adopts a ‘black letter’ approach to distil the law concerning the way in which adjudicators should deal with expert reports, and reveals there are many pitfalls that an adjudicator should be aware of.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to make a comparative analysis of the operation of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW) (the NSW Act) and the Construction Contracts Act 2002 (NZ) (the NZ Act). Data were extracted from the NSW and NZ Acts, the NSW Department of Commerce and from the published books, reports and articles. Under the NSW Act, which is only concerned with <b>payment</b> <b>claim</b> disputes, adjudicators' jurisdiction is narrow and timelines for the submission of documents and for making an adjudication determination are short. Consequently, <b>payment</b> <b>claim</b> disputes are resolved rapidly and economically. The NZ Act on the other hand addresses all kinds of disputes. The jurisdiction of adjudicators is broad and the period for making an adjudication determination is about twice as long as in NSW. One of the strengths of the NSW Act is the ability to enter judgment for an adjudicated amount by simply filing an adjudication certificate in a court. One of the strengths of the NZ Act is in allowing the claimant to join the owner of a construction site in an adjudication; the adjudicator has a power to determine that the owner, who is an associate of the respondent, is jointly and severally liable with the respondent for the debt, and can approve of a charging order over the construction site owned by the owner.

Of the eight Australian Acts, two distinct legislative models can be discerned – what have been termed the ‘East Coast’ and ‘West Coast’ models.

40|$|It {{has been}} pointed out by IACM that the {{frequency}} of claims had {{increased by more than}} 30 % in the last 3 years. This is a worrying trend as such {{there is a need for}} a project manager and contract administrator to adopt an anticipatory management approach by regularly monitoring and analysing the claims in their projects. One way of doing this is by identifying the pattern or trend of construction claims that have been reported in a law report. Therefore, this research aimed to develop profile of contractual claim in term of type of head of claim, causes of claim, the parties involved, type of project, the standard form, time of claim occur and the origin of claim resolution. This research is limited to Malaysian law cases between 1999 until 2013. This research is based on secondary data on 70 cases. These cases are analysed to obtain the pattern of different field of profile. This study indicates the claim for payment has the highest percentage of all project. It also points out that the highest cause to the <b>payment</b> <b>claim</b> is due to the claim for work done.

40|$|Over {{the past}} twelve years, {{building}} and construction industry security of payment legislation has progressively come into force in all the Australian States and Territories. A primary objective of the legislation {{is to ensure that}} parties in the industry receive timely and fair payment for construction work carried out and/or related goods and services supplied. In order to achieve this objective, the legislation has focused on removing unfair contractual payment provisions, establishing a default right to progress payments in the absence of such contractual provision, and providing a swift, interim method of dispute resolution for payment claims {{in the form of an}} adjudication scheme. As such, a party who claims it is owed money under a construction contract can refer its <b>payment</b> <b>claim</b> to an independent adjudicator for a rapid determination of the amount (if any) due. Such a determination has binding effect, pending any eventual outcome from a more formal dispute resolution process such as litigation or arbitration. There is a lack of uniformity between the various Australian Acts. Many commentators distinguish two broad Australian legislative models, with key differences as to the scope of disputes covered, and the payment provisions and adjudication schemes prescribed. These inconsistencies have resulted in extra costs to the construction industry due to the unfamiliarity, uncertainty and confusion with security of payment laws and procedures in the various jurisdictions. Furthermore, the cost to the public purse of administering the legislation is exacerbated by the need to educate stakeholders about eight different regimes. The time is ripe for action to be taken to harmonise the legislation. Accordingly, this thesis proposes a legislative approach which is appropriate for adoption on a nationally uniform basis. The proposed approach is informed by a review, on the available evidence, of the performance of the Australian schemes, and an evaluation of the schemes by reference to a set of criteria drawn from the dispute resolution literature.

40|$|The {{proposals}} for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy within the Mid Term Review of the European Commission fueled {{the discussion about}} the future of direct payments to farmers. The EU Commission recommends a decoupling of animal and area payments from the production by granting these direct payments as a <b>payment</b> <b>claim</b> per hectare of eligible farm land. However, introducing area tied payments the intended shift of payments â€œfrom the produce to the producerâ€ will not take place, but instead an increased transfer of payments to land owners seems likely. This study therefore analyses the impacts of changing the area payments for grand cultures into person-tied payments on the cereals market of the European Union. For the assessment of impacts homogenous natural locations are clustered. The clustering is based on the regional reference yields for cereals and the share of arable land of total agricultural area in different farm types of the regions. For these production locations total production costs for cereals, oilseeds, and protein crops are calculated {{as a function of the}} farm size in order to estimate a cost reduction potential subject to structural changes within agriculture. The main results are the following: 1) Prerequisites are good for the EU to cultivate cereals since a major part of the production is located in highly competitive regions. Thus the EU would remain a net exporter of cereals even producing under world market conditions. However, maintaining the intervention price system while abolishing the set-aside obligation could lead to an uncontrolled increase of cereal stocks. 2) Even on highly competitive locations a significant structural change is required in order to reduce costs and to yield profits without area payments. Depending on the development of the world market prices for cereals the model calculations find a reduction of the work force between 20 000 and 50 000 labor units. 3) Without area payments the profits per hectare and thus the rents would decrease notably and therefore result in a corresponding income loss for land owners. An exclusive granting of payment claims to the producers would in particular affect former farmers, whose rental incomes contribute substantially to their pension plans.
