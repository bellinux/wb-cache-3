5|$|On 13 March, {{violence}} {{erupted in}} the Bekkersdal township in Gauteng, the scene of violent service delivery protests in 2013. Residents staged a protest over a planned ANC campaign in the area, barricading the streets with rocks and burning tyres and <b>pelting</b> ANC officials and police vehicles with stones.

5|$|In 1995 {{the team}} regressed further, losing even more players to free agency and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 5–11 record, their worst since Bill Parcells' first season in 1983. Quarterback Dave Brown was particularly disappointing, as he finished with just 2,814yards and 11 touchdowns on the season. Reeves went public with his desire to have more of a say in personnel matters. He controlled the team's free agency decisions, but feuded with General manager (GM) George Young who chose the team's draft picks.* Pervin. pg. 124 Lowlights were a 35–0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the Monday Night season opener, and the fans <b>pelting</b> the Charger sideline with snowballs in the season's final game.

The <b>pelt</b> classes were: A, pure white lustrous, long and even fleece, B, pure white with lower quality fleece, C, white with tan colour on outskirts of fleece, and D, white with tan fibres in the fleece. Sires in <b>pelt</b> classes A and B had heavier weaning weight of daughters than sires in other <b>pelt</b> classes. Daughters in <b>pelt</b> classes A and B were lighter at weaning than those in other <b>pelt</b> classes due to lowered selection intensity for weaning weight. The <b>pelt</b> class of sire did not significantly affect any of the production traits. No effect of <b>pelt</b> class of sire or <b>pelt</b> class of daughter on ewe fertility could be demonstrated.

5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began <b>pelting</b> each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious.

In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of the}} state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai Police {{announced}} its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February, which created an upsurge {{of violence in}} the state and led to two deaths. Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Jalna, Beed, Aurangabad and Latur. Shops, offices and other business establishments were shut down in different parts of Mumbai, as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested. Central Mumbai localities were most affected, especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park, the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena. The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area. A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing shop owners to down shutters in JB Nagar, Andheri. John suffered two rib fractures and bruises on his lungs. In Nashik, an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a Maharashtrian, died during a stone <b>pelting</b> on state-run buses by MNS supporters.

Van <b>Pelt,</b> the last elected Supervisor (mayor) of New Utrecht before it was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894.

Rogers and Calhoun leave with Kyle out the door, but rush back in when they hear Van <b>Pelt</b> scream.

After that Justinian set about killing Tiberius' brother, Heraclius who was perhaps the best general in the Empire.

As more body parts were dug up, near the premises, hundreds of local residents descended on the spot and alleged that there was an organ trade connection to the grisly killings of young children.

The type of fur and the amount of fur <b>pelts</b> required for this tax varied, depending on how available the <b>pelts</b> were. For example, {{in the beginning of the}} 17th century, yasak could be anywhere from five to twenty-two sables per man, but this dropped to three sable <b>pelts</b> by the mid-1600s due to decreases in the sable population. In 1601, Russian tax collectors in the Verkhoturye district collected about ten sables a year from every married man and five sables a year from every bachelor. Officials collecting the yasak tribute also demanded extra furs as [...] "gifts". Fox, squirrel, and ermine <b>pelts</b> were also accepted as yasuk after sable populations began to decline due to overhunting. Instead of one sable <b>pelt,</b> the following was accepted as its equivalent: one fox, glutton (relative of the marten), or otter pelt; two blue-fox pelts; sixteen polar-fox pelts; or one hundred squirrel <b>pelts.</b> The Russian government decided the amount of other <b>pelts</b> that were equivalent to the sable <b>pelt.</b>|$|R
