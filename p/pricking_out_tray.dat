50|$|Australian bluebells are {{generally}} easily propagated by division or root cutting. The seed {{is a very}} fine, black powder. It germinates readily {{in a few weeks}} and is best directly sown into tubes or cells as the seed and plant are very small and hard to separate and <b>prick</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{a pattern}} {{which would require}} fresh <b>pricking</b> <b>out,</b> and much skill; but Grisell thought she could {{accomplish}} it, and took her leave, kissing the Duchess's hand--a great favour to be granted to her--curtseying three times, and walking backwards, after the old training that seemed {{to come back to}} her with the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|In the United States {{the custom}} {{appears to have}} come from California, where a foreign saloon owner may have put <b>out</b> <b>trays</b> of simple hors d'oeuvres to serve his customers.

50|$|It {{is better}} to sow the ripe seed, after {{collection}} from the plant. Seed should be sown in trays within a cold frame, then the seedlings, can be <b>pricked</b> <b>out,</b> when they are {{large enough to be}} handled. They are then grown on within a greenhouse or cold frame, for another year. The new plants can then be planted out, in late spring or early summer.|$|R
60|$|The pattern needed much care, and Lambert induced Hans Memling himself, {{who drew}} {{it so that}} it could be <b>pricked</b> <b>out</b> for the cushion. In after times it might have been held a greater honour to work from his pattern than for the Duchess, who sent to inquire after it more than once, and finally desired that Mistress Grisell should bring her cushion and show her progress.|$|R

60|$|The night, {{now that}} they were close to the shore, was loud with the noise of running tide-water, and the air was heavy with the smell of mud and marsh, and over all the {{whiteness}} of the moonlight, with a few stars <b>pricking</b> <b>out</b> here and there in the sky; and all so strange and silent and mysterious that Barnaby could not divest himself of the feeling that it was all a dream.|$|R
50|$|Seed - sow {{spring in}} a cold frame. Germination is usually quick and good. <b>Prick</b> <b>out</b> the {{seedlings}} into individual pots {{as soon as they}} are large enough to handle and plant them out when in early summer. It is also possible to sow in situ, though this requires a lot more seed to produce the same amount of plants from a protected sowing. Division in late summer as the plant dies down.|$|R

This lasted two days, when Charles made his peace with his wife by solemnly promising to give up Lady Castlemaine, and to have from that time forward nothing more to do with her.|$|R

500|$|Both {{schools of}} thought in New York agreed that eating with one's fingers and not being afraid to get messy were {{integral}} {{to the culture of}} the beefsteak. No matter which type of beefsteak a diner attended, the main course was beef loin dipped in butter-based sauce and served thinly sliced on rounds of bread (day-old bread, at East Side beefsteaks; fresh toast, at West Side). Napkins were considered unnecessary; diners generally wore aprons with which they could wipe the grease off their hands. Food was dispatched from the kitchen laid <b>out</b> on <b>trays</b> and waiters continued bringing <b>out</b> <b>trays</b> until diners could literally eat no more (In his New Yorker article, Joseph Mitchell quotes one man as saying, [...] "I'm so full I'm about to pop. Push those kidneys a little nearer, if you don't mind."). Beer flowed freely during banquets in pre-prohibition years.|$|R

50|$|This {{is where}} mail is {{delivered}} to or received from when an employee has a desk. Each desk has {{a minimum of}} three letter <b>trays</b> labelled, in, <b>out</b> and pending. The in tray is where mail is received. The <b>out</b> <b>tray</b> is mail that is waiting to be collected. The pending tray is for documents that cannot be worked on at present because input from another person is required, or the requests are low priority. Sometimes additional trays are used for post, filing, dictation, etc. according {{to the needs of the}} individual or organisation.|$|R

Some retirees also maximize the display space found in these trunks by also incorporating shadow boxes into the lid compartment as well. An added benefit by having a shadow box in an antique trunk is all of the storage space for uniforms, hats, photograph albums, and any other service memorabilia collected over the years.|$|R

60|$|In {{a sort of}} dream, {{his heart}} sunk to the bottom, leaving the surface of him still, quite still, he rose with the panful of food, {{carefully}} balancing the child on one arm, the pan in the other hand. The silky fringe of the shawl swayed softly, grains and hay trickled to the floor; he went along a dimly-lit passage behind the mangers, where the horns of the cows <b>pricked</b> <b>out</b> of the obscurity. The child shrank, he balanced stiffly, rested the pan on the manger wall, and tipped out the food, half to this cow, half to the next. There was a noise of chains running, as the cows lifted or dropped their heads sharply; then a contented, soothing sound, a long snuffing as the beasts ate in silence.|$|R

As for the town and the Ordinary he had quitted such a short time before, so different were they from this present experience, it was as though they might have concerned another life than that which he was then enjoying.|$|R
