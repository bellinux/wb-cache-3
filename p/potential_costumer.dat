There are certain factors contributing to this and several real life barriers needing to be crossed to establish such a business for an outside entrepreneur. The purpose of this thesis {{is to find the}} factor that contributes to the growth in Internet users in developing countries and identify important barriers and difficulties that needs to be dealt with order to get a success for such a business. A statistical analysis including a correlation analysis and a regression model is used to identify the factors effecting Internet usage and technology penetrations. A case study of one of the countries in the selection is also done in order to reveal real life difficulties and conditions in a developing country. Results show that there are a few statistical significant variables to the Internet usage, these are "International bandwidth" and "GNI per capita". Although these have a low value of effect on Internet usage they are to be focused on when selecting a country to start up an Internet providing business. The case study revealed several factors that would be of interest for an ISP entrant. The status of equipment in use are that they are outdated and most people access the Internet through Internet kiosk were they pay a hourly rate for access. As they use the existing ISPs they are a <b>potential</b> <b>costumer</b> instead of competitor, this would help reaching the people that does not possess the equipment to access the Wi-Fi network directly. The need for a cash option in payment methods is also very significant as this is the main payment method used in developing countries. </p...|$|E

The company gained more market share and reputation.When technology is changing, companies tend to have more risk of losing <b>potential</b> <b>costumers</b> with other firms. For example, Blockbuster {{was one of the biggest}} and recognized DVD rental company around the world. When Netflix appeared in the industry, Blockbuster had to take a defensive strategy to fight against that strong competitor. The company launched an online platform where people had to pay a little amount of money and watch movies online. This strategy was useful at first but Netflix offers were preferred by a lot of people in economic terms. Blockbuster went into bankruptcy and liquidated its stores because they were losing so much money.|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} power grid is facing immense changes, {{the production of}} intermittent electricity is increasing {{at the same time}} as a big part of todays base load (mostly nuclear power) as well as the power reserve is in the process of being phased out. Due to these changes it is deemed that a larger amount of demand response will be needed in the near future. In order to accomplish this some sort of stimulus is required. Due to this accompanied by new indications from the regulatory authority Energimarknadsinspektionen Umeå Energi Elnät (UEEN) have started a process where they wish to investigate the consequences of abandoning their current pricing method in favor of a peak demand charge tariff. This new pricing method will increase the costumers ability to affect their electricity bill in addition to providing a higher degree of stimulus for demand response. This report is a part of that investigation and aims to quantify the costumers potential as well as the expected willingness for demand response och load shifting in adherence to the potential change in pricing methods. Accordingly. the question formulation for this thesis is as follows: What is the potential for load shifting, and a decreased power demand, due to a behavoiral change by the means of online measuring for households and business costumers in their testgroups respectively? What is the potential for load shifting, and a decreased power demand, by the means of enabling technology such as batteries, load limiting equipment, storage water heater etc. ? How large is the economic stimulus for the costumers of UEEN to achieve load shifting by changing their behaviour or invest in enabling technology? A selection of costumers in four different neighbourhoods (a total of 793 costumers) were chosen, and measured data regaring their peak power demand and their monthly electricity consumption were used in the calculations of this thesis. Based on this data and a literature study conclusions regaring the costumers demand response and load shifting potential were drawn.  Out if the 793 costumers included in this study the absolute majority (771 costumers) currently have a fuse corresponding to 16 - 25 A which is why only the results for these costumers is presented below. According to a theoretical assessment almost all of the costumers included in this study have a possibility to shift a fairly big part of their load. However, according to the literature study, it is reasonable to expect a load shift corresponding to 2 - 5 % of the costumers peak demand due to behavioural changes as a consequense of online measuring accompanied by a peak demand charge tariff. This would coincide with a load shift of 0, 1 - 0, 45 kW per household during the winter season, which, for the majority of costumers, can be translated into an annual saving of 0 - 200 SEK/household.   With regards to the expected load shift by the means of enabling technology batteries is not considered to, due to its unprofibility, be a solution that constumers can be expected to invest in in the nearby future. The potential load shift as a result of regulating electricity based heating systems however, is considered to be significantly larger and is deemed to amount to 2 - 5 kW depending on the heating system and its as well as the builidings built-in heat storage capacity. Based on this, some assumptions regarding the constumers heating systems and their current power demand the <b>potential</b> <b>costumer</b> savings is evaluated to 300 - 750 SEK per year...|$|E

This means that competitive companies need to have a website to represent their brand and to conduct business. E-commerce sites need to pay special attention to the usability of their sites, since it has such an impact on how <b>potential</b> <b>costumers</b> view their brand. Jakob Nielsen defines usability as a 2 ̆ 2 quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use 2 ̆ 2; he separates usability into five quality components: learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction. The current standard for testing usability involves having a number of users physically use a site in order to determine where they have trouble. This kind of usability testing can be time consuming and costly. In order to mitigate some of these costs, many tools are being developed to help automate the process. However, many automated tools evaluate only one of the five components, or simply look for errors. In an attempt to increase the reliability and scope of such testing, this paper investigates the effectiveness of automated usability evaluators and proposes methods for future researchers to test them. Specifically, this paper details an experiment performed to test the some freely available usability evaluators against more traditional usability evaluations. The experiment attempts to determine whether automatic usability evaluations might be used as a cheaper alternative to more traditional usability evaluations...|$|R

For the analysis I use critical political economy as a theoretical point of view. Material/Method: The material consists of interviews made from a qualitative method. The informants are delegates from the editorial staff of the Swedish National Radio’s channels P 3 and P 4. Main results: Even though Facebook is a good tool for spreading information and getting in touch with people, it still is a commercial network and that cannot be forgotten. Companies use the surveillance structure of Facebook to collect information from their <b>potential</b> <b>costumers</b> so that the users can see tailored advertising on the site. The presence of the Public Service-based Swedish National Radio makes the users want to stay at Facebook and keep them entertained so that the companies can gather more information and thus earn more money.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to seek {{solutions}} to the fact, {{that there is a}} great potential for energy savings in households, which is not realised in spite of the economic advantages related to these savings. Many technological solutions for bringing down energy use in households are well known and well tested, but barriers by the end users, such as lack of interest and lack of knowledge are {{standing in the way of}} implementing them. By creating a new commodity, energy services, it may be possible to overcome some of the traditional barriers. An Energy Service may for example be the provision of 20 C in the end user home, lighting and use of selected appliances. By offering this commodity, the number of decisions made by the individual household in order to meet their fundamental needs in a cost effective way is reduced. The research question; How can an efficient market for energy services aimed at households be build? takes its point of departure in the fact, that in Denmark, no companies offer such a service and no costumers are demanding it. Thus, there is no market for Energy Services and the commodity itself is undeveloped. The research field is both the demand side and supply side of such a market. On the demand side, the greatest potentials for savings in buildings are located. Ownership forms such as social housing, co-op apartments and self-owned apartments are researched with the aim of discovering, which ownership forms are suitable for a start-up market, and how energy services can be integrated in the decision-making process. On the supply side, it is researched how the energy service can be developed, how companies wishing to offer energy services (Energy Service Companies, ESCOs) can organise themselves, and how contact to <b>potential</b> <b>costumers</b> can be established. The conclusion of the project contains two elements. Firstly, three concepts for energy services have been developed. The first concept is an energy service based on well know technologies, where the main task for the ESCO is to provide methods of finance for energy savings, that the household would not else wise find attractive. The second concept involves the implementation of sophisticated technological solutions where the technology will help to further optimize the energy consumption and make it possible to consume electricity when the price is low. The last concept will focus on a better adaptation of household into the energy system by making it into an active player. The second part of the conclusion contains a range of recommendations on measures that should to be taken in order to create an efficient market for these concepts. The recommendations are aimed at policy makers, and stakeholders on both the supply side and demand side of the market. In a wider perspective, the conclusions from this project may also be used to develop markets for energy services aimed at other sectors than households...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturers of the {{automotive}} industry (Toyota, Honda, General Motors…) have established 2015 as the starting year for the introduction of commercial Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCV) in the Japanese, European and USA markets. To have a successful introduction of these FCVs, a network of hydrogen stations should be deployed. These hydrogen stations have to accomplished several safety requirements, i. e. not to reach a temperature higher than 85 °C in the gas inside the tank during the refuelling. This temperature limit of 85 °C is set for two reasons, to protect the materials of the tank from thermal degradation, {{and to be able}} to fill the tank (100 % state of charge) without surpass the maximum working pressure (125 % of the nominal working pressure). In addition, refuelling time shouldn't exceed 3 - 5 minutes, to be competitive with the conventional petrol stations and attractive for the <b>potential</b> <b>costumers.</b> To perform a refuelling within these two limits represents a technological challenge, since the faster the filling the higher the increase of temperature (this increase is even higher in a 70 MPa tank). For this reason it is necessary to study this process and try to figure out which are the important parameters in the temperature evolution during refuelling. The JRC-IET has developed a facility, GasTeF, for carrying out tests on full-scale high pressure vehicle’s tanks for hydrogen or natural gas. This facility is unique in Europe and it allows performing permeation tests and fast filling tests at a maximum pressure up to 850 bars (with helium or hydrogen). The facility allows performing test with different environmental temperatures, flowing rates and temperatures gas inlet. A big amount of data is collected during the tests thanks to the different sensors installed in the facility. In this paper we are going to show the effects of pre-cooled inlet gas on temperature evolution, depending on several parameters as type of tank or flow rate. The type of tank (metallic liner, type 3 or plastic liner, type 4) affects to temperature evolution during the filling, being reached lower temperatures in type 3 tanks due to their higher heat transfer coefficient. This different thermal behaviour implies different pre-cooling needs depending on the type of tank, which are studied and included in this paper. The flow rate plays an important role in the temperature evolution during a refuelling, being higher the temperature increase of the gas inside the tank with higher flow rates. The importance of the pre-cooling regarding the flow rate is considered in this study. The results of all the tests performed for the elaboration of this paper will be compared with the fuelling protocols shown in the SAE J 2601, where several inlet gas temperatures (- 40 °C, - 20 °C, 0 °C, and not pre-cooled gas) are considered. Previous studies have shown the need to pre-cool the gas to reach a 100 % of state of charge in refuelling with a filling time of less than 5 minutes. A discussion comparing the energy used to cool down the gas with the extra amount of hydrogen mass introduced in the tank due to the pre-cooling is included in this study. JRC.
