In particular it deals with the tools needed to express abstractions and their realizations; to this end it introduces {{the concept of a}} 'form ' to subsume the notions of type (mode), macro, <b>procedure,</b> <b>generator,</b> and coercion. An extended example is given together with the sketch of a proof of the example.

40|$|We {{postulate}} that {{a distribution}} is pseudorandom if it cannot be told {{apart from the}} uniform distribution by any efficient procedure.

Thus, pseudorandom generators {{can be used to}} reduce the randomness-complexity in any efficient <b>procedure.</b> Pseudorandom <b>generators</b> and computational difficulty are closely related: loosely speaking, each can be efficiently transformed into the other. 1 Introduction The second half of this century has witnessed the development of three theories of randomness, a notion which has been puzzling thinkers for ages.

40|$|GENERIC is a {{programming}} language for the description and manipulation of integrated circuits. GENERIC works on the layout level with the designer in complete control of the layout process. To design an integrated circuit, a program is written which hierarchically describes the chip. The dynamic calling structure of the program determines the integrated circuit's hierarchical cell structure. These cells are created by special <b>procedures</b> called <b>generators.</b> Generators are capable of producing completely custom structures-they do not consist of predefined layout. In addition to the specification, GENERIC provides operators for the manipulation of integrated circuit layouts, thus enabling existing geometry to be modified. These modifications can be geometrical, topological or circuit. GENERIC is {{a very high level}} language. The language is general purpose-the VLSI aspects of the language are layered on top of the basic language as a run-time library. Since the library itself is written in GENERIC, the language is completely extensible...|$|R

40|$|SDL {{claims to}} be a {{language}} for the description of open systems, allowing the integration of other components into an SDL system and that of an SDL system as a mere component into a greater unit. Indeed, SDL provides the possibility for the interaction of a system with its environment. Signals can be exchanged with the environment and in addition the developer may hide arbitrary actions inside external <b>procedures.</b> Code <b>generators</b> are widely in use to produce runnable code from an SDL system description, decreasing faultiness and increasing flexibility. But changes in or changes of the communication protocol to the environment still force a code generator to be adapted, costing precious resources. This paper presents an automated code generation from SDL to C++, which enables the flexible connection of various communication protocols without changing the code generator or adding code manually. A runtime library contains all necessary means for communication to the environment, an approach which has been tested using CORBA and Web Services, but could be adapted easily to arbitrary protocols. Problems with the choice of appropriate encodings seem to be solved with the recommendation Z. 104, which enables the specification of encodings already in the SDL- 2000 system.

40|$|Abstract — While biology-inspired {{approaches}} for computing walking gaits are {{often based on}} joint oscillators, whenever precise control of feet placement is needed a more specific approach based on explicit footstep control is usually employed.

While the trajectories can be modulated according to high-level parameters offering realtime control of the produced gait, the trajectories can also be modified in order to achieve precise foot placements. Robust balance is achieved by integrating a reactive realtime module which adjusts the overall posture of the robot according to the readings of the feet pressure sensors. We apply our gait generation method to the HOAP- 3 humanoid platform and several results are presented. I...|$|R

40|$|Moving from limited-domain natural {{language}} generation (NLG) to open domain is difficult {{because the number of}} semantic input combinations grows exponentially with the number of domains. Therefore, it is important to leverage existing resources and exploit similarities between domains to facilitate domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose a procedure to train multi-domain, Recurrent Neural Network-based (RNN) language generators via multiple adaptation steps. In this procedure, a model is first trained on counterfeited data synthesised from an out-of-domain dataset, and then fine tuned on a small set of in-domain utterances with a discriminative objective function. Corpus-based evaluation results show that the proposed procedure can achieve competitive performance in terms of BLEU score and slot error rate while significantly reducing the data needed to train generators in new, unseen domains. In subjective testing, human judges confirm that the <b>procedure</b> greatly improves <b>generator</b> performance when only a small amount of data is available in the domain.

40|$|The {{penetration}} of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is increasing in modern power systems. The integration of {{large amounts of}} RES is a challenge but the technology provides many tools to exploit them for uses and functions considered, so far, a prerogative of more traditional power plants. For example, since {{a large amount of}} RES is installed in HV subtransmission grids, it is possible to exploit them in wanted and unwanted islanding conditions. In this paper, a procedure for evaluating off-line the feasibility of islanded operation and planning it is presented. This <b>procedure</b> defines which <b>generators</b> and loads could remain connected after islanding to balance the real power of the island. For each possible set of islanding events, the set of discrete control actions (opening switches) is determined and communicated to local Substation Automation Systems, to be put in place in case of actual islanding.

40|$|Summary. In {{the present}} work a {{numerical}} approach for the optimization of stirrer configurations is presented. The methodology {{is based on}} a parametrized grid generator, a flow solver, and a mathematical optimization tool, which are integrated into an automated <b>procedure.</b> The grid <b>generator</b> allows the parametrized generation of block-structured grids for the stirrer geometries. The flow solver is based on the discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by means of a fully conservative finite-volume method for block-structured, boundary-fitted grids. As optimization tool the two approaches DFO and CONDOR are considered, which are implementations of trust region based derivative-free methods using multivariate polynomial interpolation. Both are designed to minimize smooth functions whose evaluations are considered expensive and whose derivatives are not available or not desirable to approximate. An exemplary application for a standard stirrer configuration illustrates the functionality and the properties of the proposed methods also involving a comparison of the two optimization algorithms. ...|$|R
40|$|Background-Although {{routinely}} administered, definitive {{evidence for}} the benefits of prophylactic antibiotics before the implantation of permanent pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators from a large double-blinded placebo-controlled trial is lacking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration reduces the incidence of infection related to device implantation. Methods and Results-This double blinded study included 1000 consecutive patients who presented for primary device (Pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) implantation or generator replacement randomized in a 1 : 1 fashion to prophylactic antibiotics or placebo. Intravenous administration of I g of cefazolin (group 1) or placebo (group 2) was done immediately before the procedure. Follow-up was performed 10 days, 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge. The primary end point was any evidence of infection at the surgical incision (pulse generator pocket), or systemic infection related to be procedure. The safety committee interrupted the trial after 649 patients were enrolled due to a significant difference in favor of the antibiotic arm (group 1 : 2 of 314 infected patients- 0. 63 %; group 11 : 11 of 335 to 3. 28 %; RR= 0. 19; P= 0. 016). The following risk factors were positively correlated with infection by univariate analysis: nonuse of preventive antibiotic (P= 0. 016); implant <b>procedures</b> (versus <b>generator</b> replacement: P= 0. 02); presence of postoperative hematoma (P= 0. 03) and procedure duration (P= 0. 009). Multivariable analysis identified nonuse of antibiotic (P= 0. 037) and postoperative hematoma (P= 0. 023) as independent predictors of infection.
