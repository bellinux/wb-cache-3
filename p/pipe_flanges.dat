It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> {{connections with}} smaller nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress was the smallest in the restart condition. On other hand, the minimum contact gasket stress in the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection with larger nominal diameter was depending on the materials of connection. In the <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connection with larger nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress distributed and changed in the radial direction due to the flange rotation.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-piercing}} riveting (SPR) method {{which uses a}} <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet. This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique rivet and incorrect rivet position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe rivet. The lap shear strength of the joint with a <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet is higher than that of a joint with a conventional rivet. In this research, a <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch riveting machine. The <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet was done by DEFORM software. The simulated joint cross-section shapes were observed, and the influence of the <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet parameters on joint quality was analyzed. Simultaneously, some riveting experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different rivet heights and chamfer angles. The results show that the joining surface is smooth and the simulated joint cross-section shapes are in good agreement with the experimental results. The joining property with a chamfer angle of 45 ° and a rivet height of 5 mm is found to be the best in joining the Al 6063 aluminum alloy sheets with a thickness of 2. 4 mm by using the SPR with a <b>flange</b> <b>pipe</b> rivet...|$|R

40|$|The {{operational}} envelope {{of the marine}} renewable energy industry requires high performance marine materials, which demand increased structural integrity and durability, coupled with significant weight reduction and minimization of cost. The design and manufacture of a “pipe-flange connections” by use of composite materials is within the current technology. However, {{a number of major}} material challenges are questionable. This study will examine the structural design for <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections made of composite through experimentation and test results are compared with Finite Element Study. It will also identify advantages and disadvantages of this composites structure compared with the traditional materials (metals). In summary, this thesis is concerned with an experimental investigation which was conducted to study the mechanical behaviour of a <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections subjected to tensile loading. The tests have been used to verify the numerical investigation of finite element analysis. The analysis section consists of the elasticity theory, finite element study and microstructure of the composite fibres that were used to develop a model to predict the collapse loads of the pipe-flange interface. The distribution of contact stresses which governs the sealing performance of pipe-flange interface is analysed as a contact problem, using theory of elasticity. The effects of the maximum stress caused in bolts are also analysed with the aid of Finite Element Analysis. For verification, experiments are carried out. These results from the model, the analytical results, were then compared to the experimental loads results and they are satisfactorily consistent...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the gasket stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s.

Based on the time-correlated leakage {{model and}} fuzzy random {{probability}} theory, {{a formula for}} calculating fuzzy random reliability of sealing performance of bolted flanged connections was derived.

As an example, an integral welding necked <b>pipe</b> <b>flange</b> was designed according to the optimization design method proposed in this paper.

5000|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>flanges</b> {{that are}} made to {{standards}} called out by ASME B16.5 or ASME B16.47 are typically made from forged materials and have machined surfaces. B16.5 refers to nominal pipe sizes (NPS) from ½" [...] to 24". B16.47 covers NPSs from 26" [...] to 60". Each specification further delineates flanges into pressure classes: 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 for B16.5, and B16.47 delineates its flanges into pressure classes 75, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900. However these classes do not correspond to maximum pressures in psi. Instead, the maximum pressure depends on the material of the flange and the temperature. For example, the maximum pressure for a Class 150 flange is 285 psi, and for a Class 300 Flange it is 740 psi (both are for ASTM A105 Carbon Steel and temperatures below 100F).|$|E
50|$|Detailed {{analysis}} {{suggested that}} the 8-inch pipe had failed due to creep cavitation at a high temperature while the pipe was under pressure. Failure had been accelerated by contact with molten zinc and there were indications that an elbow in the pipe had been at significantly higher temperature {{than the rest of}} the pipe. The hot elbow led to a non-return valve held between two <b>pipe</b> <b>flanges</b> by twelve bolts. After the disaster, two of the twelve bolts were found to be loose; the inquiry concluded that they were probably loose before the disaster. Nypro argued that the bolts had been loose, there had consequently been a slow leak of process fluid onto lagging leading eventually to a lagging fire, which had worsened the leak to the point where a flame had played undetected upon the elbow, burnt away its lagging and exposed the line to molten zinc, the line then failing with a bulk release of process fluid which extinguished the original fire, but subsequently ignited giving a small explosion which had caused failure of the bypass, a second larger release and a larger explosion. Tests failed to produce a lagging fire with leaked process fluid at process temperatures; one advocate of the 8-inch hypothesis then argued instead that there had been a gasket failure giving a leak with sufficient velocity to induce static charges whose discharge had then ignited the leak.|$|E
