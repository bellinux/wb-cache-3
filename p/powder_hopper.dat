40|$|Protective sensor sheaths are {{required}} in the glass industry for sensors {{that are used to}} measure various properties of the melt. Molten glass presents an extremely corrosive elevated temperature environment, in which only a few types of materials can survive. Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi{sub 2 }) has been shown to possess excellent corrosion resistance in molten glass, and is thus a candidate material for advanced sensor sheath applications. Plasma spray-forming techniques were developed to fabricate molybdenum dilicide-alumina (Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }) laminate and functionally graded composite tubes with mechanical properties suitable for sensor sheath applications. These functionally graded materials (FGMs) were achieved by manipulating the <b>powder</b> <b>hoppers</b> and plasma torch translation via in-house created computer software. Molybdenum disilicide and alumina are thermodynamically stable elevated temperature materials with closely matching thermal expansion coefficients. Proper tailoring of the microstructure of these MoSi{sub 2 }-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } composites can result in improved strength, toughness, and thermal shock resistance. This study focuses on the mechanical performance of these composite microstructures...|$|R

The material is gradually melted by the mechanical energy generated by turning screws and by heaters arranged along the barrel. The molten polymer is then forced into a die, which shapes the polymer into apipe that hardens during cooling.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{mechanism}} of discharge of fine <b>powders</b> from <b>hoppers</b> is examined. Gas pressure measurements were taken in {{the proximity of the}} hopper outlet, mainly along the axis, while discharging fine powders. Different types of pressure traces were detected depending on the solid properties. A simple model was developed to account for the main features of pressure profiles. The main hypothesis relies on the presence of a surface near the hopper outlet which defines a discontinuous change in the voidage of the discharging solids. From the fluid dynamic point of view, the solid above this surface bl:haves as a permeable compact; the solid below, instead, can be considered as a moving suspension of solids in gas. This region appears to be the major responsible of the pressure gradients inside the hopper. A good agreement between model and results indicates that, in spite of its simplicity, the models accounts for the main phenomena involved. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
60|$|It was a puzzling question, {{and full}} of grief to me, who, young though I was, had been well rubbed, curried, and ground down to fine <b>powder</b> in the <b>hopper</b> of an evil fortune, and who {{therefore}} could sympathize with one in similar circumstances. For though we may look grave and behave kindly and considerately to a friend in calamity; yet, if we have never actually experienced something like the woe that weighs him down, we can not with the best grace proffer our sympathy. And perhaps there is no true sympathy but between equals; and it may be, that we should distrust that man's sincerity, who stoops to condole with us.|$|R

The discharge of <b>powders</b> from <b>hoppers</b> usually takes place in open atmosphere.

40|$|We {{have done}} a {{complete}} flowability characterization of the lunar soil simulant, JSC- 1 a, following closely the ASTM- 6773 standard for the Schulze ring shear test. The measurements, which involve pre-shearing the material before each yield point, show JSC- 1 a to be cohesionless, with an {{angle of internal friction}} near 40 deg. We also measured yield loci after consolidating the material in a vibration table which show it to have significant cohesion (approximately equal to 1 kPa) and an angle of internal friction of about 60 deg. Hopper designs based on each type of flowability test differ significantly. These differences highlight the need to discern the condition of the lunar soil in the specific process where flowability is an issue.

40|$|The {{application}} of functionally graded materials (FGMs) is quite difficult, but thermal spray processes like Plasma spray have demonstrated their unique potential in producing graded deposits, where researchers have used twin powder feed systems to mix different proportions of powders. FGMs vary in composition and/or microstructure from one boundary (substrate) to another (top service surface), and innovative characteristics {{result from the}} gradient from metals to ceramics or non-metallic to metals. The present study investigates an innovative modification of a high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spray process to produce functionally graded thick coatings. In order to deposit thick coatings, certain problems have to be overcome. Graded coatings enable gradual variation of the coating composition and/or microstructure, which offers the possibility of reducing residual stress build-up with in coatings. In order to spray such a coating, modification to a commercial <b>powder</b> feed <b>hopper</b> was required to enable it to deposit two powders simultaneously which allows deposition of different layers of coating with changing chemical compositions, without interruption to the spraying process. Various concepts for this modification were identified and one design was selected, having been validated through use of a process model, developed using ANSYS Flotran finite element analysis. In the current research the mixing of different proportions of powders were controlled by a computer using LabVIEW software and hardware, which allowed the control and repeat-ability of the micro structure when producing functionally graded coatings...|$|R
40|$|The Brown and Richards (Principles of Powder Mechanics, Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK, 1970) {{correlation}} for {{the discharge}} rate of fine <b>powders</b> from a <b>hopper</b> was modified {{to account for}} the gas pressure gradient near the outlet. According to Dons*+ et al. (Chem. Eng. Sci. 52 (1997) 4291) there is a transition between a granular floow region and a suspended floow region near the hopper outlet. Brown and Richards (1970) stated that the particle discharge rate depends on the 9 ow conditions just above this transition surface. In the modified equation that is developed {{to account for the}} gas pressure, a term including the gas pressure gradient at this surface appears. The gas pressure gradient is evaluated from the literature experimental results by considering the Donsì et al. (1997) finding that {{a significant part of the}} gas pressure gradient near the hopper outlet is due to the suspended motion. Furthermore, a simplified analysis is carried out to evaluate from the experimental results the voidage variation within the solids phase that is responsible for the onset of the gas pressure gradient...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{dimension}} and multiplying functional aspect of engineering product is {{a mark of}} a modern technology product. Therefore, research of micro machining and smart material {{is an important step}} to develop the future manufacturing process. Layered manufacturing is one of the propective process of it. Research of powder deposition is a key of developing multi material micro fabrication. This research was implemented in four steps including materials preparation and characterization, design and manufacturing experiment apparatus, wall friction-flow ability test and design-manufacturing MMMF machine including the mechanical, electronics and software system. The research was initiated by study observation to find information about characteristic of fine powder and method of reducing the cohesiveness. By sieving process, powder was separated into 4 particle sizes including - 34, 34 - 60, 60 - 74, 74 - 104 micron. Particle shapes were observed using optical microscope. Wall friction test was performed to observe the effect of wall surface roughness, particle size and material powder on mass flow characteristic, by Jenike method. Flow ability test was carried out to yield the powder flow consistency by varying the particle sizes, models of screw feeder geometry, installing blender mechanism, reducing the particle cohesiveness and the wall friction test parameters (<b>powder</b> quantity in <b>hopper</b> and wall surface roughness). For these experiments, rotation of the screw feeder was fixed at 236 rpm. By plotting the experimental data, the optimum parameter of powder mass flow can be determined and it was tested by varying rotation of the screw feeder. The experimental results show that the mass flow characteristic is affected by wall surface roughness and particle size. Effect of <b>powder</b> quantity in <b>hopper</b> can be eliminated by installing blender mechanism; it can also reduce the compaction of the powder around nozzle orifice so that the mass flow can be increase. Mass flow characteristic is also affected by hopper angle, in which the optimal angle is achieved at 25. 67 o (by variation of 20. 6 o, 22. 62 o and 25. 67 o). Powder mass flow was caused dominantly by stimulating rotation of the screw feeder, it is not by helicoidal surface of the screw feeder. Powders trapped in helicoidal slot drive around particle caused by geometric interlocking. However, increasing screw feeder diameter is an effective way to increase the mass flow of smaller particle size (in this chase smaller than 60 micron). Preheating process gives the effective method to increase the mass flow, particularly for small particle (smaller than 60 micron). By considering these parameters, mass flow capacity can be arranged effectively by controlling rotation of the screw feeder. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates an {{innovative}} modification of a HVOF (High Velocity Oxy-Fuel) thermal spray process to produce functionally graded thick coatings. In order to deposit thick coatings, certain problems {{have to be}} overcome. More specifically these problems include minimizing residual stresses, which cause shape distortion in assprayed components. Residual stresses in coatings also lead to adhesion loss, interlaminar debonding, cracking or buckling and are particularly high {{where there is a}} large property difference between the coating and the substrate. Graded coatings enable gradual variation of the coating composition and/or microstructure, which offers the possibility of reducing residual stress build-up in coatings. In order to spray such a coating, modification to a commercial <b>powder</b> feed <b>hopper</b> was required to enable it to deposit two powders simultaneously. This allows deposition of different layers of coating with changing chemical compositions, without interrupting the spraying process. Various concepts for this modification were identified and one design was selected, having been validated through use of a process model, which was developed using ANSYS Finite Element Analysis. The model simulates the flow of nitrogen gas and powder through the system, and verified the supply of mixed composition powders. Based on this information a multi-powder feed unit was manufactured, commissioned and calibrated. Multi-layer coatings of aluminium and tool-steel were sprayed onto aluminium substrates. The chemical composition of different layers of a five layer graded coating was determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to confirm functionality. Subsequently, various controlled parameters of the HVOF spraying process were studied for this type of coating using 33 factorial design of experiments. Results were analysed in terms of surface stress to deposition thickness ratio. The best combination of spray parameters identified for deposition of the mixed coating resembles those recommended for aluminium powder alone. It is proposed that this arises from the thermal properties of the constituent powders. Different types of aluminium/tool-steel functionally graded coatings were then deposited using the optimised set of spray parameters, and considered using Clyne’s analytical method of stress analysis and Vickers hardness testing method. Coatings composed of thicker layers resulted in much higher residual stress, but also improved hardness compared to thinner samples. It was found that if 5 layers of graded material are sprayed, and the residual stress compared to that of a traditional single layer (of the same thickness), an approximately 48 % reduction can be achieved. However this benefit is mitigated somewhat by the fact that applying these multi-layers reduces the hardness to by approximately 16 % compared to the traditional single layered deposit. Therefore an engineer must compromise between the stress and hardness when designing a functionally graded coating-substrate system...|$|R
40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry uniform flow of powders {{is one of the}} most important considerations in solid dosage manufacture. Improper feeding of <b>powders</b> from storage <b>hoppers</b> into dye-presses can lead to inconsistent product quality, causing economic and health impacts. Investigation into the properties affecting powder flow is crucial. There were four objectives of the current research: 1. To determine the effect of moisture on the flow (Jenike flow index, Hausner Ratio and Carr Index, static and dynamic angle of repose) of selected pharmaceutical powders. 2. To study the effect of particle shape and size on Jenike flow index for selected starch and pharmaceutical powders. 3. To determine the effect of mixture compositions on the Jenike flow index of ordered mixtures of selected pharmaceutical powders. 4. To develop a novel flowability tester based on electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) that measures the dynamic angle of repose of powders. To address the first objective, to determine the effect of moisture content on the flow of four pharmaceutical powders; an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), aspartame, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and Respitose® ML 001 were selected. The API and Respitose® powders were found to be nonhygroscopic and were tested at near zero moisture contents only (in this case 0. 31 % and 0. 19 % respectively). Aspartame was tested at moisture contents of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 8 % and HPMC at moisture contents of 0 %, 2 %, 5 % and 10 %. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear index, the Hausner Ratio, the Carr Index and the static and dynamic angles of repose. The Jenike flow index of aspartame increased from 0. 885 to 3. 65 with an increase in moisture content, which was attributed to the formation of large, round agglomerates. The Jenike flow index of HPMC decreased from 3. 28 to 2. 65 with an increase in moisture content, which was attributed to the increasing strength of liquid bridges. The Jenike flow index was the only flowability indicator to capture this complex behaviour. In order to address the second objective, five starches (cow cockle, barley, rye, rice and tapioca), as well as four pharmaceutical ingredients (an API, aspartame, HPMC, and Respitose® ML 001), were characterised for size and shape, and then tested for flowability. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear test, the most widely accepted flowability standard in {{the pharmaceutical}} industry. It was found that the Jenike flow index decreased linearly with decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing roundness for the powders investigated. It was also determined that particle shape had a greater impact on flowability than size for powders under 30 microns in diameter. To address the third objective, ordered mixtures of pharmaceutical powders were examined to determine their flowability. Six combinations of Respitose® ML 001, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in varying concentrations were selected for investigation. Powder flowability was measured using the Jenike shear test, the most widely accepted flowability standard in the industry. The Jenike flow indices of the ordered mixtures were indistinguishable from the Jenike flow index of pure Respitose® at the alpha = 0. 1 level. The fourth objective, to develop a novel flowability tester using electrical capacitance tomography to measure the dynamic angle of repose, was investigated at the same time as the effect of moisture content. It was determined that the results of the novel dynamic angle of repose tester did not correlate well with the Jenike shear test. More development is needed before the novel flowability tester is ready for industrial use. The Jenike shear cell remains the only acceptable flow test for complex flow behaviour...|$|R
