5|$|The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is {{a two-year}} {{educational}} programme primarily aimed at 16 to 18 year olds. The program provides an internationally accepted qualification {{for entry into}} higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It {{was developed in the}} early to mid-1960s in Geneva, Switzerland, by a group of international educators. After a six-year <b>pilot</b> <b>programme</b> ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established.|$|E
5|$|A <b>pilot</b> <b>programme</b> was {{commissioned}} in March 1977, and was {{recorded by the}} end of the following June. A second series {{was commissioned}} in 1979, transmitted in 1980. Episodes of the first series were re-recorded for release on LP records and audio cassettes and Adams adapted the first series into a best-selling novel in 1979. After the 1980 transmissions of the second radio series, a second novel was published and the first series was adapted for television. This was followed by three further novels, a computer game, and various other media.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to many young people, regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a <b>pilot</b> <b>programme</b> in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance.|$|E

25|$|At {{around this}} time, the {{national}} press also began coverage of the pilot cannabis programme in Brixton where officers were instructed not to arrest or charge people who {{were found to be}} in possession of cannabis.

25|$|The {{attacks were}} having a devastating effect on German fighter units. More and more Staffeln and Gruppen were pulled off the front line on the Eastern Front to {{reinforce}} the Reich. Göring ordered that more effort be made to train pilots more thoroughly and quickly whilst expanding the Jagdflieger force. He ordered bomber pilots to be converted to fighter pilots. This failed. Pilot training was shortened to meet the need for pilots. In 1944, the <b>pilot</b> <b>programme</b> had shrunk to eight months and 111 flying hours; just 20 hours on the Fw 190 and Bf 109. This was less than ½ of what the German cadets could receive in 1942.|$|E

40|$|Medical {{education}} and training in the United Kingdom is undergoing profound change driven by a governmental policy that has attracted the title Modernizing Medical Careers. The role of piloting and evaluation in Modernizing Medical Careers is described and the article argues that, {{in addition to the}} previously described rational, cultural and control functions of evaluation, a signifi cant function of evaluation and <b>pilot</b> <b>programmes</b> is to facilitate the implementation of change in a complex system.

25|$|The National Trust has {{invested}} £600,000 in a marine source heat pump to provide heating for the house. At 300 kilowatts, the pump {{is the biggest}} in Britain. Its oil-fired boiler made the mansion the most polluting and biggest oil consumer of the National Trust's properties; the renovation is expected to save around £40,000 a year in operating costs. Plas Newydd {{is one of five}} properties in a pilot experiment; if they succeed, the National Trust will invest in 43 more renewable energy plans.

25|$|On {{the basis}} of this <b>pilot</b> <b>programme,</b> {{national}} guidelines were developed to guide the prevention of mother-to-child transmission in the country. The provision of such services has been ratified by the AIDS Regulations. Services are being scaled up to cover at least 85% of infected pregnant women by 2007, and to reach at least 90% by 2010. Scale-up is being prioritized to the most heavily affected areas first. As of the end of 2005, more than 500,000 pregnant women in high-risk groups or in high-prevalence areas had been tested for HIV in 271 counties in 28 provinces. The overall participation rate in HIV testing in these pregnant women was 92%, and the HIV infection rate ranged from 0.3% to 0.7%. Among those who tested positive, 80% received antiretroviral therapy, and more than 90% accepted formula milk for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission.|$|E

40|$|Rural {{development}} policies lately take an inter-sectoral area-based approach. This turn {{raises questions}} relating to governance {{on the one}} hand and issues relating to the participation of different sectors therein on the other. In this paper I present a case study from Germany, focussing on three area-based rural development funding <b>programmes,</b> two temporary <b>pilot</b> <b>programmes</b> and a mainstream scheme. The concept of regional governance is shown to play a crucial role in the implementation of <b>pilot</b> <b>programmes,</b> while mainstream policy only partly is affected. Forestry as a sector was found to only play a minor role in such processes of regional governance. This paper reveals sector – internal as well as – external causes of this phenomenon and closed with conclusions on how to (sector-internally and – externally) enhance forestry participation to area-based rural development programmes.

40|$|This paper investigates how <b>{{piloting}}</b> <b>programmes</b> in China {{can promote}} local policy innovations. By {{using one of}} the piloting emission trading schemes (ETS) in Guangdong province as a case study, it is argued that the main features of the piloting experiments, particularly in the climate change domain, are largely different from previous local marketization experiments that dominate the reform period of China. Whereas previous experiments are often characterized as bottom-up or indigenous initiatives with strong patronage relations to the pro-reform politicians at central level, the current <b>piloting</b> <b>programmes</b> are often crafted in a top-down fashion that is often misaligned with local market or corporate interests. Hence, local policy innovations are designed, developed and brokered by the local state officers,in order to bridge this central–local interest gap. As a result,successful implementation of these policy innovations largely depends on local political traditions, bureaucratic culture and perceptions of distinctive development needs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the conceptual framework}} and application of a working model (‘EPSoCare’) for psychosocial intervention for refugees living in camps in low income countries. The intervention’s main objective is social re-integration of individuals with psychosocial problems.

The interventions aimed to cover 360. 000 refugees in camps in Tanzania, and 230. 000 in a camp in Zaire. The <b>pilot</b> <b>programmes</b> were heavily impacted by the prevalent insecurity in the camps and the atmos-phere of mistrust resulting from it, {{as well as by}} the insufficiency of social services. The development of psycho-education material took more time than expected. Medical staff was not easily ready to be trained in psychosocial concepts.

2500|$|In March 2009 Leeds City Region Partnership {{submitted}} a formal bid for more powers and funding from Government through a <b>pilot</b> <b>programme</b> on offer. The Partnership [...] {{put forward a}} [...] "Forerunner Plan" [...] with proposals for greater responsibilities in housing and regeneration, higher level skills and innovation. The bid was the Partnership’s formal response to the announcement by HM Treasury in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report that Government would be working {{with at least two}} city region partnerships across the country to pilot new freedoms and flexibilities in a range of areas. These arrangements will see the Government and its agencies delegating greater control over funding and delivery of key schemes to the city region authorities as a way of stimulating economic growth.

2500|$|In 2001 Brixton became {{subject of}} {{newspaper}} headlines {{due to the}} implementation of a pilot cannabis programme, also known as the [...] "softly softly" [...] approach, initiated by Brian Paddick, then Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth. Police officers were instructed not to arrest or charge people who were found to be in possession of cannabis. They were instead to issue on-the-spot warnings and confiscate the drugs. Although Paddick is credited with the idea, the <b>pilot</b> <b>programme</b> was sanctioned by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Sir John Stevens. Paddick asserts that he implemented the policy because he wanted his officers to deal with cannabis quickly and informally so that they could concentrate on heroin and crack cocaine offences, and street robbery and burglary, which were affecting {{the quality of life in}} Lambeth to a greater extent. The pilot was ended December 2005 and was replaced by a so-called [...] "no deal" [...] policy on cannabis in Brixton following complaints about increasing numbers of dealers openly selling the drug.|$|E
