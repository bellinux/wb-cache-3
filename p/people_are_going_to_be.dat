500|$|Director Peter Berg said {{prior to}} Hancocks release {{that if the}} film pulls in as much {{business}} as predicted, a sequel, Hancock 2, would likely follow.

Believing them, Jenna tries to seduce a NBC {{executive}} whom she sees talking to Jack.

500|$|On {{the quality}} of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, [...] "I think it's good, actually. I think <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the {{work has been done}} very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really {{impressed}} with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E

In the same way, with one year's Indian statistics before you, you can guess closely at how many people were killed in that Empire by tigers during the previous year, and the year before that, and the year before that, and at how many were killed in each of those years by bears, how many by wolves, and how many by snakes; and you can also guess closely at how many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed each year for the coming five years by each of those agencies.
