Over the next centuries, the town became a {{commercial}} centre for the area, importing and exporting goods through harbours on the River Wyre at Skippool and Wardleys.

During the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century</b> the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution led to a decline in the craft industries in Poulton.

For some time, the town's market remained important as a local supply of goods for growing Fleetwood and Blackpool. Eventually Poulton was overshadowed by Fleetwood and Blackpool. In his 1837 work on Blackpool, William Thornber called Poulton the [...] "metropolis of the Fylde". This was a time when Poulton was still prominent among its near neighbours; David Foster commented in 1972 that not only was Thornber's description of the town no longer apt, it had ceased to be accurate even from 1850 with the rapid growth of the coastal resorts.|$|E

The older {{advocates of}} {{evolution}} sought for {{the causes of}} the process exclusively in the influence of varying conditions, such as climate and station, or hybridisation, upon living forms. Even Treviranus has got no farther than this point. Lamarck introduced the conception of the action of an animal on itself as a factor in producing modification. Starting from the well-known fact that the habitual use of a limb tends to develop the muscles of the limb, and to produce a greater and greater facility in using it, he made the general assumption that the effort of an animal to exert an organ in a given direction tends to develop the organ in that direction. But a little consideration showed that, though Lamarck had seized what, as far it goes, is a true cause of modification, it is a cause the actual effects of which are wholly inadequate to account for any considerable modification in animals, and which can have no influence at all in the vegetable world; and probably nothing contributed so much to discredit evolution, in the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century,</b> as the floods of easy ridicule which were poured upon this part of Lamarck's speculation. The theory of natural selection, or survival of the fittest, was suggested by Wells in 1813, and further elaborated by Matthew in 1831. But the pregnant suggestions of these writers remained practically unnoticed and forgotten, until the theory was independently devised and promulgated by Darwin and Wallace in 1858, and the effect of its publication was immediate and profound.|$|E

In the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> twenty-first <b>century,</b> the most important pressures facing businesses worldwide, especially those in the developed world, is arguably the need for integrating sustainability issues into daily business operations. For businesses, the creation of economic value by integrating corporate social and environmental responsibility issues now increasingly pose real profound strategic challenges. These complex challenges involve numerous processes carried out and influenced by many stakeholders to set the tone and guide corporate level decisions. As organisations try to meet these complex challenges, they need to be innovative. This often calls for the creation, use and exploitation of new knowledge. Therefore, knowledge resources must be properly managed to provide an environment for wellinformed decisions. Much of the sustainability related knowledge evolves around on-going learning from the actions taken by managers and stakeholders who enact the organisation’s sustainability-related change initiatives. This paper primarily reports on the empirical findings of an on-going research study, which is focused on managing change and knowledge associated with sustainability initiatives for organisational competitiveness. The paper focuses on the key drivers that have fuelled the need for managing sustainability-related knowledge. The findings are, in the main, based on semistructured interviews with fifty-nine professionals from forty UK organisations in four sectors – energy and utility, transportation, construction, and not-for-profit organisations. The paper concludes that identifying and understanding the key drivers for managing sustainability-related knowledge is a complex process. The key drivers for managing sustainability-related knowledge as revealed by the current study are to improve accessibility to sustainability-related knowledge, to identify sustainability-related knowledge assets, to improve the flow of sustainability-related knowledge, to build sustainability-related skills and capabilities and to capture key sustainability-related knowledge...|$|R
