2500|$|The {{original}} {{show was}} shot on high quality 35 mm film, {{but had to}} be downscaled before editing and <b>postprocessing</b> to standard 80s and 90s TV resolution (video quality) for broadcast. [...] The show's final visual effects (e.g. all exterior shots of the starship Enterprise, phaser fire or beaming fade-ins and -outs) were also composed only in standard resolution video. All previous home video and DVD releases used this severely downscaled version. To include such footage on Blu-ray, using only upscaling, {{would have resulted in}} a larger but blurred image, so CBS decided to use a more detailed approach to bring the show to high-definition. They also opted to adhere to the show's original 4:3 aspect ratio.|$|E
2500|$|... {{study the}} problem of link {{scheduling}} for time division multiple access network communications protocols on sensor networks as a variant of edge coloring. In this problem, one must choose time slots for the edges of a wireless communications network so that each node of the network can communicate with each neighboring node without interference. Using a strong edge coloring (and using two time slots for each edge color, one for each direction) would solve the problem but might use more time slots than necessary. Instead, they seek a coloring of the directed graph formed by doubling each undirected edge of the network, with the property that each directed edge [...] has a different color from the edges that go out from [...] and from the neighbors of [...] They propose a heuristic for this problem based on a distributed algorithm for -edge-coloring together with a <b>postprocessing</b> phase that reschedules edges that might interfere with each other.|$|E
