Faktor-faktor tersebut antara lain: contextual <b>perceive</b> value, <b>perceive</b> usefulness, <b>perceive</b> easy of use, {{customer}} satisfaction dan trust. Berkaitan dengan tujuan yang ingin dicapai, data diambil dengan menggunakan teknik purposive sampling. Kriterianya adalah mahasiswa UNS yang pernah menggunakan Mcommerce. Teknik ini digunakan memastikan keakuratan data penelitian. Sampel diambil sebanyak 200 responden dengan tingkat pengembalian tinggi yaitu sebesar 179 responden. Penentuan jumlah ini dimaksudkan untuk memenuhi kriteria minimal alat statistik yang digunakan yaitu SEM (Structural Equation Modelling). Sedangkan tingkat pengembalian yang tinggi dikarenakan data dikumpulkan dengan melakukan wawancara secara langsung dipandu kuesioner. Kualitas data penelitian dapat diperoleh dengan melakukan uji validitas dan uji reliabilitas. Hal ini dimaksudkan untuk memastikan bahwa data yang terkumpul memenuhi kriteria kelayakan sehingga dapat diuji dengan alat statistik apapun. SEM merupakan metode statistik yang dipilih untuk memecahkan masalah yang dirumuskan dalam studi ini. Hasil studi ini mengindikasi hubungan antarvariabel yang signifikan yaitu: contextual <b>perceive</b> value pada repurchase intention, contextual <b>perceive</b> value pada {{customer satisfaction}}, customer satisfaction pada repurchase intention, <b>perceive</b> usefulnes pada customer satisfaction, <b>perceive</b> {{ease of use}} pada customer satisfaction, <b>perceive</b> ease of use pada repurchase intention, dan trust pada repurchase intention. Penelitian ini juga mendiskusikan implikasi secara lanjutan, teoritis, dan praktis Kata kunci: contextual <b>perceive</b> value, <b>perceive</b> usefulnes, <b>perceive</b> ease of use, customer satisfaction, trust, repurchase intention dan mcommerce This stdy aims to determinant the factors that affect the interests of students to use m- commerce as a tool in their transactions. These factors include: contextual <b>perceive</b> value, <b>perceive</b> usefulnes, <b>perceive</b> easy of use, customer satisfaction and trust. In connection with the objective to be achieved, the data taken using purposive sampling technique. The criteria are students who never use m-commerce UNS. This technique is used to ensure the accuracy of research data. Samples was taken of 200 respondents with {{a high rate of}} return that is equal to 179 respondent. Determination of this amount is intended to meet the minimum criteria for statistical tool used is the SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). While the high return rate due to data collected by conducting interviews directly guided questionnaire. The quality research data can be obtained by analyzing the validity and reliability test. It is intended to ensure that data collected meet the eligibility criteria {{so that it can be}} tested with any statistical tool. SEM is a statistical method chosen to solve the problem formulated in this study.

The ability of an organization implements service quality program will positively motivate customers’ <b>perceive</b> value; this may lead to increased their satisfaction. The nature of this relationship is less emphasized in service quality service models. In this study, a survey research method was used to gather 102 usable questionnaires from academic staffs who have studied in one Malaysian public institution of higher learning in East Malaysia (HIGHINSTITUTION). The outcomes of hierarchical regression analysis showed three important findings: firstly, interaction between <b>perceive</b> value and responsiveness insignificantly correlated with customer satisfaction. Secondly, interaction between <b>perceive</b> value and assurance insignificantly correlated with customer satisfaction and thirdly, interaction between <b>perceive</b> value and emphathy significantly correlated with customer satisfaction. This result demonstrates that <b>perceive</b> value has increased the effect of emphathy customer satisfaction, but <b>perceive</b> value has not increased the effect of responsiveness and assurance on customer satisfaction. Further, this study confirms that <b>perceive</b> value does act as a partial moderating variable in the service quality models of the organizational sample. In addition...|$|R
