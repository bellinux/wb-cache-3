25|$|Porous bass trap {{absorbers}} {{need to be}} {{very thick}} to be effective at lower frequencies so they tend to be allocated either as diagonal wedges in the corners or as thick rectangular bulk behind false walls where they are {{out of the way and}} less likely to disrupt higher frequencies or room function. Air gap behind a <b>porous</b> <b>panel</b> absorber e.g. straddling a corner also helps to ensure it protrudes more into the room where there is more air velocity, improving its velocity-based absorption and extending its bandwidth while inducing some ripple in its absorption spectrum. Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more conveniently and effectively positioned flat against a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPropagation of {{two-dimensional}} small amplitude Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves {{has been}} investigated over a rigid panel followed by a <b>porous</b> <b>panel</b> {{in the presence of}} cross-flow. In the present work boundary layer flow over alternate rigid-porous panels in which suction is applied through the <b>porous</b> <b>panel</b> is investigated. Also investigated is the problem of flow past alternate rigid and porous panels with cross flow. A general space marching solution has been discussed for calculating the mean velocity profile for the above case, in the developing region of mean flow in the <b>porous</b> <b>panel,</b> following the rigid-porous junction. Numerical solutions are obtained using a finite difference method for the suitably simplified Navier Stokes equations, using appropriate boundary conditions. Detailed two-dimensional analyses have been done for the disturbance waves using both the quasi-parallel (QP) approximation, and more accurately, using the non-parallel (NP) approach. The non-parallel approach has been carried out over the developing mean-flow region of the <b>porous</b> <b>panel,</b> following the rigid-porous junction. Numerical solutions have been obtained by finite difference procedures. In some of the cases results have been validated with the available literature. Finally, the jumps in the amplitude of the disturbance waves across the rigid- porous junction were calculated using the theory of Sen et al. [6]. The important outcome from this work is in optimizing the length of the <b>porous</b> <b>panel,</b> following the rigid-porous junction. It is seen that, as compared to the length required to approach the asymptotic mean flow state to within 99 %, only a very short <b>porous</b> <b>panel</b> length is sufficient to stabilize the disturbances. Hence, it is foreseen that alternate long rigid panels, with in-between short porous panels, could be a very effective way of stabilizing the disturbances, and thus delaying laminar to turbulent transition...|$|E
40|$|A <b>porous</b> <b>panel</b> with a {{small crack}} {{subjected}} to mixed-mode loads under yielding and plane stress conditions is examined here. The recently proposed modified Gurson’s yield criterion is adopted {{to account for the}} non-linear behavior of a <b>porous</b> <b>panel</b> with normal anisotropy but planar isotropy. Trends in the constant J contour, based upon a finite element analysis, are correlated with those of constant fatigue life contours under mixed-mode I and II loading conditions. The effects of both the anisotropy parameter and the porosity upon the J integral are then demonstrated. Simulation results show that the transverse strain dominates constant J contours on the -plane as the anisotropy parameter increases under the mixed-mode loads. However, constant J contours are less sensitive to the transverse strain even if a relatively larger void volume fraction appears in the panel...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} described {{of the effects}} of a passive porous wall on boundary-layer instability. The passive porous wall Is conceived of as a thin porous sheet stretched over a plenum chamber. When disturbances in the form of Tollmien-Schlichting waves propagate along the boundary layer, the fluctuating pressure forces air {{in and out of the}} plenum chamber. The basic approach is based on classic linear stability theory fur the flat-plate boundary layer with modified wall boundary conditions. The wall response is represented by a complex admittance (ratio of fluctuating flow rate per unit area to wall pressure) and, therefore, applies to a general class of passive porous, and other interactive, walls. The effects of a wide range of admittance values are studied, A stabilizing effect is obtained when the admittance phase is close to pi / 2, and an optimum value of admittance magnitude is also found. A theoretical model is introduced and used to calculate the admittance of the <b>porous</b> <b>panels</b> used in a parallel experimental study, It is shown that it may be possible to manufacture stabilizing <b>porous</b> <b>panels.</b> The stabilizing mechanism is due to the production of a near-wall region of negative Reynolds stress...|$|R

The panel skin is perforated with eight hundred 0.0025-inch-diameter laser-drilled holes per square inch. TKS fluid exudes through the panels on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizers. Fluid is also thoroughly distributed from the slinger-ring on the propeller and from the windshield spraybar. Secondary fairings or structures such as lift struts can also be protected. Engine inlets may be protected, as well. The fluid is pumped from a tank by an electrically-driven metering pump through a microfilter to proportioning units. Proportioning units contain calibrated capillary tubes that divide the flow to the individual needs of the <b>porous</b> <b>panels</b> and the slinger ring. One metering pump is provided for inadvertent systems. For systems certified for flight into known icing conditions (FIKI), two pumps are installed for redundancy and can be selected individually. Fluid for the windshield spraybar system is provided by an on-demand gear pump. One or two windshield pumps are provided depending on the certification basis. As the TKS Ice Protection system is used, any accumulation of debris is flushed out. Glycol has cleaning properties and will not harm the paint finish of the aircraft. No performance is lost from the system; only significant ice protection capabilities are added.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{attempts}} to induce some formalism {{in the study}} of stability of developing shear flows, by use of so called ‘ad-hoc’ methods wherein all terms upto and inclusive of a particular order are lumped together in the same equation. However, whether the ‘ordering’ is perturbation or asympotic is somewhat vague. The classical example of stability of a developing shear flow is the stability problem of boundary-layer flow over a flat-plate including the non-parallel effects. Other examples are free shear flows; also, problems involving flow over alternate rigid and <b>porous</b> <b>panels</b> with suction, or suction from one wall and injection from the opposite wall. The quick method for stability analysis is to use the local Orr-Sommerfeld solution, using the quasi-parallel approximation. This is sometimes augmented by inclusion of some non-parallel terms, perhaps in an ad-hoc manner, and so called ‘improved solutions’ are obtained. The present paper {{attempts to}} establish a formal framework for these methods so that these methods are no more termed ‘ad-hoc’...|$|R

The research activity focused on the development {{of a wide range of}} ceramic components via sinter-crystallization of glasses produced from waste (fly ash, slag, sludge) with or without the addition of vitrification aids, such as cullet or silicates. The raw materials have been mixed in the appropriate ratios to yield ceramic compositions that could be used in the building industry (e. g glass ceramic tiles, <b>porous</b> <b>panels,</b> lightweight aggregates). Monolithic, porous or dense, sintered glass ceramics and ceramics were manufactured as substitutes for natural stones or traditional ceramics.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{acoustic}} behavior of double-walled panels, with sandwiched layer of porous materials is presented within Classical Laminated Plate Theory (CLPT) for laminated composite panels. For this purpose, equations of wave propagation are firstly extracted based on Biot's theory for porous materials, then the transmission loss (TL) of the structure is estimated in a broadband frequency. Secondly, TL coefficient of the structure is determined using Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). In the next step, accuracy of the solution is shown with comparing the data obtained from these two presented models {{as well as the}} experimental results available in literature. Finally, the effects of parameters on sound transmission loss of double <b>porous</b> composite <b>panels,</b> especially at a high frequency range, are discussed. In addition, the results show that maximum sound energy is transferred through the waves frame (structure born) due to the porous layer bonded between the two composite panels. Therefore, material parameters that are principally related to solid phase of the foam such as Poisson's ratio, bulk density and bulk Young's modulus, have the most significant effects on the transmission loss.

40|$|The closed {{confined}} environments of the ISS, {{as well as}} {{in future}} spacecraft for exploration beyond LEO, provide many challenges to crew health. One such challenge is the availability of a robust, energy efficient, and re-generable air revitalization system that controls trace volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) to levels below a specified spacecraft maximum allowable concentration (SMAC). Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), which is capable of mineralizing VOCs at room temperature and of accommodating a high volumetric flow, is being evaluated as an alternative trace contaminant control technology. In an architecture of a combined air and water management system, placing a PCO unit before a condensing heat exchanger for humidity control will greatly reduce the organic load into the humidity condensate loop ofthe water processing assembly (WPA) thereby enhancing the life cycle economics ofthe WPA. This targeted application dictates a single pass efficiency of greater than 90 % for polar VOCs. ~ Although this target was met in laboratory bench-scaled reactors, no commercial or SBIR-developed prototype PCO units examined to date have achieved this goal. Furthermore, the formation of partial oxidation products (e. g., acetaldehyde) was not eliminated. It is known that single pass efficiency and partial oxidation are strongly dependent upon the contact time and catalyst illumination, hence the requirement for an efficient reactor design.

40|$|Problem {{statement}} Sports teachers (and other users) often {{suffer from}} bad acoustics in sports halls. A survey revealed that most complaints are about tiredness, throat problems and hearing problems. Bad acoustics in sports halls are {{mainly caused by}} an uneven distribution of the sound absorbing material in a hall. Often, the roof absorbs most of the sound where the floor and walls up to 3 meter reflect most of the sound. This {{lower part of the}} walls needs to be strong, flat and hard to rebound balls. In this way, vertically reflected sound is being absorbed faster than horizontally reflected sound. This difference causes sagging Schroeder curves and therefore long reverberation times. Dutch standards for acoustics are mainly based on reverberation times, so sagging curves are unwanted. Besides the problem of the long reverberation times, another problem is found. Measurements show that sports halls constructed with stone-like materials absorb sound according to the expectations of the material properties. Sports halls constructed with perforated steel sound absorbing panels give different results. These panels seem to behave differently on sound absorption than expected. Especially low frequencies seem to be absorbed extremely well by the panels. The research question therefore is: ‘Why do perforated steel sound absorbing panels seem to behave differently in absorption coefficient in sports halls than expected from laboratory test results?’ Because this question is part of the larger subject ‘acoustics in sports halls’, it is necessary to investigate the acoustical behaviour of perforated steel panels for a broad demarcation of the subject. Approach In order to find an answer to the research question, two hypotheses are tested by measurements. The measurements are done in a laboratory and in a scale model. The results are analysed. The conclusions give insight in the sound absorbing behaviour of perforated steel sound absorbing panels. Besides that, the conclusions give guidelines to the design phase of this graduation project. Hypotheses: 1. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the shape of the panels causes sound absorption of parallel striking sound based on a phase shift principle. 2. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the backing construction has influence on the result. Laboratory measurements Absorption coefficient measurements are done in the reverberation room of the acoustical laboratory. Different samples of the roof structure are tested. By comparing the results, we get insight in the influence of different parts of the roof structure. Besides that, hypothesis one can be tested: the influence of the backing construction will become clear. Scale model measurements The scale model makes it possible to test the influence of different shaped roof structures in a small model. By using the same, reflecting material for all walls, we get insight in the influence of changes in roof shapes. Some of the roof structures are (partly) covered with a sound absorbing material to compare the results of those to the other variations. This research should give an answer to hypothesis two. Results The scale model measurement results show that profiled structures cause a considerable decrease in local sound pressure compared to a hard, flat surface. This decrease is largest for low frequencies. The surface with sound absorbing material on top causes the biggest decrease, which is caused by the sound absorption of the facing material. The ‘sound absorption by shape’ is caused by the phenomena of diffusion and interference. It is not visible in reverberation times (T 20), just in histograms and Schroeder curves. The laboratory measurements show that the influence of the thermal insulation layer; a part of the backing construction, is large on (low frequent) sound absorption. The rock wool panels give a high peak in the sound absorption graph for 100 Hz. This very good sound absorption is probably caused by the panel being its own panel-resonator and porous absorber in one. The influence of the ‘cannelurevulling’ is small, like the influence of the vapour barrier and different perforation degrees. Conclusions Perforated steel sound absorbing panels absorb more low frequent sound than expected. This good sound absorption is probably achieved by the profiled shape of the steel panels in combination with the backing thermal insulation. The profiled shape causes the effect of sound absorption caused by the effects of diffusion and interference. The backing construction absorbs {{a large part of the}} low frequent sound because the hard, stiff and heavy rock wool panels are probably a <b>porous</b> material and <b>panel</b> resonator in one. The research does not give strong guidelines to improve the roof structure. The gained knowledge is used in the design of a wall panel. The walls up to three meters are still the weakest link when talking about acoustics in sports halls. The designed panel should improve this situation.
