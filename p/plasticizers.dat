25|$|Inclusion of <b>plasticizers</b> {{tends to}} lower Tg and {{increase}} polymer flexibility. <b>Plasticizers</b> are generally small molecules that are chemically {{similar to the}} polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and reduced interchain interactions. A {{good example of the}} action of <b>plasticizers</b> is related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. An uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no <b>plasticizers</b> in it, because it needs to remain strong and heat-resistant. Plasticized PVC is used in clothing for a flexible quality. <b>Plasticizers</b> are also put in some types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.|$|E

40|$|The {{high level}} of <b>plasticizer</b> in {{plasticized}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) ensures that <b>plasticizer</b> selection has an important influence on the suitability of PVC to function in blood-contacting applications. In this study, three types of plasticized PVC in sheet form, with di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tri-(2 -ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM) and n-butyryltri-n-hexyl citrate (BTHC) as <b>plasticizer,</b> were selected for assessment and single solute fibrinogen adsorption was utilized as an initial index of interactions with blood components. Fibrinogen adsorption behavior shows a strong dependence on the <b>plasticizer</b> selection, <b>plasticizer</b> level at the surface and the adsorption conditions, such as adsorption time and fibrinogen solution concentration. Results indicate that BTHC plasticized PVC possesses the lowest adsorption capacity in {{the three types of}} plasticized PVC, while TEHTM plasticized PVC seems to have the strongest reactivity in certain fibrinogen solution concentrations. The alteration of surface <b>plasticizer</b> level was achieved by a methanol-cleaning treatment with a variety of cleaning times and the fibrinogen adsorption on plasticized PVC decreases with the reduction of surface <b>plasticizer</b> level.

40|$|Background and {{the purpose}} of the study: Mechanical {{properties}} of films prepared from aqueous dispersion and organic solutions of Eudragit RL were assessed and the effects of <b>plasticizer</b> type, concentration and curing were examined. Methods: Films were prepared from aqueous dispersion and solutions of Eudragit RL (isopropy alcohol-water 9 : 1) containing 0, 10 or 20 % (based on polymer weight) of PEG 400 or Triethyl Citrate (TEC) as <b>plasticizer</b> using casting method. Samples of films were stored in oven at 60 ºC for 24 hrs (Cured). The stress-strain curve was obtained for each film using material testing machine and tensile strength, elastic modulus, %elongation and work of failure were calculated. Results and major conclusion: The films with no <b>plasticizer</b> showed different mechanical properties depending on the vehicle used. Addition of 10 % or 20 % of <b>plasticizer</b> decreased the tensile strength and elastic modulus and increased %elongation and work of failure for all films. The effect of PEG 400 on mechanical properties of Eudragit RL films was more pronounced. The differences in mechanical properties of the films due to vehicle decreased with addition of <b>plasticizer</b> and increase in its concentration. Curing process weakened the mechanical properties of the films with no <b>plasticizer</b> and for films with 10 % <b>plasticizer</b> no considerable difference in mechanical properties was observed before and after curing. For those with 20 % <b>plasticizer</b> only films prepared from aqueous dispersion showed remarkable difference in mechanical properties before and after curing.

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of both <b>plasticizer</b> and {{streching}} strain on the percolation transition in polyisoprene-carbon nanocomposites (PCNC) is reported. The orthopositronium (oPs) accessible free volume sites in the unstreched and streched PCNC without <b>plasticizer</b> as well as with <b>plasticizer</b> have been measured by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The lifetime of oPs,  3, is related {{to the size of the}} free volume, and the intensity, I 3, to the number concentration of free volume sites. It was found that streching decreases the number of free volume cavities independent of the both mass parts carbon nano-particles (CNP) and <b>plasticizer.</b> The free volume cavity size has maximum value in the region of percolation transition. Percolation threshold was determined by electric resistance measurements (ERM). Both PALS and ERM show that the percolation threshold shifts to greater values of mass parts of CNP under streching strain. An opposite shift of percolation threshold was found under adding <b>plasticizer.</b> It is interesting that adding of CNP increases mean free volume cavity size at mass parts percolation threshold. It means that filling of cavities occurs above the percolation threshold.

40|$|Potassium {{ion-selective}} and pH membrane electrodes {{based on}} neutral carrier ionophores for K+ (valinomycin) and H+ (TDDA and ETH 5294), respectively, immobilized in carboxylated PVC (PVC-COOH) with normal (classical) and reduced amounts of <b>plasticizer,</b> were investigated {{with respect to}} their general analytical performances (linear range, slope, detection limit, selectivity, internal membrane resistance), their biocompatibility and cellular responses. The analytical performance of potassium selective electrodes was not affected by reducing the <b>plasticizer</b> content from 66 % (m/m) to about 33 % (m/m) while that of pH electrodes was significantly changed at the lower <b>plasticizer</b> concentration level. The adhesive properties of PVC-COOH membranes to an inert substrate such as polyimide-coated Kapton are greatly improved by reducing the <b>plasticizer</b> content of the membrane. In addition, as was reported earlier by this group, improved biocompatibility was observed with these membranes relative to those with increased <b>plasticizer</b> content.

The Committee said there are some alternative <b>plasticizers</b> available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these <b>plasticizers</b> should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices. Risk assessment results have shown positive results regarding the safe use of High Molecular Weight Phthalates.
