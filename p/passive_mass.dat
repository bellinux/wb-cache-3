40|$|Pipes for {{pipeline}} and risers {{are subjected}} to fatigue loading during deployment. Additionally, {{in the case of}} free spanning pipelines and risers may be exited at their resonance frequency by vortex induced vibration. In some situations the pipes may assume a curved shape after unreeling aboard a pipe lying vessel and this may affect the dynamic behavior. Before installation the pipes are tested in a high cycle fatigue test to determine the life time of the pipe in fatigue. In this master thesis the effect of a curved shape is studied. A finite element model was created in the finite element software Abaqus. It was important to make the model as similar to reality as possible; to obtain comparable results. The mesh put on the riser pipe, end masses and end caps is of the size 50 mm. The reason for using such fine mesh is to represent the geometry and the properties of the material used in a best possible way. The results obtained from the finite element model have been compared to the results obtained from the finite element model have been compared to the results obtained in the laboratory and the deviations were very small. The different sources of error are discussed due to the curved shape of the pipes. With this in mind two different solution of how to smoothen the stress distribution along the circumference of the pipe is obtained. There are many different ways to smoothen the stress distribution. In chapter six and seven two different solutions arepresented. In the first solution it is tried to compensate for mass of the rising height by attaching a similar mass at {{the opposite side of the}} rising height. This solution did not function and the errors are commented on. In chapter seven a parameter study for a <b>passive</b> <b>mass</b> damper is presented.

This in turn leads to a straightforward derivation of the classical Newtonian gravitational force. We call the inertia and gravitation connection with the vacuum fields the quantum vacuum inertia hypothesis. To date only the electromagnetic field has been considered. It remains to extend the hypothesis to the effects of the vacuum fields of the other interactions. We propose an idealized experiment involving a cavity resonator which, in principle, would test the hypothesis for the simple case in which only electromagnetic interactions are involved.
