50|$|The current {{recommended}} {{method of}} grasping <b>pike</b> is {{to close the}} hand firmly over the gill covers, {{and to make the}} period of handling as short as possible before release. Grabbing a <b>pike</b> by the gill covers is not feasible when a <b>pike</b> is very big, but it is easy to handle a <b>pike</b> by inserting the fingers {{at the bottom of the}} gill opening and grabbing the lower jaw. Big <b>pike</b> should also be supported at the belly. When a <b>pike</b> is held this way it is also easier to keep the mouth open to remove a hook. Some anglers now use special grips to grab the <b>pike's</b> front lower jaw, which can add to the safety of an anglers because of the danger imposed by the hooks of the lure or tackle and the <b>pike's</b> teeth.

40|$|Northern <b>pike</b> (Esox lucius) are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that can}} switch to alternative prey species after preferred prey have declined. This trophic adaptability allows invasive <b>pike</b> to have {{negative effects on}} aquatic food webs. In Southcentral Alaska, invasive <b>pike</b> are a substantial concern because they have spread to important spawning and rearing habitat for salmonids and are hypothesised {{to be responsible for}} recent salmonid declines. We described the relative importance of salmonids and other prey species to <b>pike</b> diets in the Deshka River and Alexander Creek in Southcentral Alaska. Salmonids were once abundant in both rivers, but they are now rare in Alexander Creek. In the Deshka River, we found that juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and coho salmon (O. kisutch) dominated <b>pike</b> diets and that small <b>pike</b> consumed more of these salmonids than large <b>pike.</b> In Alexander Creek, <b>pike</b> diets reflected the distribution of spawning salmonids, which decrease with distance upstream. Although salmonids dominated <b>pike</b> diets in the lowest reach of the stream, Arctic lamprey (Lampetra camtschatica) and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) dominated <b>pike</b> diets in the middle and upper reaches. In both rivers, <b>pike</b> density did not influence diet and <b>pike</b> consumed smaller prey items than predicted by their gape-width. Our data suggest that (1) juvenile salmonids are a dominant prey item for <b>pike,</b> (2) small <b>pike</b> are the primary consumers of juvenile salmonids and (3) <b>pike</b> consume other native fish species when juvenile salmonids are less abundant. Implications of this trophic adaptability are that invasive <b>pike</b> can continue to increase while driving multiple species to low abundance...|$|R

25|$|Aggressiveness also {{arises from}} a need of space. Young <b>pike</b> {{tend to have}} their food robbed by larger <b>pike.</b> <b>Pike</b> are {{aggressive}} if not given enough space because they are territorial. They use a form of foraging known as sit-and-wait. Unlike species such as perch, <b>pike</b> undergo bursts of energy instead of actively chasing down prey. As such, {{a fair amount of}} inactive time occurs until they find prey. Hunting efficiency decreases with competition; the larger the <b>pike,</b> the larger the area controlled by that particular <b>pike.</b> An inverse relation to vegetation density and <b>pike</b> size exists, which is due to the possibility of cannibalism from the largest <b>pike.</b> This makes sense, as the smaller <b>pike</b> need more vegetation to avoid being eaten. Large <b>pike</b> do not have this worry and can afford the luxury of a large line of sight. They prefer a tree structure habitat.|$|R
