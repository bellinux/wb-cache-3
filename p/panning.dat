5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some <b>panning.</b> So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. It gives {{you a lot of}} freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

40|$|The Pab 1 p-dependent poly(A) {{nuclease}} (<b>PAN)</b> from Saccharomyces cerevisiae copurifies with polypeptides {{of approximately}} 127 and 76 kDa. Previously, it was {{demonstrated that the}} 127 -kDa <b>Pan</b> 2 protein is required for <b>PAN</b> activity (R. Boeck, S. Tarun, M. Reiger, J. Deardorff, S. Müller-Auer, and A. B. Sachs, J. Biol. Chem. 271 : 432 - 438, 1996). Here we demonstrate that the 76 -kDa protein, encoded by the nonessential <b>PAN</b> 3 gene, is also required for enzymatic activity. Deletion of <b>PAN</b> 3 resulted {{in the loss of}} <b>PAN</b> activity in yeast extracts, and immunodepletion of <b>Pan</b> 3 p from purified <b>PAN</b> fractions abolished enzymatic activity. We show by coimmunoprecipitation and directed two-hybrid studies that the <b>Pan</b> 2 and <b>Pan</b> 3 proteins physically interact. In addition, we demonstrate that a deletion of <b>PAN</b> 2, <b>PAN</b> 3, or both resulted in similar increases in mRNA poly(A) tail lengths in vivo. These data strongly suggest that both <b>Pan</b> 2 p and <b>Pan</b> 3 p are required subunits of the <b>PAN</b> enzyme and that <b>PAN</b> functions in vivo to shorten mRNA poly(A) tails...|$|R
5|$|Marble {{quarrying}} {{and processing}} are major activities in Romblon. Among {{the most common}} marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips).

Gold <b>panning</b> and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.|$|E
5|$|Recreational gold mining {{is popular}} along the Klamath {{and some of}} its tributaries, {{including}} the Salmon and the Trinity. Although simple methods such as <b>panning</b> are still used, some methods use suction pumps—a practice involving turning over deposits of sediment and spreading them in order to find gold. Debates over the practice, which opponents contend damage water quality (mercury) and fish habitat, continue. Currently, suction dredge mining is banned in California until 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} for NASA's imaging team was that, as the mission progressed, the objects being photographed were getting {{farther away from}} the spacecraft, therefore appearing fainter and requiring longer exposures and even slewing (<b>panning)</b> of the cameras to achieve good quality. The telecommunication capability also decreased with distance, limiting the number of data modes that could be used by the imaging system.|$|E

30|$|Paradigm 1 : The home-PAN notifies all sensor nodes {{under its}} control about the {{presence}} of foreign <b>PAN</b> with a specific role. An ordinary sensor node in <b>PAN</b> ‘A’ if interested in information of interest from foreign <b>PAN</b> forwards inter-PAN data to the coordinator of <b>PAN</b> ‘A’. <b>PAN</b> ‘A’ coordinator has information about bridge nodes therefore it sends this data to <b>PAN</b> ‘B’ coordinator through bridge nodes. <b>PAN</b> ‘B’ coordinator then sends data to the destination sensor node of <b>PAN</b> ‘B’.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pans</b> are {{manufactured}} in both metal and high-impact plastic. Russia iron or {{heavy gauge steel}} <b>pans</b> are traditional. Steel <b>pans</b> are heavier and stronger than plastic <b>pans.</b> Some are made of lightweight alloys for structural stability. Plastic gold <b>pans</b> resist rust, acid and corrosion, and most are designed with moulded riffles along {{one side of the}} <b>pan.</b> Of the plastic gold <b>pans,</b> green and red ones are usually preferred among prospectors, as both the gold and the black sand stands out {{in the bottom of the}} <b>pan,</b> although many also opt for black <b>pans</b> instead to easily identify gold deposits.|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and <b>panning</b> for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E
5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found his personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while <b>panning</b> his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—ZigBee {{is popular}} for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) devices {{because of its}} low power consumption, {{built-in}} security method and ratified specifications. With these features, it is also suitable {{to be used with}} medical sensor devices. Medical sensors in a human body self organize a ZigBee Personal Area Network (<b>PAN).</b> These <b>PANs</b> are interconnected and form a HealthNet. For the interconnection, a ZigBee <b>PAN</b> detects existence of another <b>PAN</b> with beacon detection or active channel scan. Different ZigBee interconnection schemes are used after detection. <b>PAN</b> bridge method uses special bridge node that works for different <b>PANs</b> with time division method. <b>PAN</b> merge method temporarily changes <b>PAN</b> coordinator’s role as bridge node and merges two <b>PANs.</b> Peer-to-peer network temporarily share all resources when two <b>PANs</b> are met, but all <b>PANs</b> have to use the same channel and operate as an ad-hoc network. In this paper, we perform extensive evaluations using NS- 2 simulations to compare <b>PAN</b> interconnection methods. Results show that the <b>PAN</b> bridge is the most useful method because it is not affected by router/node ratio and is applicable to different channel usages. I...|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence. The video opens within a black cube {{with an array of}} different colored lights with several people dancing. The video inter-cuts to Justin Timberlake singing to the song. Timberlake then floats to the floor from an opening in the cubic's ceiling, performing choreography with his supporting dancers and singing to the track's first verse. Throughout the video, it inter-cuts to Timberlake dancing by himself, with the sections sometimes featuring the camera <b>panning</b> around Timberlake's face. Entering the second verse, Timberlake is in the cube on his own, manipulating the motion of the cube with his hands, with his legs following the moving platform. Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers. Following the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female (Staci Flood), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section. A break-down of the song, where Timberlake is beatboxing, shows him dancing by himself. The beatboxing section of the song is only available in the music video version, the album version cuts the beatboxing out. The breakdown then ends, with the video continuing with Timberlake and his back-up dancers. The closing beat boxing section of the track features the camera <b>panning</b> around several duplicates of Timberlake beatboxing and talking in sync to the song's lyrics. The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Trinity River is an {{important}} water source for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation, {{as well as a}} major center of recreational activities such as gold <b>panning,</b> fishing and whitewater rafting. Since 1964 the Trinity River has been dammed to create Trinity Lake, the third largest man-made lake in the state. As much as 90percent of the upper Trinity River watershed was diverted for agriculture in the Central Valley. In 1991 environmental regulations were enacted, requiring a greater release of water to the Trinity River in order to protect fish. However, the use of Trinity River water remains a contentious issue, especially in years of drought.|$|E
