40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the derivation of functional programs for grammar <b>analysis</b> <b>problems,</b> {{such as the}} Empty problem and the Reachable <b>problem.</b> Grammar <b>analysis</b> <b>problems</b> {{can be divided into}} two classes: top-down problems such as Follow and Reachable, which are described in terms of the contexts of nonterminals, and bottom-up problems such as Empty and First, which do not refer to contexts. In a previous paper we derive a program for bottom-up grammar <b>analysis</b> <b>problems.</b> In this paper we derive a program for top-down grammar <b>analysis</b> <b>problems</b> by transforming the specification of an arbitrary top-down problem into a program. The existence of a solution is guaranteed provided some natural conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, we describe a general transformation that applies to both classes of grammar <b>analysis</b> <b>problems.</b> The general transformation avoids unnecessary computations in the computation of a fixed point. Constructor classes, which are used to abstract from the notions bottom-up and top-down, are an essential ingredient of the latter derivation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The control {{landscape}} for various canonical quantum control problems is considered. For {{the class of}} pure-state transfer <b>problems,</b> <b>analysis</b> of the fidelity as a functional over the unitary group reveals no suboptimal attractive critical points (traps). For the actual optimization problem over controls in L 2 (0, T), however, there are critical points for which the fidelity can assume any value in (0, 1), critical points for which the second order analysis is inconclusive, and traps. For the class of unitary operator optimization <b>problems</b> <b>analysis</b> of the fidelity over the unitary group shows that {{while there are no}} traps over U(N), traps already emerge when the domain is restricted to the special unitary group. The traps on the group can be eliminated by modifying the performance index, corresponding to optimization over the projective unitary group. However, again, the set of critical points for the actual optimization problem for controls in L 2 (0, T) is larger and includes traps, some of which remain traps even when the target time is allowed to vary...|$|R
