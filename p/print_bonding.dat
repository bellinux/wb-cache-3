Screen <b>printing</b> and <b>bonding</b> process development Screen-printing is a method for the selective layer deposition of a specific material on flat surfaces. During the print process the material will be pressed through a textured screen (see Figure 1). For encapsulation of micro mechanical components by seal glass bonding it is necessary to create small structures of seal glass like bond frames at one of two substrates. To achieve this aim two different material types of screen fabric layers were evaluated. The two materials were polyester and stainless steel. The experiments showed that screens made of stainless steel are more suitable for printing smaller (< 200 µm) structures than polyester screens. A second important value to deposit enough glass material on the substrate is the mesh opening of the screen-printing fabric. After evaluating different sizes, a mesh opening of 50 µm proved to b...|$|R

50|$|By 1846 Gazaway {{had moved}} to New York and in 1850, along with some {{associates}} founded the Bank of the Republic with $1,000,000 capital,. Another investment was in Knoxville, TN where a hotel he invested in was renamed the Lamar House Hotel, associated with the Bijou Theater. Around this time his son, Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar had become a thorn in his side, especially through his ownership of The Wanderer (slave ship). Meanwhile, in New York, Gazaway had become a valued contact for Southern governments, arranging loans, <b>printing</b> <b>bonds</b> and as the war neared, actually buying semi-obsolete rifles from the federal arsenal for the states of Georgia and South Carolina. At {{the start of the}} Civil War his wife (second wife, the first having drowned in the sinking of his steamboat Pulaski) was in poor health, and she died soon after. True to his native state, Gazaway had returned to Georgia by early 1861 where he was active in banking. In the Spring of 1863 ten men including Lamar announced the forming of the Importing and Exporting Company of Georgia. It was late in the war and the Union blockade was getting stronger and stronger so this venture, like the confederacy, was doomed. When Savannah fell, it is estimated that something like 10% of the cotton seized by Sherman belonged to Gazaway Lamar.|$|R

40|$|The foundry {{industry}} provides near {{net shape}} metal casting {{for a wide}} range of industries, producing components in ferrous and non-ferrous metal castings in a range of sizes from miniature items as small as zips to large castings such as ships' propellers. The sand casting process has changed little over centuries, except for incremental improvement in materials and mechanisation of the process, the fundamental process being that of sand compacted around a pre-manufactured mould pattern which is then removed to cast the metal. For mass production stage this is both efficient and economical, however during development and prototyping production stages the requirement for mould production tooling, the design constrained production method means this stage is often a major bottleneck in new product development. Additive manufacturing has been used to manufacture sand moulds for metal sand casting using laser sintering and sand bonding process without the need for tooling. This research focuses on optimisation of the build parameters for additive manufactured sand <b>print</b> <b>bonded</b> mould tools specifically for automotive aluminium castings. The approach taken in this research is to evaluate characteristics of casting produced and relates to the permeability, dimensional accuracy, tensile and compressive crush strength, density, impact strength and high temperature resistance of the mould tool produced. These properties are required to compare the 3 D Sand Printing (3 DSP) process to traditional Furan based casting sand mixtures. The automotive turbo charger casing was used to validate the build parameters optimisation process. This research would be of interest to designers and manufacturing engineers wishing to take advantage of the implications of having new design freedom, tool-less manufacturing with short lead times in a wide range of materials using fundamentally tried and tested foundry industry casting techniques.
