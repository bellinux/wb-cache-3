40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{development of}} Haar-based rectangular windows for recognition of young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> based on WorldView- 2 imagery data. Haar-based rectangular windows or {{also known as}} Haar-like rectangular features have been popular in face recognition as used in Viola-Jones object detection framework. Similar to face recognition, the oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> recognition would also need a suitable Haar-based rectangular windows that best suit to the characteristics of oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> A set of seven Haar-based rectangular windows {{have been designed to}} better match specifically the young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> as the crown size is much smaller compared to the matured ones. Determination of features for oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> is an essential task to ensure a high successful rate of correct oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> detection. Furthermore, features that reflects the identification of oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> indicate distinctiveness between an oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> and other objects in the image such as buildings, roads and drainage. These features will be trained using support vector machine (SVM) to model the oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> for classifying the testing set and subimages of WorldView- 2 imagery data. The resulting classification of young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> with sensitivity of 98. 58 % and accuracy of 92. 73 % shows a promising result that it can be used for intention of developing automatic young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> counting...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{application of}} Haar-based rectangular features for recognition of young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> based on WorldView- 2 imagery data. Younger age of oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> {{should be more}} separated and sparse in the imagery data compare to the matured age of oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree.</b> Even though that the young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> can obviously be detected visually in the image, the contrast of the image is significantly lower. This leads to difficulty of distinguishing the young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> and {{the background of the}} image. Thus, the images will be processed using power law transformation to increase the contrast of the images. Several existing and new modified Haar-based rectangular features are introduced to the WorldView- 2 image. The features for young oil palm and non-oil palm will be trained and classified using AdaBoost. The resulting classification of young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> shows a promising result that it can be used for intention of developing automatic young oil <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> counting...|$|R

40|$|Adsorption {{of heavy}} metals on {{biological}} sorbents, activated carbon and synthetic resin particles {{is a common}} separation technique. In this study, the biosorption of nickel ions from aqueous solution by <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> leaves was investigated {{as a function of}} shaking time, nickel ions concentration and equilibrium pH. Competitive adsorption of nickel on <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> leaves with EDTA and citric acid was also investigated. Batch adsorption experiments revealed that the biosorption of nickel on <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> leaves was strongly pH dependent, and maximum nickel sorption was found to occur at equilibrium pH of 6. 0. Dynamics studies showed that: the initial uptake of nickel on <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> leaves was rapid, equilibrium was established within 30 minutes, and the data followed the pseudo-second order reaction. The equilibrium sorption data of nickel on <b>palm</b> <b>tree</b> leaves at solution pH 6. 0 were described by two-parameter isotherm models such as the Langmuir, Freundlich, and D-R models and three-parameter models such as Redlich-Peterson and Sips isotherm models.
