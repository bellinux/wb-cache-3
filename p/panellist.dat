5|$|Seán Gallagher, entrepreneur, <b>panellist</b> on the Dragons' Den {{television}} programme and {{former member of}} the Fianna Fáil National Executive, was nominated by local councils.|$|E
5|$|Harley later {{also joined}} the AIS-AFL Academy as an {{assistant}} coach and mentor. Prior to the 2010 AFL season, it was further announced that Harley would join the Channel 7 network football commentary team, replacing Nathan Buckley in the leading special comments role. Harley admitted that his previous experience as a regular <b>panellist</b> on the football program One Week at a Time during his playing days had fuelled an interest in working within the media industry. He is currently the general manager of football at the Sydney Swans and will become their CEO in 2019.|$|E
5|$|During World War II Nash {{rejected}} {{offers of}} a home posting and instead served as a trooper in New Guinea, stating that he wished to be treated no differently from any other soldier. Following {{the end of the}} war, Nash returned to South Melbourne and won the team goal kicking award, although his age and injuries inhibited any return of his previous successes. Nash retired from VFL football {{at the end of the}} 1945 season to play and coach in the country before returning to coach South Melbourne in 1953. After retiring, Nash wrote columns for newspapers, was a <b>panellist</b> on football television shows and was a publican before his death in Melbourne, aged 76.|$|E

5000|$|Also, {{there would}} be a special sudoku contest and mental {{calculation}} head-to-head competition, since there were no <b>panellists</b> in [...] "The Brain's Hall of Fame" [...] who specialise in either of these fields. They along with other <b>panellists</b> in the [...] "Hall of Fame" [...] who didn't have their nominated opponents would be straightly qualified for the third phase, in order to play head-to-head with international <b>panellists.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Suggestion effect: The {{suggestion}} {{effect is}} basically the influence of other <b>panellists</b> by voicing their opinions or making known their reactions. Silence and separation of <b>panellists</b> by booth-like partitions help decrease the suggestion effect enormously.|$|R
5|$|During his {{production}} tenure on Children's Ward, Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs, particularly for soap operas; his {{intention was to}} eventually work on the popular and long-running Granada soap Coronation Street. In pursuit of this career plan, he storylined soaps such as Families and wrote scripts for shows such as Cluedo, a game show based on the board game of the same name, and Do the Right Thing, a localised version of the Brazilian panel show Você Decide with Terry Wogan as presenter and Frank Skinner as a regular <b>panellist.</b> One writing job, for The House of Windsor, a soap opera about footmen in Buckingham Palace, was so poorly received that his other scripts for the show would be written under the pseudonym Leo Vaughn.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year is {{an award}} {{presented}} at the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year award ceremony. The award is presented to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport in that year. The award was decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each <b>panellist</b> voted for their top two choices; their first preference was awarded two points, and their second preference was awarded one point. The winning sportsperson had the most total points. In the case of a points tie, the sportsperson chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared. In 2015 the public voted for this award.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award is {{an award}} given {{annually}} {{as part of}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony each December. The award is given to the coach who was considered to have made the most substantative contribution to British sport in that year. The award is decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each <b>panellist</b> votes for their top two choices; their first preference is awarded two points, and their second preference is awarded one point. The winning coach is the one with the largest points total. In the case of a points tie, the person chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared.|$|E
50|$|The four {{original}} <b>panellists</b> were {{adept at}} this game, and each took an individual turn. Since {{the death of}} Willie Rushton guest <b>panellists</b> have appeared, and the two team members occasionally sing together, presumably {{to compensate for the}} unsteadiness of a guest's voice. Guest <b>panellists</b> sometimes exhibit little or no musical talent, most notably Jeremy Hardy, whose dreadful attempts at singing are greatly anticipated by audiences, and this itself often makes for effective comedy.|$|R
30|$|The sensory {{evaluation}} of the products was carried for various attributes namely colour and appearance, flavour, juiciness, texture and overall acceptability {{by a panel of}} seven experienced <b>panellists</b> on a 8 -point hedonic scale, wherein 8 denoted “extremely desirable” and 1 denoted “extremely undesirable” (Seman et al., 1987). <b>Panellists</b> were seated in a room free of noise and odours and suitably illuminated. Coded samples for {{sensory evaluation}} were prepared and served warm to <b>panellists.</b> Water was provided for oral rinsing between the samples.|$|R

50|$|During {{the opening}} introduction, Chris Maslanka would present {{a few short}} puzzles for the {{listeners}} and <b>panellists</b> to work on {{during the course of}} the programme. He would then introduce the three <b>panellists,</b> and invite each in turn to present a puzzle to the others.|$|R
50|$|Four regular <b>panellists</b> discuss {{moral and}} ethical issues raised by a recent news story. Michael Buerk {{delivers}} a preamble launching the topic, then a series of 'witnesses' - experts or other relevant people - are questioned by the <b>panellists,</b> who then discuss what each witness said.|$|R
5000|$|Both the You're Fired! {{audience}} {{and two of}} the <b>panellists</b> agreed with the decision to fire Gavin, with one of the <b>panellists</b> who agreed commenting that it had been a close decision between Gavin and Vincent. Sean Lock described it as [...] "the best decision Lord Sugar ever made".|$|R
25|$|In February 2009, it was {{announced}} that Brydon would be one of three people to replace Lyttelton as chairman of the 51st series of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue (the others being Stephen Fry and Jack Dee). Brydon also appeared as guest <b>panellist</b> in the first two episodes of series 52, chaired by Jack Dee. He returned as a guest <b>panellist</b> in the last two episodes of series 54 in January 2011.|$|E
25|$|Another set of tour dates, with Jack Dee as {{chairman}} and Jeremy Hardy as guest <b>panellist,</b> took place in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Merton {{appeared}} on BBC Radio 4's The Big Fun Show. After long-time Just a Minute <b>panellist</b> Kenneth Williams died in 1988, Merton (a {{fan of the}} show) contacted the producer {{at the suggestion of}} the host, Nicholas Parsons. He was invited to participate during the following year and has appeared regularly on the programme ever since. In 2016 Merton overtook Williams to become the second most regular <b>panellist,</b> surpassed only by Clement Freud.|$|E
5000|$|McDermott opens each {{show with}} a scripted {{monologue}} in which he dissects newsworthy events in a humorous manner. He concludes by declaring, [...] "and that's the good news!" [...] and throwing his newspaper clippings in the air, after which an air cannon expels more newspaper clippings all over the stage. The episode's six <b>panellists,</b> divided into two teams, are then introduced. Teams are captained by the two regular <b>panellists,</b> radio comedian Mikey Robins and stand-up comedian Claire Hooper. The four guest <b>panellists</b> consist {{of a combination of}} comedians, media personalities and occasionally politicians.|$|R

50|$|The panel {{underwent}} a further presenter revamp for its 19th series following the departures of Vorderman, Sally Lindsay and Shobna Gulati. Klass and Claire Richards, {{who had been}} <b>panellists</b> for series 18, also did not return. Gloria Hunniford, Penny Lancaster and Judy Finnigan were announced as new <b>panellists.</b> June Sarpong later joined the show on 23 March 2015. The series also featured a total revamp {{in the style of}} the show, with the logo, set and theme tune changed dramatically, and the <b>panellists</b> walking out to their respective seats at the start, behind a smaller desk, closer to the audience.|$|R
50|$|In each half-hour programme, the <b>panellists</b> {{brought along}} one puzzle {{with which to}} test the mental mettle {{of the other two}} <b>panellists</b> and their host. Essentially, it was just for fun and no points were scored. Another puzzle, the Panel Beater, was contributed by a listener. A prize was {{available}} for solving a competition puzzle.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a German study which compared eight ways of recruiting members for an online access panel. Two thousand respondents, {{divided into four}} groups of 500, were invited to sign up with the panel via email, fax, flier or letter. Half of each sample’s invitations offered a cash lottery, into which new <b>panellists</b> would be entered, whereas {{the other half of}} the invitations did not offer a lottery. Overall, email was the most successful means of solicitation, followed by flier and fax, which were equally efficient. Very few <b>panellists</b> were recruited via letter. The lottery was effective only with fliers. The composition of the recruited samples differed according to solicitation method. Fax-recruited individuals were older than those recruited by flier and email. <b>Panellists</b> recruited via email had been using the internet longer than flier- and fax-recruited <b>panellists</b> and they used the internet more often than those recruited via fax. After their recruitment, <b>panellists</b> were followed up in the first two studies run in the panel. The probability of their taking part in these studies and of completing these questionnaires was independent of the method by which they had been recruited...|$|R
