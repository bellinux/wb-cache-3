Kitiara Uth Matar, the half sister of the twins Caramon and Raistlin, was supposed to be there as well, but only sent a mysterious note.|$|E
5|$|Tim Folger {{speculates that}} news of radio {{contact with an}} {{extraterrestrial}} civilization would prove impossible to suppress and would travel rapidly, though Cold War scientific literature on the subject contradicts this. Media coverage of the discovery would probably die down quickly, though, as scientists began to decipher the message and learn its true impact. Different branches of government (for example legislative, executive, and judiciary) may <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> policies, potentially giving rise to power struggles. Even {{in the event of}} a single contact with no follow-up, radio contact may prompt fierce disagreements as to which bodies have the authority to represent humanity as a whole. Michaud hypothesizes that the fear arising from direct contact may cause nation-states to put aside their conflicts and work together for the common defense of humanity.|$|E

25|$|Corporate {{governance}} in Vietnam is seen {{more as a}} management framework rather than a system for accountability and protecting minority shareholders. In particular, the LOE does not clearly mandate the separation of ownership and management. Separation of ownership and management promotes accountability by allowing managers to be objectively appraised.

25|$|Though {{initially}} one of {{the most}} outspoken de Mella supporters, Chicharro did not integrate fully in the Mellista group; some speak even of “chicharrismo”, others dubbed him “mauro-ciervista”. While de Mella was firm on his Traditionalist principles and opted for a grand conservative party built upon them, Chicharro started to lean towards the vision of Victor Pradera, embracing a more loose Right-wing alliance held together by a lowest common denominator. In the early 1920s he effectively left the Mellistas; some scholars consider him paradigmatic for many rebellious Carlists who joined de Mella in 1919, but soon abandoned him to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> goals and to amalgamate in other Right-wing groupings.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky's primary {{education}} was at Oak Lane Country Day School, an independent Deweyite institution {{that focused on}} allowing its pupils to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> interests in a non-competitive atmosphere. It was here, {{at the age of}} 10, that he wrote his first article, on the spread of fascism, following the fall of Barcelona to Francisco Franco's fascist army in the Spanish Civil War. At the age of 12, Chomsky moved on to secondary education at Central High School, where he joined various clubs and societies and excelled academically, but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching used there. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.|$|E
25|$|In April 2000 Mental As Anything {{announced}} {{the first official}} change to their line-up since 1977. Brothers Peter O'Doherty and Reg Mombassa left to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> musical projects, including their band Dog Trumpet, and their art careers. The last tour by this line-up was a short trip to Vietnam organised by the Australian Government. They were replaced by David 'Duck' Barraclough (ex-The Exponents) and Murray Cook (ex-Leah Purcell, Mixed Relations). Cook (no relation to Murray Cook of The Wiggles) left the band after the Beetroot Stains album (2000) {{and was replaced by}} New Zealand born Mike Caen, who had worked with Jenny Morris, Margaret Urlich, Rick Price, Daryl Braithwaite and Tina Arena. The Road Case album by this line-up appeared late in 2002.|$|E

25|$|The Court buttressed its {{determination}} {{based upon}} the underlying premises of the directness requirement. First, the Court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions. For example, in this case, National could have lowered its prices for numerous reasons unrelated to the asserted fraud. Conversely, Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than National's alleged RICO violation. Secondly, the direct causal connection requirement is especially warranted where the direct victims of the RICO violation can <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> claim. Here, the State of New York could file suit and in that situation, {{it would be much}} easier for a court to calculate New York's damages. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court reversed the Second Circuit's holding that Ideal had satisfied the proximate cause requirement under its section 1962(c) claim.|$|E
25|$|Even {{at the age}} {{of seven}} when the family moved to Lichfield, she {{recognised}} she had a gift for writing. At Lichfield the family lived in the Bishop's Palace which became the centre of a literary circle including Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, to which Anna was exposed and encouraged to participate as she later relates. Though Canon Seward's (but not his wife's) attitudes towards the education of girls was progressive relative to the times, they were not excessively liberal. Amongst the subjects he taught them was theology and numeracy, and how to read and appreciate poetry, and also how to write and recite poetry. Although this deviated from what were considered ' conventional drawing room accomplishments', the omissions were also notable, including languages and science, although they were left free to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> inclinations. However Anna was not unskilled in the domestic sphere.|$|E
25|$|Philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), who {{regularly}} cited De la Court's works, described in his unfinished Tractatus Politicus (1677) how the ideal state, a democratic republic, should function. According to Spinoza, kings {{have a natural}} tendency to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> personal interests, and entrust large portions of power to confidants (who lack any official mandate, but often de facto run the country if the king is a weakling). These confidants are often noblemen, making it an aristocracy instead of a monarchy in practice. The best monarchy is a quasi-monarchy, a crowned republic in which princes have as little power as possible. Spinoza proposes a council of state, elected by citizens, to take the most important decisions, and replace the murderous and pillaging royal mercenary armies by an unpaid draft army of citizens that defends its own country for self-preservation. If this council of state is large and representative enough, {{there will never be}} a majority in favour of war, because of all the suffering, destruction and high taxes it will cause.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard also faced other {{practitioners}} {{moving into}} leadership positions within the Dianetics community. It was structured as an open, public practice in which others {{were free to}} <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> lines of research and claim that their approaches to auditing produced better results than Hubbard's. The community rapidly splintered and its members mingled Hubbard's ideas {{with a wide variety}} of esoteric and even occult practices. By late 1950, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation was in financial crisis and the Los Angeles Foundation was more than $200,000 in debt (...) [...] Winter and Art Ceppos, the publisher of Hubbard's book, resigned under acrimonious circumstances. Campbell also resigned, criticizing Hubbard for being impossible to work with, and blamed him for the disorganization and financial ruin of the Foundations. By the summer of 1951, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation and all of its branches had closed.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Garfield {{believes}} {{the story of}} Never Let Me Go is about humans, and exploring [...] "what {{it is to have}} a soul, and how you prove what a soul is"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a [...] "call to arms" [...] about the positives of life. He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is [...] "more about humanity's ability to look the other way".

500|$|Speakers' Corner was {{established}} by the issuance of the Public Entertainments (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2000, which exempted people wishing to speak in Hong Lim Park from the need {{to apply for a}} licence under the Public Entertainments Act. Speakers had to be Singapore citizens, as the Government was concerned that the venue should not be used by foreigners [...] "to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> agenda whether in respect of their own domestic issues, or those of other countries, including Singapore's". They also had to register their intention to speak with a police officer at the Kreta Ayer NPP any time within 30 days before the public speaking, although {{there was no need to}} inform the police of the topic of the proposed speech. However, speakers were not permitted to deal with any matter which related either directly or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally, or which might cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore.|$|E

Amongst the subjects he taught them were theology and numeracy, and how to read, appreciate, write and recite poetry.

500|$|According to Satoru Iwata, former President of Nintendo, Dragon Quests {{widespread}} {{appeal is}} that it is [...] "made so that anyone can play it...and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests." [...] According to him, Dragon Quest is designed for anyone to pick up without needing to read the manual in order to understand it. Ryutaro Ichimura, producer at Square Enix, who has played the game since he was a child, says the Dragon Quest storylines allow players to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero saving the world. Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of casual gamers, while not alienating the more hardcore gamers, is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy. Iwata and Ichimura believe it is because the games are created in a way that allows both groups to <b>pursue</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> goals; casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles, but for those who want more there is still content for them to pursue.|$|E
