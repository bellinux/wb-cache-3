5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E

25|$|It is {{rare for}} pericoronitis {{to occur in}} {{association}} with both lower third molars at the same time, {{despite the fact that}} many young <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> both lower wisdom teeth partially erupted.

25|$|Cancer can {{be treated}} by surgery, chemotherapy, {{radiation}} therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy (including immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibody therapy) and synthetic lethality. The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and {{the stage of the}} disease, as well as the general state of the patient (performance status).

25|$|African {{countries}} {{suffer from}} communication difficulties caused by language diversity. Greenberg's diversity index {{is the chance}} that two randomly selected people would have different mother tongues. Out of the most diverse 25 countries according to this index, 18 (72%) are African. This includes 12 countries for which Greenberg's diversity index exceeds 0.9, meaning that a pair of randomly selected <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> less than 10% chance of having the same mother tongue. However, the primary language of government, political debate, academic discourse, and administration is often {{the language of the}} former colonial powers; English, French, or Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2012, The Weather Channel began to assign names to major winter storm systems. The channel's {{management}} stated the decision to start naming notable winter storms came {{as a way to}} more easily spread knowledge and raise awareness. By naming winter storms, TWC stated that the public would find it easier to follow storm information, social media will be able to refer to and discuss the storm, and <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> an easier time referring to the storm after it occurs. Most independent sources identify the use of winter storm names by The Weather Channel as a form of SEO-friendly branding.|$|E

25|$|Farming, which, {{the authors}} note, {{produces}} 10 to 100 times more calories per acre than foraging, carried this trend further. Over {{the period from}} 10,000 BC to AD 1, the world population increased about a hundredfold - estimates range from 40 to 170 times. An accelerated rate of evolution {{is a direct result}} of the larger human population. More <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> more mutations, thereby increasing opportunity for evolutionary change under natural selection. The spread of rapidly expanding populations eventually outpaced the spread of favourable mutations under selection in those populations, so for the ﬁrst time in human history favourable mutations could not fully disperse throughout the human species. In addition, of course, selection pressures changed once farming was adopted, favouring distinctive adaptations in different geographic areas.|$|E

Epilepsy {{is more common in}} older people. In the developed world, onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the elderly. In the developing world onset is more common in older children and young adults, due to differences in the frequency of the underlying causes.

500|$|At the Twenty-Second Congress of the CPSU in October {{that year}} Khrushchev openly {{attacked}} the Albanian leadership, proclaiming Hoxha a [...] "leftist nationalist deviationist" [...] {{and calling for}} his overthrow, declaring that, [...] "We are certain the time will come when the Albanian communists and the Albanian <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> their say, and then the Albanian leaders will have to answer for the harm they have done their country, their people {{and the cause of}} socialist construction in Albania." [...] He further stated that [...] "The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks." [...] To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech, [...] "the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees." [...] Nicholas C. Pano noted that [...] " [...] pronouncements , at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned, had made the policies of de-Stalinization, peaceful coexistence, and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system." [...] Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries, the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew [...] "the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA, {{while at the same time}} demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union."
