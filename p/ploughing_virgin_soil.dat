Comparisons were made of soil properties at several depths. When compared with the tilled <b>soils</b> the <b>virgin</b> <b>soils</b> had higher organic matter contents, saturated hydraulic conductivities and water retained at several applied pressures. Bulk densities and hydraulic resistances were lower in the <b>virgin</b> <b>soils.</b> For the Crowley silt loam, values of pH and elemental contents of the <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> were higher than those of the tilled soil. Determinations also were made of the effects of a 14 -year addition of winter cover crops on a Dubbs-Dundee soil in continuous cotton production. In general, the winter cover crops tended to increase hydraulic conductivity~. ·porosity and organic matter content. These results indicated that the detrimental effects of long-term tillage on soil hydraulic properties could partially be overcome with the planting of these crops during the winter. However, the rate of improvement in the hydraulic properties was not dramatic...|$|R

Analyzing the indices of total number and algae biomass in studied biogeocoenoses {{it should be}} noted that the maximal values of alga number in <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> steppe exceeded minimal in 3, 3 times; biomasses - in 2, 1. For <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> steppe of post-fire-induced development the relation between maximum and minimal value of total number of algae was up to 2, 1; biomass - 2, 4. For agrocoenosis we noted the largest ranges in variation of number and biomass.

In soil samples, selected within the limits of <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> biogeocoenoses of biosphere reserve “Askania-Nova” and agrocoenosis of dry-land and irrigated arable land in biosphere reserve by direct count, the algae species of Bacillariophyta, Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Xanthophyta and Eustigmatophyta have been found.

The results clearly showed that rapeseed crop was not suited to the <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> as the crop produced 10 % of the seed yield achieved at the fertile soil. There were significant increases in seed yield, straw and biological yields due to NPK application. Oil yields were 0. 312 and 2. 304 t ha- 1 on <b>virgin</b> and fertile <b>soils,</b> respectively. Treated wastewater supplied rapeseed with 35, 43 and 156 % of the recommended requirements of N, P and K, respectively in the <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> while the corresponding values in the fertile soil were 79, 96 and 191 % for N,P and K, respectively.

40|$|Phosphate {{fertilizers}} are enriched with 238 U {{during its}} production from phosphate rocks. Since, application of phosphate fertilizers in modern agriculture is ever on the increase, {{the present study}} investigated the impact of phosphate fertilizers on the radioactivity profile of cultivated (fertilized) <b>soils</b> as against <b>virgin</b> <b>soils.</b> Thirty soil samples each from cultivated fields and virgin fields were collected from Srirangam taluk and analyzed for the activity concentrations of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K employing gamma ray spectrometry. Similar analysis was also undertaken in commonly used phosphate fertilizers. Among the phosphate fertilizers analyzed single super phosphate (396. 3  Bq/kg) and triple super phosphate (284. 2  Bq/kg) registered higher level of 238 U. The mean activity level of 238 U in cultivated soil (8. 4  Bq/kg) was 25 % higher than that of <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> (6. 8  Bq/kg), while the mean 232 Th and 40 K activities in cultivated soil (98. 4  Bq/kg & 436  Bq/kg) were elevated by 12. 4 % and 4 % respectively as compared to <b>virgin</b> <b>soil</b> (87. 5  Bq/kg & 419  Bq/kg). The mean radium equivalent (Raeq) value for <b>virgin</b> and cultivated <b>soil</b> samples was found to be 164. 5  Bq/kg and 181. 7  Bq/kg respectively. It is evident that the application of phosphate fertilizers elevated 238 U level of the soil. However, the mean Raeq value for soil samples is well below the permissible limit of 370  Bq/kg and hence cultivated soils do not pose any radiological risk...|$|R
