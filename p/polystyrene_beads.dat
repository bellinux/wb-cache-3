40|$|We {{increase}} the effective stiffness of optical tweezers by position clamping a <b>polystyrene</b> <b>bead</b> with a predictive feedback control algorithm. This algorithm mitigates {{the effect of}} feedback loop delay. Hence, higher gain than with proportional control can be employed, which results in higher effective trap stiffness, without trap instability. In experiments (initial trap stiffness 0. 056 pN/nm with a 1. 78 µm diameter <b>polystyrene</b> <b>bead)</b> predictive control increased the effective trap stiffness by 55 % relative to proportional control. We also derive theoretical expressions for the power spectra of the bead position controlled by our algorithm.

25|$|On-Bead Ligand Binding assays are {{isolation}} {{methods for}} basic proteins, DNA/RNA or other biomolecules located in undefined suspensions {{and can be}} used in multiple biochromatographic applications. Bioaffine ligands are covalently bound to silica beads with terminal negatively charged silanol groups or <b>polystyrene</b> <b>beads</b> and are used for isolation and purification of basic proteins or adsorption of biomolecules. After binding the separation is performed by centrifugation (density separation) or by magnetic field attraction (for magnetic particles only). The beads can be washed to provide purity of the isolated molecule before dissolving it by ion exchange methods. Direct analyzation methods based on enzymatic/fluorescent detection (e.g. HRP, fluorescent dye) can be used for on-bead determination or quantification of bound biomolecules.|$|E

2500|$|EDTA {{was used}} in {{separation}} of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography. [...] Perfected by F.H. Spedding et al. in 1954, the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide EDTA complexes with atomic number. Using sulfonated <b>polystyrene</b> <b>beads</b> and copper(II) as a retaining ion, EDTA causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanide. The lanthanides elute in order of decreasing atomic number. Due to the expense of this method, relative to counter-current solvent extraction, ion-exchange is now used only to obtain the highest purities of lanthanide (typically greater than 4N, 99.99%).|$|E

The response function amplitude of the oscillatory bead directly measures {{the dynamics of the}} spatiotemporal structure of the motile particles.

Appropriate Langevin equations are set up that capture all these essential features...|$|R

30|$|The DEP {{force is}} {{positive}} when the Clausius-Mossotti (CM) factor (ƒCM) {{has a positive}} value while the negative DEP force is generated when ƒCM has a negative value. Moreover, the electric field gradient and the radius of the particles are directly affected by the DEP force [8]. According to the electric field distribution, we can predict where the beads are trapped on the chip. In the positive DEP, the particles are gathered toward the higher electric field region while the particles move toward the lower electric field region in the negative DEP. In {{the case of the}} <b>polystyrene</b> <b>bead,</b> it has negative DEP characteristics at almost every frequency range.|$|R

50|$|Components of {{biological}} membranes diffuse in a viscous pseudo-two-dimensional environment. By labeling membrane component with either an optical label (such as a gold or <b>polystyrene</b> <b>bead)</b> or a fluorescent tag, a trajectory can be observed. The trajectory of lipids and proteins within the membrane of live cells {{have been used}} to infer the mechanisms affecting their motion. One of the methods to observe optical labels on cell membranes is known as nanovid microscopy. Another interesting technique associated with particle tracking is real-time 3D particle tracking, that was used in the context of observing small complexes as they are shuttled around in or near the cell membrane.|$|R
50|$|This {{method is}} based on use of RNA {{polymerase}} (RNAP), which {{is attached to a}} <b>polystyrene</b> <b>bead.</b> One end of DNA to be sequenced is attached to another bead, with both beads being placed in optical traps. RNAP motion during transcription brings the beads in closer and their relative distance changes, which can then be recorded at a single nucleotide resolution. The sequence is deduced based on the four readouts with lowered concentrations of each of the four nucleotide types, similarly to the Sanger method. A comparison is made between regions and sequence information is deduced by comparing the known sequence regions to the unknown sequence regions.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} demonstration of multiple optical tweezers based on interference of two co-propagating beams that intersect {{at a given}} angle and form interference fringes (asymmetric optical traps) at the focal plane of a focusing lens. Since this arrangement provides only two-dimensional trapping when the objects are pushed against the coverglass, we added the third counter-propagating beam. This beam did {{not interfere with the}} previous two but compensated their radiation pressure. Therefore, stable three-dimensional confinement into multiple fringes is achieved. We quantified experimentally the maximal optical forces exerted on 1  μm <b>polystyrene</b> <b>bead</b> in both configurations and compared them with theoretical predictions. Reasonable good coincidence was found especially for two-dimensional trapping...|$|R

40|$|Maximum {{trapping}} efficiency in optical tweezers occurs {{close to the}} coverslip because spherical aberration owing to a mismatch in the refractive indices of the specimen (water) and the immersion oil dramatically decreases the trap efficiency as the trap depth increases. Measuring the axial trap efficiency at various tube lengths by use of an oil-immersion objective has shown that such an aberration can be balanced by another source of spherical aberration, leading to {{a shift in the}} position of the maximum efficiency in the Z direction. For a 1. 1 microm <b>polystyrene</b> <b>bead</b> we could achieve the maximal efficiency at a depth of 70 microm, whereas the trap was stable up to a depth of 100 microm...|$|R

We have demonstrated the feasibility of our method by observing the bead undergoing Brownian motion in water by implemented setup. For fast determination, a series of transverse intensity images are numerically reconstructed from a single hologram of the bead, then centroid technique is applied to the reconstructed images for enhancing the position resolution.
