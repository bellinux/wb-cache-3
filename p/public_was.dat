5|$|After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French <b>public</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} indifferent. Carmen initially gained {{its reputation}} {{through a series}} of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.|$|E

5000|$|In public {{relations}} and communication theory, a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> distinct from a stakeholder or a market. A <b>public</b> <b>is</b> {{a subset of the}} set of stakeholders for an organization, that comprises those people concerned with a specific issue. Whilst a market has an exchange relationship with an organization, and is usually a passive entity that is created by the organization, a public does not necessarily have an exchange relationship, and is both self-creating and self-organizing. <b>Publics</b> <b>are</b> targeted by <b>public</b> relations efforts. In this, target <b>publics</b> <b>are</b> those <b>publics</b> whose involvement <b>is</b> necessary for achieving organization goals; intervening <b>publics</b> <b>are</b> opinion formers and mediators, who pass information to the target publics; and influentials <b>are</b> <b>publics</b> that the target publics turn to for consultation, whose value judgements are influential upon how a target public will judge any {{public relations}} material. The <b>public</b> <b>is</b> often targeted especially in regard to political agendas as their vote is necessary in order to further the progression of the cause. As seen in Massachusetts between 2003 and 2004, it was necessary to [...] "win a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public support" [...] in order to get same-sex marriage passed in the commonwealth.|$|R

5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy {{and make it}} more accessible, though appreciated by many of the <b>public,</b> <b>was</b> distrusted by the British Establishment.

5000|$|Public {{relations}} theory {{perspectives on}} <b>publics</b> <b>are</b> situational, per Dewey and Grunig; mass, where a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> simply {{viewed as a}} population of individuals; agenda-building, where a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> viewed {{as a condition of}} political involvement that is not transitory; and [...] "homo narrans", where a <b>public</b> <b>is</b> (in the words of Gabriel M. Vasquez, assistant professor in the School of Communication at the University of Houston) a collection of [...] "individuals that develop a group consciousness around a problematic situation and act to solve the problematic situation" [...] <b>Public</b> schools <b>are</b> often under controversy for their [...] "agenda-building," [...] especially in debates over whether to teach a religious or secular curriculum. [...] The promotion of an agenda is commonplace whenever one <b>is</b> in a <b>public</b> environment, but schools have exceptional power in that regard. In the public school system, {{it is the responsibility of}} those within the system to determine what agenda is being promoted.|$|R

Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934.
