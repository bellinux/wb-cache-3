5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> {{this is the}} {{extensive}} freeway system in the city, due {{to the majority of}} that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.|$|E
5|$|The {{lineup of}} the live band had a {{tendency}} to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band had remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the {{presence}} of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It seems likely that at least <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>the</b> feeling between {{contract}} servicemen, conscripts, and officers.|$|R
50|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{humor in}} the series comes from Dr. Kiwi's pedophilia, as he {{demonstrates}} an attraction to 13-year-old Patti. This subtext may be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> show was never sold internationally.|$|R

5|$|With 13 {{episodes in}} its final season, Fringe has a total of 100 episodes, a {{critical}} number for syndication deals for Warner Bros., and considered <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the show's final renewal. The show premiered in syndication on the Science Network on November 20, 2012.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2009 speech {{entitled}} Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, {{the governor}} of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's bancor. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} new {{journals}} specializing in machine learning (e.g., Journal of Machine Learning) and many older journals {{that are now}} routinely sprinkled with machine learning papers (e.g., Journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Statistical Association). So far, however, applications in criminology are hard to find. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is time; {{it takes a while}} for new technology to diffuse. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is software; <b>the</b> popular statistical packages can be at least five years behind recent developments. Yet another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>the</b> need for a dramatic attitude adjustment among criminologists. Empirical research in criminology is thoroughly dominated by a culture of causal modeling in which the intent is to explain in detail the mechanisms by which nature generated <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> a response variable as a particular function of designated predictors and stochastic disturbances.a Machine learning comes from a different culture characterized by an “algorithmic” perspective.|$|R
50|$|Before long, {{however, the}} CIA was {{training}} Cuban guerillas. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Pigs Invasion operation failed was disagreement between senior military {{people and the}} CIA paramilitary staff about what was necessary for an invasion to work; there were also pure political issues that helped doom it.|$|R
5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Somerset's poor {{performances}} {{was their}} inability to consistently field their best players; at least four of their better cricketers were unable to commit to the full fixture list, and in all the county played 30 different people in their eight matches. Faint praise was offered to the batting of William Herbert Fowler, Newton and Edward Sainsbury in The Sportsman, but the bowling was considered by Wisden to be sub-standard, particularly that of Arnold Fothergill.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} 18 N-3PBs {{were used}} to equip No. 330 (Norwegian) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík, Iceland. The N-3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in crates on board the Norwegian steamer , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> deploying the N-3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom, with the involved risk of friendly fire incidents. The exiled Norwegian military authorities had originally wanted to base the squadron in the United Kingdom {{in order to be}} able to operate off German-occupied Norway.|$|E
5|$|From 7 January 2001, NSB {{made several}} major {{changes to the}} {{commuter}} rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. Six stations were closed: Muruvik, Solbakken, Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg. At the same time, the station at Marienborg and Røstad opened. NSB also introduced a fare zone system, which gave up to NOK20 discount for single-fare travelers and about the same fares for month-pass holders. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units. This also allowed NSB to operate some of services with double unit (four-car) trains in rush-hour.|$|E

50|$|Hammond {{continued}} to play Trump for <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. Killam's contract was terminated early after that season, with some news sources alleging that being replaced as Trump was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>the</b> Narrows are so notable {{is because}} they have a {{downward}} gradient of over 100 feet per mile. <b>The</b> entire section <b>of</b> river is about 3 miles in length.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, he posted career highs in ERA (2.89), {{opponent}} {{batting average}} (.211) and WHIP (1.03). He was 13–7 in 30 games and {{was selected to}} his third All-Star Game. At {{the end of the}} 2011 season, the Red Sox stumbled and failed to make the playoffs. Beckett and two more starting pitchers (John Lackey and Jon Lester) were {{in the center of a}} controversy where the three drank alcohol during games, where they weren't pitching, and also ate fried chicken and played video games. Beckett was noted as the leader of this and some cited this behavior as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the team's poor play down the stretch.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, NSB {{announced}} that they were considering {{reducing the number of}} stations on the commuter rail from the then 31 stations to between 15 and 20. NSB stated that 50% of the stations were responsible for only 2% of the traffic, and that a bus service to these areas—which would transport people to the closest railway station—would be more economic and reduce travel time for the remaining passengers. NSB also stated that they indented to re-brand the service as part of the Puls brand used for the other commuter rail services. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the change of service was that Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality had permitted TrønderBilene to double the number of services on their competing coach service along the route and the commuter rail needed to increase its speed to not lose customers to the coach.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2000, a Class 92 {{train was}} {{damaged beyond repair}} in the Åsta {{accident}} near Åsta Station on the Røros Line. Nineteen {{people were killed in}} the accident. From 7 January 2001, NSB made several major changes to the commuter rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units.

500|$|The {{terrorist}} threat level in Great Britain was upgraded to [...] "substantial" [...] on 11 May 2016, with the New IRA's continuing threats being <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> by Home Secretary Theresa May and MI5.|$|R
50|$|Mapperley Tunnel was {{extremely}} unstable due to mining subsidence {{and the heavy}} traffic through it. In 1925 <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof collapsed, blocking the line, and this was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that this section of line closed prematurely.|$|R
5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a {{telemetry}} station. There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station was a chance to apply its latest minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E
5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the inefficacy of the 1914 {{session was}} that McCreary {{was engaged in}} a {{three-way}} primary race for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate. The other major candidates were former Governor Beckham and Augustus O. Stanley; a fourth candidate, David H. Smith, withdrew early from the race. McCreary ran a mostly positive campaign, touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents. Beckham and Stanley, however, were bitter political and personal enemies, and the campaign reflected their animosity. Without the support of Beckham's political machine that had helped him in the gubernatorial contest, McCreary never had a realistic {{chance to win the}} nomination. Beckham secured the nomination with 72,677 votes to Stanley's 65,871 and McCreary's 20,257.|$|E
5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> their lackluster {{performance}} was repeated injuries to starting quarterback Al Clark, who missed three regular-season games due to injuries. Heading into the Music City Bowl, he {{was recovering from}} a rib injury suffered in Tech's final regular-season game. Despite the missed games, Clark completed 72 of 148 passes for 1,050 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and five interceptions for the 1998 season. On the ground, Virginia Tech running backs Lamont Pegues and Shyrone Stith combined for 1,444 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns. Together, they averaged 178 yards per game on the ground. Another bright spot on the Virginia Tech offense was kicker Shayne Graham, who was named a first-team All Big East selection. He kicked 37 extra points and was successful on 22 field goal attempts, earning the Hokies 103 points in total.|$|E
25|$|Harburg {{stated in}} 1960 {{that he was}} told <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> it was so {{difficult}} to get a film version made was Hollywood was scared of fantasy musicals. Another <b>reason</b> was <b>the</b> McCarthyism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period.|$|R
50|$|The land {{along the}} Orange area often flooded from the Sabine, with {{destructive}} effects. Also, the considerations for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and recreational purposes were <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> Texas State Legislature formed the Sabine River Authority of Texas in 1949, and in 1950 the Louisiana State Legislature created the Sabine River Authority, State <b>of</b> Louisiana for <b>the</b> project.|$|R
5|$|Vainglory {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's graphics, characters, and level design, but criticized {{its lack of}} team communication features. Reviewers disagreed on <b>the</b> game's degree <b>of</b> accessibility to newcomers, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why it received mixed reviews.|$|R
5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this was that the sound program used in Evermore was {{not up to the}} technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations. When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company, Humongous Entertainment, and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, Putt-Putt; he was the company's third employee. Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the Putt-Putt, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish and Spy Fox series.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} 1882 on Fort Glanville's {{northern}} sister Fort Largs—then {{known as the}} Port Adelaide battery—to the same specification as Fort Glanville; its barracks and rear defence wall were finished in 1885. Though guns had already been purchased specially, plans for the third fort at Glenelg were not proceeded with. South Australia was experiencing a depression in 1886 and that coupled with a report by General James Bevan Edwards scuttled plans for the third coastal fort. As early as 1888 the emphasis for defence of the Adelaide coast had already shifted to Fort Largs; a fact cited as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> abandonment of the Glenelg fortifications.|$|E
5|$|At age 18, {{playing in}} a limited role for HV71 during the 2010–11 season, Fast scored 16 points (seven goals, nine assists) in 36 games, with a +6 plus-minus, six penalty minutes and two power play goals, {{exceeded}} most observers' expectations. Fast credited playing alongside Johan Davidsson as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> his success and growth in confidence. He was held scoreless with a -3 plus-minute in three postseason games as the first-place HV71 was swept from {{the first round of}} the playoffs by Allmänna Idrottsklubben (AIK) in an upset. In the 2011–12 season, Fast had three multi-point games, including a career-high four assists and five points against AIK on October 4. That game started a streak of 10 points (one goal, nine assists) over six games, which continued to an October 20 match against Frölunda HC. However, Fast's season was cut short after he suffered a fractured ankle during a November 29 game against Brynäs IF. He missed three months as a result, but nevertheless recorded 16 points (five goals, 11 assists) in 21 games for the season, matching his Swedish Hockey League career high in points and establishing new career highs in assists and plus-minus (+9). He also scored two goals and one assist in five postseason games.|$|E
50|$|Junior {{officers}} {{were in a}} much more parlous state, as it was not really possible to keep a home on the half pay for a Lieutenant. This was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why marriage by junior officers was so frowned upon.|$|R
50|$|Madame Fatal {{was never}} a popular {{character}} given the cross-dressing angle, which is perhaps <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why DC Comics decided not to further run with the character and limited him to light-hearted jibes made by other comic book heroes.|$|R
30|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>the</b> black-box {{manner in}} {{a very large number}} of new {{predictors}} are generated as a component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search process. A new linear basis can be defined for each predictor and various sets <b>of</b> predictors. Another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is that tree-based methods capitalize on regions in which associations with the response are weak. One by one, such regions do matter much, and conventional regression approaches bent on explanation might properly choose to ignore them. But when a large number of such regions is taken seriously, forecasting accuracy can dramatically improve. There is important predictive information in <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> regions, not in each region by itself.|$|R
