30|$|Several {{clutches}} of fertilised eggs were collected and acclimated at 20  ±  1  °C. Embryonic development of S. maindroni {{can be divided}} into 12 stages (Jiang et al. 2010), with the early stages combined into five major developmental phases: (I) the zygote stage; (II) the <b>pre-embryonic</b> <b>stage,</b> which occurs over an extremely short period and includes cleavage, blastula, and gastrula stages; (III) the organogenesis stage, when the main body parts and organs such as the wrist, eye, heart and ink sac are formed; (IV) the morphological integrity stage, which corresponds to further ongoing development of bodily structures, with the yolk sac still present; (V) the pre-hatching stage, during which the yolk sac disappears in preparation for hatching. Embryos were collected at these five stages and used for RNA extraction.|$|E
30|$|The {{consumption}} of yolk stores during a specific period of development involves governing regulatory signals and controlling ROS by-products (Shafer et al. 2011). Most antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase are expressed {{at high levels}} during yolk consumption. Understanding the sub-cellular management of metabolism before, during, and after yolk consumption is, therefore, an intriguing area of investigation. As observed in many other organisms, SmPrx 6 mRNA was detected throughout embryonic development. Expression was highest during the <b>pre-embryonic</b> <b>stage</b> (II), which was 1358.26 -fold higher than the pre-hatching stage (p <  0.05), and expression then declined gradually from stage III to stage V. The early embryonic period {{can be considered a}} time of substantial proliferative stress because early-stage embryogenesis involves massive cellular proliferation over a very short time. Correspondingly, SmPrx 6 has been implicated in complex cellular processes including cell proliferation (Wood et al. 2003 a), differentiation (Rabilloud et al. 1995) and apoptosis (Zhou et al. 2000; Bernier-Villamor et al. 2004), with the highest expression in early-stage embryos. Our present results indicate that SmPrx 6 {{plays a major role in}} embryonic development in S. maindroni, especially during the early stages of tissue differentiation.|$|E
25|$|When {{testosterone}} and endorphins in ejaculated semen {{meet the}} cervical wall after sexual intercourse, females receive {{a spike in}} testosterone, endorphin, and oxytocin levels, and males after orgasm during copulation experience an increase in endorphins and a marked increase in oxytocin levels. This adds to the hospitable physiological environment in the female internal reproductive tract for conceiving, and later for nurturing the conceptus in the <b>pre-embryonic</b> <b>stages,</b> and stimulates feelings of love, desire, and paternal care in the male (this {{is the only time}} male oxytocin levels rival a female's).|$|R
40|$|Observations on the {{duration}} of pre/post embryonic stages, survival and longevity of laboratory populations ofCulex fatigans andAnopheles stephensi were made {{in order to understand}} the factors controlling outbursts of these mosquito populations in original habitats. Regardless of the nature of culture medium and food,C. fatigans took a longer period (19 days) to complete the development of <b>pre-embryonic</b> <b>stages</b> thanA. stephensi (17 days). The highest survival rate ofC. fatigans was noticed in pupal stage (96 %), while it was advanced to IV instar stage (95 %) inA. stephensi. The survivorship curves ofC. fatigans andA. stephensi exhibited negatively skewed rectangles, indicating that the mortality is confined exclusively to aged individaals...|$|R
40|$|Schistosomiasis is a {{water-borne}} parasitic illness {{caused by}} neoophoran trematodes {{of the genus}} Schistosoma. Using classical histological techniques and whole-mount preparations, the present work describes the embryonic development of Schistosoma mansoni eggs in the murine host and compares it with eggs maintained under in vitro conditions. Two <b>pre-embryonic</b> <b>stages</b> occur inside the female worm: the prezygotic stage {{is characterized by the}} release of mature oocytes from the female ovary until its fertilization. The zygotic stage encompasses the migration of the zygote through the ootype, where the eggshell is formed, to the uterus. Fully formed eggs are laid still undeveloped, without having suffered any cleavage. In the outside environment, eight embryonic stages can be defined: stage 1 refers to early cleavages and the beginning of yolk fusion. Stage 2 represents late cleavage, with the formation of a stereoblastula and the onset of outer envelope differentiation. Stage 3 is defined by the elongation of the embryonic primordium and the onset of inner envelope formation. At stage 4, the first organ primordia arise. During stages 5 to 7, tissue and organ differentiation occurs (neural mass, epidermis, terebratorium, musculature, and miracidial glands). Stage 7 is characterized by the nuclear condensation of neurons of the central neural mass. Stage 8 refers to the fully formed larva, presenting muscular contraction, cilia, and flame-cell beating. This staging system was compared to a previous classification and could underlie further studies on egg histoproteomics (morphological localizome). The differentiation of embryonic structures and their probable roles in granulomatogenesis are discussed herein...|$|R
40|$|In one Petri dish are scores, perhaps hundreds, of thrombocytes: human platelets, {{the cells}} that {{circulate}} in our bloodstream {{and help us}} stop bleeding when we 2 ̆ 7 re cut. Normally, platelets are produced when they bud off from megakaryocytes, their parent cells, in our bone marrow. The newly formed platelets circulate around our bodies for about a week, and then-if they haven 2 ̆ 7 t been used in clotting-they are destroyed in the spleen and liver, {{to be replaced by}} freshly created cells. But the platelets in this Petri dish have never been inside a bone or traveled through a vein or an artery; they will never encounter a spleen or a liver; they will never {{be a part of a}} human body or pumped by a heart. Only a few weeks ago, these cells were undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells, floating in this same Petri dish like clouds in a tiny sea of gel. Now, having been bathed by a researcher in the right combination of materials, they have become platelets. In a neighboring Petri dish there are still clouds floating: human embryonic stem cells from the same line as those that have already been transformed into platelets. These cells are being cultivated, divided, and multiplied. They will supply the researcher with an essentially limitless number of genetically identical cells on which to test and re-test techniques for inducing thrombocytic differentiation-for making specialized human blood cells without blood, bone marrow, or a human body. In these two Petri dishes we see the twofold magic of stem cells: they have the ability to replicate themselves repeatedly, and they can transform into a diverse range of specialized cells. So-called 2 ̆ 2 embryonic 2 ̆ 2 stem cells are taken from what is in fact the <b>pre-embryonic</b> blastocyst <b>stage</b> of development (i. e., a fertilized egg that has divided into a small cluster of cells). They have the capacity to develop into every kind of cell. So-called 2 ̆ 2 adult 2 ̆ 2 stem cells are found at numerous sites around the body at every post-embryonic stage of development. They have the capacity to differentiate into a range of specialized cell types found in their organs of origin; this permits them selectively to repair and replenish specialized tissue. Both adult and embryonic stem cells have tremendous potential for exploitation in the development of therapies for disease. The fact that they can self-replicate indefinitely means that they are of great utility in testing and comparing cellular responses to different drugs and biological materials. Moreover, if scientists can master the mechanisms by which stem cells can be made to differentiate into specialized cell types, stem cells may become a source of replacement cells for people with cellular diseases like diabetes, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s...|$|R
