The method is based on converting the task of magnetometry into phase estimation, performing quantum phase estimation on a single N-V nuclear spin using either adaptive or nonadaptive feedback control, and the recently demonstrated capability to perform single-shot readout within the N-V [P. Neumann et. al., Science 329, 542 (2010) ]. We present numerical simulations to show that our method provides an estimate whose <b>precision</b> <b>scales</b> close to ~ 1 /T (T is the total estimation time), and moreover will give an unambiguous estimate of the static magnetic field experienced by the N-V. By combining this protocol with recent proposals for scanning magnetometry using an N-V, our protocol will provide {{a significant decrease in}} signal acquisition time while providing an unambiguous spatial map of the magnetic field.

40|$|During {{embryonic}} development, {{a spatial}} pattern is formed in which proportions are established precisely. As an early pattern formation step in Drosophila embryos, an anterior-posterior gradient of Bicoid (Bcd) induces hunchback (hb) expression (Driever et al. 1989; Tautz et al. 1988). In {{contrast to the}} Bcd gradient, the Hb profile includes information about {{the scale of the}} embryo. Furthermore, the resulting hb expression pattern shows a much lower embryo-to-embryo variability than the Bcd gradient (Houchmandzadeh et al. 2002). An additional graded posterior repressing activity could theoretically account for the observed scaling. However, we show that such a model cannot produce the observed precision in the Hb boundary, such that a fundamentally different mechanism must be at work. We describe and simulate a model that can account for the observed precise generation of the scaled Hb profile in a highly robust manner. The proposed mechanism includes Staufen (Stau), an RNA binding protein that appears essential to <b>precision</b> <b>scaling</b> (Houchmandzadeh et al. 2002). In the model, Stau is released from both ends of the embryo and relocalises hb RNA by increasing its mobility. This leads to an effective transport of hb away from the respective Stau sources. The balance between these opposing effects then gives rise to <b>scaling</b> and <b>precision.</b> Considering the biological importance of robust <b>precision</b> <b>scaling</b> and the simplicity of the model, the same principle may be employed more often during development.

40|$|Deep neural {{networks}} are gaining in popularity {{as they are}} used to generate state-of-the-art results for a variety of computer vision and machine learning applications. At the same time, these networks have grown in depth and complexity in order to solve harder problems. Given the limitations in power budgets dedicated to these networks, the importance of low-power, low-memory solutions has been stressed in recent years. While a large number of dedicated hardware using different precisions has recently been proposed, there exists no comprehensive study of different bit precisions and arithmetic in both inputs and network parameters. In this work, we address this issue and perform a study of different bit-precisions in {{neural networks}} (from floating-point to fixed-point, powers of two, and binary). In our evaluation, we consider and analyze the effect of <b>precision</b> <b>scaling</b> on both network accuracy and hardware metrics including memory footprint, power and energy consumption, and design area.
