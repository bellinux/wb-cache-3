500|$|Tractatus de globis {{begins with}} a letter by Hues {{dedicated}} to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I's reign. However, he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the Spaniards and Portuguese {{if they had a}} complete knowledge of astronomy and geometry, which were essential to successful navigation. In the preface of the book, Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere, and refuted opposing theories. The treatise was divided into five parts. The first part described elements common to Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, including the circles and lines inscribed on them, zones and climates, and the use of each globe's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian. The second part described planets, fixed stars and constellations; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe, and discussed the length of the circumference of the earth and of a degree of a great circle. Part 4, which Hues considered {{the most important part of}} the work, explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun's position, latitude, course and distance, amplitudes and azimuths, and time and declination. The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on rhumb lines. In the work, Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the [...] "nautical triangle" [...] used for <b>plane</b> <b>sailing.</b> Difference of latitude and departure (or longitude) are two sides of the triangle forming a right angle, the distance travelled is the hypotenuse, and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course. If any two elements are known, the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of sines, tangents and secants.|$|E
60|$|We {{began the}} march in good spirits, and by twelve we had handsomely done our four miles and a half. Of course {{we passed the}} {{different}} barrières, and the gate of Père Lachaise. The captain commenced with great vigour, and for near two hours, as he expressed himself, he had me a little on his lee quarter; not more, however, he thought, than was due to his superior rank, for {{he had once been}} my senior as a midshipman. At the Barrière du Trône we were compelled to diverge a little from the wall, in order to get across the river by the Pont d'Austerlitz. By this time I had ranged up abeam of the commodore, and I proposed that we should follow the river up as far as the wall again, in order to do our work honestly; but to this he objected that he had no wish to puzzle himself with spherical trigonometry; that <b>plane</b> <b>sailing</b> was his humour at the moment; and that he had, moreover, just discovered that one of his boots pinched his foot. Accordingly we proceeded straight from the bridge, not meeting the wall again until we were beyond the abattoir. These abattoirs are slaughter-houses, that Napoleon caused to be built near the walls, in some places within, and in others without them, according to the different localities. There are five or six of them, that of Montmartre being the most considerable. They are kept in excellent order, and the regulations respecting them appear to be generally good. The butchers sell their meats, in shops, all over the town, a general custom in Europe, and one that has more advantages than disadvantages, as it enables the inhabitant to order a meal at any moment. This independence in the mode of living distinguishes all the large towns of {{this part of the world}} from our own; for I greatly question if there be any civilized people among whom the individual is as much obliged to consult the habits and tastes of all, in gratifying his own, as in free and independent America. A part of this uncomfortable feature in our domestic economy is no doubt the result of circumstances unavoidably connected with the condition of a young country; but a great deal is to be ascribed to the practice of referring everything to the public, and not a little to those religious sects who extended their supervision to all the affairs of life, that had a chief concern in settling the country, and who have entailed so much that is inconvenient and ungraceful (I might almost say, in some instances, disgraceful) on the nation, blended with so much that forms its purest sources of pride. Men are always an inconsistent medley of good and bad.|$|E

They transcend reliance on reaction mass and {{have the ability to}} provide a small, but continuous, acceleration. Because propellant mass is not an issue, high-performance sails can enable new exotic non-Keplerianor bits (NKOs) 1 that are not feasible for conventional chemical or electric propulsion. A constant out-of <b>plane</b> <b>sail</b> force is utilized to raise the spacecraft's orbit high above the ecliptic plane in two- or three-body systems. Potential beneŽfits to the science community are large. Circular, displaced orbits can be used to provide continuous observation of the solar poles or to provide a unique vantage point for infrared astronomy. (There is much less resolution-limiting dust out of the ecliptic plane enabling smaller telescope mirror dimensions for equivalent performance.)

2500|$|A chined hull {{consists}} of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set {{at an angle}} to each other when viewed in transverse section. The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often bent lengthwise. Plywood chined boats made of 8'x4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3–6mm can easily be shaped into a compound bend. Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun [...] "pirogue" [...] {{is an example of a}} craft with hard chines. Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at <b>planing.</b> <b>Sail</b> boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.|$|R

50|$|To plane, {{especially}} to initiate planing, the power-to-weight ratio must be high, since the planing {{mode of operation}} involves moving the hull at speeds higher than its natural Hull speed. All boat designs for planing benefit from minimised weight; planing powerboats are commonly made from light alloy or use other reduced-weight construction techniques- RIBs are typical examples. <b>Planing</b> <b>sailing</b> boats need a good sail area and powerboats need a high-power engine. Steps and chine ridges may also {{be incorporated into the}} design to encourage both ease of planing and stability. Most surfboards are planing or semi-planing hulls that utilize the push of the waveform more or less in combination with gravity and specific angles of attack for the airfoil to maximise propulsive force and reduce the net downforce and thus achieve planing lift. Many forms of marine transport make use of planing, including fast ferries, racing boats, floatplanes, flying boats, and Seaplanes. Beyond planing, fast vessel designs have seen a transition to hydrofoil designs.|$|R

During a heavy enemy air attack on 14 October, Callaghan joined in downing several <b>planes.</b> <b>Sailing</b> on to stand guard off the invasion area on Leyte, Callaghans force contributed air power in the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf, which insured the Allied advance in the Philippines against the desperate Japanese efforts {{to break up the}} landings.

40|$|The {{demand to}} sail at high forward speeds in both calm water {{and in a}} seaway remains high. For various patrol, search and rescue or {{military}} operations attaining high forward speeds is essential. In head and bow quartering seas, the main factor for voluntary speed reduction is the occurrence of large vertical peak accelerations. The occurrence of large vertical peak accelerations imposes limits to the operability of <b>planing</b> monohulls <b>sailing</b> in head seas. A challenge for designers of fast monohulls is to explore different possibilities to increase the operability of <b>planing</b> monohulls <b>sailing</b> in head seas. To achieve this a reduction of the vertical accelerations is required. The operability can be considered improved if the level of accelerations can be reduced compared to a trip at an equal but constant forward speed. This implies {{that it is possible}} to sail at a higher speed without increasing the discomfort on board. A solution for increasing the operability of <b>planing</b> monohulls <b>sailing</b> in head seas has been found in proactive control. Vertical peak accelerations have a very short duration. Unacceptably large vertical peak accelerations have a low frequency of occurrence. These two aspects are the incentive for a proactive control system. What makes proactive control unique is the fact that the control is based on predicted vertical peak accelerations. The response of the ship for the next few seconds needs to be simulated real-time while sailing. These predictions should be carried much faster than real-time, since there is little to effectuate control because of the high relative velocity between ship and incoming waves. In this dissertation proactive control of the forward speed, also termed automated proactive thrust control, has been presented. The purpose of this study is to show the level of reduction of the vertical accelerations possible with automated proactive thrust control.
