5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, <b>pemetrexed,</b> etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
25|$|Antifolates such as trimethoprim, methotrexate, <b>pemetrexed</b> and raltitrexed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pemetrexed</b> {{has been}} shown to improve {{survival}} in non-squamous cell NSCLC, and is the first drug to reveal differential survival benefit in large cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and <b>pemetrexed.</b> Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. <b>Pemetrexed</b> is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{centers around}} {{reducing}} exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, {{may be used}} to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and <b>pemetrexed.</b> The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In lung cancer, erlotinib {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} in patients with or without EGFR mutations, but appears to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Overall survival, progression-free survival and one-year survival are similar to standard second-line therapy (docetaxel or <b>pemetrexed).</b> Overall response rate is about 50% better than standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients who are non-smokers, and light former smokers, with adenocarcinoma or subtypes like BAC are more likely to have EGFR mutations, but mutations can occur in all types of patients. A test for the EGFR mutation in cancer patients has been developed by Genzyme.|$|E
25|$|In {{numerous}} {{clinical trials}} conducted in NSCLC, several different platinum-based chemotherapy regimens {{have been shown}} to be more-or-less equally effective. LCLC's, as a subtype of NSCLC, have traditionally been included in many of these clinical trials, and have been treated like other NSCLC's. More recent trials, however, have shown that some newer agents may have particular effectiveness in prolonging survival of LCLC patients. <b>Pemetrexed,</b> in particular, has shown significant reduction in the hazard ratio for death when used in patients with LCLC. Taxane-based (paclitaxel, docetaxel) chemotherapy was shown to induce a complete and sustained response in a liver metastasis in a case of LCC-RP. A later-appearing metastasis within mediastinal lymph nodes in the same case also showed a durable response to a taxane alone.|$|E
5000|$|Chemotherapy is {{the only}} {{treatment}} for mesothelioma that has been proven to improve survival in randomised and controlled trials. The landmark study published in 2003 by Vogelzang and colleagues compared cisplatin chemotherapy alone {{with a combination of}} cisplatin and <b>pemetrexed</b> (brand name Alimta) chemotherapy in patients who had not received chemotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma previously and were not candidates for more aggressive [...] "curative" [...] surgery. This trial was the first to report a survival advantage from chemotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma, showing a statistically significant improvement in median survival from 10 months in the patients treated with cisplatin alone to 13.3 months in the group of patients treated with cisplatin in the combination with <b>pemetrexed</b> and who also received supplementation with folate and vitamin B12. Vitamin supplementation was given to most patients in the trial and <b>pemetrexed</b> related side effects were significantly less in patients receiving <b>pemetrexed</b> when they also received daily oral folate 500mcg and intramuscular vitamin B12 1000mcg every 9 weeks compared with patients receiving <b>pemetrexed</b> without vitamin supplementation. The objective response rate increased from 20% in the cisplatin group to 46% in the combination <b>pemetrexed</b> group. Some side effects such as nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, and diarrhoea were more common in the combination <b>pemetrexed</b> group but only affected a minority of patients and overall the combination of <b>pemetrexed</b> and cisplatin was well tolerated when patients received vitamin supplementation; both quality of life and lung function tests improved in the combination <b>pemetrexed</b> group. In February 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved <b>pemetrexed</b> for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, there are still unanswered questions about the optimal use of chemotherapy, including when to start treatment, and the optimal number of cycles to give. Cisplatin and <b>pemetrexed</b> together give patients a median survival of 12.1 months.|$|E
50|$|Itraconazole {{has been}} {{investigated}} as an anti-cancer agent. A small randomized clinical trial found that patient survival was increased when itraconazole was added to <b>pemetrexed.</b> Median survival for the patients in the study who received both itraconazole and <b>pemetrexed</b> was 32 months, while median survival for patients who only received <b>pemetrexed</b> was 8 months.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Vogelzang {{directed}} the largest Phase II trial for mesothelioma using <b>pemetrexed</b> (brand name Alimta, by Eli Lilly). <b>Pemetrexed</b> is an antifolate, {{a class of}} drugs that targets the folic acid metabolic pathway. The results of the trial showed tumors shrank in 41 percent of patients on <b>pemetrexed</b> in combination with a more commonly used chemotherapy agent called cisplatin. Only 17 percent of patients receiving cisplatin alone experienced tumor shrinkage. Additionally, those on the <b>pemetrexed</b> combination lived nearly three months longer than those on cisplatin alone.|$|E
50|$|The PARAMOUNT trial {{investigated}} whether {{treatment with}} a maintenance dose of <b>pemetrexed</b> would inhibit {{the growth of}} non-small-cell lung carcinoma and improve survival rates after first-line therapy with <b>pemetrexed</b> plus cisplatin.|$|E
50|$|PARAMOUNT {{found that}} {{maintenance}} therapy with <b>pemetrexed</b> {{for patients with}} advanced non-squamous NSCLC was an effective and well-tolerated treatment option in those patients who had not had progress after initial therapy with <b>pemetrexed</b> plus cisplatin.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{prior to}} PARAMOUNT had shown <b>pemetrexed,</b> an antifolate, {{had been an}} {{effective}} therapy for patients with NSCLC when used either as an initial chemotherapy with cisplatin or as a maintenance drug when {{not part of the}} initial therapy. The PARAMOUNT study was designed to measure the extent of the efficacy when a patient received <b>pemetrexed</b> maintenance therapy after cisplatin/pemetrexed initial therapy. The study would measure progression-free survival of patients and survival irrespective of whether the cancer had progressed. An additional study goal would be to check the extent to which measurement of thymidylate synthase - the naturally produced enzyme on which <b>pemetrexed</b> acts - could predict the efficacy of <b>pemetrexed</b> in these cases.|$|E

50|$|They {{are holding}} 2 phase 2 trials. The Yosemite trial is testing demcizumab with Abraxane and {{gemcitabine}} verses only using Abraxane and gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer. The second phase 2 trial is Denali, which is testing demcizumab with <b>pemetrexed</b> and carboplatin verses only <b>pemetrexed</b> and carboplatin alone for {{non-small cell lung cancer}} patients. The patients {{were similar to}} subjects in phase 1 trials of demcizumab.|$|E
50|$|Combination {{trials have}} {{evaluated}} velibarib {{in combination with}} doxorubicin, temozolomide, topotecan, carboplatin, paclitaxel, <b>pemetrexed,</b> cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, and others.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{should take}} folic acid and vitamin B12 {{supplement}} even if levels are normal {{when they are}} on <b>pemetrexed</b> therapy. (In clinical trials for mesothelioma, folic acid and B12 supplementation reduced the frequency of adverse events.) It is also recommended for patients {{to be on a}} steroid (e.g., dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily) on the day prior, day of, and day after <b>Pemetrexed</b> infusion to avoid skin rashes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pemetrexed</b> is {{chemically}} {{similar to}} folic acid {{and is in}} the class of chemotherapy drugs called folate antimetabolites. It works by inhibiting three enzymes used in purine and pyrimidine synthesis - thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). By inhibiting the formation of precursor purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, <b>pemetrexed</b> prevents the formation of DNA and RNA, which are required for the growth and survival of both normal cells and cancer cells.|$|E
50|$|Many are {{primarily}} DHFR inhibitors, but raltitrexed is an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, and <b>pemetrexed</b> inhibits both {{and a third}} enzyme.|$|E
50|$|PARAMOUNT {{found that}} {{maintenance}} therapy with <b>pemetrexed</b> {{for patients with}} advanced non-squamous NSCLC was an effective and well tolerated treatment option in those patients who had not had progress after initial therapy with <b>pemetrexed</b> plus cisplatin. The average life of all participants receiving the experimental treatment increased more than 13 months {{as compared to the}} control group. The results of this trial should not be generalized beyond the scope of the research and the trial design must be considered to interpret these results.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pemetrexed</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} for treating non-squamous lung carcinomas, and is the first drug that has been specifically shown to improve survival in large cell carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pemetrexed</b> {{has been}} shown to improve {{survival}} in non-squamous cell NSCLC, and is the first drug to reveal differential survival benefit in large cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} structure of <b>pemetrexed</b> {{was developed by}} Edward C. Taylor at Princeton University and clinically developed by Indianapolis-based drug maker, Eli Lilly and Company in 2004.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pemetrexed</b> (brand name Alimta) is a {{chemotherapy}} drug manufactured {{and marketed}} by Eli Lilly and Company. Its indications are {{the treatment of}} pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|Cisplatin in {{combination}} with raltitrexed has shown an improvement in survival similar to that reported for <b>pemetrexed</b> {{in combination}} with cisplatin, but raltitrexed is no longer commercially available for this indication. For patients unable to tolerate <b>pemetrexed,</b> cisplatin {{in combination with}} gemcitabine or vinorelbine is an alternative, or vinorelbine on its own, although a survival benefit has not been shown for these drugs. For patients in whom cisplatin cannot be used, carboplatin can be substituted but non-randomised data have shown lower response rates and high rates of haematological toxicity for carboplatin-based combinations, albeit with similar survival figures to patients receiving cisplatin.|$|E
50|$|The other phase 2 {{trial is}} the Denali trial for non-small cell lung cancer. It is a randomized, 3 arm study in {{subjects}} with first-line metastatic Stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The tumors must not have an epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase. The primary objective {{of this study is}} progression-free survival. Secondary objectives are response rate, duration of response, overall survival, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics. Each randomized subject will receive carboplatin and <b>pemetrexed</b> for four cycles, followed by <b>pemetrexed</b> maintenance. The Denali trial is still currently underway and will be completed at the end of 2016.|$|E
50|$|Thymidylate synthase inhibitors are {{chemical}} agents which inhibit the enzyme thymidylate synthase and have potential as an anticancer chemotherapy. Five agents were {{in clinical trials}} in 2002: raltitrexed, <b>pemetrexed,</b> nolatrexed, ZD9331, and GS7904L.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pemetrexed,</b> {{although}} not {{classified as a}} targeted agent, {{has been shown to}} have improve survival in non-squamous cell NSCLC, and is the first drug to reveal differential survival benefit in large cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|In February 2004, the Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} <b>pemetrexed</b> {{for treatment}} of malignant pleural mesothelioma, a type of tumor of {{the lining of the}} lung, in combination with cisplatin for patients whose disease is either unresectable or who are not otherwise candidates for curative surgery. In September 2008, the FDA granted approval as a first-line treatment, in combination with cisplatin, against locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with non-squamous histology. A Phase III study showed benefits of maintenance use of <b>pemetrexed</b> for non-squamous NSCLC. Activity has been shown in malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. Trials are currently testing it against esophageal and other cancers.|$|E
50|$|For his {{contributions}} to heterocyclic chemistry, in particular {{the discovery of the}} new-generation antifolate <b>pemetrexed,</b> approved for the treatment of mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer and under clinical investigation for treatment of a variety of other solid tumors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pemetrexed</b> is also {{recommended}} {{in combination with}} carboplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, the relative efficacy or toxicity of pemetrexed-cisplatin versus pemetrexed-carboplatin has not been established beyond what is generally thought about cisplatin or carboplatin doublet drug therapy.|$|E
