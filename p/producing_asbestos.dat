40|$|Background and history: Italy was {{the main}} {{asbestos}} producer {{and one of the}} greatest consumers in 20 th century Europe until the asbestos ban was introduced in 1992. Asbestos exposure affected the population {{in a wide range of}} working environments, namely mining and marketing of asbestos, asbestos cement production, shipyards and textile industries. This also determined a widespread environmental asbestos exposure affecting the surrounding communities. Methods: To investigate the drivers and difficulties of the process leading to the asbestos ban and its subsequent implementation, we focused on stakeholder involvement, environmental health policies, capacity building and communication. Results: In the past three decades, stakeholder involvement has been instrumental in advancing the industrial asbestos replacement process, prevention and remediation interventions. Furthermore, involvement also contributed to the integration of environmental and health policies at national, regional and local levels, including capacity building and communication. In a global public health perspective, international scientific cooperation has been established with countries using and <b>producing</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Discussion and Conclusions: Key factors and lessons learnt in Italy from both successful and ineffective asbestos policies are described to support the relevant stakeholders in countries still using asbestos contributing to the termination of its use...|$|E

40|$|Mesothelioma, a {{malignant}} {{cancer of the}} pleura, is almost exclusively associated with asbestos exposure. 1 What {{will it take to}} eradicate this highly preventable cancer? Despite the scientific consensus that exposure to asbestos fibres causes deadly diseases, we continue to use as-bestos in products designed ostensibly to improve quality of life. For example, asbestos is still used in automobile brake-linings, and in the chloralkali industry that produces chlorine for disinfecting water worldwide. 2 Toxic asbestos remains the main material for some plastics and in domestic building products – especially in corrugated roof materials for housing in developing countries. Regional disparities persist in trans-lating scientific knowledge of asbestos risks to policy for preventing cancers and other diseases. Most cases of me-sothelioma are now found in countries <b>producing</b> <b>asbestos</b> and in developing countries using the products, where scientific knowledge of asbestos toxicity seems to have been lost in translation. 3 It is in these countries, where affected populations are less likely to have ac-cess to prompt diagnosis, health care or litigation, that we will observe the next wave of mesothelioma cases. 3 A perspective on three scientific transla-tional gaps is presented here: (i) mak-ing policy decisions within the context of scientific uncertainty, (ii) the role of alternative assessments in selecting safer commercial materials, and (iii) the translation of scientific evidence into disease prevention. The International Labour Organi-zation’s Asbestos Convention, designed to protect workers from the well-known hazards of asbestos exposure, entered into force on 16 June 1989.

The fiber concentration was higher in areas in which outcrop crocidolite asbestos is present in the soil than in areas lacking this feature.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{progressive}} interstitial fibrosis in a retired shipyard worker who was exposed to asbestos during the postwar era of the late 1940 s and 1950 s, when asbestos exposures in the workplace were not regulated. Forty years later, at 63 years of age, the patient presented with restrictive lung disease. The patient was diagnosed with asbestos-related pleural disease and parenchymal asbestosis. He remained stable for the next 7 years, but {{then he began to}} manifest rapid clinical progression, which raised the possibility of an unusual variant of asbestosis, a concomitant interstitial process, or an unrelated disease. Lung biopsy was not undertaken because of the patient's low pulmonary reserve and limited treatment options. An empiric trial of oral steroids was initiated, but his pulmonary status continued to deteriorate and he died of pulmonary failure at 72 years of age. Many diseases result in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Ideally, open lung biopsy should be performed, but this procedure inevitably causes complications in many patients with end-stage restrictive lung disease. Furthermore, while the presence of asbestos bodies in tissue sections is a sensitive and specific marker of asbestos exposure, neither this finding nor any other charge is a marker indicative of asbestosis or the severity of asbestosis. With the enactment of the Asbestos Standard in the United States, asbestos exposures have been decreasing in this country. However, industries that <b>produce</b> <b>asbestos</b> products and wastes continue to expand in developing countries.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{estimate}} {{exposures to}} asbestos fibres of specific sizes among asbestos textile manufacturing workers exposed to chrysotile {{using data from}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and to evaluate {{the extent to which}} the risk of lung cancer varies with fibre length and diameter. Methods 3803 workers employed for at least 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 day between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1973 in any of three plants in North Carolina, USA that <b>produced</b> <b>asbestos</b> textile products and followed for vital status through 31 December 2003 were included. Historical exposures to asbestos fibres were estimated from work histories and 3578 industrial hygiene measurements taken in 193522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 1986. Exposure 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cresponse relationships for lung cancer were examined within the cohort using Poisson regression. ResultsIndicators of fibre length and diameter obtained by TEM were positively and significantly associated with increasing risk of lung cancer. Exposures to longer and thinner fibres tended to be most strongly associated with lung cancer, and models for these fibres fit the data best. Simultaneously modelling indicators of cumulative mean fibre length and diameter yielded a positive coefficient for fibre length and a negative coefficient for fibre diameter. ConclusionsThe results support the hypothesis that the risk of lung cancer among workers exposed to chrysotile asbestos increases with exposure to longer fibres. More research is needed to improve the characterisation of exposures by fibre size and number and to analyse the associated risks in a variety of industries and populations.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{assess and}} {{quantify}} {{the occurrence of}} pleural malignant mesotheliomas in people who neither experienced occupational exposure to asbestos nor were married to (or known to live with) workers exposed to asbestos in the workplace. The {{study was conducted in}} the area of the local health authority of Casale Monferrato, in north western Italy, where a large factory that <b>produced</b> <b>asbestos</b> cement was active up to 1985. No other major activities related to asbestos have ever been present in the area. METHODS [...] A retrospective survey covering the period 1980 to 1991 identified 126 incident pleural malignant mesotheliomas histologically diagnosed among residents in the local health authority (population at the 1981 census 98, 000). Submission of 83 of 95 cases diagnosed during 1980 - 9 for revision by a panel of five expert pathologists led to the exclusion of 21. The 31 cases diagnosed in 1990 - 1 were not submitted for revision. For 64 of the 105 retained cases, information derived from different sources (rosters of the employees in the asbestos cement factory dated back to 1907, list of their spouses, clinical records) did not suggest occupational or paraoccupational exposure to asbestos. RESULTS [...] Incidence excludes cases for which there was some suggestion of occupational or paraoccupational exposure to asbestos. Incidence of histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma among residents in the local health authority (annual x 100, 000; age adjusted) was 4. 2 in men and 2. 3 in women (based on 26 and 18 cases respectively). In both sexes, rates in 1985 - 9 were higher than in the previous quinquennium. Corresponding estimates for 1990 - 1 (based on unrevised diagnoses) suggest similar rates in men and women. CONCLUSION [...] Rate ratios which are four to six times those measured by conventional Italian cancer registries can hardly be totally explained by bias produced by lack of recognition of occupational or paraoccupational exposure. The problem of proving this type of negative data is common to other circumstances of alleged cancer clusters of environmental (non occupational) origin...|$|R
