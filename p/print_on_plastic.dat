50|$|The United States' {{entry into}} World War II {{resulted}} in {{a general lack of}} materials for commercial usage, causing the company to begin <b>printing</b> <b>on</b> <b>plastics</b> as an alternative. Most attempts by other organizations to make <b>prints</b> stick permanently <b>on</b> <b>plastics</b> were unsuccessful; however, Velonis was able to find a solution. By dissolving a resin made from ground-up lipsticks, he was able to facilitate the grinding of pigments more effectively, allowing for the paint to stick due to the migrating plasticizer within it.|$|R

50|$|The corona {{treatment}} {{was invented by}} the Danish engineer Verner Eisby in 1951. Verner had been asked {{by one of his}} customers if he could find a solution which would make it possible to <b>print</b> <b>on</b> <b>plastic.</b> Verner found that there were already a couple of ways to accomplish this. One was a gas flame method and the other was a spark generating method, both of which were crude and uncontrollable and did not produce a homogeneous product. Verner came up with the theory that a high frequency corona discharge would provide both a more efficient and controllable method to treat the surface. Exhaustive experiments proved him to be correct. Verner's company, Vetaphone, obtained patent rights for the new {{corona treatment}} system.|$|E

50|$|Material is a {{relative}} term in architectural design and so {{may be used to}} designate materials which are considered to be virtual, (such as photographs, images or text) or other materials which are natural. Some materials may be considered as combinations of the two. Certain veneers which are composed of images <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> are a good example of this. Observationally therefore, virtual materials can be said not to exist without a natural physical substrate. Therefore, what separates a virtual material from a natural one is some aspect of the mind and perception as well as a process of representation to produce them.|$|R

In addition to demonstrating high-throughput fabrication, we fulfill another requirement for organic electronics and achieve low-voltage operation in ambient air by using a polyelectrolyte insulator, poly(4 -styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSH). PSSH is a proton conductor that forms electrical double layers at the interfaces with the gate electrode and the semiconductor channel upon application of a small gate voltage (≤ | 1 V|). Printed PSSH exhibits a high capacitance of 10 μF cm- 2, leading to a printed poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) hole mobility above 0. 1 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 in a bottom-gate, top-contact configuration...|$|R
40|$|ADEPT Project: The CUNY Energy Institute is {{developing}} less expensive, more efficient, smaller, and longer-lasting power converters for energy-efficient LED lights. LEDs produce light {{more efficiently than}} incandescent lights and last significantly longer than compact fluorescent bulbs, but they require more sophisticated power converter technology, which increases their cost. LEDs need more sophisticated converters because they require {{a different type of}} power (low voltage direct current, or DC) than what's generally supplied by power outlets. The CUNY Energy Institute {{is developing}} sophisticated power converters for LEDs that contain capacitors made from new, nanoscale materials.

Sigmar Polke has also engaged with the hares on paper or textiles, or as part of his installations. Dieter Roth's Köttelkarnikel (Turd bunny) is a copy of Dürer's hare made from rabbit droppings, and Klaus Staeck enclosed one in a little wooden box, with a hole cut out of it, so that it could look out and breathe.|$|R

50|$|CTA's Automated Fare Collection (AFC) {{system was}} {{installed}} in 1997 by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., the largest provider of AFC systems in the USA. The AFC system replaced the CTA’s tokens with magnetic-stripe stored-value cards <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> or paper based on Cubic's earlier MetroCard implementation in New York City. All fare collection and payment equipment {{was designed to be}} retrofitted at a later date with smart card readers, a technology that was on the horizon. A small pilot program (“Chicago Gold”) for reduced-fare disabled riders in 1999 led to a contract with Cubic to install smart card readers universally in 2000. In August 2000, a more extensive “Chicago Card” pilot program distributed stored-value smart cards to volunteer participants. The pilot program was expanded system-wide in November 2002. The Chicago Card Plus debuted in January 2004. “Go Lane” card readers were installed in the buses, starting in 2005, allowing Chicago Card users to bypass the line of passengers using the farebox; however, only one payment could be accepted at a time, eliminating this possible efficiency. The Go Lane card readers were removed starting in May 2010 and Chicago Card card readers were moved back to the main fare box.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of metal}} oxide interlayers in polymer solar cells has great {{potential}} because metal oxides are abundant, thermally stable, {{and can be}} used in fl exible devices. Here, a layer-by-layer (LbL) protocol is reported as a facile, room-temperature, solution-processed method to prepare electron transport layers from commercial ZnO nanoparticles and polyacrylic acid (PAA) with a controlled and tunable porous structure, which provides large interfacial contacts with the active layer. Applying the LbL approach to bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells with an optimized ZnO layer thickness of H 25 nm yields solar cell power-conversion effi ciencies (PCEs) of ≈ 6 %, exceeding the effi ciency of amorphous ZnO interlayers formed by conventional sputtering methods. Interestingly, annealing the ZnO/PAA interlayers in nitrogen and air environments in the range of 60 - 300 ° C reduces the device PCEs by almost 20 % to 50 %, indicating the importance of conformational changes inherent to the PAA polymer in the LbL-deposited fi lms to solar cell performance. This protocol suggests a new fabrication method for solution-processed polymer solar cell devices that does not require postprocessing thermal annealing treatments and that is applicable to fl exible devices <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> substrates...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} and compares {{two different types}} of screen printed flexible and conformable pressure sensors arrays. In both variants, the flexible pressure sensors are in the form of segmental arrays of parallel plate structure - sandwiching the piezoelectric polymer Polyvinylidene Fluoride Trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) between two printed metal layers of silver (Ag) in one case and the piezoresistive (Multiwall Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) mixed with Poly(dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) layer in the other. Each sensor module consists of 4 × 4 sensors array with 1 × 1 mm 2 sensitive area of each sensor. The screen printed piezoelectric sensors array exploits the change in polarization level of P(VDF-TrFE) to detect dynamic tactile parameter such as contact force. Similarly, the piezoresistive sensors array exploits the change in resistance of the bulk printed layer of MWCNT/PDMS composite. The two variants are compared on the basis of fabrication by <b>printing</b> <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> substrate, ease of processing and handling of the materials, compatibility of the dissimilar materials in multilayers structure, adhesion and finally according to the response to the normal compressive forces.

40|$|The {{development}} of plastic card printers {{has led to}} the widespread use of identity documents <b>printed</b> <b>on</b> <b>plastic</b> cards, such as ID cards, driving licenses and access key cards. This paper presents a new security feature based on a technique for embedding a personalized microstructure into a photograph. This microstructure {{takes the form of a}} bitmap pattern embedded into the original photograph as a succession of balanced chromatic shifts. The amplitude of these shifts may be modulated so as to make the pattern fully apparent, just noticeable, or completely invisible under normal viewing conditions. Since the chromatic shifts cancel each other out in any macroscopic portion of the image, the global appearance of the protected image remains intact. The embedded microstructure may be adapted to each instance of the protected identity document. For example, it can repeat textual information already present elsewhere on the document, or it can include a code derived from data specific to the document holder. Furthermore, this information may be made fully readable without the help of a specialized apparatus. Such identity documents exhibit an intrinsic resistance against imitation, tampering and substitution...|$|R
