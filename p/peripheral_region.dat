5|$|A recent threat, first {{reported}} in 1978, is forest dieback. In some areas, {{especially in the}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>region,</b> this has been severe with nearly a 50% in vegetation. Water deficiency has been attributed as {{the main cause of}} dieback as droughts are becoming more frequent. Regrowth of forest is hindered by frost which is increasingly severe. The forest dieback has affected 22 species of plants with Calophyllum walkeri being the most affected. A study has suggested that low calcium causes soil acidification and increased toxicity caused by metallic elements such as aluminium may be causing the dieback. Leaching of nutrients and the resulting imbalance in soil micronutrients may also be contributing to the dieback.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{have lower}} {{foraging}} efficiency compared to adults {{and in most}} feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend {{to stay close to}} one another and forage for food together at the <b>peripheral</b> <b>region</b> of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.|$|E

40|$|Past {{contributions}} {{stress that}} international ties {{in the form}} of foreign workers and international collaboration enable firms to be present in international markets by providing access to diverse knowledge, and professional and social networks. These mechanisms have, however, not undergone the same empirical scrutiny for firms in intermediate and <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions.</b> If firms in more <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> are able to tap into the global economy using international channels, this has important implications, for example, for the localization decision of firms. The empirical analysis builds on linked employer–employee data (LEED) merged with community innovation survey (CIS) data. The results demonstrate that there is a positive association between international ties and international market presence for firms in core, intermediate and <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions,</b> demonstrating that <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> are not detached from global processes.

40|$|Vestibular and {{cochlear}} regeneration following ototoxic insult from aminoglycoside antibiotics {{has been}} well documented, particularly in birds. In the present study, intraotic application of a 2 mg streptomycin paste was used to achieve complete vestibular hair cell destruction in pigeons (Columba livia) while preserving regenerative ability. Scanning electron microscopy was used to quantify hair cell density longitudinally during regeneration in three different utricular macula locations, including the striola, central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions.</b> The utricular epithelium was void of stereocilia (indicating hair cell loss) at 4 days after intraotic treatment with streptomycin. At 2 weeks the stereocilia began to appear randomly and mostly in an immature form. However, when present most kinocilia were polarized toward the developing striola. Initially, regeneration occurred more rapidly in the central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> of the utricle {{as compared to the}} striola. As regeneration proceeded from 2 to 12 weeks, hair cell density in the striola region equaled the density noted in the central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions.</b> At 24 weeks, hair cell density of the central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> was equal to normal values, however the striola region had a slightly greater hair cell density than that observed for normal animals...|$|R

2500|$|The growth {{capacity}} of the axons lies in the microtubules which are located just beyond the actin filaments. Microtubules can rapidly polymerize into and thus “probe” the actin-rich <b>peripheral</b> <b>region</b> of the growth cone. [...] When this happens, the polymerizing ends of microtubules {{come into contact with}} F-actin adhesion sites, where microtubule tip-associated proteins act as [...] "ligands". Laminins of the basal membrane interact with the integrins of the growth cone to promote the forward movement of the growth cone. Additionally, axon outgrowth is also supported by the stabilization of the proximal ends of microtubules, which provide the structural support for the axon.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} linkage between tax {{competition}} and foreign investment in Europe. Although the majority of economists consider a link between these two phenomena to be unambiguous, the literature ignores its long-term implications. To gauge the economic rationale of this issue, the paper considers experience in western and eastern Europe, which are understood as "central" versus "peripheral" regions, respectively, and distinguishes between short- and longterm perspectives. In this paper, {{it is argued that}} policymakers, who want to attract foreign investment but have incomplete information over optimal taxation policy, may be inspired to initiate cuts in tax rates. Because other countries may be tempted to respond similarly, a dynamic tax- policy response would cause methodical tax rivalry among <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions,</b> as well as between <b>peripheral</b> and central <b>regions.</b> The current reality in Europe shows that tax competition benefits <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> in the short-term but that a continuing tax competition would make short-term tax advantages to <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> either disappear or exert negligible weight on international investment decisions over the long-term...|$|R
40|$|Draft version- Please do not quote!

The clustering results indicate that Swiss regions are distinct with regard to their potential for venture creation. From the results it is possible to derive different strategies for the particular clusters. In particular, for most of the clusters containing agglomeration and urban regions as well as of some semi-peripheral regions {{it might be a good}} strategy to strengthen the entrepreneurship education in order to compensate for existing weaknesses like the lack of role models. However, several clusters which contain <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> should better rely on strengths available than to compensate existing weaknesses.

2500|$|The growth cones are {{continually}} being built up through {{construction of the}} actin microfilaments and extension of the plasma membrane via vesicle fusion. The actin filaments depolymerize and disassemble on the proximal end to allow free monomers to migrate to the leading edge (distal end) of the actin filament where it can polymerize and thus reattach. Actin filaments are also constantly being transported away from the leading edge by a myosin-motor driven process known as retrograde F-actin flow. [...] The actin filaments are polymerized in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>region</b> and then transported backward to the transitional region, where the filaments are depolymerized; thus freeing the monomers to repeat the cycle. [...] This is different from actin treadmilling since the entire protein moves. [...] If the protein were to simply treadmill, the monomers would depolymerize from one end and polymerize onto the other while the protein itself does not move.|$|E

40|$|Most {{socio-economic}} activities {{take place}} in a few European centre regions, resulting in the fact that those areas located at the European edge often lag behind in terms of economic growth, innovation capacity and population dynamics. Whereas for a long time, EU regional policy has mainly functioned as an equalising system balancing out this uneven development, the adoption of the Lisbon Agenda has initiated a new focus within EU regional policy. An increased concern for international competitiveness has led to major policy changes, focussing on the creation and realisation of potentials.

However, this study stresses more the sociological aspects of peripheries, studying not only the causes, but also the social effects of life in <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions.</b> The authors use the term ‘inner peripheries’ because most of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>regions</b> detected in their analyses are located in the inner parts of the country, mainly along the borders of the administrative regions (kraje). Their approach combines the concept of the life world (espace vécu) as defined by A. Frémont and A.

Myrdal´s theory of cumulative circular causation when trying to explain the origin and growth of peripheries. In the Czech Republic inner peripheries are usually the peripheral zones of metropolitan areas and regional centre areas.
