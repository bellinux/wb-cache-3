40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} the concept, design, analytical modeling and experimental prototype {{for a new}} &quot;smart connector&quot;, which provides electrical and mechanical connection between components of a system, specifically robotic modules. The connector includes plug and receptacle components. The plug has a central pin surrounded by a plurality of lamellae. The lamellae have an end connected to the base and a free end. A Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator is positioned about the lamellae of the plug for controlling {{the movement of the}} free end of the lamellae. The receptacle has a <b>pin</b> <b>housing</b> corresponding to the central pin of the plug. Additionally, the receptacle includes a plurality of lamellae for mating with the plug lamellae. Like the plug, the receptacle includes an SMA actuator for controlling movement of the receptacle lamellae. The plug lamellae and the receptacle lamellae have corresponding shoulders at the free ends for interconnecting the plug and the receptacle. In another configuration, the plug and receptacle are positioned side by side to provide a universal connector. The connector can transmit axial force through the lamellae, shear force through the receptacle and plug housings, and torque in the case of universal configuration. The disconnection can be controlled from plug and/or receptacle side(s) ...|$|E
40|$|During the 2016 - 2017 school year, the Cal Poly NextFlex Group, in conjuncture {{with the}} Cal Poly Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Department, was {{comprised}} of professors, undergraduate students, and graduate students all working towards the manufacturing of flexible hybrid electronics (FHEs). FHEs, which are comprised of a flexible plastic substrate (thermoplastic polyurethane), screen-printed silver ink, and a thin silicon wafer, have {{a wide range of}} potential applications. At the time of this project, FHEs and other flexible electronics did not have a set of test standards to characterize their mechanical and electrical properties. The Cal Poly NextFlex Group recruited three Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering students (known as the BendatroniX Team) from the Fall 2016 Senior Project class to create a Reliability Test Fixture to test the FHEs that they were manufacturing. Over the course of three quarters, the team designed, built, and validated a reliability test fixture that characterized the electrical integrity of the FHEs as a function of mechanical strain. The fixture {{was comprised of}} four clamps that mated with an Instron tensile testing machine. One of the clamps had a unique pogo <b>pin</b> <b>housing</b> that monitored the electrical resistance across the FHEs while it was stretched. Upon the conclusion of the project, the BendatroniX Team trained Cal Poly NextFlex students on how to use the fixture so that they could continue to test and characterize the tensile properties of different FHE configurations. The following report details the design, build, and test process that the BendatroniX Team performed to create the Reliability Test Fixture for FHEs...|$|E

50|$|P. rossicus {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Nestor Ivanovich Novozhilov in 1948. The specific name {{is derived from}} the name of Russia, where the holotype was found. The holotype of P. rossicus, <b>PIN</b> 304/1 <b>housed</b> at Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, consists of cranial and some postcranial remains of a relatively small pliosaur. It was collected at the right bank of the Volga River, of Chuvashia, European part of Russia, from the Buinsk Mine oil shales, Dorsoplanites panderi ammonite zone, dating to the middle Volgian stage (also known as middle Tithonian). Novozhilov (1964) later also described some pectoral remains associated with the holotype. The holotype preserved trihedral teeth like other members of Pliosaurus, and bears 6 tooth pairs in the mandibular symphysis, similar to OUMNH J.10454. Halstead (1971) reassigned this species to Liopleurodon based on this symphyseal tooth count, but Knutsen (2012) and Benson et al. (2013) referred it back to Pliosaurus, as it exhibits the diagnostic traits of the genus such as trihedral teeth. PIN 304/1 has also been interpreted as a juvenile by both Halstead (1971) and Storrs et al. (2000) based on its relatively small size and poorly developed dorsal blade and anteroventral ramus of the scapula.|$|R

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} species listed above, only Pliosaurus irgisensis might {{represent}} another valid species of Pliosaurus. It was first described and named by Nestor Ivanovich Novozhilov in 1948, {{under the name}} Peloneustes irgisensis. The specific name {{is derived from the}} name of the Maly Irgiz River, where the holotype was found. The holotype, <b>PIN</b> 426 <b>housed</b> at Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, consists of partial cranium and postcranium of a medium-sized individual. The cranial remains of PIN 426 are currently suffering from the effects of pyrite decay, and its associated remains have been lost. It was collected at Savel-evsk Mine No. 1, of eastern Saratov Oblast, European part of Russia, from the middle Volgian stage (also known as middle Tithonian). Novozhilov (1964) reassigned the material to a new genus, Strongylokrotaphus, meaning [...] "round" [...] (strongylos) [...] "temple" [...] or [...] "head" [...] (krotaphos) in Ancient Greek. These assignments were criticized by other workers, including Tarlo (1960), Halstead (1971) and Storrs et al. (2000), because of the general and non-specific diagnosis for Strongylokrotaphus, and differences from the type species of Peloneustes. P. irgisensis might be synonymous with P. rossicus based on their similar sizes and stratigraphic co-occurrence, as the only difference between the species is ontogenetic. Knutsen (2012) considered the material to be non-diagnostic and referred P. irgisensis to Pliosauridae indet, as dentition, which is autapomorphic in Pliosaurus, was not described from PIN 426. Benson et al. (2013) also considered this species to be a nomen dubium, referring it to Thalassophonea indet, and stating that PIN 426 requires re-description.|$|R

50|$|The {{rules of}} this game are {{slightly}} more complicated than the European version. Each bowler will roll the ball twice in each frame regardless {{of the number of}} pins knocked down on each roll. When a bowler’s turn is completed, the next bowler will not receive a “Full House” to bowl at: rather, the next bowler must attempt to knock down the pins that were left by the previous bowler. For example, if the first bowler is only able to knock down seven pins, the second bowler must attempt to knock down the remaining two pins. Should the second bowler be unsuccessful in knocking down both of these pins in the allotted two rolls, the third bowler will attempt to knock down the remaining pins. This will continue until the remaining pins are knocked down or {{until the end of the}} frame. Once all pins are knocked down, the “12-pin”/”Redhead” is left standing alone (see below), or the end of the frame is reached, all nine <b>pins</b> (a Full <b>House)</b> will be reset.|$|R
