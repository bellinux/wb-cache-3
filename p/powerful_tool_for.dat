5|$|In {{a similar}} way, xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe/130Xe and 136Xe/130Xe are a <b>powerful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> {{understanding}} planetary differentiation and early outgassing. For example, {{the atmosphere of}} Mars shows a xenon abundance {{similar to that of}} Earth (0.08parts per million) but Mars shows a greater abundance of 129Xe than the Earth or the Sun. Since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess 129Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New Mexico is believed to be from the decay of mantle-derived gases from soon after Earth's formation.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a <b>powerful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> {{studying}} {{the formation of}} the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of homological algebra was closely {{intertwined with the}} emergence of category theory. By and large, homological algebra is the study of homological functors and the intricate algebraic structures that they entail. One quite useful and ubiquitous concept in mathematics is that of chain complexes, which can be studied both through their homology and cohomology. Homological algebra affords the means to extract information contained in these complexes and present it in the form of homological invariants of rings, modules, topological spaces, and other 'tangible' mathematical objects.

25|$|The {{movement}} progressed within India {{alongside the}} Indian independence movement, but the Pakistan Movement sought {{to establish a}} new nation-state that protected the religious identity and political interests of Muslims in South Asia. The first organised political movements were in Aligarh where another literary movement was led by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan that built the genesis of the Pakistan movement. An educational convention held in 1906 with joint efforts of Syed Ahmad Khan and Vikar-ul-Haq, the Muslim reformers took the movement to the political stage in the form of establishing the mainstream and then newly formed All-India Muslim League (AIML), with prominent moderate leaders seeking to protect the basic rights of Muslims in the British Raj. During the initial stages of the movement, it adopted the vision of philosopher Iqbal after addressing at the convention of the AIML's annual session. Muhammad Ali Jinnah's constitutional struggle further helped gaining public support for the movement in the four provinces. Urdu poets such as Iqbal and Faiz used literature, poetry and speech as a <b>powerful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> political awareness. Feminists such as Sheila Pant and Fatima Jinnah championed the emancipation of Pakistan's women and their participation in national politics.|$|E

500|$|In this formalism, {{a liquid}} crystal {{material}} {{is treated as}} a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) splay of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) bend of the material, where the distortion {{is parallel to the}} director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly <b>powerful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> modeling liquid crystal devices [...] and lipid bilayers.|$|E
