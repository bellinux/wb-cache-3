He would however <b>push</b> <b>it</b> back and on March 11, 2013 say the album would be released in June or July 2013. On April 29, he would announce a release date of July 2, 2013. However he would <b>push</b> <b>it</b> back again, till August, and on July 15 in a press release Juicy J announced a final release date for the album of August 27, 2013 in the United States. On July 21, 2013 the track listing and album cover was revealed. Its first release was on August 23, 2013 in other countries such as Australia.|$|E
5|$|After demonstrating his goal-scoring {{form for}} Panathinaikos, in March 2010, Cissé was {{recalled}} to the French squad for a friendly against Spain in Paris.

Third was 2010 winner Tony McCoy on Don't <b>Push</b> <b>It,</b> twelve lengths behind the second. 15/2 favourite The Midnight Club made a mistake at the third fence and finished sixth.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. He {{shows that the}} shape of the egg favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to <b>push</b> <b>it</b> forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost legs to the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and <b>push</b> <b>it</b> towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack of}} Alexios's {{division}} initially caught Bryennios's men off guard, but, being veteran troops, they soon recovered {{and once again}} began to <b>push</b> <b>it</b> back. Retreating, Alexios's troops, and especially the Turks, employed skirmishing tactics, attacking the enemy line and then withdrawing swiftly, thus keeping their opponents at bay and weakening the coherence of their line. Some among Alexios's men chose to attack Bryennios, and the rebel general had to defend against several attacks himself.|$|E
5|$|For {{work on the}} scenario, Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of <b>Push!!,</b> <b>it</b> was reported {{that the story of}} Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry, {{had managed}} to block the North Korean's advance to Yongsan while the 19th Infantry was able to <b>push</b> <b>it</b> back and inflict {{substantial}} casualties. However, by the evening of August 6, KPA held firmly on to their bridgehead. Attempted crossings that night were repulsed to the south by South Korean forces, but {{an unknown number of}} reinforcements were moved across the river the night of August 6–7. On August 7–8, the North Koreans tried to move two more battalions across the river to the north, but were repulsed by 21st Infantry, which was still in place. The KPA battalions were shifted south to cross at the bridgehead, instead. By August 8, an estimated regiment of North Korean troops were across the Naktong.|$|E

5|$|The event {{opened with}} a Shop of Horrors match between Abyss and Black Reign, which lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds. In a Shop of Horrors match, all weapons are legal to use, a wrestler can not be counted out, and {{it can only be}} won by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell {{interfered}} on Reign's behalf during the encounter. Abyss won the contest by pinfall after slamming Reign into the mat with his maneuver, the Black Hole Slam. After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a key that hung around Reign's neck and used it to open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and <b>push</b> <b>it</b> off the stage.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then <b>push</b> <b>it</b> to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|From the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea (also known as the Republic of Korea) by the North, the North Korean People's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Armed Forces and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and South Korean forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and <b>push</b> <b>it</b> south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{is shocked}} {{when the driver}} of the car gets out and is {{revealed}} as Doctor Browning, who has escaped from prison. He holds Mercedes hostage and forces her into the car, driving off and leaving Clare's corpse in the road. He takes her to the empty McQueen house and attempts to kill her, but Cindy and Lindsey arrive in time and knock him unconscious. Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning over the head with a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into bin liners, stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic is going to have new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and <b>push</b> <b>it</b> off a cliff, making it appear that Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. When they all confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of bad people, and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|E

5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to <b>push</b> <b>it</b> down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E
