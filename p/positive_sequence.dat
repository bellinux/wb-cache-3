Such relays may be used to trip circuit breakers or take other steps to protect electrical systems.|$|E
30|$|Detailed control {{strategies}} for IBDERs and DFIMs are examined in literature, {{and it is}} concluded that besides control strategies that can be integrated in the traditional AC machines, IBDERs and DFIMs can employ the following five additional and important control strategies [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]: ① control of three-phase real and reactive power providing symmetrical <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltages; ② control of three-phase real power and <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage magnitude providing symmetrical (<b>positive</b> <b>sequence)</b> voltages; ③ control of three-phase real and reactive power with additional control of negative sequence current; ④ control of three-phase real power and <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage magnitude with additional control of negative sequence current; and ⑤ control of three phase real power and <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> current magnitude. These advanced control strategies sense <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage and current components at the PCCs of IBDERs and DFIMs, and then provide special VSC switching processes [91]. The control of zero sequence currents {{is the same as}} for AC machines [12], [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Finally, the distributed slack bus is proposed in [23, 103, 104] for microgrids in autonomous operation.|$|E
40|$|IEEE Xplore link: [URL] fully rated {{converter}} of type 4 {{wind turbines}} {{is capable of}} providing dynamic voltage control during grid faults by injecting controlled reactive currents. This paper describes three different dynamic voltage control options during unbalanced grid faults: 1) the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control with only a <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; 2) the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control with limitation of the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; and 3) {{the positive and negative}} sequence voltage control with both a positive and a negative sequence reactive current injection. These different control options are compared in simulations of a wind power plant connected to a meshed power system, including synchronous generators. It is shown that both the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control with limitation and the positive and negative sequence voltage control can overcome the voltage rise and voltage distortion that can occur with pure <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage control without limitation. Both of these options have a distinct fault response, where the positive and negative sequence voltage control results in a fault response that resembles the fault response of a synchronous generator with higher fault current contributions in the faulted phases. status: publishe...|$|E

We also use similar notation for <b>positive</b> <b>sequences.</b> Let { a_n}_n= 1 ^∞, { b_n}_n= 1 ^∞ be <b>positive</b> <b>sequences.</b> Then we denote a_n∼ b_n if there exists N > 0 such that m ≤ a_n/b_n≤ M for every n > N for some constants 0 < m ≤ M < ∞.

It may also produce voltage ripples in the dc link and {{also increase the}} reactive power and have negative impact on grid current. In order to eliminate the voltage ripple along dc link capacitor and the dc component of the reactive power, both <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> and negative sequence currents should be controlled separately. Therefore this paper utilizes synchronous reference frame theory. One where the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> currents are regulated by a proportional integral (PI) controller in a positive synchronous reference frame (SRF), and the other negative sequence currents are regulated by a PI controller in a negative synchronous reference frame. The positive reference frame which rotates counter clockwise, the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> will appears as dc, while the negative sequence appears as 100 Hz. In same manner the negative sequence reference frame, which rotates clockwise, where the negative sequence appears as dc, while the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> components appears as 100 Hz.

30|$|Fault {{direction}} estimation during SPT condition using <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> components can be possible. However, during {{single pole}} operation in applications with line-side potential, eventual corruption of polarizing quantity can occur if the input voltage {{to the memory}} circuit is corrupted. Invalid memory polarization may cause directional element malfunction. For this reason, the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage input to the polarizing memory is generally eliminated when the voltage is distorted [29]. To overcome from this problem a <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> current based approach is proposed in this paper.

In this case, the values of θcp 23 and θcp 31 are found to be 3.98  rad and 0.56  rad. The maximum value of θcpij is 3.98  rad, which indicates that faulty branch is line 2 – 3.|$|E

30|$|PΣV: {{traditional}} three-phase AC machines {{as well as}} IBDERs and DFIMs can {{be represented}} with this bus type. In accordance with [89], the control strategy of the DER connected to this bus type involves setting the injected three-phase real power and {{the magnitude of the}} <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage component. Due to the unsymmetrical system state, the real power at the PCC of DER is not equally distributed per phases. Therefore, representing this control strategy with the traditional single-phase PV bus type, per each phase, would introduce calculation errors. The shortcoming could be omitted by using by using the recently-introduced PΣV bus type. For this bus type, the three-phase real power and the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage magnitude are known variables, while the angle of the <b>positive</b> <b>sequence</b> voltage component as well as the complex-valued negative and zero sequence voltage components are unknown state variables.|$|E
