40|$|Private sector buyers often award {{construction}} contracts through negotiation {{rather than through}} open competitive tendering. Negotiating with a reputable contractor {{is a way to}} mitigate contractual hazards. For many public sector buyers, however, open competitive tendering is required by law. The practices of <b>procurement</b> <b>officers</b> in local authorities are examined in regard to the selection of construction contractors, focusing particularly on their use of scoring-based competitive tendering and ex ante information exchange between <b>procurement</b> <b>officers</b> and the firms competing for contracts. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 15 <b>procurement</b> <b>officers</b> in 10 local authorities in Sweden. Using the contractor's staffing of the project organization as a contract award criterion allows <b>procurement</b> <b>officers</b> to select reputable contractors. Arranging face-to-face meetings with contractors before the final award decision allows <b>procurement</b> <b>officers</b> to resolve at least some technical problems in complex construction projects. When negotiations are prohibited by law, these practices can be seen as combined responses to hazards of construction contracting. Contracting, procurement law, public sector, Sweden,...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, Interarmco {{flooded the}} American market with {{military}} firearms, catering both to souvenir-hungry GIs and sportsmen, and drastically undercutting domestic sporting-arms manufacturers. [...] At the same time, Cummings became an export sales agent for various small arms manufacturers. [...] Interarmco was an original exclusive agent for ArmaLite, and Cummings personally demonstrated its revolutionary AR-10 selective-fire rifle to various nations, including Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. [...] The Nicaraguan demonstration succeeded {{in what would}} have been the first-ever AR-10 export sale to the nation of Nicaragua in 1957 (later cancelled). [...] In 1958, Cummings sold 100 ArmaLite AR-10 rifles to Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, but in 1959 the entire shipment of AR-10 rifles was captured intact on the Havana docks by the victorious rebel forces of Fidel Castro. [...] Cummings wrote Castro and asked him if he would pay for the rifles or return them, and was invited to visit Cuba in return. [...] Reportedly impressed with the firepower of the AR-10, Castro paid for the rifles and asked for more, but the American arms embargo to Cuba prohibited further sales. Castro later gave the rifles to rebels seeking to overthrow the leader of the Dominican Republic, General Rafael Trujillo. [...] In June 1959, the rebels invaded the Dominican Republic in a combined air/sea operation. [...] Betrayed by local residents, the seaborne rebel forces (led by Cuban officers), were surprised at the water's edge; those dropping via parachute were hunted down in the following days by the Dominican army. Captured AR-10 rifles from Cummings' Batista shipment were found on the bodies of guerrillas killed in firefights with government forces. [...] When Cummings arrived in the Dominican Republic that same month to discuss the subject of arms sales with the nation's arms <b>procurement</b> <b>officer,</b> an enraged General Trujillo stormed into the room carrying an AR-10 rifle taken off the body of a dead insurgent, demanding to know why Cummings had supplied guns to his enemies.

In this paper, we conduct a survey among forty nine university <b>procurement</b> <b>officers</b> in Israel to examine to what extent <b>procurement</b> <b>officers</b> have adapted to smartphones and tablets by testing how frequently officers use notebooks, smartphones, and tablets for work-related and leisure purposes. We find that while officers prefer electronic sources of information over printed sources of information, officers have not yet adapted to the later technological advances (i. e., smartphones and tablets). Notebooks are more frequently used than either smartphones or tablets for work-related and leisure purposes. One explanation behind this result is that officers are not skilled in using smartphone and tablets applications. This implies that training officers in the use of these devices may improve their performance...|$|R
