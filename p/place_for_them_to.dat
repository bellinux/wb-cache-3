25|$|Worldwide {{introduction}} of various mosquito species over large distances into regions {{where they are}} not indigenous has occurred through human agencies, primarily on sea routes, in which the eggs, larvae, and pupae inhabiting water-filled used tires and cut flowers are transported. However, apart from sea transport, mosquitoes have been effectively carried by personal vehicles, delivery trucks, trains, and aircraft. Man-made areas such as storm water retention basins, or storm drains also provide sprawling sanctuaries. Sufficient quarantine measures have proven difficult to implement. In addition, outdoor pool areas make a perfect <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> grow.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from The Onions The A.V. Club graded the episode with a D+, writing that [...] "Unlike the {{previous}} two weeks’ episodes, which juggled a number of storylines and locations and generated {{a real sense of}} Fringe’s expanding milieu, 'Fracture' is so curtailed that it almost feels like it was made for the Fox accountants. The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plot’s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter about finding a new <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astrid—and really not discovering much, except that she doesn’t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astrid’s underused yet again, even in an episode where she gets a lot of lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E

The Bauhaus principles, with their emphasis on functionality and inexpensive building materials, were perceived as ideal in Tel Aviv. The architects fleeing Europe brought not only Bauhaus ideas; the architectural ideas of Le Corbusier were also mixed in. Furthermore, Erich Mendelsohn was not formally associated with the Bauhaus, though he had several projects in Israel in the 1930s as did Carl Rubin, an architect from Mendelsohn's office. In the 1930s in Tel Aviv, many architectural ideas were converging and Tel Aviv was the ideal <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be tested.|$|E

[...] Montagu did not regard Palestine as a [...] "fit <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> live". [...] Montagu believed that it would let down assimilationists and the ideals of British Liberalism. [...] The Memorandum was not supposed to accentuate the prejudice of mentioning 'home of the Jewish people'. [...] Weizmann was a key holder at the Ministry of Supply by late 1917. [...] By 1918 Weizmann was accused of combating the idea of a separate peace with Turkey. [...] He considered such a peace at odds with Zionist interests.

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{alleviate}} Cebes' {{worry that the}} soul might perish at death, Socrates introduces his first argument for the immortality of the soul. This argument is often called the Cyclical Argument. It supposes that the soul must be immortal since the living come from the dead. Socrates says: [...] "Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how could they have been born again?". He goes on to show, using examples of relationships, such as asleep-awake and hot-cold, that things that have opposites come to be from their opposite. One falls asleep after having been awake. And after being asleep, he awakens. Things that are hot can become cold and vice versa. Socrates then gets Cebes {{to conclude that the}} dead are generated from the living, through death, and that the living are generated from the dead, through birth. The souls of the dead must exist in some <b>place</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be able to return to life.|$|E

Rabbah bar bar Hana saw two cracks in the ground from which smoke issued. He took a piece of wool, soaked it in water, attached it to the point of his spear, and passed it over the cracks, and the wool was singed. The Arab told Rabbah bar bar Hana to listen, and he heard them saying, [...] "Moses and his Torah are true, but Korah's company are liars." [...] The Arab told Rabbah bar bar Hana that every 30 days Gehinnom caused them to return for judgment, as if they were being stirred like meat in a pot, and every 30 days they said those same words.|$|E

According to the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) they are of least concern. They are doing very well in numbers.

Both disallowed items earned the team fines that effectively cost them victory.|$|R
