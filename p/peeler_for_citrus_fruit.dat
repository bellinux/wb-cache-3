40|$|Some {{historians and}} {{commentators}} have advanced {{the hypothesis that}} the development of the citrus industry- which also took place in the XIX century- also {{played an important role in}} favoring the emergence of the Sicilian mafia, especially in the area around Palermo. 1 Indeed, the evolution of international demand <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> resembles that of sulfur, although the time pattern <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> is less clear than for sulfur and Sicily was never a quasi-monopolist in the market <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> as it was in the sulfur market. Although <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> cultivations were especially concentrated in the areas areas around Palermo and the surrounding Conca d’Oro where early mafia’s presence was considerable, as reported in the 1885 parliamentary enquiry (Damiani, 1885), the cultivation of citrus was similarly widespread in the eastern part of Sicily, where the mafia remained virtually absent until the second part of the XX century. One possibly insightful way to empirically investigate this rather puzzling issue is to look at the distribution of the inputs employed in citrus cultivation: land and water. While Sicily’s climatic conditions and soil composition are generally favorable to the cultivation of citrus fruits- particularly in coastal areas- such cultivation requires abundant and regular availability of water which, instead, tends to vary substantially across different areas of Sicily. Indeed, underground water basins ten...|$|R

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Italy (evaluating Member State (EMS)), received an application {{from the company}} Cheminova to modify the existing MRLs <b>for</b> malathion in <b>citrus</b> and pome <b>fruits,</b> plum, strawberry and lettuce. In order to accommodate intended Southern European Union uses on lettuce, strawberries and <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> and the authorized use on apples, pears and plums in the third countries, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for malathion in all crops under consideration, including other salad plants. According to EFSA, the submitted residue data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit,</b> strawberries, apples, plums and lettuce. Residue data were not sufficient to derive a MRL proposal for pears. An extrapolation of residue data from lettuce to the whole group of salad plants is not supported by residue data. EFSA notes that for the MRL proposals on apples, plums, strawberries and lettuce additional data gaps were identified during the assessment. Based on the combined risk assessment, which was performed for malathion and its metabolites with similar toxicity (DMM desmethyl-malathion, MMCA malathion monocarboxylic acid and MDCA malathion dicarboxylic acid) and separately for malaoxon and {{taking into account the}} currently available information for the crops under consideration, the existing MRLs and the lack of detailed information on the actual approved uses of malathion, a potential long-term consumer health risk cannot be excluded. Setting a MRL on provisional basis might be acceptable by risk managers <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruits,</b> strawberries and lettuce, taking into account the low contribution of these crops to the overall long-term exposure and high level of uncertainties of the risk assessment which were compensated by using conservative assumptions leading to an overestimation of the calculated dietary exposure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{irrigation}} plan <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> in the climatic {{context of}} the area studied seems possible {{on the basis of}} evaporation from a class A pan. In principle, a coefficient value of 0. 6 could be retained. Indeed, the use of this coefficient together with a high frequency of irrigation has made it possible not only to satisfy the water requirements of the <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit,</b> but also to obtain a good yield, namely 40 tons per hectare. In addition, it has been possible to achieve a great economy in water in comparison to the considerably larger quantities otherwise needed by many farmers. Hence, a great saving in water compared to quantities commonly bought by other farmers. This was reflected not only in the yield but also in the quality of the fruit, {{which turned out to be}} even better, as indicated by its size, since the quantity of water was closer to that needed. A poor yield was obtained when the water deficit was severe...|$|R

40|$|Organ abscission is an {{important}} process in plant development and reproduction. During abscission, changes in cellular adhesion of specialised abscission zone (AZ) cells ensure the detachment of infected organs or those no longer serving a function to the plant.

Different plant species display distinct patterns and timing of organ shedding, most likely adapted during evolution to their diverse life styles. However, it appears that key regulators of cell separation may have conserved function in different plant species.

In order to accommodate for the authorized uses in European Member States, the EMS Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs of fenpyroximate in peaches, raspberries, blackberries, peppers and beans (with pods) and to lower MRLs <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit,</b> loquat, quinces, medlar, plums, apricots, wine grapes and strawberries. No need to modify MRLs was identified for apples, pears, tomatoes and aubergines. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted residue data are sufficient to support the lowering of the existing EU MRLs <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit,</b> pome fruit, plums, wine grapes and strawberries. The submitted residue data on raspberries, blackberries, peppers and beans (with pods) substantiate the proposal to raise the existing EU MRL. The submitted residue data on peaches, tomatoes and aubergines confirm the existing EU MRL. For apricots insufficient data were provided to support the authorized use. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the raising of the existing EU MRLs for fenpyroximate in raspberries, blackberries, peppers and beans (with pods) and the maintaining or lowering of the existing EU MRLs for other crops under consideration, will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern.

40|$|The Panel {{conducted}} {{a risk assessment}} of Phyllosticta citricarpa for the EU. P.  citricarpa causes citrus black spot (CBS) and is absent from the EU. Under the scenario of absence of specific risk reduction options against P. citricarpa, the risk of entry of P.  citricarpa was rated as likely <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> plants <b>for</b> planting and <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> with leaves, moderately likely <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> without leaves, unlikely <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> leaves <b>for</b> cooking and very unlikely for Tahiti lime fruit without leaves. Establishment was rated as moderately likely because susceptible hosts are widely available and environmental conditions in many EU citrus-growing areas are suitable (with high uncertainty) for P.  citricarpa ascospore production, dispersal and infection.  Current fungicide treatments will not prevent establishment. Environmental favourability is increased {{by the use of}} sprinkler and micro-sprinkler irrigation in some EU citrus-growing locations. Spread with trade was rated as moderately likely. Model results indicate that CBS epidemics are most likely to develop in EU citrus-growing areas in late summer to early autumn and in some locations also in late spring to early summer. CBS is expected to affect mainly lemons and late-maturing sweet orange and mandarin varieties, with moderate negative consequences for the production of fresh fruit, but with environmental impact of additional fungicide treatments. Negative consequences would be minor <b>for</b> early-maturing <b>citrus</b> varieties and minimal <b>for</b> <b>citrus</b> <b>for</b> processing. Uncertainty concerning the consequences is high, mainly {{because of the lack of}} data on critical climate response parameters for the pathogen but also because information on impact in areas at the limits of the current distribution is scarce. Since eradication and containment are difficult, phytosanitary measures should focus on preventing entry. Current phytosanitary measures are evaluated to be effective, with the exception of pest-free production sites...|$|R
