50|$|Of {{the many}} internationally {{recorded}} publications relating to gloss measurement, the earliest recorded studies (perceived and instrumental) {{are attributed to}} Ingersoll,who in 1914 developed a means to measure the glare of paper. The Ingersoll “Glarimeter”, the earliest known instrument developed for gloss measurement, {{was based on the}} principle that light is polarised in specular reflection. The instrument employed incident and viewing angles of 57.5° and used a contrast method to subtract the specular component from the total reflection using a <b>polarising</b> <b>element.</b> Ingersoll successfully applied for and patented this instrument a few years later in 1917.|$|E

A genetic algorithm {{has been used to}} minimise the drift of the reflection band, stabilising it {{for a wide range of}} angles, to beyond 60 °, even on thin substrates...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{influence}} of the edges on the currents induced in finite arrays used as frequency selective surfaces (FSS), large arrays of dual <b>polarised</b> <b>elements</b> have been modelled. The elements are rings, which provide azimuthal symmetry and do not restrict the current distributions. Current amplitudes fluctuate widely across the arrays, as do the orientations of nulls in the current distributions around the element circumference. Results for a sequence of arrays of increasing size illustrate how the currents eventually settle to the infinite case...|$|R
40|$|For {{three-dimensional}} {{electromagnetic wave}} field synthesis, {{the orientation of}} dual-polarised antenna elements has influence on the size or volume of the usable “quiet zone” or ”sweet spot”. The customary choice of polarisation directions along phi and theta allows for the full angular range over which wave fields can be synthesised. But, we show that this choice effectively reduces the number of available active radiators in case a single polarised wave is to be synthesised, with direction of incidence near the phi-axis. One option to maintain synthesis quality is driving both types of <b>polarised</b> <b>elements,</b> meaning also adding channel emulators that are an appreciable cost factor. However, not all applications need fully 3 -D incident fields and some simple compromises for specific applications are proposed...|$|R
2500|$|The BBC, which {{ultimately}} broadcast high-definition television on Freeview in the DVB-T2 format adopted in 2009, initially considered an alternative method utilising spare capacity {{at night to}} allow the download of high definition programmes for later replay. In addition the BBC's Research and Development team invented a transmission method that doubles the effective bandwidth that could currently be delivered by each multiplex using [...] "spatial multiplexing". While conventional analogue and digital terrestrial television signals are transmitted either vertically or horizontally polarised (providing protection against interference from other distant signals which may be transmitted on the same frequency, but will usually be planned to use the opposite polarisation), the proposed technique would have involved using the same frequency to transmit two different signals at once, one vertically and one horizontally polarised. A special receiving aerial, containing both vertically and horizontally <b>polarised</b> <b>elements,</b> could receive both signals simultaneously and feed these to a suitable set top box, but would require new transmitters and receiving equipment and aerials; the technique was ultimately not adopted.|$|R
40|$|A major {{program of}} reform has been {{announced}} by the Australian government {{that appears to be}} at odds with current general public perceptions regarding how safe quality maternity care is delivered. Australia is a society that has embraced the introduction of high technology across all aspects of life including childbirth in contrast to a primary maternity care model which reserves valuable obstetric services for only those women experiencing complications. The proposed reform does not come with consensus agreement and represents a change to traditional key stakeholder relationships with government. Maternity care provider groups involving obstetrics and midwifery {{have a long history of}} involvement in professional power struggles whilst consumer groups also contain <b>polarised</b> <b>elements.</b> Ongoing tensions exist as those who hold power to influence the direction of the reforms constantly assert their authority while those who do not hold the power make bids to seize power and redirect the reforms to suit their agendas. Critical discourse analysis was employed as the methodological framework in the context of Australian maternity services policy to better understand how knowledge and power have been used by key stakeholders for the purpose of influencing change. Interpretive analysis in this research was guided by the use of a neoliberal lens for the purpose of exposing the intrinsic drivers for change that are unrelated to key stakeholder influence. This approach has allowed power relationships to be examined and the forces driving change to be exposed. The analysis of relationships of power in maternity care has highlighted changes to historical positions including: Government and medicine; medicine and midwifery; medicine and consumers; and government and consumers. It is argued that these changes have been stimulated through the introduction of neoliberal values in publicly funded maternity services management. The rise in consumer influence has impacted strongly on the direction of change culminating in the proposed primary maternity reform agenda. The Australian government seeking to secure affordable maternity services has allianced to the reforms advocated by the key stakeholder collaboration incorporating consumer groups, midwifery, sympathetic health service managers and rural doctors. In contrast to the position of the collaborative alliance the obstetric discourse has been unable to provide government with solutions to escalating costs and workforce deficits associated with providing Australian women with safe maternity care. These findings have implications for the implementation process which is further challenged as general public confidence in the proposed reforms is being undermined in the newspaper media by a steady stream of fear inducing cautionary warnings emanating from the authoritative medical and obstetric expert claiming that lives of mothers and babies will be threatened by the proposed change. The general public are presented with a conflict, caught between the need for change and fear that change will undermine safe standards...|$|R
500|$|The Fifth <b>Element</b> <b>polarised</b> critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times {{described}} {{the film as}} an [...] "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's [...]" [...] He concluded that The Fifth Element was [...] "a lot warmer, more fun and boasts {{some of the most}} sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see." [...] On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "thumbs up"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, [...] "I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long." ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the performance of antennas for mobile base station applications and techniques for improving the coverage and capacity within a base station cell. The work starts by tracing the development of mobile systems, both in technical and commercial terms, from the earliest analogue systems to present day broadband systems and includes anticipated future developments. This is followed by an outline of how smart antenna systems can be utilised to improve cell coverage and capacity. A novel smart antenna system incorporating an array of slant ± 450 dual- <b>polarised</b> stacked patch <b>elements</b> four columns wide excited by a novel multi-beam forming and beam shaping network has been designed, simulated and implemented. It is found that for an ideal smart antenna array, four narrow overlapping beams, one wide “broadcast channel” beam and right and left shaped beams can be provided. Results are presented for the simulation of the smart antenna system using CST EM simulation software which inherently includes mutual coupling and the effects of a truncated ground plane on the element patterns. The results show some significant changes to the desired set of coverage patterns and various mutual coupling compensation techniques have been reviewed. An improved design technique has been developed for compensating the performance degrading effects of mutual coupling and finite ground plane dimensions in microstrip antenna arrays. The improved technique utilises combination of two previously known techniques: complex excitation weights compensation by inversion of the array mutual coupling scattering matrix and the incorporation of a WAIM (wide angle impedance matching) sheet. The technique has been applied to a novel multi-beam smart antenna array to demonstrate the efficacy of the technique by electromagnetic simulation. In addition, a demonstrator array has been constructed and tested which has yielded a positive conformation of the simulation results. For the developed demonstrator array which provides seven different beams, beams “footprints” have been predicted both for free space propagation and for urban propagation to evaluate the dynamic capacity performance of the smart antenna in a 3 G mobile network. The results indicate that sector capacity can be dynamically tailored to user demand profiles by selection of the appropriate beam patterns provided by the novel smart antenna system.
