Analysis of charred remains in one pot indicates that it at least was used for fermenting a mixture of blood and nuts. Some have therefore guessed that fermentation of grain was used to produce beer.|$|E

25|$|Cuttlefish {{possess an}} {{internal}} structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and {{is made of}} aragonite. The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle. Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, {{and is one of}} the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives. Jewellers and silversmiths traditionally use cuttlebones as moulds for casting small objects, but they are <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> known as the tough material given to parakeets and other caged birds as a source of dietary calcium.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{is a general}} Sunday newspaper, covering news and politics. It is published in five sections: News, Sport, Business, Property, and Living, {{as well as a}} magazine section. In terms of news, while the newspaper maintains a broadsheet outlook, it has come in for much criticism lately due to its increasing emphasis on lifestyle features in the main section. It has also been criticised for regularly tending towards sensationalism, and for the often opinion-focused, rather than news-focused nature of its articles. It is <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> described as a middle-of-the-road newspaper, rather than a newspaper of record. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Deputy Editor was Anne Harris.|$|E
25|$|All {{versions}} of the GBP bypass the duodenum, which is the primary site of absorption of both iron and calcium. Iron replacement is essential in menstruating females, and supplementation of iron and calcium is preferable in all patients. Ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated. Alternative forms of iron (fumarate, gluconate, chelates) are less irritating and <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> absorbed. Calcium carbonate preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. Chewable calcium supplements that include vitamin K are sometimes recommended by doctors as {{a good way to}} get calcium.|$|E

25|$|The {{laughing}} owl's plumage was yellowish-brown striped {{with dark}} brown. There were white straps on the scapulars, and occasionally the hind neck. Mantle feathers were edged with white. The wings and tail had light brown bars. The tarsus had yellowish to reddish-buff feathers. The facial disc was white behind {{and below the}} eyes, fading to grey with brown stripes towards the centre. Some birds were more rufous, with a brown facial disk; this was at first attributed to subspecific differences, but is <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> related to individual variation. There are indications that males were more often of the richly coloured morph (e.g. the Linz specimen OÖLM 1941/433). The eyes were very dark orange. Its length was 35.5–40cm (14-15.7") and wing length 26.4cm (10.4"), with males being smaller than females. Weight was around 600grams.|$|E
25|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1846, the LNWR had offered to lease the Shropshire Union, and the {{directors}} felt that a guaranteed income from a powerful company was <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> than most other options. They agreed to the terms in December, and the LNWR obtained an Act of Parliament in June 1847 to authorise the arrangement. The Shrewsbury and Stafford Railway was opened on 1 June 1849, and lease payments began a month later on 1 July. The arrangement of the lease was not fully completed until 25 March 1857, but the LNWR, struggling with their own success, persuaded the Shropshire Union not to build any more railways, {{in exchange for a}} commitment to servicing the canal debts. The Shropshire Union thus lost its independence after a very short period, but continued to manage the canals under its control, and in this they had a remarkably free hand.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} years, Monkhouse was <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> known for hosting {{television}} quiz shows than {{for being a}} comedian. One of his biggest successes was The Golden Shot from 1967 until 1972 and again in 1974. This was broadcast live for 52 weeks a year and drew up to 17 million viewers. His tenure ended with allegations, which he denied, {{that he had taken}} bribes to include branded goods on the programme as advertisements. He returned in 1974 after comedians Norman Vaughan and Charlie Williams were found wanting. The dozens of other shows Monkhouse presented included Celebrity Squares, Family Fortunes and Bob's Full House. Audiences regularly topped 15 million. In the late 1980s he hosted two series of the revival of the talent show Opportunity Knocks, which aired as Bob Says Opportunity Knocks. He then moved to ITV to front two more game shows, Bob's Your Uncle and the $64,000 Dollar Question, neither of which were popular successes.|$|E

25|$|The methods {{based on}} stable {{isotopes}} and O2/Ar ratios {{have the advantage}} of providing estimates of respiration rates in the light without the need of incubations in the dark. Among them, the method of the triple oxygen isotopes and O2/Ar have the additional advantage of not needing incubations in closed containers and O2/Ar can even be measured continuously at sea using equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry (EIMS)/Ar measurements by equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry | journal=Anal. Chem. | volume=81 | issue = 5 | pages=1855–1864 | doi=10.1021/ac802300u}} or a membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS). However, if results relevant to the carbon cycle are desired, it is <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> to rely on methods based on carbon (and not oxygen) isotopes. It is important to notice that the method based on carbon stable isotopes is not simply an adaptation of the classic 14C method, but an entirely different approach that does not suffer from the problem of lack of account of carbon recycling during photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole of}} the Soviet Union became {{dedicated}} to the war effort. The population of the Soviet Union was <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> prepared than any other nation involved in the fighting of World War II to endure the material hardships of the war. This is primarily because the Soviets were so used to shortages and coping with economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I brought similar restrictions on food. Still, conditions were severe. World War II was especially devastating to Soviet citizens because it was fought on their territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over one million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and the elderly. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to bread, flour, cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar, and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Additional rations were often so expensive {{that they could not}} add substantially to a citizen’s food supply unless that person was especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with local resources that they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold any surplus they had at a high price and a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two {{years after the end of}} the war wiped out their wealth.|$|E

[...] Hammett replied, [...] "Fine, take my bunk, I'll sleep up front, it's <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> up there anyway." [...] Burton was sleeping shortly before 7am on September 27 when, according to the driver, the bus skidded off the road (the E4, [...] north of Ljungby), and flipped onto the grass in Kronoberg County.

500|$|The two composers {{ceased to}} be on {{friendly}} terms {{in the middle of}} the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons. Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other. Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom. Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, [...] "Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people." [...] The public tension led to personal estrangement. Ravel said, [...] "It's <b>probably</b> <b>better</b> for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons." [...] Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift. In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac. Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval, contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband.|$|E
