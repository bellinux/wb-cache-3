25|$|The {{education}} of street children in India is very poor and often nonexistent. A study of street children in Bombay in 1989 found that 54.5 percent {{had never been}} enrolled in school and 66 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were illiterate. A 2004 study of street children in Bombay revealed that circumstances were largely the same: 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> had never attended school and approximately two-thirds were illiterate.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{plentiful}} resources, {{the country}} lacks sustainable pragmatic policies to combat poverty. Hania Sholkamy, an {{economist for the}} Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo, disclosed that although the government had subsidized 270 million loaves of bread/day at 19 Piasters/piece, 29 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> in Egypt remained malnourished. Although these policies were adopted {{in an attempt to}} reduce economic burdens on the poor, they benefited the rich more which caused more problems to the poor and increased the burdens of the government. In fact, 83 percent of food subsidy, 76 percent of electricity subsidy, 87 percent of petroleum subsidy and 76 percent of the social safety net subsidy went to the non-poor instead of the poor.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, Chester Upland School District {{announced}} {{it could not}} pay faculty and staff. It appealed to the state for additional funding. The District has received over $73 million in extra funding {{over the last five}} school years. The State Appointed Receiver, Francis Barnes, had sought court approval of a plan which partially addressed a $23.8 million shortfall. The District lost the appeal. Local charter schools educate more than forty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> living in the attendance zone of the Chester Upland School District. They have fled the district due to decades of poor academic outcomes and chronic safety issues. The Wolf Administration and the District created a plan to cut back sharply on the state mandated funding sent to the charter schools.|$|E

2500|$|Street {{children}} in India face additional vulnerability {{because of their}} {{lack of access to}} nutritious food, sanitation, and medical care. Street children lack access to nutritious food because many are dependent on leftovers from small restaurants or hotels, food stalls, or garbage bins.

Frequent rocket fire has also caused many injuries in the post-Intifada period. Permanent disability among children has resulted, including blindness,, paralysis, brain damage, and loss of limbs. A 2003 study by Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel concluded, [...] "Analysis of the injuries sustained by the 160 children hospitalized after these events indicates that most were caused by blasts and penetration by foreign objects. Sixty-five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> had multiple injuries, and the proportion of critical to fatal injuries was high (18%)." ...|$|E
25|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{increase}} <b>of</b> {{regulations and}} legal restrictions on child labour, {{there has been}} a 64 percent decline in child labour from 1993-2005. Although this is a great decrease in <b>the</b> country <b>of</b> India, there is still high numbers <b>of</b> <b>children</b> working in <b>the</b> rural areas <b>of</b> India. With 85 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> labour occurring in rural areas, and 15 percent occurring in urban areas, there are still substantial areas <b>of</b> concern in <b>the</b> country <b>of</b> India.|$|R

2500|$|Historically, Polish-Americans have assimilated {{very quickly}} to American society. Between 1940 and 1960, only 20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of Polish-American ethnic leaders spoke Polish regularly, {{compared}} to 50 percent for Ukrainians. In the early 1960s, 3,000 of Detroit's 300,000 Polish-Americans changed their names each year. Language proficiency in Polish is rare in Polish-Americans, as 91.3% speak [...] "English only". In 1979, the 8 million respondents of Polish ancestry reported that only 41.5 percent had single ancestry, whereas 57.3% of Greeks, 52% of Italians and Sicilians, and 44% of Ukrainians had done so. Polish-Americans tended to marry exogamously in the postwar era in high numbers, and tended to marry within the Catholic population, often to persons of German (17%), Italian (10%), East European (8%), Irish (5%), French-Canadian (4%), Spanish-speaking (2%), Lithuanian (2%), and English (1%) ancestry.|$|E
2500|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} in bathing, toilets, {{and water}} {{also contributes to}} poor health. In the same study of street children in Bombay, 29.6 percent of children reported bathing in the sea and 11.5 percent reported bathing in pipes, wells, or canals. Open air bathing of street children {{is in fact a}} very common sight in all parts of India. These children have to put their naked bodies on display {{for a very long time}} before, during and after bathing. As a result, they develop hardly any sense of modesty. They as well as the onlookers have a casual approach to this phenomenon. Street children also lack restroom facilities, demonstrated by the fact that 26.4 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> used the roadside or railway line for their toilet. For water, the children reported asking restaurants or hotels for water (69.1 percent) or using pipes and water taps (15.6 percent).|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the British-based Internet Watch Foundation {{reported}} that child pornography on the Internet {{is becoming more}} brutal and graphic, {{and the number of}} images depicting violent abuse has risen fourfold since 2003. The CEO stated [...] "The worrying issue is the severity and the gravity of the images is increasing. We're talking about prepubescent children being raped." [...] About 80 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> in the abusive images are female, and 91 percent appear to be {{children under the age of}} 12. Prosecution is difficult because multiple international servers are used, sometimes to transmit the images in fragments to evade the law. Some child pornographers also circumvent detection by using viruses to illegally gain control of computers on which they remotely store child pornography. In one case, a Massachusetts man was charged with possession of child pornography when hackers used his computer to access pornographic sites and store pornographic pictures without his knowledge. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has ruled that if a user downloads child pornography from a file sharing network and possesses it in his [...] "shared folder" [...] without configuring the software to not share that content, he can be charged with distributing child pornography.|$|E

For urban women, 2.3% of women had a child before age 15 and 16.7% of women had a child before age 18. For rural women, 4% had a child before age 15 and 25% had a child before age 18. Throughout time there has been organizations that have helped with such issues, such as the United Nations, and <b>the</b> Accelerated <b>Child</b> Survival Development Programme, both fought against abortions, and reduced about 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> and maternal mortality rates.|$|R

2500|$|At year's end {{more than}} 20,000 children, {{including}} nearly 3,000 girls, had been demobilized from government security services and armed groups. NGOs estimated {{that as many}} as 30,000 children were once associated with armed groups. Although there were no reliable statistics, most credible sources, including the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), estimated that at least 3,000 children had yet to be demobilized and remained in <b>the</b> ranks <b>of</b> or held by armed groups. According to an October AI report, girls accounted for 15 to 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> soldiers, but in some areas they constituted less than 2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> child soldiers demobilized.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{incidence}} <b>of</b> <b>child</b> labour {{is still}} very high in many less developed countries.
