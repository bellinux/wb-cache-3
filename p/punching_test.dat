40|$|Traditionally, {{flexural}} {{testing is}} used to characterize the strength and post–peak behavior of fiber–reinforced concretes (FRC). Nevertheless, these tests results exhibit a high dispersion, and therefore invalidate their use as tests for the systematic control of FRCs in works.

The small <b>punch</b> <b>test</b> (SPT) is a {{relatively}} new mechanical testing technique capable of utilising small disk-shaped specimens to determine the mechanical behaviour of the test materials. From the test data, fracture properties in particular the equivalent fracture strain (εqf) can be determined and the elastic-plastic fracture toughness of a material can be characterised. Finite element analyses (FEA) of the small <b>punch</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed for the 304 H stainless steel in this study. 304 H stainless steel was isothermally aged at 650, 700 and 750 o C for durations up to 200 hours.

40|$|A small <b>punch</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of}} the {{innovative}} methods {{that can be used to}} evaluate the properties of a material without destructive harm to the in-service component. Conventionally identifying material properties by a uniaxial test is widely applied to engineering.

In 2006, European Code of Practice (CoP) of small <b>punch</b> <b>tests</b> was first released, in which the correlation factor, ksp, was introduced to bridge the gap between the above methods.

However, in accordance with various studies on FRC, it has been seen different variation coefficients {{of the order of}} 20 % for the results of flexural test beams.

40|$|International audienceExperimental and {{numerical}} {{studies of}} hot tearing formation in steel are reported. On the one hand, an ingot <b>punching</b> <b>test</b> is presented. It consists {{in the application}} of a deformation at the surface of a solidifying 450 kg steel ingot. The experimental parameters are the displacement of the pressing tool, together with its velocity, leading to variations of a global strain rate. On the other hand, three-dimensional finite element thermomechanical modeling of the test is used. The time evolution of the strain tensor serves to compute an index to evaluate the susceptibility to create hot tears. It is based on the integration of a hot tearing criterion (HTC) that compares the local accumulation of strain with the expression of a critical value proposed in the literature. The main variable of the criterion is the brittleness temperature range (BTR) that refers to the solidification interval during which strain accumulates and creates hot cracks or tears. Detailed comparison of the simulation results with the measurements reveals the importance of the BTR for the prediction as well as excellent capabilities of the HTC to predict the formation of hot tears...|$|E
40|$|Several {{authors have}} shown the direct {{influence}} of {{the orientation of the}} fibres on the residual strength of the material. From a design-oriented perspective, the anisotropy due to the dispersion and orientation of fibres has {{to be taken into account}} when characterizing the mechanical behaviour of the material. However, the wide variety of tests currently used for the characterization of fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) only allow a unidirectional characterization (without considering the orientation of the fibres in the matrix). In order to overcome this drawback, a complete characterization of the fibres orientation together with its structural contribution in the cracked section is required. Considering the above, this paper proposes the use of the double punch test on cubic samples (so called multidirectional double <b>punching</b> <b>test</b> or MDPT test) as an alternative to conventional characterization tests. Due to the specimen shape in a single procedure an estimation of the fibre orientation efficiency can be obtained, establishing a link between the mechanical properties of FRC with the fibre orientation. Thereby, this paper represents a meaningful contribution to provide a step towards the development of a rational and design-oriented constitutive model for real-scale structures.

Copper clad laminate is a main raw material for consumer electronics, information and telecommunications devices.

The proposed system consists of small-scale force transducer, displacement transducer and data acquisition system, with which the punching forces can be measured in each punch steps. A small punch with outer diameter 2 mm is directly connected to the force transducer to measure the pushing and pulling forces during the hole-punching process. Bushings and guide pins are used inside the die configuration in order to ensure path straightness when the punch moves into the die cavity. The experimental results show that the increase of punch and die clearances decreases the punching forces. The same result is obtained with increase of blank temperatures. In the final part of the paper, a computer-aided analysis package DEFORM 2 D is used to understand the deformation and crack initiation of the blank in the small hole-punching process. The analytical maximum punching force agrees with experimental result. The research results are a useful database when designing requirements of punch and ejecting force during manufacture...|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} the failure mechanisms of polyurea when {{is loaded with}} an ultra-high strain pressure wave. This kind of loading is present when polyurea {{is used as a}} protective layer against projectiles in ballistics and explosions. A large amount of research has been done on this polymer at room temperature and at lower strain rates, but there is not a lot of information on the failure mechanism of polyurea when is subjected to ultra-high strain rate and low temperatures. Therefore, to understand the failure mechanisms that occur in these loading situations a noveler technique is necessary. Modifications were made to the Laser Spallation Technique in order to load structures under a single transient wave pulse, resulting in two different setups. This study characterized polyurea shock loaded at extreme pressures, strain rates and temperatures. By sandwiching polyurea between two right angle N-BK 7 prism, the sample was subjected to a combined pressure shear stress at strain rates of 2. 8 x 107 s- 1. The stress at failure was determined by Abaqus, a finite element analysis software, that was loaded by interferometrically measured stress wave in the glass prism before it strikes the polyurea sample. A shear strength of of 90 ï¿½ 9. 9 MPa under a pressure of only 119 ï¿½ 13 MPa was measured. Using a different testing setup, polyurea was loaded in tension-shear stress, the stress state at failure was calculated to be 27. 71 ï¿½ 2. 43 MPa in shear and mean normal stress of and 57. 13 ï¿½ 5. 02 MPa. This occurred at a calculated peak strain rate of 3. 7 x 107 s- 1. To explore an even more extreme loading environment, a specialized test setup was employed to load polyurea at temperatures ranging from room temperature to - 100 ï¿½C in an attempt to elucidate brittle behavior. Under these loading conditions polyurea failed in a different way, depending on the displacement constraints of the sample and the way that the stress wave was generated. In the spallation test setup, the spalled strength found through the FEM stress calculations is equal to 1. 11 GPa with a strain rate of 6. 4 x 107 s- 1. Polyurea formed a Hertian cone crack when a certain combination of temperature and energy fluence was used, a failure mechanism not previously observed at room temperature using the maximum energy of the Nd:YAG laser (2. 3 J). Polyurea columns were loaded at different temperatures and energy fluence, showing wing cracks when the samples were loaded at - 60 ï¿½C with 490 KJ/m 2 fluence.

The material in the <b>punching</b> <b>tests</b> was ultra-high-strength steel DQ 960, with a thickness of 4 mm.

The J-integral value can be derived from the calculated load-load line displacement curve, and the amount of crack extension can be estimatde by the length of the damaged elements, in which the void fraction reaches the void volume fraction at final fracture. Thus a J-R curve can be created and JIC can be determined according to ASTM E 1820 - 08. Experimental results for both the small <b>punch</b> <b>tests</b> and the standard fracture tests. have been analysed and verifications carried out by using standard uni-axial tensile tests and fracture CT tests. A good agreement is found between the test results and the analytic prediction. JRC. DDG. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|R
