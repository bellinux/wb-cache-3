5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E

40|$|Background Studies {{on blood}} flow {{velocity}} in the fetal middle <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> have revealed signs of brain sparing in chronic hypoxia. These signs of brain sparing can {{disappear in the}} terminal case, but whether this applies to the whole brain or only parts of it is unknown. Methods Velocity waveforms of the middle cerebral, anterior <b>cerebral</b> and <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> were recorded in 221 pregnancies complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension. The presence of brain sparing (pulsatility index < 2 standard deviations) was noted and correlated to outcome of pregnancy, including emergency operative intervention and/or neonatal distress. Results Signs of brain sparing in the anterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> were found in 90 fetuses, {{and in the middle}} <b>cerebral</b> and <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> in 52 and 65, respectively. Signs of brain sparing in the anterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> showed the strongest relationship to adverse perinatal outcome. The anterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> was the only vessel in which signs of brain sparing were predictive of perinatal mortality. Conclusions Velocimetry of the anterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> appears to be superior to that of the middle <b>cerebral</b> and <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> as a means to predict adverse perinatal outcome. Anterior <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> brain sparing may therefore be less transitory than sparing in the middle <b>cerebral</b> and <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries,</b> possibly suggesting that the frontal lobes are spared longer than the lateral and occipital regions of the fetal brain...|$|R

25|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} {{is caused by}} lesions in the {{inferior}} left temporal lobe of the brain located near Wernicke's area, and is usually due to minor hemorrhage or contusion in the temporal lobe, or infarcts of the left <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> (PCA). One function of the arcuate fasciculus is the connection between Wernicke’s and Broca’s area. In TSA Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas are spared, meaning that lesions do not occur in these regions of the brain. However, since the arcuate fasciculus, Wernicke's area, and Broca's area are secluded {{from the rest of}} the brain in TSA, patients still have intact repetition (as information from the arcuate fasciculus is relayed to Broca’s area), but cannot attach meaning to words, either spoken or heard.|$|E
500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>artery</b> are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} types of latex calibrated-leak balloon catheters have been developed. One consists of a Teflon catheter with a detachable latex balloon and is used to embolize branches of the external carotid artery. The other consists of a Silastic catheter with a nondetachable latex balloon and is used to embolize brain arteriovenous malformations. An experimental model and animal experiments have determined the best conditions for safe and reproducible embolization with isobutyl- 2 cyanoacrylate (IBC- 2). Selective catheterization of branches of external carotid, middle cerebral, anterior <b>cerebral,</b> and <b>posterior</b> <b>cerebral</b> <b>arteries</b> in humans is facilitated, and emboli-zation with IBC- 2 has been achieved with these balloon catheters. Selective catheterization of branches of the external carotid artery has been extensively used during the past 10 years, but even with a small catheter (3 or 4 French) and small gu ide wires (0. 0 21 or 0. 025 inch [0. 05 or 0. 06 cm]) it is sometimes difficult to catheterize a distal branch of the internal maxillary artery.
