500|$|Homer-Dixon {{begins by}} {{presenting}} his <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> background {{that led to}} the drafting of this book. [...] He establishes that the nature of problems are becoming overly burdensome, including providing resources for exponentially growing populations, managing international environmental impacts, and creating a secure global economic market. Modern problems often contain numerous factors that interact to create hidden complexities and non-linear results. The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis is used to illustrate a system in which professed experts had confidence in but internal and external factors compounded upon each other to create a sudden, unexpected drop. The delusion of control, or the assumption that experts were in control, led to overconfidence in an economic system that was not well understood. Homer-Dixon finds that the experts are just as susceptible to groupthink as non-experts and that they have boundless capacity for hindsight rationalization of unexpected movements.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the process of deciphering the tablets, Pettinato made claims about a possible connections between Ebla and the Bible, citing an alleged references in the tablets to the existence of Yahweh, the Patriarchs, Sodom and Gomorrah and other Biblical references. However, much of the initial media excitement about a supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely discredited and the academic consensus is that Ebla [...] "has no bearing on the Minor Prophets, the historical accuracy of the Biblical Patriarchs, Yahweh worship, or Sodom and Gomorrah". In Ebla studies, the focus has shifted away from comparisons with the Bible; Ebla is now studied as a civilization in its own right. The claims led to a bitter <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> conflict between the scholars involved, as well as what some described as political interference by the Syrian authorities.|$|E

Philosophers Peter Singer and Paula Casal praised work for exposing a false dichotomy of animal rights versus animal welfare, both seeing the work as an important contribution to the literature for this reason. Francione, an advocate for an animal rights approach which does mandate liberation, was quoted as saying that [...] "It would be an understatement to say that I disagree with Cochrane but he does a fine job presenting the argument and his book will surely provoke debate and discussion." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{begins by}} {{surveying}} the historical place of <b>personal</b> narrative <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> research writing in college composition courses {{in an effort}} to foreground student perceptions of these assignments in the college curriculum. The questions guiding this project focus on student perceptions of academic value, genre conventions, audience awareness, and moments of empowerment in college English writing assignments. Student subjects were interviewed one-on-one, the result of which is a sharp contrast between what composition teachers and students recognize as valuable in the process of writing <b>personal</b> narrative <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> research assignments. Most surprisingly, students identified a narrative of mastery which has fallen out of focus in contemporary composition studies. Ultimately, I argue for writing projects which cull the most valued aspects of each genre to encourage greater student agency and a more consequential writing experience...|$|R
