2500|$|Microsoft Surface 1.0, {{the first}} version of PixelSense, was {{announced}} on May 29, 2007 at the D5 Conference. It shipped to customers in 2008 as an end-to-end solution with Microsoft producing and selling the combined hardware/software platform. [...] It is a 30-inch (76cm) 4:3 rear <b>projection</b> <b>display</b> (1024×768) with integrated PC and five near-infrared (IR) cameras that can see fingers and objects placed on the display. The display is placed in a horizontal orientation, giving it a table-like appearance. The product and its applications are designed so that several people can approach the display from all sides to simultaneously share and interact with digital content. The cameras’ vision capabilities enable the product to see a near-IR image of what’s placed on the screen, captured at approximately 60 times per second. The Surface platform processing identifies three types of objects touching the screen: fingers, tags, and blobs. Raw vision data is also available and can be used in applications. The device is optimized to recognize 52 simultaneous multitouch points of contact. Microsoft Corporation produced the hardware and software for the Microsoft Surface 1.0 product. Sales of Microsoft Surface 1.0 were discontinued in 2011 in anticipation of the release of the Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft Surface and the Microsoft Surface 2.0 software platform.|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{perception}} limits of the human visual system is presented, resulting in an estimate of approximately 15 million variable resolution pixels per eye. Assuming a 60 Hz stereo display with a depth complexity of 6, we make the prediction that a rendering rate of approximately ten billion triangles per second is sufficient to saturate the human visual system. 17 different physically realizable computer display configurations are analyzed to understand their visual perceptions limits. The displays include direct view CRTs, stereo <b>projection</b> <b>displays,</b> multi-walled immersive stereo <b>projection</b> <b>displays,</b> head-mounted displays, as well as standard TV and movie displays for comparison.

40|$|International audienceProjection displays, {{compared}} to other modern display technologies, have many unique advantages. However, the image quality assessment of <b>projection</b> <b>displays</b> has not been well studied so far. In this paper, we propose an objective approach to measure the relative contrast of <b>projection</b> <b>displays</b> based on the pictures taken with a calibrated digital camera {{in a dark room}} where the projector is the only light source. A set of carefully selected natural images is modified to generate multiple levels of image contrast. In order to enhance the validity, reliability, and robustness of our research, we performed the experiments in similar viewing conditions at two separate geographical locations with different <b>projection</b> <b>displays.</b> In each location, we had a group of observers to give perceptual ratings. Further, we adopted state-of-art contrast measures to evaluate the relative contrast of the acquired images. The experimental results suggest that the Michelson contrast measure performs the worst, as expected, while other global contrast measures perform relatively better, but they have less correlation with the perceptual ratings than local contrast measures. The local contrast measures perform better than global contrast measures for all test images, but all contrast measures failed on the test images with low luminance or dominant colors and without texture areas. In addition, the high correlations between the experimental results for the two <b>projections</b> <b>displays</b> indicate that our proposed assessment approach is valid, reliable, and consistent...|$|R

5000|$|A {{different}} kind of <b>projection</b> <b>display</b> is the class of [...] "laser projection displays", where the image is built up sequentially either via line by line scanning or by writing one complete column at a time.
