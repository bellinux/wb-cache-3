25|$|Photosensitivity is an {{abnormal}} skin reaction to direct sunlight exposure. It is unrelated to a sunburn. These reactions {{are due to}} <b>photosensitization,</b> the accumulation of photosensitive compounds beneath the skin. In some cases, the photodynamic substances come from ingested plants or drugs, after being metabolized or not. In other cases, the photodynamic substances may be produced in the body itself due to inborn errors in pigment metabolism, especially those involving the heme synthesis. Photosensitivity reactions are usually seen in herbivorous or omnivorous animals, though such reactions are not uncommon among carnivores.|$|E
500|$|Solar {{urticaria}} is an immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity {{that can}} be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous <b>photosensitization.</b> Primary SU {{is believed to be}} a type I hypersensitivity (a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including anaphylaxis) in which an antigen, or substance provoking an immune response, is [...] "induced by UV or visible radiation." [...] Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as tar, pitch, and dyes. People who use drugs such as benoxaprofen or patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria may also contract this secondary form. These items that cause this photosensitivity are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater sensitivity to light.|$|E

50|$|<b>Photosensitization</b> is {{a process}} of {{transferring}} the energy of absorbed light. After absorption, the energy is transferred to the (chosen) reactants.

50|$|Although Hypericum perforatum {{is grown}} commercially {{in some regions}} of south east Europe, it is listed as a noxious weed in more than twenty {{countries}} and has introduced populations in South and North America, India, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. In pastures, St John's wort acts as both a toxic and invasive weed. It replaces native plant communities and forage vegetation {{to the extent of}} making productive land nonviable or becoming an invasive species in natural habitats and ecosystems. Ingestion by livestock such as horses, sheep, and cattle can cause <b>photosensitization,</b> central nervous system depression, spontaneous abortion or death.

5000|$|Trioxsalen (trimethyl{{psoralen}}, Trioxysalen or Trisoralen) is a furanocoumarin and a psoralen derivative. It {{is obtained}} from several plants, mainly Psoralea corylifolia.

It is administered either topically or orally {{in conjunction with}} UV-A (the least damaging form of ultraviolet light) for phototherapy treatment of vitiligo and hand eczema. [...] After photoactivation it creates interstrand cross-links in DNA, which can cause programmed cell death unless repaired by cellular mechanisms.

5000|$|With cycloheptene, the {{cis-isomer}} {{is always}} assumed but the trans-isomer does also exist. One procedure for the organic synthesis of trans-cycloheptene is by singlet <b>photosensitization</b> of cis-cycloheptene with methyl benzoate and ultraviolet light at −35 °C. The double bond in the trans isomer is very strained. The directly attached atoms {{on a simple}} alkene are all coplanar. In trans-cycloheptene, however, {{the size of the}} ring makes it impossible for the alkene and its two attached carbons to have this geometry because the remaining three carbons could not reach far enough to close the ring (see also Bredt's rule). There would have to be unusually large angles (angle strain), unusually long bond-lengths, or the atoms of the alkane-like loop would collide with the alkene part (steric strain). Part of the strain is relieved by pyramidalization of each alkene carbon and their rotation relative to each other. The pyramidalization angle is estimated at 37° (compared to an angle of 0° for an atom with normal trigonal-planar geometry) and the p-orbital misalignment is 30.1°. [...] Because the barrier for rotation of the double bond in ethylene is approximately 65 kcal/mol (270 kJ/mol) and can only be lowered by the estimated strain energy of 30 kcal/mol (125 kJ/mol) present in the trans-isomer, trans-cycloheptene should be a stable molecule just as its homologue trans-cyclooctene. In fact, it is not: unless the temperature is kept very low, rapid isomerization to the cis-isomer takes place. The trans-cycloheptene isomerization mechanism is not simple alkene-bond rotation, but rather an alternative lower energy pathway. Based on the experimentally observed second order reaction kinetics for isomerization, two trans-cycloheptene molecules in the proposed pathway first form a diradical dimer. The two heptane radical rings then untwist to an unstrained conformation, and finally the dimer fragments back into two cis-cycloheptene molecules. Note that the photoisomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid with bromine is also bimolecular.|$|E
50|$|Gerischer studied {{chemistry}} at the University of Leipzig between 1937 and 1944 with {{a two-year}} interruption because of military service. In 1942, he {{was expelled from}} the German army because his mother was born Jewish; he was thus found “undeserving to have {{a part in the}} great victories of the German Army.” The war years were difficult for Gerischer, and his mother committed suicide on the eve of her 65th birthday in 1943. His only sister, Ruth (born in 1913), lived underground after escaping from a Gestapo prison and was subsequently killed in an air raid in 1944.In Leipzig, Gerischer joined the group of Karl Friedrich Bonhöffer, a member of a distinguished family, whose members were persecuted and murdered because of their opposition to Nazi ideology. Bonhöffer descended from an illustrious chemical lineage of Wilhelm Ostwald (1853-1932) and Walther Hermann Nernst (1864-1941). He kindled Gerischer’s interest in electrochemistry, supervising his doctoral work on periodic (oscillating) reactions on electrode surfaces. Gerischer completed his doctoral thesis in 1946. He followed Bonhöffer to Berlin where his Ph.D. supervisor had accepted the directorship of the Institute of Physical Chemistry at Humboldt University. There he also became the department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin-Dahlem (later the Fritz Haber Institute). Gerischer himself was appointed as an “Assistänt”; in 1970 he would return to the Fritz Haber Institute as its Director. With the Berlin Blockade and the prevailing economic conditions, the post-war research was carried out under extremely difficult conditions.Gerischer met his future wife, Renate Gersdorf, at the University of Leipzig where she was doing her diploma work with Prof. C. Weygand. They were married in Berlin in October 1948. In 1949 Gerischer moved his young family to Göttingen to join Bonhöffer as a Research Associate at the newly established Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry. In Berlin and Göttingen and especially during the period from 1949 to 1955 Gerischer was interested in electrode kinetics and developed instruments and techniques for their study. It was he who developed the electronic potentiostat, the most widely used instrument of electrochemists. He also monitored fast electrode processes by double potential step and AC modulation. This work laid the foundation for a mechanistic interpretation of electrode reactions and had a lasting impact on our understanding of electrode kinetics. It was recognized by the newly minted Bodenstein Prize of the Deutsche Bunsen-Gesellschaft, which Gerischer and Klaus Vetter jointly received in 1953.He was appointed in 1954 to the position of Department Head and Senior Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Metal Research in Stuttgart. A year later, he received the Habilitation from the University of Stuttgart for his comprehensive study of the discharge of metal ions in corrosion. The years 1954-1961 in Stuttgart were prolific and it was here that Gerischer began his work on semiconductor electrochemistry. It began with a short note on the electrochemistry of n-type and p-type germanium; a study that grew out of a seminar on solid state physics at the university, where the recent results of Brattain and Garrett on germanium were discussed. Gerischer recognized the theoretical implications of semiconductor electrochemistry in charge transfer and its potential applications in photochemistry and photovoltaic devices. His papers considered the differentiation between Faradaic reactions of electrons and holes (1959), the theory of electron tunneling at semiconductor-electrolyte interfaces, solution Fermi levels, and densities of states. He extended his studies to metal electrodes which he studied with his electronic potentiostat (1957), to stress corrosion (1957), to hydrogen evolution and hydrogen adatom formation (1957), to fast electrode processes (1960) and to the reaction kinetics of water dissociation, which he probed by the microwave pulse method (1961).His work was recognized by his appointment as Associate Professor (“Extraordinariat”) in Electrochemistry at the Technical University in Munich in 1962-63 followed by his promotion to full professor in 1964 and his appointment as Director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. The 1964-1968 period witnessed a flurry of studies from his group on photoelectrochemistry and <b>photosensitization</b> on electrode materials such as ZnO, CdS, GaAs, silver halides, anthracene, and perylene. In 1969-1970 he was named Dean of Natural Sciences at the Technical University in Munich. Gerischer returned to Berlin in 1970 to assume the directorship of the Fritz Haber Institute, where he continued his studies of electrode kinetics, semiconductor electrochemistry, and photoelectrochemistry. After becoming Emeritus Director of the Institute, he worked with Adam Heller in 1990-1991 at the University of Texas at Austin on the rate-controlling role of adsorbed oxygen in titania-assisted photocatalytic processes.His honors and awards included the Olin Palladium Award of the Electrochemical Society (1977), Centenary Lectureship, the Chemical Society, London (1979), DECHEMA Medal, Frankfurt (1982), Electrochemistry Group Medal, The Royal Society of Chemistry, London (1987), Galvani Medal, The Italian Chemical Society (1988), and the Bruno Breyer Medal, The Royal Australian Chemistry Institute (1992).|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of viscosity on the rate of <b>photosensitization</b> of diaryliodonium salts by anthracene. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to monitor the <b>photosensitization</b> reaction in propanol/glycerol solutions of differing viscosities. As the viscosity was increased, the rate of <b>photosensitization</b> decreased in a manner qualitatively described by the Smoluchowski-Stokes-Einstein equation for bimolecular elementary reactions, coupled with numerical solution of the photophysical equations. Based on these studies, we would expect the viscosity change during polymerization to {{have a profound effect on}} the rate of <b>photosensitization</b> due to a marked decrease in the rates of the diffusion-controlled bimolecular reactions. Therefore, the rate of <b>photosensitization</b> may become extremely low after a certain degree of polymerization with further reaction arising primarily from propagation of existing active centers...|$|E

It has been found that <b>photosensitization</b> by 8 -MOP differs from <b>photosensitization</b> by toluidine blue, in that it has a temperature coefficient of less than one, and that the presence of oxygen is not necessary for, and even is deleterious to, the <b>photosensitization,</b> the psoralen being destroyed by its presence. It has previously been shown that the presence of carotenoid pigments protects the cells of S. lutea from lethal <b>photosensitization</b> by toluidine blue; {{it was found that the}} presence of these pigments has no protective effect in <b>photosensitization</b> with 8 -MOP. Studies on the lethal <b>photosensitization</b> of S. lutea with toluidine blue suggested that the primary sensitive site of the photokilling was the protein of the cell membrane, as manifested by the destruction of membrane enzyme activity and the regulation of permeability. It has been found that photokilling by 8 -MOP has no effect on these functions. A study was made on the effect of photokilling by 8 -MOP on the production of penicillin-resistant mutants as an indication of an alteration in the cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by the psoralen.
