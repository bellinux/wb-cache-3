50|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> in this variant {{constitutes}} a distinct mode of governance that differs in one fundamental way from standard assumptions about policymaking. The conventional {{model of the}} policy process that is widely taken for granted by jurists, economists, and political scientists holds that policy analysis, formulation, and embodiment in legislation precede implementation. But <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> means innovating through implementation first, and drafting universal laws and regulations later.|$|E
50|$|In a stricter {{definition}} <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> {{implies a}} policy {{process in which}} experimenting units try out {{a variety of methods}} and processes to find imaginative solutions to predefined tasks or to new challenges that emerge during experimental activity. <b>Policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> is not equivalent to freewheeling trial and error or spontaneous policy diffusion. It is a purposeful and coordinated activity geared to producing novel policy options that are injected into official policymaking and then replicated on a larger scale, or even formally incorporated into national law.|$|E

40|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} experimentation, {{the costs of}} project development consist of (i) the direct cost of running trials as well as (ii) the implicit opportunity cost of leaving alternative projects idle. Another natural type of experimentation cost, the cost of {{holding on to the}} option of developing a currently inactive project, has not been studied. In a (multi-armed bandit) model of experimentation in which inactive projects have explicit maintenance costs and can be irreversibly discarded, I fully characterise the optimal <b>experimentation</b> <b>policy</b> and show that the decision-maker’s incentive to actively manage its options has important implications for the order of project development. In the model, an experimenter searches for a success among a number of projects by choosing both those to develop now and those to maintain for (potential) future development. In the absence of maintenance costs, the optimal <b>experimentation</b> <b>policy</b> has a ‘stay-with-the-winner’ property: the projects that are more likely to succeed are developed first. Maintenance costs provide incentives to bring the option value of less promising projects forward, and under the optimal <b>experimentation</b> <b>policy,</b> projects that are less likely to succeed are sometimes developed first. A project development strategy of ‘going-with-the-loser’ strikes a balance between the cost of discarding possibly valuable options and the cost of leaving them open...|$|R
30|$|The {{governments in}} all the four {{countries}} examined in this paper — Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea — have adopted the idea and {{the language of the}} social investment since the 1990 s. In Canada, the social investment idea was publicly articulated by the federal Liberal government through the Throne Speech {{at the beginning of the}} Parliamentary Session in 1997. Over the next decade, the social investment discourses developed at both federal and provincial levels. The emergence of the social investment approach in Canada can be observed by the various <b>policy</b> <b>experimentations</b> at different levels of governments. These include the highly successful implementation of the $ 5 -a-day child care program in Quebec, the introduction of the Canada Child Tax Benefit in 1998 extending financial support to low income families with dependent children, and which expanded over the next decade, and the failed federal attempt to develop a national day care strategy in 2004. Despite the local and provincial variations, observers argue that the social investment perspective in Canada gradually led to a redesigning of “welfare architecture” over the next decade and a half as ideas and slogans such as “invest in children” became mainstreamed and social policies became increasingly oriented towards early education and learning and other forms of skills and human capital development (Jenson & St-Martin, 2003; Jenson, 2010).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{calls for}} a radical change in {{employment}} services through {{an examination of the}} tumultuous twenty year history of <b>policy</b> change and <b>experimentation.</b> With unemployment at around 5 % in Australia, there is much talk of ‘full employment’ and a focus on skills shortages. Yet, the fact remains that well over 2 million Australians are unemployed, under-employed or on disability benefits and many hundreds of thousands are capable but have little prospect of moving into secure employment under the current support arrangements. In this considered yet bold paper, Lisa Fowkes examines the tumultuous twenty year history of <b>policy</b> change and <b>experimentation</b> in employment services. Ms Fowkes brings an insider’s perspective, having for many years been a key figure with Job Futures, an extensive national network of community-based employment services. Lisa Fowkes’ essay concludes with a compelling call to end the ‘tweaking’ that has characterised change in the employment services and, for the benefit of all, to embark upon the substantial reform needed to provide the unemployed and underemployed with the dignity, security and opportunities to which they are entitled.

50|$|At first sight, <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> {{displays}} commonalities {{with what}} Lindblom characterizes as the incremental method of successive limited comparisons in making public policy: the exploratory, reversible character of policymaking and the prior reduction of political antagonisms by avoiding drastic {{change at the}} outset. Yet, under certain conditions, experimentation can transcend incrementalist tinkering with existing practices and lead to drastic policy departures and transformative change marked {{by the emergence of}} new configurations of actors, interests, institutions, ideologies, and goals.|$|E
50|$|If <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> is {{designed}} and evaluated by social scientists {{as part of}} government-sponsored pilot programs, it is usually limited to narrowly defined trial measures and preselected target groups. It often is confined to the fine-tuning of implementation technicalities (such as testing the suitability of a new social security card in a pilot site), but only very rarely to substantive policy formulation (such as the extent, focus, or budgeting of social policies) that are the object of complex bargaining processes in which tactical political considerations weigh much heavier than outside expertise.|$|E
50|$|Transformative <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> is {{much more}} {{comprehensive}} and ambitious since it strives to alter economic and administrative behavior and institutions. Such experimentation also opens up entirely new market segments and establishes new types of corporate organization, thereby regularly moving beyond the originally defined test groups and procedures and involving policymakers on different levels of the political system. Mosteller sees such “reorganization experiments” as {{the most difficult to}} carry out because they depend on a chain of complex interrelations, may require {{a great deal of time}} and resources, tend to provoke stiff political opposition, have to deal with ongoing contextual changes, and are subject to political-administrative interference and changes of the rules of the game in the middle of the experimental process. Transformative experimentation usually comes in the shape of demonstration projects taking place in a politically realistic—i.e., fluid, disturbed, and contested—context that escapes strict scientific controls, but can give a fuller view of the workings of novel policies and their impact on major social, market, or administrative actors.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015, Yohannes began a {{sustained}} effort to strengthen {{and expand the}} OECD’s work to address rising inequality. In July, he published a joint op-ed with OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria, arguing that the United States can lead a global transition towards a more inclusive model of economic growth. In October, he created a Friends of Inclusive Growth group, then leveraged his role as Chair to foster collaboration with local government and private sector leaders. Explaining his strategy, he compared rising inequality to climate change, arguing that: “in {{the case of the}} climate movement, cities, NGO’s and businesses took the lead in <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> and advocacy, laying the groundwork for action at the national level. They can do the same on inequality. They can lead a global movement for inclusive economic growth.” [...] Yohannes encouraged and supported the creation of a network of Champion Mayors for Inclusive Growth, launched at the Ford Foundation on March 29, 2016. [...] At the second meeting of Champion Mayors, he announced that he had obtained funding from the Department of State for a dedicated web platform that would strengthen collaboration between mayors and educate the public about inclusive growth. [...] Yohannes also led outreach to the private sector, hosting the launch of the OECD Initiative on Business and Inclusive Growth in November 15, 2016.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to an institutional economics {{analysis of the}} public economy by answering the following question: {{what is the role}} of intergovernmental grants in laboratory federalism? In line with factual evidence, the fiscal federalism literature on <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> hints that grants can be employed to stimulate policy innovation through trial and error learning. Yet it lacks a theory of <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> through grants, meaning that, in effect, we lack a fiscal theory of laboratory federalism. In the proposed approach, an intergovernmental grant is likened to a fiscal institution for political compromise between levels of government that frames <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> options and constraints. At the same time, since policy solutions are not always easy to find or to implement, <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> requires some degree of flexibility. Thus, the paper shows that the extent of experimentation induced by a grant is influenced (or, more fashionably, nudged) by the conditionality attached to the grant. It argues, moreover, that if a grantor would like to induce more (less) experimentation, then, all other things equal, a grant with fewer (more) conditions attached should fare better than a grant with more (less) conditions attached...|$|E

This lacuna is puzzling, for grants are fundamental policy tools for federations. We develop an approach that fills this lacuna by interpreting grants as fiscal institutions for policy innovation: <b>policy</b> <b>experimentation</b> is encouraged or discouraged depending on the degree of grant conditionality, and a simple heuristic expresses mistake-ridden learning from experimentation...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{studying}} the initialization stage of learning classifier systems (LCS) applying the Pittsburgh approach. It has a theoretical part where the covering probability of a random rule set is modelled and a practical part. The practical part has the objective of developing general initialization policies that have competent performance on {{a broad range of}} datasets. Two kinds of policies are tested: (1) ways of tuning the initialization probability of the system and (2) smart initialization operators that create rules that are generalized versions of randomly sampled training instances. The results identify a subset of settings that are robust enough to be considered candidates to be the default initialization policy. These settings have competent performance compared to several alternative machine learning systems. Beside identifying the good <b>policies,</b> the <b>experimentation</b> made is also useful to give hints about what kind of initial solutions is the system able to process successfully to create well generalized solution...|$|R
40|$|Most {{theories}} and {{experimental studies of}} choice under uncertainty focus on choices between alternatives with known probability distributions. In many real-life contexts, however, the distribution of payoffs is not known, but have to be estimated from observations of outcomes. March (1996) illustrated how such experiential learning could produce seemingly risk-averse behavior even among risk-neutral individuals. This paper formally demonstrates that a large class of learning procedures produces seemingly risk-averse behavior in situations where information about an uncertain alternative can only be obtained by choosing it. Moreover, I show that such risk sensitivity is actually an adaptive response to the trade-off in sequential choice under uncertainty between exploration and exploitation. In particular, uncertainty aversion follows even if a risk neutral decision maker would follow an optimal <b>policy</b> of <b>experimentation</b> in the socalled one-armed bandit problem. These results illustrate {{the implications of the}} costs of learning about unknown and uncertain alternatives and suggest a different interpretation of observations of a preference for a certain alternative over an uncertain alternative. They also have implications for the rationality of positive hypothesis testing strategies. ...|$|R

Orthodox interpretations hold that the current system is a US-led ‘prohibition regime’ that was constructed in an extremely repressive and restrictive manner with almost no flexibility for significant national deviations. This paper challenges these orthodox interpretive frameworks and suggests no absolute and clear dichotomy between strict adherence and ‘breaches’ of the international treaties...|$|R

40|$|Policy {{objectives}} {{often can}} be simply stated. Yet, policy implementation frequently becomes complex, not {{only when the}} problem addressed is complex or wicked, such as family violence prevention, but also when the policy is simply stated, such as raising the GST. In complex implementation, effective organisational and individual practices facilitate learning by experimentation. Practices centre on detecting anomalies and then explicitly incorporating reflections on them in ongoing design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation activities. The research drew on <b>policy</b> and <b>experimentation</b> literature to propose a new framework for describing complex implementation practices, a range of cases studies, and discussions with policy managers. Findings highlight {{the need for a}} consistent strategic view of end goals, some means for testing changes, and the capacity to identify and assess results in order to redirect effort. Support for these practices involves ensuring appropriate permission to experiment, early and sustained activity conducted outside the responsible agencies, and open access to multiple sources of expertise. Implementing agencies and the policy management system need to take every opportunity to fully incorporate learning into their understanding of the agency’s role, capability requirements, and future focus...|$|R

We show that when managerial ability ha a multiplicative impact on revenue then the first best investment policy may require the implementation of short-term projects with negative NPV in order to generate information on managerial ability that can be exploited in later periods. We also show that, when the firm is free to design the compensation scheme, the first best is attained even if only short-term contracts are allowed.
