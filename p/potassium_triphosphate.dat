40|$|Several commercially {{available}} reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were characterized with aqueous solutions of ammonium sulfate, <b>potassium</b> <b>triphosphate,</b> and mixtures {{of these two}} salts at different feed concentrations, compositions and pressures. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the rejection of these solutes, in particular the ammonium ion (NH 4 +), by different RO membranes. The aqueous solutions were assumed to come from an anaerobic digester via a process, currently under investigation by CHFour Biogas Inc., to maintain low concentrations of ammonia in the digester in order to maximize the biogas production. The ammonium ions present in the liquid produced from the process are then concentrated using membrane separation. The concentrated ammonium solution would be a valuable fertilizer that could be used by agriculture. The membranes were characterized with three models: the solution-diffusion model, the Kedem-Katchalsky model, also known as the irreversible thermodynamics model, and the Donnan Steric Pore Model (DSPM). The solution-diffusion and irreversible thermodynamics models were found to be inadequate for proper membrane characterization and the use of the DSPM model yielded membrane properties in good agreement with those found in already existing literature. The pore radius of investigated membranes ranged from 0. 39 to 0. 51 nm. The effect of pH on membrane surface charge was also studied, with the conclusion that increases in pH led to increasingly negative surface charges. This affected the transport of individual ions through the membrane due to preferential passage of the counter-ions. The effects of applied pressure on the stoichiometric nature of salt rejections were also studied. The minimal observed rejection from the range of experiments carried out using ammonium sulfate was 93...|$|E
40|$|Protease in {{polyhedral}} {{protein is}} precipitated with 0. 1 saturation of ammonum sulphate {{but that in}} silkworm tissue with 0. 2 - 0. 5 saturation. The both proteolytic enzymes display the highest activity at pH 10. 5; they are destroyed by heating at 70 ℃ for 10 minutes. The protease of polyhedral protein is inhibited by copper sulphate of high normality, chloramphenicol palmitate, chloramphenicol, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, flavin adenine dinucleotide, 8 -azaguanine, nitrogen mustard, aureomycin or potato inhibitor, and activated by copper sulphate of low concentration, urea, thiourea, cysteine or ascorbic acid.

40|$|The {{infusion}} of hyperimmune agglutinating antibodies into man or animals causes spherocytosis and hemolysis. The mechanism of spherocytosis was studied in rats given rabbit anti-rat red cell antiserum intravenously. During the 18 hr after antibody infusion, {{a time before}} the onset of reticulocytosis, hematocrits fell from 40. 6 to 27. 6 %. However, no change occurred in mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin content, or the red cell concentrations of <b>potassium</b> or adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP). There was a progressive loss of membrane constituents and membrane surface area which followed first order kinetics. At 18 hr membrane cholesterol had decreased 23. 5 %, phospholipid 26. 3 %, protein 4. 7 %, and surface area (calculated from a measure of osmotic fragility) 14. 2 %. There was no change in the per cent composition of the various phospholipids. Similar changes occurred in animals splenectomized before receiving antibody...|$|R
40|$|Adducin is a heterodimeric {{cytoskeleton}} protein {{consisting of}} an alpha-subunit and either a beta- or gamma-subunit. In rats and humans, mutation of the alpha-adducin subunit {{leads to the}} stimulation of the sodium (Na(+)), <b>potassium</b> (K(+)) -adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> (ATP) -ase activity in renal tubular cells, increased renal Na(+) reabsorption, and, subsequently, hypertension. Ouabain is a hormone that is released by the hypothalamus and, possibly, the adrenal glands. In renal tubular cells it modulates Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity and regulates natriuresis. Plasma ouabain levels increase {{with the number of}} copies of the mutated alpha-adducin allele. Rostafuroxin is a digitoxygenin derivative that selectively displaces ouabain from the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase receptor and lowers blood pressure in rats and humans. In this short editorial review, we summarize the recent experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that contributed {{to our understanding of the}} pathogenetic mechanisms that lead to hypertension associated with the alpha-adducin Gly 460 Trp polymorphism and its interaction with ouabain. We propose that a pharmacogenomic approach, as applied in an ongoing Phase II dosage study of rostafuroxin, will be a critical step in moving the adducin hypothesis from experimental and observational studies to clinical application. status: publishe...|$|R

This phase, whose composition was confirmed by ICP analysis, is isotypic with the alluaudite-like phosphates, thus it exhibits the (A 2) (A&# 8242; 2) (A 1) (A&# 8242; 1) (A&# 8242;&# 8242; 1) (M 1) (M 2) 2 (PO 4) 3 general formula. The site occupancies led to the following cation distribution: 0. 53 &# 8197;K on A&# 8242; 2 (site symmetry 2), 0. 31 Mn on A&# 8242;&# 8242; 1, 1. 0 Mn on M 1 (site symmetry 2) and (0. 62 Fe + 0. 38 Mn) on M 2. The structure is built up from infinite chains of edge-sharing M 1 O 6 and M 2 O 6 octahedra. These chains run along [10 overline{ 1 }] and are connected by two different PO 4 tetrahedra, one of which exhibits 2 symmetry. The resulting three-dimensional framework delimits large tunnels parallel to [001], which are partially occupied by the K+ and Mn 2 + cations...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{starvation}} for inositol, a phospholipid precursor, an inositol-requiring mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been}} shown to die if all other conditions are growth supporting. The growth and metabolism of inositol-starved cells has been investigated {{in order to determine the}} physiological state leading to "inositolless death". The synthesis of the major inositol-containing phospholipid ceases within 30 min after the removal of inositol from the growth medium. The cells, however, continue in an apparently normal fashion for one generation (2 h under the growth conditions used in this study). The cessation of cell division is not preceded or accompanied by any detectable change in the rate of macromolecular synthesis. When cell division ceases, the cells remain constant in volume, whereas macromolecular synthesis continues at first at an unchanged rate and eventually at a decreasing rate. Macromolecular synthesis terminates after about 4 h of inositol starvation, at approximately the time when the cells begin to die. Cell death is also accompanied by a decline in cellular <b>potassium</b> and adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> levels. The cells can be protected from inositolless death by several treatments that block cellular metabolism. It is concluded that inositol starvation results in a imbalance between the expansion of cell volume and the accumulation of cytoplasmic constituents. This imbalance is very likely the cause of inositolless death...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Scutellariae Radix {{is one of}} the {{well-known}} tocolytic Chinese herbs. Oroxylin A is isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis. The main syndrome of preterm birth is caused by uterus contractions from excitatory factors. Administration of tocolytic agents is a strategy to prevent the occurrence of preterm births. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of oroxylin A on contractions of uterine strips isolated from non-pregnant female Wistar rats (250 ~ 350 g). Contractions of the uterus were induced with acetylcholine (Ach) (1 μM), PGF 2 α (0. 1 μM), oxytocin (10 - 3 U/ml), KCl (56. 3 mM), tetraethylammonium (TEA; 1 and 10 mM), 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP; 5 mM), glipizide (30 μM), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (LNNA; 10 - 3 M), a β-receptor blocker (propranolol; 10 μM), and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin; 60 μM). The inhibitory effects of the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions by oroxylin A were antagonized with Ach (IC 50 22. 85 μM), PGF 2 α (IC 50 27. 28 μM), oxytocin (IC 50 12. 34 μM), TEA; 1 and 10 mM (IC 50 52. 73 and 76. 43 μM), 4 -AP (IC 50 67. 16 μM), and glipizide (IC 50 27. 53 μM), but oroxylin A was not influenced by Ca 2 + -free medium, LNNA, propranolol, or indomethacin. Otherwise, oroxylin A-mediated relaxation of the rat uterus might occur through opening of uterine calcium-dependent potassium channels or adenosine <b>triphosphate</b> <b>potassium</b> channel activation. This suggests that oroxylin A is the tocolytic principle constituent of Scutellariae Radix, and oroxylin A may provide a lead compound for new tocolytic drug development in the future. </p...|$|R
