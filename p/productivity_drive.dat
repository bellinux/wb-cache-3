Despite the overwhelming predictions that Labor would lose, Keating succeeded in winning over the electorate with a strong campaign opposing 'Fightback!' and a focus on creating jobs to reduce unemployment.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on original archival research and interviews with ex-participants, the research reconstructs how this project was designed and operated; its analysis is based on a capability perspective. Findings – The paper analyses the problems encountered by projects promoting labour market integration and personal capabilities in the context of a <b>productivity</b> <b>drive</b> in a contracting industry that requires the retention of the most productive workers to stave off industrial collapse. It argues that deliberative democracy offers the more effective means for co-ordinating integrated employment policies than governance strategies associated with NPM.

This thesis {{examines}} the history of discipline by considering three paths that it followed from its revival up to its institutionalization: the influence of the <b>productivity</b> <b>drive,</b> the role of trade unions and the activity of early young researchers. European Productivity Agency's Italian office Comitato Nazionale per la ProduttivitÃ  propagandised studies on management and on the effects of the industrialization on work and society. Academicians, technicians, psychologists who worked for CNP started rethinking sociology of work, but the managerial use of sociology was unacceptable for both trade unions and young researchers. So âfree unionâ CISL created a School in Florence with an eager attention to social sciences as a medium to become a new model union, while Marxist CGIL, despite its ideological aversion to sociology, finally accepted the social sciences lexicon in order to explain the work changes and to resist against the employers' association offensive. On the other hand, political and social engagement led a first generation of sociologists to study social phenomenon in the recently industrialized Italy by using the sociological analysis. Finally, the thesis investigate the cultural transfers from France, whose industrial sociology (sociologie du travail) was considered as a reference in continental Europe. Nearby the wide importance of French sociologie, financially aided by planning institutions in order to employ it in the industrial reconstruction, other minor experiences such as the social surveys accomplished by worker-priests in the suburbs of industrial cities and the heterodox Marxism of the review âSocialisme ou Barbarieâ influenced Italian sociology of work. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} historiography {{sees the}} working class as a passive bystander in the insurrectionary phase of the Cuban revolution, assuming that the real struggle was conducted by a rural guerrilla army. However, {{an examination of the}} archival evidence contradicts this view and shows that workers played a much more active role in the defeat of the Batista regime than they are normally given credit for. At the start of the 1950 s, Cuba was suffering a crisis in profitability as the world price of sugar declined. This led the employers to conduct a <b>productivity</b> <b>drive</b> backed by the full repressive force of the Cuban state. Going on strike in a dictatorship is a life or death decision and workers need to feel some confidence in their chances of survival and in the possibility of successfully gaining a result that would be in their political and economic interests. Thus, following the defeat of a wave of militantly organised strikes in 1955, significant numbers of working class militants felt of the need for armed support to enable them defend their wages and conditions. Starting from the city of Guantánamo and spreading to cover most of the island, these activists constructed an impressive, clandestine, working class organisation in alliance with the rebel army which, after several failed attempts, proved capable of calling a successful general strike in January 1959. This strike was crucial to the rebel victory. This thesis, based on primary source material found in archives and private collections in Havana, Manzanillo, Guantánamo and Santiago de Cuba, will re-examine working class participation in the Cuban insurrection of the 1950 s, concentrating on organised labour rather than the role of individual citizens...|$|E
40|$|Though the {{importance}} of coppicing {{for the conservation of}} forest biodiversity is acknowledged, little is known about flora diversity and how it may be affected by the perceptions, constraints and regulations governing how loggers choose to exploit forest resources. Building on previous research on coppiced forests in the central Italian Apennines, unstructured and structured social surveys were performed along with structural and compositional vegetation sampling to determine how the ecology of the understory flora, where most of the biodiversity is found, may be affected by direct and indirect interactions between formal rules, namely Marche Region prescriptions, and informal rules applied in coppicing management. We identified economic/logistical and ecological variables that influence change in understory plant communities, particularly focusing on specialist forest species, and we explored how commercial, private and group property (Comunanza Agraria) loggers are influenced by these variables in deciding whether a forest is suitable for coppicing. Our insights on the relationships between the human and the ecological dimensions of the coppicing system suggest that the users prefer specific forest conditions because they facilitate efficient harvesting. These conditions also happen to be compatible with the life cycle of the specialist forest species in the ground flora. The stand attributes considered to be indicators of <b>productivity</b> <b>drive</b> decision making almost independently from (but largely compatibly with) formal rules. This is true across the three groups of loggers. These attributes seem to act as determinants of the conservation of the functional diversity of understory plant species, at plot and forest patch scale. We conclude that economically viable coppicing can occur after the stumps have been allowed to regenerate and grow beyond a certain diameter. This enables understory conditions favorable to forest specialist plants to re-establish and makes the present coppicing regime compatible with conservation of the diversity of these species in the forest landscape. © 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{channelling}} of US aid funds into a {{drive to}} increase productivity was an important feature of the reconstruction of Western Europe after World War Two. Located within the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the European Productivity Agency (EPA) {{played a key role}} in organising this <b>productivity</b> <b>drive</b> between 1953 and 1962 by constructing a network of national productivity centres. As an OEEC member state, Ireland joined the EPA when it was set up. But it did not take a significant part in the Agency’s activities until 1959 when the government approval for the setting up of an Irish national productivity centre given almost a decade earlier was finally put into effect. At the EPA’s prompting, a National Joint Committee on the Human Sciences and Their Application to Industry (HSC) – probably the first body involved in providing public funding support for the creation of a social science research infrastructure in Ireland - was also set up. This working paper traces the history of the HSC. It examines the initiatives the HSC took in conjunction with EPA from 1959 to 1962, how it survived the EPA’s demise to provide support for social science research projects after becoming a component part of the Irish national productivity centre and how a radical restructuring of the national productivity centre in the early 1970 s set the stage for the demise of its role in supporting research by the end of that decade. The paper’s conclusion indicates the intended next stage of this work in progress. It also tentatively draws out the implications of this particular study for the broader understanding of how Ireland began to `open up’ its economy and society at the end of the 1950 s and of the role that direct and indirect US aid played in this process...|$|E

40|$|International {{entrepreneurship}} is {{an important}} vehicle for firms to reap benefits from their high productivity levels and from economies of scale by reaching new customers. International enterprises tend to be larger and more innovative, but a key question of causality remains disputed in the international trade and international business studies literature. That is, does innovation and <b>productivity</b> <b>drive</b> firms towards international markets or does internationalization influence firm innovation and productivity? In this thesis, six papers fill two gaps in the literature. First, small businesses are increasingly active in international trade relationships. Some small firms even become internationally active from their inception; a spectacle {{referred to as the}} “born global” firm. Often these SMEs concentrate their business activities in nearby markets and specialize to particular niches. What stands out is that these firms use international markets {{to gain access to the}} latest technologies, learn from interaction with foreign partners and obtain experimental knowledge to become more innovative. Thus, such learning by SMEs poses some difficulties for the standard models’ hypothesis that only large, productive firms venture abroad. Moreover, the standard model predicts that immediately after productivity levels are revealed, firms make the internationalization decision. However, the majority of the SMES cannot be labeled born global but becomes active in foreign markets sequentially. Second, just as small enterprises may not have direct access to recent innovations, many firms from developing countries want to internationalize in order to obtain foreign inputs and close the knowledge gap with large Western multinationals. For firms from transition economies and emerging markets that have a high learning potential, joint ventures and foreign direct investment facilitate the access to strategic assets. Moreover, international activities allow for economies of scale, induce learning-by-doing effects and give rise to new competitive pressures to enhance firm-level productivity. Taking stock, this suggests that relatively unproductive non- Western firms and SMEs purposely attempt to influence their innovative capacity and productivity by the internationalization of their enterprises. Therefore, if we consider the internationalization process as a strategy to increase productivity, the assumption of exogeneity is no longer valid as it are SMEs and firms from developing countries that are expected to experience most efficiency gains from international activities as their learning potential is the highest. These firms also have sufficient absorptive capacities. The six papers make an important contribution to understanding the mechanisms and consequences of the internationalization of the firm. Based on micro-econometric evidence the thesis provides insights in a vibrant literature in international economics and business studies on international entrepreneurship and enterprise development. In summary, the papers suggest that entrepreneurship, internationalization and innovation play an important role for economic development. The papers stipulate that there is a fruitful interplay between economics and business studies as a multidisciplinary field of research to explain both the conditions for and the impact of internationalization strategies at the firm-level. The main thesis that internationalization has a positive effect on firm performance is confirmed for small businesses from advanced economies and for firms from less developed market...|$|E

40|$|Yawata Steel Works, {{which now}} belongs to Nippon Steel Corporation, {{was the first}} large scale {{integrated}} steel making enterprise in Japan. As an enterprise owned by the Japanese Government, it started {{iron and steel making}} in 1901. The enterprise grew in size so rapidly that in the 1920 s it employed about 30, 000 workers. The Yawata Steel Works consisted of a huge complex of numerous mills. The total number of blast furnace mills, steel making mills, roll mills, repair shops, railway shops and other mills were counted as more than one hundred in the late 1920. Although individual mills had to follow a primitive production control and accounting requirements imposed by the top management, the execution of the business was largely left to mill managers. It {{is important to note that}} each mill was more or less independent of the control by the top management in its implementation of labor management. Until early 1910 s, most of the labor management in Yawata had been carried out by the mill managers who were responsible for recruitment, discharge, promotion, and pay raise of their workers. For the whole period, there existed a central labor office which was in charge of labor management in general. But the resources of the office were so limited that tasks it could perform were mainly confined to enactment of by-laws which stipulated codes of labor conditions for operators and day laborers. In order to compensate for the weak position of the central labor office and to strengthen the control over individual mills, the top management with the assistance of the central labor office made use of a stratified personnel system. While the status of top and middle management which included executive officers, engineers and assistant engineers in its fold was defined by the statutes and governmental decrees, the top management could decide the number and the status of the lower rank of supervisors. As there had always been a need with the rise of production in each mill to increase the number of lower ranks of supervisors, the top management and the central labor office could gain control over the activities of each mill through its policy as to supervisors. Thus, until the outbreak of the war in Europe, the role of the central labor office remained quite limited. But the economic boom which took place during and after the war changed the situation. The hectic economic activities all over Japan produced an acute labor shortage almost everywhere in Japan. The Yawata Steel Works was forced to raise the workers' pay, and the following inflationary pressures invigorated the workers' demand for better working conditions. After the short-lived unsuccessful strikes in February 1920, the top management implemented a series of reforms in labor management which were to change the role of the central labor offices. One of the reforms was an establishment of the works councils, the labor offices being responsible for its working. New supervisory classes mostly recruited from operators were created. The labor office began issuing a bi-monthly newspaper. As it was evident that each mill could do almost nothing in reacting to the workers' demand, the labor management by the central labor offices began to take the place of the management by individual mills. The economic depression following the post-war boom also contributed to the strengthening of the function of the central labor office. The need to raise productivity by way of restraining the increase of man-power necessarily limited the power of each mill in its recruitment activity. In case a mill manager wanted to increase the number of his workers, he was required to get a permission from the central labor office. The manning was no more regarded as a matter which only mill managers could handle. The central labor office could decide the number of workers which a mill could employ, move workers from one mill to another more easily, start productivity and safety campaigns which mobilized all the workers. The evidence as to the labor management shows that there was a clear-cut trend toward centralization within the Steel Works. But it will exaggerate the situation to say that there was no strong trend other than centralization. We cannot forget the countervailing trend of decentralization at this period. Accounting system was the case in point. In earlier period the top management controlled the activities of each mill through a centralized accounting system, but in the 1920 s and 1930 s there developed an accounting system which put more responsibility for cost control on each mill. Even in the labor management, centralization and decentralization took place at the same time. While the central labor office was responsible in checking the working of the wage systems, each mill could invent and implement a local wage system as long as it was based on the general wage policy. In the <b>productivity</b> <b>drive</b> promoted by the central labor office, each mill set up a committee including staffs and workers in order to discuss the productivity measures. The centralization in the labor management of Yawata Steel Works is important in that it became an integral part of the policy of the top management to achieve a highly integrated state of production. Before the application of Taylorism and other production techniques on a large scale which began in 1950 s, there were few methods available to the top management in coordinating the activities of each mill. The labor management by the central labor office was one of those methods which could offer an effective means of coordination. The emergence of the new way of running a giant enterprise through the centralized labor management will be also of note in its connection with the fact that from the late 1930 s to 1950 s the Steel Works made use of the centralized labor management in mobilizing workers participation in war production effort and in post war reconstruction. After the Second World War the newly established labor union organizing operators of the Yawata Steel Works held joint consultation with the management. The issues discussed was status of operators, manning policy and pay rise, all of which the central labor office had dealt with before the war. It will not miss the point to say that the centralized labor management became an institutional basis on which post war industrial relations was constructed. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the productivity}} {{performance of the}} Indian manufacturing sector using unit level data, which is aggregated at four-digit industry level for the period 1994 - 95 to 2004 - 05 for 15 major states. The study focuses on both the organized and unorganized segments of the manufacturing sector. Both partial and total factor productivity (TFP) measures have been employed to trace the productivity performance of formal and informal manufacturing sector. TFP is estimated using Cobb-Douglas production functions at the four-digit industry level. The estimation is carried out by employing the Levinsohn-Petrin method, which uses intermediate inputs as the proxy to address the potential simultaneity bias in production function estimations. Our analysis reveals that labour productivity has increased for the organized sector over time whereas both labour productivity and capital intensity growth have slowed down in the unorganized sector during the 2000 - 01 to 2004 - 05 period. The production function analysis shows that capital has played a more {{significant role in the}} production process in both the sectors. TFP growth accelerated in the organized manufacturing sector during 2001 - 05 over 1995 - 2001 while the TFP decline that started in the first period (1995 - 2001) continued unabated even in the second period (2001 - 2005) in the unorganized manufacturing sector. We also find that output growth in both the sectors is <b>productivity</b> <b>driven</b> and not input driven. The improvement in TFPG of organized manufacturing in the post- 2000 period as compared to the second half the 1990 s across most states in India and that output growth was mostly <b>productivity</b> <b>driven</b> are important positive features of manufacturing performance in the post-reform period. However, the declining total factor productivity on one hand and increasing capital intensity of the unorganized sector is a cause of worry and raises several important questions. ...|$|R
30|$|These {{challenges}} are largely similar across {{other developing countries}} and include, among others, the following problems: (1) low <b>productivity</b> <b>driven</b> by limited access to quality and affordable inputs and services, and output markets (Rao et al. 2016 b); (2) limited access to input market that heightens the cost of production, further restricting households to low-input-low-output vicious cycle (Rao et al. 2015); (3) remote and scattered location of smallholder dairy households with limited access to reliable infrastructure, which leads to higher transaction costs and presents further challenges in terms of access to input and output markets (Rao et al. 2016 a).; (4) inappropriate cattle breeds for dairy production; (5) diseases and low adoption of technologies in the dairy industry (Makoni et al. 2013); and (6) high transaction cost (Kilelu et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Between 5000 BCE and 1800, the {{population}} of the world grew 120 -fold despite constraints on the total amount of land available for production. This paper develops a model linking population growth to increasing <b>productivity</b> <b>driven</b> by random innovation and diffusion. People are endowed with a set of skills obtained from their parents or neighbours, but those skills are imperfectly applied during their lifetimes. The resulting variation in productivity leads to a distribution of income and to a process of diffusion whereby high-income activities spread at the expense of low-income activities. An analytic formula is derived for the steady-state distribution of income. The model predicts that the rate of growth of population approaches an asymptotic limit, whereupon there are no scale effects. The model also predicts that if the rate of diffusion of knowledge is increased, the growth rate will increase. ...|$|R
