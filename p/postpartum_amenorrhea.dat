Most matings occur during the maximum swelling. The gestation period is on average 240 days. <b>Postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea</b> (absence of menstruation) lasts less than one year and a female may resume external signs of oestrus within a year of giving birth, though the female is probably not fertile at this point. Female bonobos carry and nurse their young for four years and give birth on average every 4.6 years. Compared to common chimpanzees, bonobo females resume the genital swelling cycle much sooner after giving birth, enabling them to rejoin the sexual activities of their society. Also, bonobo females which are sterile or too young to reproduce still engage in sexual activity. Mothers will help their sons get more matings from females in estrus. Adult male bonobos have sex with infants.

In comparing a group of southern Mexican children subject to MMM and a group in the same region who received dietary supplements, Chavez et al. show a relation between MMM and poorer school performance; unsupplemented children showed poorer participation, greater degree of in-class distraction, more sleeping in class, and poorer performance on standardized tests. In addition, malnourished children showed poorer scores on intelligence quotient (I.Q.) tests than their supplemented counterparts. [...] Of all the aspects of human existence, sexual reproduction may have the most detailed articulation with malnutrition.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesCross-sectional {{estimates}} of contraceptive use {{do not provide}} understanding of time to postpartum uptake. This paper uses a range of Malawian data sources: a prospective study to explore time to uptake of contraception and a cross-sectional survey to assess whether sexually active postpartum women whose fecundity has returned use contraception, and whether abstaining/amenorrheic women report using contraception. Study designA demographic surveillance site (DSS) in Malawi was used to identify 7393 women aged 15 – 49 years eligible for a 1 -year prospective study of contraception using provider-recorded data on patient-held records (2012 – 2013). This provided a reliable record of time to uptake of postpartum contraception. The average timing of resumption of sexual activities after postpartum abstinence and return of menses was estimated from a population-based sexual behaviour survey in the DSS (2010 – 2011). ResultsOf 4678 women recruited to the prospective contraception study, 442 delivered an infant during the observation period. Of these, 28. 4 % used modern contraception within 6 months of delivery. However, at 6 – 9 months after delivery, only 28. 0 % women had started menstruation and resumed sexual activities; of these, 77. 6 % used contraception. Amongst abstaining/amenorrheic women, a quarter reported contraceptive use. ConclusionsThe low uptake of postpartum contraception is likely due to many women abstaining and/or experiencing amenorrhea. Self-reports of contraceptive use amongst abstaining/amenorrheic women bring into question the quality of cross-sectional surveys and demonstrate that contraceptive use by women at low risk of pregnancy could contribute to the Malawi paradox of high contraceptive use and high fertility. Given relatively low risk of pregnancy in the postpartum period in this context, a focus on long-acting/permanent methods {{may be more effective}} to avert unintended pregnancies. ImplicationsThere has been increasing interest in the utility of postpartum contraceptive programmes to assist women to space births. Our findings suggest that, although uptake of contraception is low, this is partly due to <b>postpartum</b> abstinence and <b>amenorrhea.</b> Provision of long-acting/permanent methods will be more effective for women after delivery...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three essays examining different facets of demography, ranging from an issue affecting infant mortality and two issues affecting fertility. ^ The first paper is {{an assessment of the}} role of cousin marriage in infant mortality. Previous studies indicate that children of related parents experience higher levels of infant mortality than would be the case if the mother were unrelated to the father. This study assesses the effects of consanguineous family structures on infant mortality in Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey, and Yemen. Disentangling the genetic component from other causes of death is a necessary step toward identifying the impact of inbreeding on mortality. In this paper, community effects, such as access to health care and the proportion of inbreeding in a population are considered using a fixed effects model. Results indicate that controlling for community level variables and sociodemographic, variables greatly reduces the effect of cousin marriage on infant mortality. ^ The second paper examines theoretical and methodological issues associated with data on social networks, focusing on the homophily of network partners chosen for conversations about family planning in four rural areas of Nyanza Province, Kenya. Identifying principles behind the selection of network partners is necessary to establish an association between the influence of social networks and behavior outcomes. Findings indicate that homophily based on sociodemographic attributes and personal preferences guides the composition of family planning networks and selection of network partners based on use or non-use of contraception, although expected to some extent, is secondary and less relevant. ^ The third chapter reviews the literature and data on secondary amenorrhea and its impact on fertility. Fertility models in demography account for <b>postpartum</b> and lactational <b>amenorrhea</b> but do not consider the impact of amenorrhea from other causes. Factors that have been associated with amenorrhea include age, nutrition, psychological factors, strenuous physical exertion, disease, and environmental factors. A closer look at the prevalence of acyclicity in populations before the discovery of oral contraceptives in 1960 and in developing countries today suggests that amenorrhea may be more widespread than is generally assumed and should not be ignored when assessing variations in fertility. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{maternal}} nutritional status and food supplementation ingested by the infant on {{the duration of}} <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea</b> and on {{the duration of the}} menstruating interval was examined. A significant negative association was found between the nutritional status of the mother during the 3 rd trimester of pregnancy and infant supplementation, on the one hand, and the length of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea</b> on the other hand. These associations remained significant after controlling for each other and for other potentially confounding factors for which data were collected. These results support the hypothesis that maternal nutritional status, by determining the amount of breast milk available, hence the frequency, duration, and intensity of suckling, is indirectly, negatively associated to the length of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea.</b> Furthermore, no association between maternal nutritional status and the length of the menstruating interval was found.

A majority of women in developing countries do breastfeed exclusively but for short durations, hence they may be sometimes unknowingly exposed to the risk of pregnancy if they are relying on nursing for contraceptive protection. The WHO’s Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommends the use of different contraceptives in the first year postpartum depending on whether the woman is nursing or not and the time since delivery. Some of the options available for breastfeeding women include implants, IUDs and injectables, which can be obtained only from a trained family planning provider. Since 2013, Population Council has been carrying out a study in Senegal, Nigeria, and Kenya to assess the acceptability of progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) as a new contraceptive option designed specifically for use by breastfeeding women to extend the period of lactational amenorrhea and promote birth spacing. Breastfeeding in sub-Saharan Africa is near universal with fairly long durations, a situation that increases the effectiveness of PVR. Each ring delivers a daily dose of 10 mg of progesterone and can be used continuously up to 3 months with a woman being able to continue with its use up to 1 year (four rings used consecutively). Preliminary results indicate that many women who had used the method found it acceptable and their partners supported its use. Activities aimed at having PVR registered and made available in focal countries are ongoing. Integration of family planning and immunization services for mothers and their newborns will be a key strategy in introducing PVR into targeted health care markets. Given that the use of PVR does not require extensive clinical training, it will be easier to integrate it {{at all levels of the}} health system from tertiary health facilities to community-based services. The PVR has been recently included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and the WHO’s fifth edition of the Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use which should facilitate its introduction into the public and private sectors.

Thus, fecundability at age 40 had declined to about one-third of that observed at age 30. Variability in individual fecundability was quite high.

40|$|The 'critical body {{composition}} hypothesis' (CBCH) is frequently {{used to explain}} variations in the duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea.</b> The hypothesis predicts that ovulation will not occur if fat reserves fall below a critical threshold. This paper attempts to analytically separate the CBCH from the broader concept of nutritional thriftiness on which it is based. A review of previous research on fat cell metabolism and ovulation finds no direct link between fatness and fecundity. Rather they are each regulated by lactation and mother-infant interactions associated with breast feeding. As a system which delivers available fat into breast milk and prevents ovulation only during {{the time when the}} infant is dependent on the mother, the pathways outlined here represent a nutritionally thrifty method of fertility regulation, one which maximizes reproductive success while minimizing energy investment. The cultural patterning both of infant feeding behaviors and the wider range of maternal activities which affect breast feeding suggest specific testable hypotheses to explain interpopulation variations in fertility and infant nutritional status. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOur {{recent studies}} of infant captive baboons (Garcia et al., 2008; 2009) found that infant to {{maternal}} mass was positively associated with reproductive parameters, e. g. duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea</b> and interbirth interval. Baboon mothers resumed cycling and reconceived when their infants attained a relatively consistent threshold mass, as predicted from interspecific life history theory. We suggested that the duration of investment acted as a facultative adjustment to infant growth rates, and depended on maternal physical and social characteristics, such as size and dominance rank. What was surprising was the relatively low energetic costs associated with reproduction; mothers' intake and energy expenditure measured by the DLW method (Rosetta et al., 2011) did not closely predict the time to resumption of cycling. Energy expenditure was correlated with maternal body mass both during early lactation and after the resumption of cycling {{and there was a}} relationship between maternal energy expenditure and infant growth rates; mothers with rapidly growing infants had higher energy expenditure than did those with slowly growing infants.

40|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known about the {{mechanisms}} that underlie variation in female fertility in humans. Data on this topic are nonetheless vital to a number of pragmatic and theoretical enterprises, including population planning, infertility treatment and prevention, and evolutionary ecology. Here we study female fertility by focusing on one component of the interbirth interval: the waiting time to conception during menstrual cycling. Our study population is a Dogon village of 460 people in Mali, West Africa. This population is pronatalist and noncontracepting. In accordance with animist beliefs, the women spend five nights sleeping at a menstrual hut during menses. By censusing the women present at the menstrual huts in the study village on each of 736 consecutive nights, we were able to monitor women's conception waits prospectively. Hormonal profiles confirm the accuracy of the data on conception waits obtained from the menstrual hut census (Strassmann [1996], Behavioral Ecology 7 : 304 – 315). Using survival analysis, we identified significant predictors of the waiting time to conception: wife's age (years), husband's age (49 years), marital duration (years), gravidity (number of prior pregnancies), and breast-feeding status. Additional variables were not significant, including duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea,</b> sex of the last child, nutritional status, economic status, polygyny, and marital status (fiancÉe vs. married).

Six main findings emerged: 1) Infant growth rates in our colony were higher than those reported for wild populations but comparable to those observed for food-enhanced animals. 2) The ratio of infant mass to maternal mass was positively associated with reproductive parameters, such as duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea</b> and interbirth interval. 3) Mothers resumed cycling and reconceived when their infants attained a relatively consistent threshold mass. 4) Infant mass-for-age was associated with maternal rank and, independently, with maternal mass such that females of high dominance rank and heavy females had relatively large infants at their resumption of cycling. 5) Low-ranking and lighter females had longer investment periods but smaller infants. They continued investment in infant through prolonged lactation until their infants reached a mass similar to that of high-ranking/heavy infants, suggesting that the lengthening of investment is essentially compensatory for slow early growth. 6) There was no relationship between infant growth and maternal activity budgets. In this colony, maternal physical and social factors rather than energetics contributed to differences among infants in growth trajectories, and infant growth underlies the time between successive reproductive events...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} time {{interval}} {{to the first}} birth and to the twin birth using statistical and mathematical models in two groups of mothers, those with twins and those with singletons, from the same population. We made use of a pair-matched case-control design. We treated the maternal birth cohort and parity as confounders and thus as controlled. We also investigated the sex of twin pairs as an interactive variable, employing such methods as survival curve testing and using geometric, gamma, and exponential distributions where appropriate. The expectations derived from the mathematical models yield numerical estimates of fertility components. The results suggest that unlike-sex twin-prone mothers have higher fecundity than controls when they conceive singletons. Further, fecundity appears high and unimpaired before the birth of twins. Mothers of like-sex twins experience somewhat shorter and but more variable birth intervals than corresponding controls before the birth of twins, suggesting within-group heterogeneity. Specifically, the birth of like-sex twins is preceded by low fecundity and {{a short period of}} <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea.</b> Biologically, like-sex (presumably monozygotic) twin-prone mothers have a hormonal defect related eventually to menopausal status that interferes with ovulation and perhaps with lactation. As for unlike-sex twin-bearing mothers, they probably experience a displacement of their maximum fertility potential toward early reproductive life and an extension of their menstrual life. From a methodologic standpoint, the study of the fertility of twin-prone mothers cannot proceed without estimates of the fertility components of birth intervals, as these intervals do not lend themselves to straightforward analytical interpretations by statistical analyses...|$|E
40|$|Background: Interpregnancy {{interval}} (IPI) {{offers an}} important period {{which allows the}} parturient {{to recover from the}} effects of pregnancy and to be in optimum health before the next pregnancy. Short IPI has serious health and economic implications. Objective: To determine the IPI among parturient attending the antenatal clinic of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital and the factors that determine this interval. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey involving 340 eligible women who attended the antenatal clinic. A pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain relevant information from the participants. The Chi-square and Student′s t-tests were used to determine association between predictor variables and the IPI with P < 0. 05 as level of significance. Results: The mean age of respondents was 28. 4 ± 3. 9 years. The average IPI was 14. 9 ± 8. 5 months with a range of 3 - 28 months. The incidence of women with short IPI was 65. 9 % (224 / 340). Contraceptive use, the presence of a male child, perinatal death in the previous confinement, number of living children, previous history of infertility, duration of exclusive breastfeeding, and duration of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea</b> showed significant association with the IPI. Conclusion: A significant proportion of our women had short IPI. Lack and failure of contraceptive use, absence of a male child, small family size, and perinatal death were among the factors that were significantly associated with short IPI. Knowledge of the of these factors would be of assistance to family planning counselors to understand the peculiar needs of our women and to offer appropriate contraceptive advice...|$|E

Average cycle length (`SD) was 29. 3 ` 3. 2 days in adults and 51. 4 ` 5. 5 days in adolescents. Menses appeared within 5. 1 ` 2. 1 days in adults and 4. 8 ` 0. 3 days in adolescents after the end of maximum tumescence, and lasted 6. 7 ` 3. 1 and 10. 3 ` 5. 0 days, respectively. Infant death tended to reduce the number of cycles to conception (4. 3 ` 1. 5 cycles after a surviving infant vs. 2. 6 ` 1. 0 cycles after infant death). Adolescents cycled for at least 16 months without conceiving. Implantation bleeding began 17. 5 ` 0. 7 days from the onset of detumescence, and lasted 10. 0 ` 1. 4 days.

One explanation that has traditionally been advanced to explain this is high levels of chronic social stress in subordinates, resulting from agonistic and aggressive interactions and leading to higher basal levels of glucocorticoids. We assessed the relationships among fecal cortisol levels and reproductive condition, dominance rank, degree of social support, and fertility in female mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) living in a semi-free-ranging colony in Franceville, Gabon. Lower-ranking females in this colony have a reproductive disadvantage relative to higher-ranking females, and {{we were interested in}} determining whether this relationship between dominance rank and reproductive success is mediated through stress hormones. We analyzed 340 fecal samples from 19 females, collected over a 14 -month period. We found that pregnant females experienced higher fecal cortisol levels than cycling or lactating females. This is similar to results for other primate species and is likely owing to increased metabolic demands and interactions between the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, estrogen, and placental production of corticotrophin releasing hormones during pregnancy. There was no influence of dominance rank on fecal cortisol levels, suggesting that subordinate females do not suffer chronic stress. This may be because female mandrills have a stable social hierarchy, with low levels of aggression and high social support. However, we found no relationship between matriline size, as a measure of social support, and fecal cortisol levels. Subordinates may be able to avoid aggression from dominants in the large enclosure or may react only transiently to specific aggressive events, rather than continuously expecting them. Finally, we found no relationship between fecal cortisol levels and fertility. There was no difference in fecal cortisol levels between conceptive and nonconceptive cycles, and no significant relationship between fecal cortisol level and either the length of <b>postpartum</b> <b>amenorrhea</b> or the number of cycles before conception. This suggests that the influence of dominance rank on female reproductive success in this population is not mediated through chronic stress in subordinate females, and that alternative explanations of the relationship between social rank and reproduction should be sought...|$|E
