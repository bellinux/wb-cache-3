25|$|It wasn't until Dunne {{left the}} Balloon Factory and {{started his own}} company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd., that a {{monoplane}} could be built. The D.6 was finished in 1911, with a 60hp (45kW) Green in a pusher configuration. Three A-frames supported the wing engine, pilot and undercarriage. All Dunne's tailless aircraft had swept wings with marked washout (reduction of angle of incidence) at the tips. Since sweepback placed the tips well behind the centre of gravity, they provided longitudinal (<b>pitch)</b> <b>stability</b> in just {{the same way as}} a conventional tailplane, mounted at lower incidence than the wing. The wing camber increased outwards, causing the outer leading edge to droop further. The inherent design of the wing provided some directional (yaw) stability, which was augmented on the D.6 using down-turned wingtips. The wing had wingtip elevons for control, though because of the down-turned tips these also provided some rudder-like forces. The D.6 was tested at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain in January 1911 but failed to take off.|$|E

Reeds come in varying degrees of hardness, generally indicated {{on a scale from}} one (soft) through five (hard). This numbering system is not standardized—reeds with the same number often vary in hardness across manufacturers and models.

40|$|We briefly {{summarized}} how {{to design}} and fabricate an insect-mimicking flapping-wing system and demonstrate how to implement inherent <b>pitching</b> <b>stability</b> for stable vertical takeoff. The effect of relative locations of the Center of Gravity (CG) and the mean Aerodynamic Center (AC) on vertical flight was theoretically examined through static force balance consideration. We conducted a series of vertical takeoff tests in which the location of the mean AC was determined using an unsteady Blade Element Theory (BET) previously developed by the authors. Sequential images were captured during the takeoff tests using a high-speed camera. The results demonstrated that inherent <b>pitching</b> <b>stability</b> for vertical takeoff can be achieved by controlling the relative position between the CG and the mean AC of the flapping system...|$|R

2500|$|The Feiro Dongó was {{the second}} design of Lajos Rotter in his {{collaboration}} with the brothers Gyula and László Feigl. Rotter aimed to produce a training aircraft of high aerodynamic refinement with a high lift to drag ratio (L/D) which was also stable but responsive to the controls, structurally strong, easy to land and with a good all-round view from the cockpit. An innovative wing design was a key feature. [...] The Dongó was a biplane with wings of very high aspect ratio and modified elliptical plan, thus minimising induced drag. The upper wing had an aspect ratio of 16.9, very high at the time, and both wings had a root chord of only , though the lower was [...] shorter. Both had thick airfoils. [...] The very narrow wings were claimed to provide longitudinal stability, as the centre of pressure could not move far, and further <b>pitch</b> <b>stability</b> was provided by heavy stagger, with the lower wing [...] behind the upper. The two wings were set at different angles of attack, 0° on the lower and 2° on the upper, again {{with the intention of}} improving longitudinal stability [...] To provide roll stability the upper wing had dihedral beyond a short centre section. The latter was supported by a steel tube cabane which had pairs of vertical, kinked struts, faired in the upper part, and a forward, transverse inverted-V, all joined to the upper fuselage. This structure made it possible to vary the upper wing's angle of incidence and the stagger. [...] The wings were 3-ply covered, two spar structures. [...] High aspect ratio, metal covered ailerons were mounted on the lower wings.|$|E

40|$|The {{main object}} {{of the present study}} is to {{investigate}} numerically the mechanism of aerodynamic damping of pitching oscillation in sedan-type vehicles. The transient numerical solver employed is based on the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. Whilst, the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method was used to realize the vehicle motion during dynamic pitching and fluid flow coupled simulations. Validation of the numerical method was done by comparing the flow structures obtained from the LES to the corresponding flow structures observed in the wind tunnel measurements. Two vehicle models with basic sedan-type automobile shape were created to study the influences of upper body geometry on the aerodynamic <b>pitching</b> <b>stability</b> of sedan-type vehicle. In addition, the credibility of modeling of automotive aerodynamics by simple bluff body models was verified. For the sedan-type models investigated, the trailing vortices that shed from the A-pillar and C-pillar edges were found to produce the opposite tendencies on how they affect the aerodynamic <b>pitching</b> <b>stability</b> of the models. In particular, the vortex shed from the A-pillar edge tended to enhance the pitching oscillation, while the vortex shed from the C-pillar edge tended to suppress it. Hence, the vehicle with rounded A-pillar and angular C-pillar exhibited a higher aerodynamic damping than the vehicle with the opposite A- and C-pillars configurations. The aerodynamic damping mechanism has been proposed {{based on the results of}} flow visualization on the phase-averaged flow properties...|$|R

The relationship between these forces and the attack angle allows us to examine static and dynamic stabilities. It was found that dependencies of normalized coefficients regarding measured forces acting on a circular plate are not observed in the ranges of small attack angles. The <b>pitching</b> <b>stability</b> is influenced significantly by a position of gravity center. Furthermore, an oscillation period could be also evaluated reasonably...|$|R
40|$|Conventionally, the {{pitching}} instability of road vehicles has been controlled mechanically {{through the application}} of suspension systems. The present study demonstrates how unsteady aerodynamics can be exploited for such control by properly configuring vehicle body shapes. To discern the effect of unsteady aerodynamics on road vehicle stability, large eddy simulation has been conducted to simulate the flow past simplified vehicle models. Forced-sinusoidal-pitching oscillation was imposed on the models during the simulation to probe their dynamic responses. Numerical results were compared with wind tunnel measurements for validation, and good agreement is attained. Unsteady flow structures above the rear section of the vehicles were found to significantly affect their <b>pitching</b> <b>stability.</b> Depending on the vehicle body shape configurations, the induced aerodynamic force tended to either enhance or restrain the vehicles' pitching instability...|$|R

5000|$|Tandem: {{two main}} wings, one behind the other. Both provide lift; the aft wing {{provides}} <b>pitch</b> <b>stability</b> (as a usual tailplane). An {{example is the}} Rutan Quickie.

5000|$|With a {{symmetrical}} rocket or missile, the {{directional stability}} in yaw {{is the same}} as the pitch stability; it resembles the short period pitch oscillation, with yaw plane equivalents to the <b>pitch</b> plane <b>stability</b> derivatives.

5000|$|The {{flight control}} system on the 777 is {{designed}} to restrict control authority beyond certain range by increasing the back pressure once the desired limit is reached. This is done via electronically controlled backdrive actuators (controlled by ACE). The protections and augmentations are: bank angle protection, turn compensation, stall protection, over-speed protection, <b>pitch</b> control, <b>stability</b> augmentation and thrust asymmetry compensation. The design philosophy is: [...] "to inform the pilot that the command being given would put the aircraft outside of its normal operating envelope, but {{the ability to do}} so is not precluded." ...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, a canard {{stabiliser}} may {{be added}} to an otherwise unstable design to obtain overall static <b>pitch</b> <b>stability.</b> To achieve this stability, the change in canard lift coefficient with angle of attack (lift coefficient slope) should be less than that for the main plane. A number of factors affect this characteristic.|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} {{fixed-wing aircraft}} has a horizontal stabiliser surface separate from its main wing.

50|$|This was {{the profile}} {{designed}} by Rostislav Alexeyev. The wings are significantly shorter than comparable aircraft, and this configuration requires a high aft-placed horizontal tail to maintain <b>stability.</b> The <b>pitch</b> and altitude <b>stability</b> {{comes from the}} lift slope difference between a front low wing in ground effect (commonly the main wing) and an aft, higher-located second wing nearly out of ground effect (generally named a stabilizer).|$|R

5000|$|The initial {{production}} {{version of}} the Greif, the He 177 A-1, tended to be unstable in the yaw and pitch axes during flight tests in August 1942, which would have led to poor bombing accuracy. Shortly after these tests, the third production A-1 example (factory serial number 15153, with Stammkennzeichen of GI + BN) had its fuselage lengthened by 160 cm (63 in) just aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. The modified aircraft, with the longer distance of the [...] "tail moment", showed a marked degree of improvement in yaw and <b>pitch</b> axis <b>stability,</b> enough to mandate the construction of the He 177 A-3 and all later models of the He 177 with the lengthened fuselage.|$|R
50|$|For most airfoils, lift slope {{decreases}} at {{high lift}} coefficients.

50|$|Being placed {{ahead of}} the center of gravity, a canard {{foreplane}} acts directly to reduce longitudinal static stability (stability in pitch). The first airplane to achieve controlled, powered flight, the Wright Flyer, was conceived as a control-canard but in effect was also an unstable lifting canard. At that time the Wright brothers did not understand the basics of <b>pitch</b> <b>stability</b> of the canard configuration, and were in any event more concerned with controllability.|$|E
5000|$|The front (usually fixed) {{section of}} the {{tailplane}} is called the tailplane or horizontal stabiliser and is used to provide <b>pitch</b> <b>stability.</b> The rear section is called the elevator, and is usually hinged to the horizontal stabiliser.
