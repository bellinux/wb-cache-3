40|$|Studies {{show that}} the digital divide and {{development}} are related. The use of smartphones and wireless data networks is becoming widespread in both rich and poor countries, outpacing the adoption of other Information and Communications Technologies, such as wired communications and <b>personal</b> computers. Specially, <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> is already providing a toolkit to fight the digital divide in poor countries since {{they are used to}} getting information and services about agriculture, health, and education among other areas. Many studies and experiences state the usefulness of mobile phones in the area of education in order to help achieve universal primary education. But most of these experiences have serious limitations that affect their longterm sustainability. In this line, the current paper provides a set of guidelines to define more sustainable and long-term viable mobile-learning projects and shows its applications to an m-learning project: the Moodbile project.

40|$|<b>Personal</b> computers, <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> and the Internet {{made the}} vision of {{everyone}} being networked real, at such a level of quality and speed that people could only dream of, one hundred years ago. Nowadays, another dream starts to become reality: the dream of networking everything. The limits of this everything are set only by our imagination: containers, trucks, robots, coffee cups, zebras, corals, firefighters, energy meters, etc. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) created the technological basis for all these applications by embedding sensing, processing and communication in one tiny device (the sensor node) and by executing tasks in a distributed, collaborative manner within the network. Through collaboration WSNs can organize efficiently, prolong system lifetime, handle dynamics, detect and correct errors, all with the final goal of eventually executing reliably the user application. WSNs stimulated {{a long list of}} applications from various domains, ranging from environmental monitoring to industrial processes, and even further to cognitive robotic systems or space exploration. This thesis focuses on WSN integration in industrial and business processes, and explores collaborative techniques to make WSNs more reliable, intelligent, effective and easy-to use. The specific contributions are: (1) analysis of the market potential and requirements, (2) service-oriented WSN architecture, (3) reliable multicast data dissemination protocol, (4) rule-based inference for event detection, (5) fuzzy logic distributed activity recognition and (6) mobile sensor-actuator team coordination...|$|R
40|$|Code-division multiple- access (CDMA) {{implemented}} with direct-sequence {{spread spectrum}} (DS/SS) signaling {{is expected to}} {{play a key role}} in the wireless telecommunications services such as <b>personal</b> communications, <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony,</b> and wireless networks. To gain insight and understanding of DS/CDMA system performance without actually building it first requires both analysis and simulations. In this thesis, DS/CDMA system performance analysis and simulations are addressed. Calculating the bit error probability for DS/CDMA systems is analytically difficult and computationally intensive. A simple and accurate approximation technique is applied to the calculation of DS/CDMA bit error probability under the assumption of infinite RF bandwidth. The bit error probability, expressed as a real function of a random variable, is simplified by using a technique that expands the function in Taylor series. As well, an architecture for DS/CDMA system with filters is developed and its performance measures, signal to noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER), are analyzed. This analysis investigates the effect of filtering on the performance of DS/CDMA systems using correlator receiver. Computer simulations of the system are also performed in this thesis. Simulation results of BER show a reasonable agreement with the BER obtained from analysis. This agreement justifies the approximation used in the analysis. It is also concluded from the simulations that filters with a bandwidth equivalent to twice the data rate provide a good BER results for a DS/CDMA system. compared to the BER performance of DS/CDMA system without filters (in which an infinite bandwidth is assumed) ...|$|R

Taiwan had a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> penetration of 108 % in 2002, ranking first in the world. This study analyzes this accelerated diffusion in terms of growth model and determinants of the diffusion rate. To eliminate the inherent uncertainty associated with choosing the optimal growth model, this study compares the performance of three conventional models, namely Gompertz, Logistic and Bass, to identify the most appropriate model, and to distinguish the forces driving the diffusion rate. Empirical {{results indicate that the}} most appropriate model is the Logistic model. Network externalities, which this study shows to be the same as the imitation effect in the Bass model, explain the superiority of the Logistic model. Moreover, market competition, which markedly reduces service prices, is identified as a primary driver of the diffusion rate of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> in Taiwan. Economic conditions, technological innovation and number of operators are insignificant factors.

40|$|This work {{looks into}} the {{monopoly}} associated with some telecommunication regulatory agencies inability to mandate the implementation of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) {{and its effects on}} subscribers who cannot retain their directory numbers when switching over to another service provider for reason best known to them. Many operators have claimed that Mobile Number Portability (MNP) is unnecessary and is an unwarranted expense, using assertions that the sector is highly competitive. Some mobile operators have gone to considerable trouble to make MNP difficult and have discouraged customers from exercising this right. They have suggested alternatives such as personal numbering and Universal Personal Telephony (UPT). However, these are not substitutes for MNP, but are expensive, value-added services. MNP should therefore strongly be encouraged by governments and Regulatory Agencies to recognize that Mobile Number Portability (MNP) {{is an essential part of}} the competitive framework and should be made legally binding on all operators and service providers.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} how Bangladeshi farmers interact with <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> and how they negotiate the resulting difficulties. In doing so, the paper seeks to identify how farmers integrate <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> into their daily lives, and what factors facilitate and limit their use of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The research was based on ethnographic observation, interviews and focus group discussions, collected through four months of fieldwork, conducted in two remote areas of Bangladesh. Findings – It was found that Bangladeshi farmers' use of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> is inhibited due to language barriers, a lack of literacy, unfamiliar English terminologies, inappropriate translation to local language (Bengali) and financial constraints. However, the social, occupational and psychological benefits from <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> motivate them to use and appropriate it through inventive use and adaptation. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that current understanding of usability needs to be interwoven with that about the appropriation of technology in order to develop a better understanding of the use and consequent integration of a technology in daily lives. Practical implications – The paper adds to the argument for a bottom-up approach for ICT-enabled intervention in development activities and for the <b>mobile</b> <b>telephony</b> manufacturers and network providers it contributes to understanding of the rural consumer market of a developing country.
