A polyclonal antibody prepared against the purified 31 -kDa periplasmic iron-regulated protein from P. haemolytica serotype A 1 showed that all P. haemolytica serotypes expressed similar 31 -kDa proteins with identical N-terminal sequences, whereas P. trehalosi serotypes expressed immunologically different 29 -kDa proteins with a different N-terminal sequence. Antibody to the 31 -kDa iron-regulated protein was a useful tool to distinguish similarities and differences of the iron-regulated proteins of P. haemolytica and P. trehalosi...|$|E
40|$|Iron plays {{a central}} role in {{bacterial}} infections, influencing both bacterial virulence and host cellular defense mechanisms. We investigated whether iron chelation might be of benefit in the treatment of pneumonic pasteurellosis of calves. Neutrophils obtained from calves previously treated with the iron chelator, deferoxamine, were studied for their responses to latex and opsonized zymosan by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence and to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan by superoxide generation. Treatment with deferoxamine in vivo failed to influence these in vitro measures of neutrophil oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, iron depletion with deferoxamine failed to modify the pathophysiological derangements that occurred in calves following experimental induction of pneumonia by intratracheal inoculation with Pasteurella haemolytica. These data indicate that iron chelation using deferoxamine cannot be recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy in the treatment of pneumonic <b>pasteurellosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>cattle...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mannheimia haemolytica is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} pneumonic <b>pasteurellosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep; two different OmpA subclasses, OmpA 1 and OmpA 2, {{are associated with}} bovine and ovine isolates, respectively. These proteins differ at the distal ends of four external loops, are involved in adherence, {{and are likely to}} play important roles in host adaptation. M. haemolytica is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, and the degree of OmpA surface exposure is unknown. To investigate surface exposure and immune specificity of OmpA among bovine and ovine M. haemolytica isolates, recombinant proteins representing the transmembrane domain of OmpA from a bovine serotype A 1 isolate (rOmpA 1) and an ovine serotype A 2 isolate (rOmpA 2) were overexpressed, purified, and used to generate anti-rOmpA 1 and anti-rOmpA 2 antibodies, respectively. Immunogold electron microscopy and immunofluorescence techniques demonstrated that OmpA 1 and OmpA 2 are surface exposed, and are not masked by the polysaccharide capsule, in a selection of M. haemolytica isolates of various serotypes and grown under different growth conditions. To explore epitope specificity, anti-rOmpA 1 and anti-rOmpA 2 antibodies were cross-absorbed with the heterologous isolate to remove cross-reacting antibodies. These cross-absorbed antibodies were highly specific and recognized only the OmpA protein of the homologous isolate in Western blot assays. A wider examination of the binding specificities of these antibodies for M. haemolytica isolates representing different OmpA subclasses revealed that cross-absorbed anti-rOmpA 1 antibodies recognized OmpA 1 -type proteins but not OmpA 2 -type proteins; conversely, cross-absorbed anti-rOmpA 2 antibodies recognized OmpA 2 -type proteins but not OmpA 1 -type proteins. Our results demonstrate that OmpA 1 and OmpA 2 are surface exposed and could potentially bind to different receptors in cattle and sheep...|$|E
