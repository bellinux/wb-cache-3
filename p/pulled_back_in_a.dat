500|$|... is {{a student}} at Galbadia Garden, {{one of the three}} {{mercenary}} academies in the game. He is one of the Garden's elite sharpshooters, always carrying his rifle. His Limit Break is Shot, which deals damage and inflicts status effects {{depending on the type of}} ammunition. Irvine is depicted as a cowboy, tall and fair-skinned with long brown hair that he wears <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ponytail. He also enjoys flirting with the female characters, being known as well for his marksmanship as his charm. He acts like a carefree, but misunderstood loner; however, this is merely a façade to charm women and hide his lack of confidence.|$|E
500|$|Karen Gillan {{had to wear}} a latex {{prosthetic}} stomach bump for {{the scenes}} which depicted Amy as pregnant. She claimed {{it made her feel}} more mature and act ridiculously, and cited it as her favourite part of filming the series. Arthur Darvill wore a wig for the aged Rory, which was trimmed to look [...] "more masculine" [...] and <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ponytail. The Eknodine were CGI and the scenes were simply filmed with the actors opening their mouths. The scene in which Rory hits Eknodine-inhabited Mrs Hamil with a plank was filmed first of all with Darvill missing actress Joan Linder, and then again with Linder's stunt double, whom he was allowed to hit. There was only one prop of the plank, and fortunately all the necessary shots were completed before Darvill accidentally broke it.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{appeared}} on stage wearing a floor-length white gown with micro-sequins from designer Marc Bouwer's pre-fall collection while {{her hair was}} <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sleek ponytail. She performed on a high-rise stage with a big screen spanning from ceiling to floor behind her. As she sang, the screen filled with images of U.N. aid workers {{on the scene in}} various wars, famines, and floods around the world. Following the performance, she announced, [...] "I'd like to ask everyone to make sure they're a part of August 19th... It's such a beautiful, beautiful day, and I'd like to honor the 22 people who lost their lives. God bless you all. Thank you so much for having me." [...] The music video for the song starts with Beyoncé singing the song with the U.N. audience seated in front of her, and images from recent disasters screening in panoramic view behind her. As the song progresses, scenes of globes and constellations turn up; laser lights and a small blue arrow, imprinted with the song's title, trace a path along the globe. The performance footage is also mixed with images of global volunteer efforts; as the giant screen displays globe-reaching graphics they morph into pictures of humanitarian work. The music video ends with the question [...] "What Will You Do?" [...] and offers the official website for the World Humanitarian Day.|$|E

2500|$|Lynch {{is known}} for being {{reluctant}} {{to talk to the}} media. He was fined $50,000 by the NFL for refusing to talk to the media throughout the 2013 NFL season, which inspired fans of the Seattle Seahawks to fundraise that amount. However, the fine was subsequently <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> agreement that he would be fined another $50,000 if he broke the same rule, after which he donated the money raised by Seahawks fans to pay his fine to charity. Lynch was fined $100,000 on November 19, 2014, for once again refusing to speak to the media. A few days later, after the Seahawks win over Arizona, he answered nearly every question from reporters with [...] "Yeah". On December 21, 2014, after the second Seahawks-Cardinals game, he answered nearly every question from reporters with some version of [...] "Thanks for asking" [...] or [...] "I appreciate you asking." [...] The only people to get an [...] "extended interview" [...] were Deion Sanders, former teammate turned analyst Michael Robinson, and Michael Silver, in which they discovered his reluctance came from his upbringing {{and the fact that he}} felt that he was [...] "forced to do something." [...] On January 27, 2015, during Super Bowl Media Day in Glendale, Arizona, Lynch continued the trend of declining to give detailed media interviews by showing up for five minutes, and answering every question with some variation of [...] "I'm just here so I won't get fined," [...] and the following day [...] "You know why I'm here." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{flight of}} the Macrotus is {{remarkable}} chiefly for its extreme maneuverability. The bat flies fairly rapidly on occasion, but the usual foraging flight is slow and buoyant, and more nearly silent that of most bats. In level flight Macrotus wings make a soft fluttering sound that is less sharp and carrying than the sounds made by the wing beats of most other bats. The method of landing is most interesting. The bat flies six to eight inches below the ceiling and upon the wings making a deep down stoke that is directed nearly straight forward the hind limbs and uropatagium. These movements cause the bat to swoop upward toward the ceiling and as the bat nears the ceiling the wings are <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> upstroke while the bat rolls over 180 degrees so that its back is facing downward and the long legs reach for the ceiling. Stated briefly, then the alighting maneuver consists of an upward swoop and a half-roll, {{at the end of}} which the feet wing rapidly toward the ceiling, seize it, and the wings give a final beat to steady the bat. Often these landings must require remarkably precise judgement of speed and distance, as many landings are made in the midst of a fairly closely spaced group of bats. Macrotus has two main methods of launching into flight, by dropping form the ceiling and taking flight after a short downward swoop, and by taking flight directly form the roosting place. The bat often hovers, both when foraging and when flying in its daytime retreat. Macrotus seems to hover easily, and it’s able to hover for several seconds at a time.|$|R

Malcolm and Cressida were not originally married as they believed {{it to be}} an outmoded and sexist institution that enslaved women. However, they did eventually marry in order to get their wedding gifts. They had their own pagan ceremony and wrote their own vows ("Do you, Cressida, take Malcolm to be your husband so long as you find acceptable and convenient?") ...|$|E

5|$|While {{pursuing}} the Viet Cong, a helicopter gunship from the U.S. 68th Assault Helicopter Company {{was shot down}} and crashed in the Quảng Giao rubber plantation, about four kilometres away from Bình Giã, killing four of its crewmen. On December 31, the U.S. Marines Advisory Group sent a team of four personnel, led by Captain Donald G. Cook, to Bình Giã to observe conditions on the battlefield. At the same time, the 4th Marine Battalion was ordered to locate the crashed helicopter and recover {{the bodies of the}} dead American crewmen. Acting against the advice of his American advisor, Major Nguyễn Văn Nho, commander of the 4th Marine Battalion, sent his 2/4th Marine Battalion company out to the Quảng Giao rubber plantation. Unknown to the 4th Marine Battalion, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment had assembled in the plantation. About one hour after they had departed from the village of Bình Giã, the commander of the 2/4th Marine Battalion reported via radio that his troops had found the helicopter wreckage, and the bodies of four American crewmen. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong opened fire and the 2/4th Marine Battalion was forced to <b>pull</b> <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>an</b> attempt to save the 2nd Company, the entire 4th Marine Battalion was sent out to confront the Viet Cong. As the lead element of the 4th Marine Battalion closed in on the Quảng Giao plantation, they were hit by accurate Viet Cong artillery fire, which was soon followed by repeated human wave attacks. Having absorbed heavy casualties from the Viet Cong's ambush, the 2/4th Marine Battalion had to fight {{their way out of the}} plantation with their bayonets fixed. During the entire ordeal, the company did not receive artillery support because the plantation was beyond the range of 105mm artillery guns based in Phước Tuy and Bà Rịa. They however escaped with the crucial support of the U.S. aircraft and helicopters whose rocket attacks forced the enemy to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and halted their attempt at pursuit.|$|R

Roper appears, informing Rip that if he should untie the wrong rope, all of the sticks will plunge into Maggie's body. However, if Rip should agree to a contest of survival against him, Roper would be glad to free her.|$|R
50|$|Mohun Bagan {{started the}} 2014/15 season with Subhash Bhowmick in {{coaching}} chair. However, {{poor performance in}} Calcutta League and Bhowmik’s lack of AFC A license saw Sanjoy Sen, former United SC and Mohammedan SC coach take over the reins before Federation Cup. Mohun Bagan’s Federation Cup campaign didn’t go well and they crashed out of the tournament after a 4-1 loss against Salgaocar.Before I-League started Sanjoy Sen made some important tactical changes. Pierre Boya, who was struggling as a striker was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deeper role, playing behind the lone striker Balwant Singh in a 4-2-3-1 formation. The trident of foreigners - Katsumi Yusa, Pierre Boya and Sony Norde was backed by energetic ball winners like Sehnaj Singh. Led by veteran Bello Razaq and Pritam Kotal Mohun Bagan defence was also strong and composed while young goalkeeper Debjit Mazumdar was extremely consistent in goal.|$|E
50|$|In September, 1978, {{the show}} {{underwent}} additional {{changes for the}} fifth and final season. Rhoda sported a new longer frizzy-permed hairstyle, which she kept <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small ponytail {{for most of the}} season. Ida and Martin go through a separation of their own; Martin then goes to Florida to find himself. He returns after several episodes but Ida wants to be wooed back, leading to dating and other romantic rituals between the two. Brenda and Benny get engaged to be married, with their wedding planned for later in the season (though this would ultimately not happen, due to Rhodas abrupt mid-season cancellation). Gary Levy does not return for this season; it is mentioned near the seasons start episode 3 that he has moved to Chicago. A new co-worker, Tina Molinari (Nancy Lane), joins Rhoda and Jack at the costume shop, having appeared in several season 4 episodes as an employee at Garys jeans store.|$|E
5000|$|Robbie Daw of Idolator {{commented that}} [...] "once again, the country act serves up a pop-crossover jam that should {{appeal to a}} variety of listeners, and will no doubt find a home on an array of radio format playlists." [...] Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song a four and a half stars rating out of five. He {{explained}} [...] "‘We Owned the Night’ is rootsy, something that couldn’t be said about any of the group’s previous singles. This being their third album, it was wise to take a chance sonically to avoid fan fatigue. The trio still manages to hang on to the lyrical suspense that makes their music so captivating." [...] He concluded saying [...] "This song is like Lady A with no makeup on, in beat up blue jeans and their collective hair <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ponytail. It’s a new style that’s still familiar, but sexy in its own way." ...|$|E

25|$|Chamberlain (knowing {{that his}} men were out of ammunition, his numbers were being depleted, and his men {{would not be able}} to repulse another Confederate charge) ordered his men to equip bayonets and counterattack. He ordered his left flank, which had been <b>pulled</b> <b>back,</b> to advance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 'right-wheel forward' maneuver. As soon as they were in line with the rest of the regiment, the {{remainder}} of the regiment would charge akin to a door swinging shut. This simultaneous frontal assault and flanking maneuver halted and captured a good portion of the 15th Alabama. While Chamberlain ordered the advance, Lieutenant Holman Melcher spontaneously and separate to Chamberlain's command initiated a charge from the center of the line that further aided the regiment's efforts.|$|R
50|$|Lita had a {{promising}} start {{to life in}} the Premiership, in which he netted the winner at home to Middlesbrough on the opening day, <b>a</b> game <b>in</b> which Reading came from 2-0 down to win, 3-2. He ended a goal drought by scoring <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2-2 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the first of ten goals in twelve games, as he scored away at Manchester United <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3-2 defeat, and scored again in the 6-0 home win over West Ham. He also scored three goals in two games in the FA Cup against Burnley and twice against Birmingham City. His next goal came at home to Wigan <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3-2 win, and in the next game he scored two late goals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 2-0 win away at Manchester City. Both goals came from through balls; for the first Lita hit a powerful first time shot {{from the edge of the}} box, across the keeper and into the top corner. The second was a finish when through one on one. He would have had a hat trick, but had a goal wrongly disallowed in the first half.

25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, {{stretchable}} water resistant translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated Spandex, is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors <b>pull</b> the fabric <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that a potentially dangerous incident occurred during the EVA. Once Grechko was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the airlock, Romanenko asked to look outside, so Grechko moved aside and Romanenko pushed hard against the airlock. He did not have his safety tether attached and began to float away from the station and thrash about. Grechko grabbed his commander by his untethered safety line and <b>pulled</b> him <b>back</b> <b>in.</b> (<b>In</b> <b>an</b> interview afterward, he reported he asked Romanenko, [...] "Yuri, where are you going?") Grechko felt the incident was overblown by author James Oberg to sound more dangerous than it really was. Although Romanenko's safety tether was not attached, there was still the electricity/communications umbilical that would have held him to the station. Another complication occurred when the gauges indicated no air was refilling the airlock. However, it was soon realized the gauges had to be faulty, and they safely reentered the station.|$|R

The bat often hovers, both when foraging and when flying in its daytime retreat. Macrotus seems to hover easily, and it’s able to hover for several seconds at a time. These bats usually forage within three feet of the ground and often drop down closer to the ground nearer the surface where they can occasionally hover for a few seconds. Even bats released in the daytime flew fairly close to the ground. Leaf-nosed bats seem to be totally insectivorous, and their food clearly reflects the bats’ foraging habits. Some insects regularly eaten by Macrotus are almost certainly taken from the ground or from vegetation. The bats’ stomachs often contain orthopteran insects, noctuid moths and caterpillars, and beetles of the families Scarabaeidae and Carabidae, along with unidentified material. The lists of food items of Macrotus contain a plethora of insects that seldom fly, are flightless, or that fly in the daytime; this constitutes strong evidence that this bat consumes insects that are on the ground or on vegetation. Most leaf-nosed bats forage sometime between one hour after sundown and four hours after sundown, and then retire to a night roosting place. Actually, each bat seems to have a pre-midnight foraging period of roughly one hour. The greatest activity in the early morning seems to occur between two and one half hours before sunrise and thirty minutes before sunrise. Bats generally begin returning with full stomachs to their daytime roosts about two hours before sunrise, and the last bats usually return approximately twenty minutes before sunrise.|$|R
