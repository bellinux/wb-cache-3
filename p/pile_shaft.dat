40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are used}} extensively {{around the world}} to support both inland and offshore structures, including important structures such as nuclear plants and oil drilling platforms. Pile foundations are known to resist higher compression and uplift loading as compared to shallow foundations. The common factor in resisting the compression and the tensile loading is the friction, which takes place between the pile and the soil. Pile foundations can be categorized as bored and driven piles. Bored piles installed in sand are known to provide relatively low capacity as compared to driven piles under the same condition. This is due the effect of the pile driving process. The estimation of the shaft resistance of driven piles remains empirical at best. The changes in the in situ stress levels as a result of pile installation are quite often overestimated/underestimated leading to unsafe/uneconomic design of the foundations. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the changes in the in situ stresses during the pile driving process, and accordingly to predict the pile capacity. In order to achieve these objectives, numerical model is developed to simulate the process of pile installation and link the cavity expansion to the pile installation and pile diameter. During this research program the changes in the soil mass due to pile installation will be recorded. Furthermore, the changes of the OCR around the pile will be examined and its effects on the earth pressure acting on the <b>pile's</b> <b>shaft</b> will be evaluated.

40|$|Shallow {{geothermal}} heat exchangers integrated in structural pile foundations {{have the capability}} of being an efficient and costeffective solution to cater for the energy demand for heating and cooling of built structures. However, limited information {{is available on the}} effects of temperature on the geothermal energy pile load capacity. This paper discusses a field pile test aimed at assessing the impact of thermomechanical loads on the shaft capacity of a geothermal energy pile. The full-scale in situ geothermal energy pile equipped with ground loops for heating/cooling and multilevel Osterberg cells for static load testing was installed at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia in a sandy profile. Strain gauges, thermistors, and displacement transducers were also installed to study the behavior of the energy pile during the thermal and mechanical loading periods. It has been found that the <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> capacity increased after the pile was heated and returned to the initial capacity (i. e., initial conditions) when the pile was allowed to cool naturally. This indicated that no losses in <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> capacity were observed after heating and cooling cycles.

40|$|AbstractThe {{calculation}} {{equation of}} large diameter bored pile's effective length {{is connected with}} its distribution of <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance. Thus, {{there is a great}} difference between the calculation results under the different distributions of <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance. Primarily, this paper summarizes the conceptualized mode of <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance under the circumstance that the soil surrounding the piles presents different layer distributions. Secondly, based on Mindlin's displacement solution and in consideration of the effect of pile diameter, the calculation equation is optimized with the assumption that the <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance has a parabolic distribution. The influencing factors are analyzed according to the calculation result of effective pile length. Finally, combined with an engineering example, the calculation equation deduced in this paper is analyzed and verified. The result shows that both the Poisson ratio of soil and pile diameter have impacted the effective pile length. Compared with the Poisson ratio of soil, the effect of pile diameter is more significant. If the pile diameter remains the same, the effect of the Poisson ratio of soil to the effective pile length decreases as the ratio of pile elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. If the Poisson ratio of soil remains the same, the effect of the pile diameter to the effective pile length increases as the ratio of pile elastic modulus and soil share modulus increases. Thus the optimized calculation result of pile effective length under the consideration of pile diameter effect is more close to the actual situation of engineering and reasonably practicable...|$|E

Geotechnical engineers face a great challenge when they build on/in collapsible soil. Inundation of collapsible soil may take place due to surface running water or raising the groundwater level. In case of surface water, the amount of settlement varies, depending {{on the extent of}} the wetting zone and the degree of saturation in the soil.

In Hong Kong practice, termination of pile driving is often based on dynamic formula and pile tips are normally embedded in a stratum with SPT-N values exceeding 200. On the other hand, installation of jacked piles ceases when the rate of penetration is less than some prescribed termination criterion and jacked piles are normally embedded in layers with SPT-N values of less than 160. As such bearing stratum is less stiff, the load transfer mechanism and capacity of jacked piles could be very different from driven piles and experience from the latter may not be directly applicable. To investigate the behaviour of such piles, a comprehensive study was conducted. In the study, six piles were instrumented with strain gauges and load tested to failure so allowing their load transfer mechanism to be studied. During installation the development of pore pressure around three of the test piles was monitored by electronic piezometers.
