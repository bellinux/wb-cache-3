A similar increase, often called the paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME), was observed before in various superconductors and superconductor/ferromagnet systems. To explain the <b>PME</b> <b>effect</b> in the presented S/F bilayers a model based on a row of vortices located at the S/F interface is proposed. According to the model the magnetic moment induced below Tc consists of the paramagnetic contribution of the vortex cores and the diamagnetic contribution of the vortex-free region of the S layer. Since {{the thickness of the}} S layer is found to be 3 - 4 times less than the magnetic field penetration depth, this latter diamagnetic contribution is negligible.

40|$|Abstract—The recent {{disappearance}} of the aquatic plant Egeria densa, a Brazilian native invasive species, from a wetland in southern Chile prompted several efforts to unveil {{the origin of this}} phenomenon. Because these changes occurred by the time a newly built pulp mill started its operations in the area, a reasonable doubt for a cause–effect relationship is plausible. We implemented a mesocosm approach to directly evaluate the effect of treated pulp mill effluents (PMEs) on several growth-related parameters of E. densa as well as other primary producers. We hypothesize that effluent, at a dilution similar to that detected in the zone of the wetland where the negative environmental impacts were evident, has a significant negative effect on this aquatic plant as well as on other primary producers inside a mesocosm system. After a prolonged (months) exposure to both 0 % PME with pure river water and a 4 to 5 % (v/v) dilution of treated <b>PME,</b> no <b>effect</b> on E. densa was measured. Furthermore, plants exposed to effluent exhibited a significantly greater general growth rate.

40|$|The superconducting {{transition}} region in a Nb disk showing the paramagnetic Meissner <b>effect</b> (<b>PME)</b> {{has been investigated}} in detail. From the field-cooled magnetization behavior, two well-defined temperatures {{can be associated with}} the appearance of the PME: T_ 1 (< T_c) indicates the characteristic temperature where the paramagnetic moment first appears and a lower temperature T_p (< T_ 1) defines the temperature where the positive moment no longer increases. During the subsequent warming, the paramagnetic moment begins to decrease at T_p and then vanishes at T_ 1 with the magnitude of the magnetization change between these two temperatures being nearly the same as that during cooling. This indicates that the nature of the PME is reversible and not associated with flux motion. Furthermore, the appearance of this paramagnetic moment is even observable in fields as large as 0. 2 T even though the magnetization does not remain positive to the lowest temperatures. Magnetic hysteresis loops in the temperature range between T_ 1 and T_p also exhibit a distinct shape that is different from the archetypal shape of a bulk type-II superconductor.

40|$|The {{paramagnetic}} Meissner <b>effect</b> (<b>PME)</b> {{is observed}} in small superconducting samples, {{and a number}} of controversial explanations of this effect are proposed, but there is as yet no clear understanding of its nature. In the present paper PME is considered on the base of the Ginzburg-Landau theory (GL). The one-dimensional solutions are obtained in a model case of a long superconducting cylinder for different cylinder radii R, the GL-parameters κ and vorticities m. Acording to GL-theory, PME is caused by the presence of vortices inside the sample. The superconducting current flows around the vortex to screeen the vortex own field from the bulk of the sample. Another current flows at the boundary to screen the external field H from entering the sample. These screening currents flow in opposite directions and contribute with opposite signs to the total magnetic moment (or magnetization) of the sample. Depending on H, the total magnetization M may be either negative (diamagnetism), or positive (paramagnetism). A very complicated saw-like dependence M(H) (and other characteristics), which are obtained on the base of self-consistent solutions of the GL-equations, are discussed.

Using this approach to calculate the acoustic-perceptual distance between different stimuli, PME was detected: (1) rated goodness, decreased as acoustic-perceptual distance relative to the prototype increased, and (2) equally spaced items far from the prototype were less frequently generalised than equally spaced items in the neighbourhood of the prototype.

Moreover, this effect shows a strong and anomalous relaxation, such that the paramagnetic moment increases {{as a function of the}} time. The anisotropy of the high-field paramagnetic moment depends on the sample microstructure, suggesting that pinning by the Y 2 BaCuO 5 particles plays a crucial role in the explanation of this effect in the melt-processed YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 materials...|$|R
40|$|Natural killer (NK) {{cells are}} the primary {{effector}} cells of the innate immune system and have well-established roles in tumor rejection and resistance to viruses, bacteria and certain parasites. There {{is a need for}} more specific immune modulators of NK cell activity that tack the wide-ranging side effects of NK cell-stimulatory interleukins. The polycationic antibiotic polymyxin B (PMB) has been shown to have a unique ability to enhance activities of some immune cells, independent of its antibiotic properties. Here we report that both PMB and its analog potymyxin E (PME) markedly enhanced the activity of NK cells enriched from the murine spleen. Maximal activation of NK cell activity was obtained after 24 h of incubation with PMB at a dose of 300 mu g/ml. PMB nonapeptide, one of the two PMB domains, and PME methanesulfonate, the negatively charged derivative of <b>PME,</b> had little <b>effect</b> on NK cell activity. PMB induced interferon (IFN) -gamma and tumor necrosis factor-a production in NK cells. Proliferation of NK cells in vitro was significantly stimulated by being incubated with PMB. Administration of PMB to mice for 7 consecutive days stimulated splenic NK cell activity and increased NK cell populations in the spleen. These results suggest that the polycationic antibiotics PMB and PME may up-regulate innate and adaptive immune responses by induction of NK cell activity and IFN-gamma production. </p...|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive {{magnetic}} field sensing using optically - detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond {{was used to}} study spatial distribution of the magnetic induction upon penetration and expulsion of weak {{magnetic field}}s in several representative superconductors. Vector magnetic fields were measured {{on the surface of}} conventional, Pb and Nb, and unconventional, LuNi$_ 2 $B$_ 2 $C, Ba$_{ 0. 6 }$K$_{ 0. 4 }$Fe$_ 2 $As$_ 2 $, Ba(Fe$_{ 0. 93 }$Co$_{ 0. 07 }$) $_ 2 $As$_ 2 $, and CaKFe$_ 4 $As$_ 4 $, superconductors, with diffraction - limited spatial resolution using variable - temperature confocal system. Magnetic induction profiles across the crystal edges were measured in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) conditions. While all superconductors show nearly perfect screening of magnetic fields applied after cooling to temperatures well below the superconducting transition, $T_c$, a range of very different behaviors was observed for Meissner expulsion upon cooling in static magnetic field from above $T_c$. Substantial conventional Meissner expulsion is found in LuNi$_ 2 $B$_ 2 $C, paramagnetic Meissner <b>effect</b> (<b>PME)</b> is found in Nb, and virtually no expulsion is observed in iron-based superconductors. In all cases, good correlation with macroscopic measurements of total magnetic moment is found. Our measurements of the spatial distribution of magnetic induction provide insight into microscopic physics of the Meissner effect...|$|R
