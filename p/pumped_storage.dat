5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as much as}} another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, environmental constraints and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited {{it is unlikely that the}} full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E

40|$|The {{necessity}} {{of the development}} of new <b>pump</b> <b>storage</b> HPP in the Republic of Macedonia, mostly {{in the context of the}} liberalization of the energy market, was considered as a priority in the country’s energy policy due to the following reasons: (1) Macedonia has favorable topography and geology for construction of <b>pump</b> <b>storage</b> HPP, (2) Favorable geographical position and sufficient regional electricity interconnections, especially with countries with dominant thermal power generation, and (3) Large potential for inclusion of newly developed renewable energy sources with stochastic nature of generation, in particular PV, wind, solar and small HPP. Although, the technical feasibility for the development of <b>pump</b> <b>storage</b> HPP was proven, the past feasibility analyses questioned their economic viability and led to somehow wrong conclusions that the Macedonian Power System itself is well balanced even without any <b>pump</b> <b>storage</b> HPP. However, taking into account the above mentioned reasoning, nowadays new opportunities emerged for investigation and construction of these power projects. The aim of this paper is to give a general outlook of the several possible sites for development of <b>pump</b> <b>storage</b> HPP in Macedonia, and to briefly discuss one of them as the most promising site...|$|R

Paton was retained by the World Bank once more in 1967 to supervise the construction of the Tarbela Dam in Pakistan, which was completed in 1976.

In order to evaluate these investments correctly the peculiarities of <b>pump</b> <b>storage</b> plants and the characteristics of liberalized power markets have to be considered. The main characteristics of power markets are the strong power price volatility and the occurrence of prices spikes. In this article a valuation model is developed capturing these aspects using power price simulation, optimization of unit commitment and capital market theory. This valuation model is able to value a future price-based unit commitment planning that corresponds to future scope of actions also called real options. The resulting real option value for the <b>pump</b> <b>storage</b> plant is compared with the traditional net present value approach.

25|$|At {{times of}} low {{electrical}} demand, excess generation capacity {{is used to}} pump water into the upper reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating electricity. Reversible turbine/generator assemblies act as a combined pump and turbine generator unit (usually a Francis turbine design). In open-loop systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows, while pump-back plants utilize a combination of <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river. Plants that do not use pumped-storage {{are referred to as}} conventional hydroelectric plants; conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as <b>pumped</b> <b>storage</b> by deferring output until needed.|$|E
