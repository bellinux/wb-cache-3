50|$|Defined benefit {{pension plans}} will offer {{various types of}} benefit {{according}} to the mode by which the employee leaves the employer. For example, if the employee remains in employment until his retirement age, then he may be entitled to a pension, often calculated by reference to his average salary in the period running up to their exit. The pension might be payable {{for the remainder of}} his life, and when he/she dies, at a reduced rate to his/her spouse for the remainder of his/her life. But if he leaves service before being entitled to a pension, he might receive a benefit such as a return of contributions, or a deferred pension payable from normal retirement age, depending on length of service. In many cases, defined benefit pension plans are funded and hold assets in order to meet those promised benefits. A defined benefit pension plan {{is an example of a}} <b>post-employment</b> <b>benefit</b> plan.|$|R

By choosing carefully how the nominal discount rate used for the liability is decomposed into real rates and inflation, I illustrate that the true exposure to an OPEB plan is {{to the spread of}} medical care inflation above (or below) the overall inflation rate. The implication is that an effective immunization strategy exists that can eliminate most of the volatility in the OPEB account...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{story about}} a union and a private sector {{employer}} who repeatedly negotiated collective bargaining agreements which referenced side contracts which provided retirees with <b>post-employment</b> healthcare <b>benefits.</b> In the early decades of their relationship neither the union nor the employer appear to have given any thought to whether or not these retiree health benefits in fact vested—i. e. were promised to retirees at no cost for the remainder of their lives. By the 1980 s and certainly the 1990 s however, as health care costs soared and life expectancy expanded, both parties continued to regularly re-negotiate agreements that were silent as to this critical term. With time, predictably enough, the employer decided to eliminate this increasingly expensive benefit; the union objected vigorously on the ground that the benefit was promised to current retirees “for life” and could not be unilaterally terminated. Recently, in M 2 ̆ 6 G Polymers v. Tackett, the Supreme Court considered the effect of this silence and unanimously concluded that courts should not construe ambiguous contract provisions in order to create lifetime promises especially in the context of labor contracts where obligations typically cease when the agreement terminates. This paper attempts to assess the Court’s decision and to understand why both parties, in the face of increasing cost pressure, came to the same strategic conclusion during the course of bargaining over many years—i. e. that silence was preferable to an explicit commitment...|$|R

40|$|Most {{state and}} local governments provide employer-sponsored {{healthcare}} benefits to their retirees. In recent years, the Affordable Care Act and accounting changes adopted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board have introduced new choices and challenges for public employers. As {{state and local}} governments look to reduce their unfunded retiree healthcare obligations, some have created dedicated trusts {{to take advantage of the}} immediate accounting benefits and the long-term savings that prefunding offers, while others have chosen to shift retirees onto the newly available public exchanges. In light of the new regulatory requirements and the evolving case law on plan modification, this article reviews the changes to the form and financing of retiree health benefits. The analysis suggests that in the long term, the expanded access to health insurance through the public exchanges, the federal subsidies upheld by King v. Burwell, and the prefunding efforts spurred by the new accounting rules should leave participants and taxpayers with greater clarity about the security and the cost of <b>post-employment</b> <b>benefits...</b>|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{financial}} accounting pedagogy {{has been criticized}} for its excessive concentration on extant authoritative rules and preparer-oriented mechanics. An alternative decision-oriented pedagogy would emphasize the economic consequences of {{financial accounting}} choices, analyze the role of accounting information within a broader economic, legal and political context, and consider emerging issues that remain authoritatively unresolved. This article illustrates a decision-oriented accounting pedagogy for the treatment of the other <b>post-employment</b> <b>benefits</b> (OPEB) issues. This article has two primary objectives. First, it provides a source for relevant economic, legal, and accounting background information and a set of decision-oriented, conceptually-motivated cases and topics for class discussion. Second, it uses the OPEB topic to illustrate the general pedagogic principle of addressing accounting issues from a decision-oriented rather than a preparer-oriented perspective. This approach could be equally useful for the treatment of a variety of accounting related topics, including asset reversions from defined benefit pension plan terminations and curtailments, corporate restructurings and downsizings, or employee stock options and deferred compensation agreements...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Beginning {{in fiscal}} year 2008, many {{state and local governments}} will begin {{reporting}} the costs of paying for nonpension retiree benefits on their financial statements in response to new accounting standards issued by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). These costs are referred to as other <b>post-employment</b> <b>benefits</b> (OPEB), with retiree health care representing the single largest component. The challenge facing state and local governments in meeting OPEB liabilities stems largely from the unplanned (and accelerating) increases in health care costs. Recent estimates suggest that state and local governments have OPEB liabilities of between $ 600 billion and $ 1. 6 trillion, and virtually all of this is unfunded. The historical method of using a “pay-as-you-go” system to meet retiree OPEB costs (where current revenues pay for these costs) would crowd out spending on other key government functions. This will be a particular challenge to governments that face both underfunded pension and OPEB liabilities...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{financial}} market returns and low long-term real {{interest rates in}} recent years have created challenges for the sponsors of defined benefit pension schemes. At the same time, lower payroll tax revenues in a period of high unemployment, and rising fiscal deficits in many advanced economies as economic activity has fallen, are also testing the sustainability of pay-as-you-go public pension schemes. Amendments to pension accounting rules that require corporations to regularly report the valuation differences between their defined benefit pension assets and plan liabilities on their balance sheet have made investors more aware of the pension risk exposure for the sponsors of such schemes. This paper sheds light on what effects these developments are having on the design of occupational pension schemes, and also provides some estimates for the <b>post-employment</b> <b>benefits</b> that could be delivered by these schemes under different sets of assumptions. The paper concludes by providing some policy perspectives. funds, service cost, contribution rates, mortality rates, long-term real interest rates, real wages, sovereign liabilities, pay-as-you-go schemes...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to analyze}} <b>post-employment</b> <b>benefits</b> {{provided}} by multinational firms, focusing on retirement advantages and pension systems in Romania and Serbia from a comparative empirical perspective. Economic literature highlights the essential {{role played by}} pension schemes in assuring a proper level of income after retirement, thus reducing poverty and increasing productivity, with significant positive implications upon overall economic activity. our research is based on developing several double-log fixed and random effects models, {{as well as a}} dynamic and distributed lags model, using a panel structure over the 2005 - 2013 period and a complex set of indicators (national accounts - GDP total and per capita; labor market - employment, unemployment, productivity, earnings; secondary and tertiary education; pension specific data - general beneficiaries, old age and survivor pensioners, total and by gender, and pension expenses as percentage of GDP). The results show that pensions represent an incentive for employees leading to an increase in resource productivity. At the same time, old age pensions are positively shaping economic growth and employment for the two countries considered, significantly reducing the poverty rate for pensioners. Nevertheless, the two pensions systems are modelled by the economic activity, educational background of employees, {{as well as by the}} level of net earnings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of deferred tax assets and liabilities for a sample of large U. S. corporations between 1993 and 2004 and documents substantial heterogeneity in the deferred tax positions of different firms. In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net deferred tax assets and 48 reported net deferred tax liabilities. Firms differ substantially in the composition of their deferred tax assets and liabilities. The largest components of deferred tax assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and <b>Post-employment</b> <b>Benefits.</b> The largest components of deferred tax liabilities are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total deferred tax assets for sample firms with net deferred tax assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while total deferred tax liabilities for sample firms with net deferred tax liabilities were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net deferred tax assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of deferred tax assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement. We use data on the sales, market value, and assets of sample firms, relative to aggregate data for the U. S. corporate sector, to estimate the aggregate value of deferred tax assets and liabilities...|$|E

40|$|This report, a first-of-its-kind effort, {{provides}} data {{on state}} Other <b>Post-Employment</b> <b>Benefits</b> (OPEB) liabilities—the cost in today's dollars of benefits {{to be paid}} to current workers and retirees over future years—and funding trends and how they are affected by aspects of state retiree health plans. All states, with the exception of Idaho, offer newly hired public workers access to certain retiree health care coverage as part of their benefits package. 1 Thirty-eight of these states have committed to making contributions toward health care premiums for such coverage. Retiree health coverage for these state government workers stands {{in sharp contrast to the}} private sector, where the proportion of firms with 200 or more workers offering health coverage to retirees has plummeted from 66 percent in 1988 to 28 percent in 2013. 2 Rising health care costs, changes in accounting standards for reporting the cost of retiree health benefits, competition from overseas firms and small startup companies, and the addition of prescription drug coverage to the Medicare program have contributed to this drop in private sector retiree health benefits. And although facing many of these same circumstances, most states continue to offer health benefits to their retired public workers, in an effort to help attract and retain a talented workforce. 3 One of the most significant changes for the states was an adjustment the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) made to accounting standards that requires states to report liabilities for retiree benefits other than pensions—known as other <b>post-employment</b> <b>benefits</b> (OPEB) —in their financial statements. (See "Glossary" box.) 4 By December 2008, all state governments were required to implement these changes, and the increased financial transparency that resulted prompted states to take a closer look at OPEB obligations and how to fund and pay for them. 5 Retiree health insurance benefits account for the majority of states' OPEB obligations, so many states have implemented policy changes concerning these benefits to address looming OPEB obligations. 6 As a result, most states provide varying levels of retiree benefits based on factors such as date of hire, date of retirement, or vesting eligibility. (See Appendices A and D for more information about which groups of retirees were included in this study and why.) This report, a first-of-its-kind effort, provides data on state OPEB liabilities—the cost in today's dollars of benefits {{to be paid to}} current workers and retirees over future years—and funding trends and how they are affected by aspects of state retiree health plans. Researchers collected and analyzed updated OPEB financial data and trends since 2010, as well as 50 -state data on the eligibility criteria for retiree health plans. (To convey more clear and consistent trends, we report 50 -state OPEB data only since 2010, because many states were adjusting to newly implemented GASB reporting standards in 2008 and 2009.) They found that states' strategies for addressing OPEB liabilities vary greatly and that the methods states choose to contribute to their retirees' health insurance premiums substantially affect the size of their OPEB liabilities...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. (International Accounting) <b>Post-employment</b> <b>benefits</b> under IAS 19 include {{defined benefit}} plans (DBP’s) and defined {{contribution}} plans. The accounting for defined contribution plans is fairly straightforward, since accrual accounting is applied and the employer entity’s legal or constructive obligation {{is limited to the}} amount the employer entity agrees to contribute to the defined contribution plan. In contrast, the accounting for DBP’s is complicated and provides a promise/guarantee of future benefits and the investment and actuarial risk of the plan lies with the employer entity. The literature review indicated that accounting and presentation of DBP’s is complicated because of the long-term nature of the liability/asset that is raised for the plan. There are many uncertainties involved in estimating the liability as this involves looking into the future and making estimates and assumptions about the future. The literature also indicated factors such as the market performance of assets, and inaccurate or unrealistic assumptions and decisions that delay making payments to DBP’s affects the funding status. Actuaries and accountants differ somewhat in the roles they play in determining the amount for DBP’s, with accountants choosing the accrued benefit method. The problem with DBP’s is that they are of a long-term nature and require estimates and assumptions to be made in calculating the DBP liability/asset. The long-term nature affects the adequacy of the liability/asset recognised for DBP’s and the related disclosure in the financial statements of large listed companies. The objective of the minor dissertation is to perform a content analysis on the presentation and disclosure of DBPs in the financial statements of a sample of Johannesburg Stock Exchange listed companies in South Africa. The research approach applied includes a broad assessment of the current status of DBP’s and defined contribution plans operated by the top 40 Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed companies, followed by a quantitative and qualitative assessment on the disclosures provided by these companies’ financial statements...|$|E
