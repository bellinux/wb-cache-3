The development of independent living and <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> is also encouraged. The college is divided into several different areas of study. These include Leisure, Therapies and Sport (including courses and qualifications in massage, complementary therapies, and sport treatment and management); Music, Media, Performance and Art (including courses and qualifications in music technology, media and art); Information and Communication Technology (including courses and qualifications in office skills and the European Computer Driving Licence); Business, Administration and Customer Service; Secondary level qualifications– General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A-Level) qualifications in subjects such as English, mathematics, French and psychology; and Braille reading. On top of academic and vocational study students are also taught to develop independence and mobility skills for day-to-day living.

However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the whip election, 167–78.

2500|$|The captivity storylines took a {{different}} route by using the characters of Ziva and Michael Rivkin to symbolize the [...] "two Israels American policy makers have faced over the years". Ziva is [...] "the cooperative and quiet Israeli, who has the technical and <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> to be of enormous assistance in achieving the mission" [...] while Rivkin is [...] "bright and pro-American, {{but in this case}} tough, aggressive, thinks he knows {{what is best for the}} United States better than the Americans, is sly and wily, and he doesn't heed the advice of his American counterparts". Both are received differently by the American agents—Ziva is respected and trusted by her colleagues; Rivkin is an object of suspicion. Steven L. Spiegel, Director of the Center for Middle East Development and Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), drew parallels between their interactions with their American counterparts and those of prominent Israeli politicians. Ziva, he reasoned, could be likened to Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, or Ehud Olmert in that she is able to agree with the American agencies on a more basic, fundamental level. Rivkin, he continued, was more like Yitzhak Shamir.|$|E
2500|$|... 2010 was {{the year}} that saw Potter {{surrender}} to his critics and leave St Helens. Criticisms from club legends like Paul Sculthorpe and Sean Long regarding his <b>personal</b> <b>skills</b> with the fans, {{as well as the}} continued fan rejection saw him let his contract run out and, initially, seek a job in the NRL, but eventually, and perhaps surprisingly, join Bradford on a two—year contract. Names like Royce Simmons, Mal Meninga, and assistant coach Kieron Purtill, were linked with the job for 2011. Simmons was the chosen man for the job, as announced on 22 July 2010. The 2010 season would also see legendary hooker and captain Keiron Cunningham retire from the game after 17 years with his one and only club. However, Cunningham would not be leaving without leaving a lasting legacy on the club. A life—like bronze statue of Cunningham was built and placed on display in the town, before being transported to the clubs new stadium upon its construction in 2012. He would additionally take up a coaching role with the academy, as well as a strength and conditioning role with the first team. In light of these decisions, neither Cunningham nor Potter halted their personal and the St Helens team quest for success; shown by their 10th successive semi—final appearance in the Challenge Cup. However, Saints failure to perform on the big stage was once more shown, going down in this semi—final by 32—28. Defeating Huddersfield in the qualifying semi—final in the 2010 play-off series by 42—22 not only saw Saints qualify for their fifth Grand Final in five years, but also saw the final ever game to be played at Knowsley Road. Fittingly, Cunningham snatched the final ever try at the famous old ground in typical fashion from dummy—half. However, for the fourth year running, St Helens once more proved flops in the Grand Final. One of the finest finals of the Super League era was anticipated, but the flamboyant Saints that the fans saw so rarely under Potter once more failed to materialise, and, in front of a near sell—out crowd of 71,526, they fell to a 22—10 loss to rivals Wigan. It was not the romantic finish to the Saints careers of Potter, Cunningham or any of the departing members of the squad that many had hoped for, but nevertheless, a new era was just around the corner, as Simmons' reign began.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the perceptions of}} lecturers, graduates and employers of <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> development in an accounting degree at Victoria University. The development of <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> in students in higher education {{has been the focus}} of discussion amongst accounting educators, accounting practitioners and the accounting profession for many years. There is a general consensus on what skills are necessarily sought to ensure success within the accountancy profession but very few previous studies on how those <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> are being developed. This research study presents a research framework which emphasises the complex interrelationships between an accounting curriculum, accounting lecturers, accounting graduates and employers of graduate accountants and their perceptions of how <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> are developed. A case study approach, combining archival, qualitative and quantitative methods, is used to investigate how a Bachelor of Business Accounting degree in one Australian university facilitates <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> development. The case study results indicate that the curriculum, as the vector for skills development, has both explicit and implicit references to skills outcomes. Graduates� perceptions of many of the <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> considered in this study are closely related to the curriculum findings. However, there appears to be a lack of convergence between lecturers� perceptions, the curriculum and graduates� perceptions. Employers generally agree that graduates display most of the <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills,</b> albeit at a low level, in the workplace. There are curriculum implications arising from the results of this research for accounting academics who design and develop accounting programs where the value of graduates� <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> are acknowledged. As a first step, academics need to improve accounting curricula by explicitly integrating <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> in their subjects. Communicating to students the explicit nature of <b>personal</b> and interpersonal <b>skills</b> development and making them aware is the next step...|$|R
