Until 2013, the Moscow MMPO processed up to 80% of all incoming international {{shipments to}} Russia which created much {{stress on the}} Russian Post.

40|$|Host {{defense against}} viruses {{probably}} depends on targeted death of infected host cells and then <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> cellular corpses by macrophages. For this process to be effective, the macrophage must presumably avoid its own virus-induced death. Here we identify one such mechanism. We show that mice lacking the chemokine Ccl 5 are immune compromised to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> delayed viral <b>clearance,</b> excessive airway inflammation and respiratory death after mouse parainfluenza or human influenza virus infection. Virus-inducible levels of Ccl 5 {{are required to}} prevent apoptosis of virus-infected mouse macrophages in vivo and mouse and human macrophages ex vivo. The protective effect of Ccl 5 requires activation of the Ccr 5 chemokine receptor and consequent bilateral activation of G(alphai) -PI 3 K-AKT and G(alphai) -MEK-ERK signaling pathways. The antiapoptotic action of chemokine signaling may therefore allow scavengers to finally stop the host cell-to-cell infectious process...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{players were}} {{permitted}} to cross without a clearance, not all transfers occurred in this manner, particularly {{in the first years}} of the schism; nevertheless, the changes gave players a stronger bargaining chip in negotiations. If a player demonstrated a willingness to accept a VFL suspension by crossing to the VFA without a clearance, then it was in his VFL club's best interests to grant the clearance in the hope that he might later return, rather than allow him to take a suspension which would prevent that from occurring. Not all clubs followed this pragmatic approach: South Melbourne, for example, made a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> refusing <b>clearances</b> to players unless they had given the club ten years of service, and it consequently lost many players without clearances. Many players still sought clearances, as they were keen to keep their options to return to the VFL open, and some turned down big VFA offers if their clearances weren't granted; Jack Dyer, for example, was denied a clearance to Yarraville in 1940, and he opted not to cross without a clearance because he harboured ambitions to return to be playing-coach of [...]|$|R
50|$|Outbound from Hoboken, commuters {{could ride}} on the Morristown Line (the mainline) to Dover, New Jersey, a trip of 38.3 miles (62 km). The Montclair Branch and Gladstone Branch diverged from the Morristown line at Roseville Avenue Station in Newark and Summit, respectively. The MUs ran off 3000 volt DC {{overhead}} electric wire, drawing current through pantographs. Due {{to the presence of}} overhead bridges along the line, the overhead catenary varied considerably in height. Where no height restrictions existed, the catenary was typically at 24 ft, but for some bridges the wire needed to drop in clearance, with Roseville Avenue being the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> lowest <b>clearance</b> at 15 ft. This didn't affect the operation of the MUs, since they had been designed with these clearance differentials in mind, but the low clearances restricted the use of other trains on the line that had insufficient clearance. The Lackawanna MUs had two pantographs: one for normal use (on the Dover end of the motor car) and one with greater wire tension that was used only during ice storms (on the Hoboken end of the car). The trains lacked speedometers. On test runs, the trains attained a speed of 63 mph on level track. On suitable downgrades, however, the trains could reach 75 mph.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Progress {{in therapy}} for cryptococcal {{meningitis}} {{has been slow}} {{because of the lack}} of a suitable marker of treatment response. Previously, we demonstrated the statistical power of a novel endpoint, the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection, based on serial quantitative cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, to differentiate the fungicidal activity of alternative antifungal drug regimens. We hypothesized that the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection should also be a clinically meaningful endpoint. METHODS: We combined data from cohorts of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated cryptococcal meningitis from Thailand, South Africa, and Uganda, for whom the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection was determined, and clinical and laboratory data prospectively collected, and explored the association between the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection and mortality by Cox survival analyses. RESULTS: The combined cohort comprised 262 subjects. Altered mental status at presentation, a high baseline organism load, and a slow rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection were independently associated with increased mortality at 2 and 10 weeks. Rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection was associated with antifungal drug regimen and baseline cerebrospinal fluid interferon-gamma levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection or early fungicidal activity as a means to explore antifungal drug dosages and combinations in phase II studies. An increased understanding of how the factors determining outcome interrelate may help clarify opportunities for intervention...|$|R

40|$|Ranaviruses such as frog virus 3 ([FV 3] family Iridoviridae) are {{increasingly}} prevalent pathogens that infect reptiles, amphibians, and fish worldwide. Whereas {{studies in the}} frog Xenopus laevis have revealed the critical involvement of CD 8 T-cell and antibody responses in host resistance to FV 3, {{little is known about}} the role played by innate immunity to infection with this virus. We have investigated the occurrence, composition, activation status, and permissiveness to infection of peritoneal leukocytes (PLs) in Xenopus adults during FV 3 infection by microscopy, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription-PCR. The total number of PLs and the relative fraction of activated mononucleated macrophage-like cells significantly increase as early as 1 day postinfection (dpi), followed by NK cells at 3 dpi, before the peak of the T-cell response at 6 dpi. FV 3 infection also induces a rapid upregulation of proinflammatory genes including arginase 1, interleukin- 1 β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Although PLs are susceptible to FV 3 infection, as evidenced by apoptotic cells, active FV 3 transcription, and the detection of viral particles by electron microscopy, the infection is weaker (fewer infectious particles), more transitory, and involves a smaller fraction (less than 1 %) of PLs than the kidney, the main site of infection. However, viral DNA remains detectable in PLs for at least 3 weeks postinfection, past the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> viral <b>clearance</b> observed in the kidneys. This suggests that although PLs are actively involved in anti-FV 3 immune responses, some of these cells can be permissive and harbor quiescent, asymptomatic FV 3...|$|R

40|$|SummaryProgressive {{memory loss}} and {{cognitive}} dysfunction are the hallmark clinical features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Identifying the molecular triggers for {{the onset of}} AD-related cognitive decline presently {{requires the use of}} suitable animal models, such as the 3 xTg-AD mice, which develop both amyloid and tangle pathology. Here, we characterize the onset of learning and memory deficits in this model. We report that 2 -month-old, prepathologic mice are cognitively unimpaired. The earliest cognitive impairment manifests at 4 months as a deficit in long-term retention and correlates with the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ in the hippocampus and amygdala. Plaque or tangle pathology is not apparent at this age, suggesting that they contribute to cognitive dysfunction at later time <b>points.</b> <b>Clearance</b> <b>of</b> the intraneuronal Aβ pathology by immunotherapy rescues the early cognitive deficits on a hippocampal-dependent task. Reemergence of the Aβ pathology again leads to cognitive deficits. This study strongly implicates intraneuronal Aβ in the onset of cognitive dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Asserting the {{inherent}} topology {{of the environment}} perceived by a robot is a key prerequisite of high-level decision making. This is achieved {{through the construction of}} a concise representation of the environment that endows a robot with the ability to operate in a coarse-to-fine strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel topological segmentation method of generic metric maps operating concurrently as a path-planning algorithm. First, we apply a Gaussian Distance Transform on the map that weighs points belonging to free space according to the proximity of the surrounding free area in a noise resilient mode. We define a region as the set <b>of</b> all the <b>points</b> that locally converge to a common <b>point</b> <b>of</b> maximum space <b>clearance</b> and employ a weighed meanshift gradient ascent onto the kernel space clearance density in order to detect the maxima that characterize the regions. The spatial intra-connectivity of each cluster is ensured by allowing only for linearly unobstructed mean-shifts which in parallel serves as a path-planning algorithm by concatenating the consecutive mean-shift vectors of the convergence paths. Experiments on structured and unstructured environments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed approach. ...|$|R
