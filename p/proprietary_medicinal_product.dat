40|$|Abstract － Since the Committee for <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> (CPMP) of the European Union {{issued in}} 1997 a “points to {{consider}} ” document {{for the assessment}} of the potential for QT interval prolongation by non-cardiovascular agents to predict drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP), the QT liability has become the critical safety issue in the development of pharmaceuticals. As TdP is usually linked to delayed cardiac repolarization, international guideline (ICH S 7 B) has advocated the standard repolarization assays such as in vitro IKr (hERG current) and in vivo QT interval, or in vitro APD (as a follow up) as the best biomarkers for predicting the TdP risk. However, the recent increasing evidence suggests that the currently used above biomarkers and/or assays are not fully predictive for TdP, but also does not address potential new drug-induced TdP due to the selective disruption of hERG protein trafficking to the cell membrane or VT and/or VF with QT shortening. There is, therefore, an urgent need for other surrogate markers or assays that can predict the proarrhythmic potential of drug candidate. In this review, we provide an ideal pre-clinical strategy to predict the potentials of QT liability and lethal arrhythmia of the drug candidates with recent issues in this field in mind, not at the expense of discarding therapeutically innovative drugs...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a brief history}} of the development of the field of immunotoxicology from one individual perspective and sep-arates the discussion into five phases: the methods development and validation phase; the compound testing phase; the many meet-ings and organization of the specialty section phase; the mechanis-tic studies phase; and the guidelines phase. During the discussion of each phase, major highlights, accomplishments, contributors and key references are provided. The immunotoxicology guide-lines for the testing of pharmaceutical chemical entities across the three major geographic axes are also presented and compared, along with some of the concerns raised by industry with these guidelines. The mandatory requirement of functional tests repre-sents the major concern and difference between the Committee of <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> (CPMP) and the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. The scientific basis for the recommendation of the functional tests proposed in the guidance documents based on National Institute of Environmental Health and Safety/National Toxicology Program (NIEHS/NTP) -sponsored studies is described. Experience at Sanofi-Synthelabo, with the test-ing of 29 new chemical drug entities developed across a broad range of therapeutic classes using this testing paradigm and functional tests to define their immunotoxic potential, yielded a low number of compounds (6. 8 %) that produced any abnormal reaction.

This paper details the pharmaceutical assessment of salmeterol HFA MDI and confirms that this product meets the current Committee for <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> regulatory requirements, and {{is comparable to the}} CFC MDI in product performance. Criteria investigated included fine particle mass (FPM), dose delivery and uniformity, priming requirements and simulated-use-testing. Dose delivery was unaffected by changing product orientation during storage. The mean dose delivered per actuation ranged from 21. 3 to 22. 4 μg, and all individual doses were within the ± 25 % defined limits of the target ex-actuator dose of 21 μg. The FPM results, defined as the mass of particles between 1. 1 and 4. 7 μm in diameter (the sum of the mass deposited on stages 3 – 5 of the Andersen Cascade Impactor), were similar for the HFA and CFC products. The mean FPM values of the two HFA clinical batches were 8. 7 and 10. 1 μg, covering the values obtained during the development, and the one of the CFC clinical batch was 10. 0 μg.

50|$|The first {{appearance}} of the term ‘safety pharmacology’ in the published literature dates back to 1980. The term was certainly in common usage in the 1980s within the pharmaceutical industry to describe nonclinical pharmacological evaluation of unintended effects of candidate drugs for regulatory submissions. Back then {{it was part of}} a wider ‘general pharmacology’ assessment, which addressed actions of a drug candidate beyond the therapeutically-intended effects. The only detailed guidelines indicating the requirements from drug regulatory authorities for general pharmacology studies were from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. Nowadays, the term ‘general pharmacology’ is no longer used, and the ICH S7A guidelines distinguish between primary pharmacodynamics (“studies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance in relation to its desired therapeutic target”), secondary pharmacodynamics (“studies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance not related to its desired therapeutic target”) and safety pharmacology (“studies that investigate the potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects of a substance on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above.”).A major stimulus to the discipline of safety pharmacology was the release in 1996 of a draft ‘Points to Consider’ document on QT prolongation by the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> (CPMP), issued in final form the following year. This initiative had been prompted by growing concern of sudden death caused by drug-induced torsade de pointes, a potentially lethal cardiac tachyarrhythmia.

40|$|Advisory {{committees}} have {{cautioned that}} influenza vaccine–induced antibody declines more {{rapidly in the}} elderly, falling below seroprotective levels within 4 months. We conducted a literature review to assess this assertion. The articles that were included in this review reported antibody levels � 4 months after influenza immunization in persons � 60 years old, interpretable {{in the context of}} annual influenza vaccine–approval criteria (seroprotection/seroconversion) specified by the Committee for <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> (CPMP) for the elderly. The final review included 14 studies; 8 of which reported seroprotection rates. Seroprotection exceeding CPMP criteria was maintained � 4 months after influenza immunization in all 8 of the studies reporting this for the H 3 N 2 component and in 5 of the 7 studies reporting this for the H 1 N 1 and B components. In determining whether CPMP criteria were met at season’s end, primary antibody response appeared to be more relevant than secondary antibody decline. Both studies reporting seroprotection rates that failed CPMP criteria � 4 months after influenza immunization for each of the H 1 N 1 and B components had also reported failed seroprotection at 1 month after immunization. If initially achieved after immunization, seroprotection rates of 70 %– 100 % were maintained not just at 4 months (2 studies) but also at 5 months (2 studies) and even at> 6 months (4 studies), for the H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1 vaccine components.

In the 2009 - 10 influenza season, the safety and immunogenicity of co-administered non-adjuvanted seasonal and MF 59 -adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines were evaluated in this study in 30 RA patients under therapy with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α agents or Abatacept and in 13 healthy controls (HC). Patients and HC underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation before (T 0), 1 (T 1) and 6 months (T 2) after vaccinations. No severe adverse reactions, but {{a significant increase in}} total mild side effects in patients versusHC were observed. Both influenza vaccines fulfilled the three criteria of the Committee for <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> (CPMP). Seroconversion rate for any viral strain in patients and HC was, respectively, 68 versus 45 for H 1 -A/Brisbane/ 59 / 07, 72 versus 81 for H 3 -A/Brisbane/ 10 / 07, 68 versus 54 for B/Brisbane/ 60 / 08 and 81 versus 54 for A/California/ 7 / 2009. A slight increase in activated interferon (IFN) -γ-, TNF-α- or interleukin (IL) - 17 A-secreting T cells at T 1 compared to T 0, followed by a reduction at T 2 in both patients and HC, was registered. In conclusion, simultaneous administration of adjuvanted pandemic and non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines is safe and highly immunogenic.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of cholinesterase inhibitors {{to correct}} the {{cholinergic}} deficit in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. However, the treatment is only effective in {{about half of the}} patients for whom it is prescribed. Vascular dementia may respond, at least to some extent, to these drugs (T Erkinjuntti and colleagues, Lancet 2002; 359 : 1283 - 90). In 2002, the Committee of <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> recommended that memantine-a drug that acts on the glutamatergic system rather than the cholinergic system-be approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderately severe to severe AD. Clinical trials have shown some effectiveness of memantine in the treatment of vascular dementia, although it has not been approved for use in this disorder. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: The results of a study of the effects of memantine on moderate to severe AD have recently been published (B Reisberg and colleagues, N Engl J Med 2003; 348 : 1333 - 41). Reisberg and colleagues treated their patients for 28 weeks, assessed several outcome variables, and found that memantine reduced clinical deterioration without significant adverse effects. This study is important as memantine is the only treatment licensed for patients with more advanced AD. WHERE NEXT? Several questions about the use of memantine as a treatment for AD remain to be answered. How beneficial is memantine treatment in routine clinical practice compared with clinical trials? What {{is the best way to}} assess treatment effects? How long do the beneficial effects last? Does memantine have neuroprotective, rather than just symptomatic, effects? In addition, we need to know when to switch from cholinesterase inhibitors to memantine or when to co-prescribe memantine with cholinesterase inhibitors. The efficacy of memantine in vascular dementia also requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{immunogenicity}} {{and safety of}} influenza vaccine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Relevant articles were retrieved from electronic databases. Seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate and factors that increase antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) were used as indices to measure the immunogenicity. The safety of vaccine was assessed through monitoring adverse events, which included side effects and SLE exacerbations. We performed a meta-analysis of influenza vaccine seroprotection, seroconversion and adverse effects. SLE exacerbation after vaccination was comprehensively described. We used the Committee for <b>Proprietary</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Products</b> (CPMP) guidelines to determine whether influenza can induce adequate immunogenicity in patients with SLE. Eighteen studies with 1966 subjects met the inclusion criteria. At least 565 of the subjects were patients with low-to-moderate SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score or stable SLE disease. Compared with the general population, seroprotection rate in SLE patients was significantly decreased in patients with H 1 N 1 [odds ratio (OR) = 0. 36, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 27 - 0. 50] and H 3 N 2 vaccination (OR = 0. 48, 95 % CI: 0. 24 - 0. 93), but not influenza B vaccination (OR = 0. 55, 95 % CI: 0. 24 - 1. 25). Seroconversion rate also significantly decreased in patients with H 1 N 1 (OR = 0. 39, 95 % CI: 0. 27 - 0. 57) and influenza B (OR = 0. 47, 95 % CI: 0. 29 - 0. 76) vaccination, but not H 3 N 2 vaccination (OR = 0. 62, 95 % CI: 0. 21 - 1. 79). However, the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in SLE patients almost reached that of the CPMP guidelines. The OR for side effects (patients versus healthy controls) was 3. 24 (95 % CI: 0. 62 - 16. 76). Among 1966 patients with SLE, 32 experienced mild exacerbation of SLE and five had serious side effects for other reasons. Influenza vaccine has moderate effect on protecting patients with SLE. The side effects of influenza vaccine are not serious and are manageable. With consideration of {{a higher risk of}} SLE exacerbation and a more severe course of infection among SLE patients, influenza vaccination should be promoted among SLE patients with a low-to-moderate SLEDAI score or stable disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined more than the prices of original <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010. The price regulation system and reimbursement with an efficient use and supply of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> could have positive effects on the management and reduction of public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In the paper <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> used in hospitals have not been analysed...|$|R
