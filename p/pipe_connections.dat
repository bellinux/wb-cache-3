25|$|Welding lead or 'lead burning' {{was much}} {{more common in the}} 19th century to make some <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> and tanks. Great skill is {{required}} but can be quickly learned. In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method. After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|E
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main <b>pipe</b> <b>connections</b> were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E

40|$|In underbalanced {{drilling}} (UBD), {{bottom hole}} pressure (BHP) {{must be maintained}} in the defined limit. Maintaining underbalanced drilling conditions after <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operation {{is required for the}} success of underbalanced drilling operations. Modeling and simulation of gas-liquid two phase flow in an UBD operation is very significant in order to accurately predict the wellbore pressure and other parameters of two phase flow. After <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operation in UBD, upon restarting mud circulation system, frictional pressure influenced the BHP and the fluid slugs in the drill string are transferred into the annulus. Therefore, the hydrostatic pressure will increase and UBD <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operations create a BHP vibration, which is a critical point. This particular time can reduce the benefits obtained to drill the well in an underbalanced environment. In this study, a mechanistic steady state gas-liquid two phase flow model was used to simulate the two phase flow after <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> operation in UBD. Simulation was carried out to predict the parameters; such as wellbore pressure, liquid holdup, and velocities of the two phases at different flow patterns, namely slug, bubble, churn, dispersed bubble, and annular flow. In order to predict wellbore pressure, a steady state model was developed to predict flow patterns, pressure gradient, and liquid holdup for gasliquid flow in vertical annulus and drill string. The model included flow pattern transition models and hydrodynamic models for individual flow pattern. The model equations along with appropriate constitutive relations formed a system of coupled drift flux, momentum, and energy equations, which were solved using the well known iterative Newton Raphson method. All model equations were implemented in a computer program named Fortran 95. The effect of gas and liquid flow rates, and choke pressure on the wellbore pressure, particularly in the BHP was evaluated numerically. In order to validate the results of the developed model, they were compared with actual field data and the results of the WELLFLO software using different mechanistic models. The results revealed that the two phase model developed can accurately predict wellbore pressure, particularly BHP, wellbore temperature, gas/liquid velocities, and two phase flow patterns...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSize {{effect on}} {{explosion}} intensity of methane-air mixture in spherical vessels and pipes was studied in this paper. The experimental results suggested {{diameter of the}} spherical vessel, the length of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> of single vessel {{and the length of}} <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> between two spherical vessels {{played a significant role in}} explosion intensity of methane-air mixture in spherical vessels and pipes. The maximum explosion pressure was almost constant, while the maximum rate of pressure rise decreased with an increasing diameter of the vessel. The maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise in single vessel with <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> both decreased due to the increase of the length of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes.</b> There was a linear relationship between explosion intensity and the length. And the maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise appeared at the end of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes.</b> For linked vessels, the explosion intensity in secondary vessel increased with an increasing length of <b>connection</b> <b>pipes</b> with linear relationships.

40|$|Drilling into mature, {{depleted}} fields {{is often}} difficult because of tight pressure margins. Increasing the pressure control will enable wells that previously were considered undrillable, to be drilled. Enabling drilling and increased oil recovery from depleted fields would most likely lead to {{a substantial increase in}} profit margains. A better pressure control will also increase the safety of the drilling crew, because the risk of unwanted situations such as a kick or a blow-out is decreased, also reducing the risk of unwanted environmental influence, e. g. oil spill. To compensate for the lack of a continuous measurement of the bottomhole pressure during drilling operations, an adpative observer of the bottomhole pressure is implemented. The observer implemented is tested, and shows promising results in estimating both the bottomhole pressure and the friction coefficient in the well during a <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> procedure. To control the pressure in the well, a low-order nonlinear model predicitve controller is developed, and it has been tested to perform well during the <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> procedure, where it maintains the pressure within the predefined boundaries. In this thesis both the obsever and the controller will be tested against an artificial well; simulated by a commercial software. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a drift-flux model (DFM) describing multiphase (gas-liquid) flow during drilling. The DFM uses a specific slip law, {{which allows for}} transition between single and two phase flows. With this model, we design unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the estimation of unmeasured state, production, and slip parameters using real-time measurements of the bottom-hole pressure, outlet pressure, and outlet flow rate. The OLGA high-fidelity simulator is used to create two scenarios from underbalanced drilling on which the estimators are tested: a <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> scenario and a scenario with a changing production index (PI). A performance comparison reveals that both UKF and EKF are capable of identifying the PIs of gas and oil from the reservoir into the well with acceptable accuracy, while the UKF is more accurate than the EKF. Robustness of the UKF and EKF for the <b>pipe</b> <b>connection</b> scenario is studied in case of uncertainties and errors in the reservoir and well parameters of the model. It is found that these methods {{are very sensitive to}} errors in the reservoir pore pressure value. However, they are robust in the presence of error in the liquid density value of the model...|$|R
