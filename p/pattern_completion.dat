25|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{plays an}} essential role in episodic memory. One important aspect of episodic memory is the spatial context in which the event occurred. Hippocampal place cells have been shown to exhibit stable firing patterns even when cues from a location are removed. Additionally, specific place fields begin firing when exposed to signals or a subset of signals from a previous location. This suggests that place cells provide the spatial context for a memory by recalling the neural representation of the environment in which the memory occurred. In other words, place cells prime a memory by differentiating the context for the event. By establishing spatial context, place cells can be used to complete memory patterns. Furthermore, place cells can maintain a spatial representation of one location while recalling the neural map of a separate location, effectively differentiating between present experience and past memory. Place cells are therefore considered to demonstrate both <b>pattern</b> <b>completion</b> and pattern separation qualities.|$|E

40|$|The {{hippocampus}} has {{a critical}} role in processing context during the acquisition and retrieval of memories. The contextual-dependence of Pavlovian fear extinction is closely associated with the hippocampus [1]. The contextually modulated retrieval of fear extinction leads to limited benefits from exposure therapy for anxiety disorders [1]. We recast extinction learning processing in the hippocampus in terms of a memory task that is dependent on <b>pattern</b> separation and <b>completion</b> machinery in the hippocampus. We developed a spiking neuron model of the Entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, and CA 3 of the hippocampus. We simulate Acetylcholine and Dopamine effects on regulating <b>pattern</b> separation and <b>completion</b> processes in the hippocampus. Our preliminary results indicate that fear extinction processing can be explained in terms of the encoding and retrieval mechanisms in the hippocampus and accordingly, can be manipulated by neuromodulators. We show that, in our model, manipulating levels of neuromodulators during extinction training can decrease the contextual-dependence of the extinction memory. We conclude that Dopamine is another important modulator of <b>pattern</b> separation and <b>completion</b> in the hippocampus, and that understanding of these neuromodulators will allow targeting specific memories in the hippocampus.

This form of memory recall deficit in the dopamine transporter heterozygous knockout mice can be reversed by a low dose of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol, further confirming that the inability to retrieve memory patterns {{is a result of}} dopamine imbalance.

40|$|<b>Pattern</b> <b>completion,</b> {{the ability}} to {{retrieve}} complete memories initiated by subsets of external cues, {{has been a major}} focus of many computation models. A previously study reports that such <b>pattern</b> <b>completion</b> requires NMDA receptors in the hippocampus. However, such a claim was derived from a non-inducible gene knockout experiment in which the NMDA receptors were absent throughout all stages of memory processes as well as animal’s adult life. This raises the critical question regarding whether the previously described results were truly resulting from the requirement of the NMDA receptors in retrieval. Here, we have examined the role of the NMDA receptors in <b>pattern</b> <b>completion</b> via inducible knockout of NMDA receptors limited to the memory retrieval stage. By using two independent mouse lines, we found that inducible knockout mice, lacking NMDA receptor in either forebrain or hippocampus CA 1 region at the time of memory retrieval, exhibited normal recall of associative spatial reference memory regardless of whether retrievals took place under full-cue or partial-cue conditions. Moreover, systemic antagonism of NMDA receptor during retention tests also had no effect on fullcue or partial-cue recall of spatial water maze memories. Thus, both genetic and pharmacological experiments collectively demonstrate that <b>pattern</b> <b>completion</b> during spatial associative memory recall does not require the NMDA receptor in th...|$|E

40|$|Bull trout Salvelinus confluentus {{exhibit a}} number of life history strategies. Stream-resident bull trout {{complete}} their life cycle in their natal tributaries. Migratory bull trout spawn in tributary streams where juvenile fish usually spend from one to four years before migrating to either a larger river (fluvial) or lake (adfluvial) where they rear {{before returning to the}} tributary stream to spawn (Fraley and Shepard 1989). These migratory forms occur where conditions allow movement from spawning locations to downstream waters that provide greater foraging opportunities (Dunham and Rieman 1999). Resident and migratory forms may occur together, and either form can produce resident or migratory offspring (Rieman and McIntyre 1993). The ability to migrate is important to the persistence of local bull trout populations (Rieman and McIntyre 1993). The identification of migratory corridors can help focus habitat protection efforts. Determining the life history form(s) that comprise local populations, the timing of seasonal movements, and the geographic extent of these movements are critical to bull trout protection and recovery efforts.
