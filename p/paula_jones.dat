5|$|Dworkin was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of President Bill Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal. She also expressed support for <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> and Juanita Broaddrick.|$|E
25|$|Coulter {{first became}} {{a public figure}} shortly before {{becoming}} an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> in her sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway {{had been asked to}} assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case for Human Events, was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.|$|E
25|$|Clinton had {{previously}} been confronted with allegations of sexual misconduct during his time as Governor of Arkansas. Former Arkansas state employee <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> filed a civil lawsuit against him; she alleged that he had sexually harassed her. Lewinsky's name surfaced during the discovery phase of Jones' case, when Jones' lawyers sought to show a pattern of behavior by Clinton that involved inappropriate sexual relationships with other government employees.|$|E
50|$|Bugliosi {{criticized the}} U.S. Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Clinton v. Jones. In his book, No Island of Sanity, {{he argues that}} the right of a president to be unburdened by a private lawsuit outweighed <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones's</b> interest in having her case brought to trial immediately.|$|R
25|$|Born in New York City to a {{conservative}} family, Coulter {{was raised in}} New Canaan, Connecticut. She deepened her conservative interests while studying history at Cornell University, where she helped found The Cornell Review. She subsequently embarked on {{a career as a}} law clerk before rising to prominence in the 1990s as an outspoken critic of the Clinton administration. Her first book concerned the Bill Clinton impeachment, and sprang from her experience writing legal briefs for <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones's</b> attorneys, as well as columns she wrote about the cases.|$|R
5|$|While the House Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} {{ended in}} a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but {{with a handful of}} Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones's</b> sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.|$|R
25|$|In the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case, Lewinsky had {{submitted}} {{an affidavit}} that denied any physical relationship with Clinton. In January 1998, {{she attempted to}} persuade Tripp to commit perjury in the Jones case. Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who was investigating the Whitewater controversy and other matters. Starr was now armed with evidence of Lewinsky's admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, and he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible perjury in the Jones case.|$|E
25|$|Starr {{took the}} {{position}} part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, {{as this was}} permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the Resolution Trust Company, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones,</b> who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual assault. Starr had explained to them why he believed that sitting U.S.presidents are not immune to civil suit.|$|E
25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1997, <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones’s</b> private {{investigators}} {{tried to talk to}} Broaddrick at her home, also secretly taping the conversation. Broaddrick refused to discuss the incident, saying “it was just a horrible horrible thing,” and that she “wouldn’t relive it for anything.” The investigators told her she would likely be subpoenaed if she would not talk to them. Broaddrick said she would deny everything, saying “you can’t get to him, and I’m not going to ruin my good name to do it… there’s just absolutely no way anyone can get to him, he’s just too vicious.” Broaddrick was subpoenaed in the Jones suit soon after and submitted an affidavit denying that Clinton had made “any sexual advances”. The recording of Broaddrick’s conversation with the investigators was leaked to the press, but Broaddrick continued to refuse to speak to reporters.|$|R
500|$|In 1994, <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> {{initiated}} {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit against Clinton, claiming that he made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright {{on the grounds that}} it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing [...] "a pack of lies" [...] and [...] "an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States" [...] funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. Bennett said that the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.|$|E
500|$|In December of {{the same}} year, {{allegations}} by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as [...] "Troopergate", the officers alleged that they arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton {{back when he was}} governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones.</b> Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated [...] "bad journalism", and that [...] "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives".|$|E

2500|$|In his {{deposition}} for the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> lawsuit, Clinton denied having [...] "sexual relations" [...] with Monica Lewinsky. On {{the basis}} of the evidence provided by Monica Lewinsky, a blue dress with Clinton's semen, Ken Starr concluded that this sworn testimony was false and perjurious.|$|E
2500|$|Funding for {{the film}} was {{provided}} by [...] "Citizens for Honest Government", to which Falwell paid $200,000 in 1994 and 1995. In 1995 Citizens for Honest Government interviewed Arkansas state troopers Roger Perry and Larry Patterson regarding the murder conspiracy about Vincent Foster. Perry and Patterson also gave information regarding the allegations in the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> affair.|$|E
2500|$|For alleged {{misconduct}} {{during his}} governorship <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> brought {{a sexual harassment}} lawsuit against Clinton while he was president. Clinton argued that as a sitting president, {{he should not be}} vulnerable to a civil suit of this nature. The case landed in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that [...] "Deferral of this litigation until petitioner's Presidency ends is not constitutionally required." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Lewinsky scandal broke, Barr was {{the first}} lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation. During debate on the {{impeachment}} resolution on the House floor, Barr argued that Clinton's attempt to interfere with Lewinsky's testimony in the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case endangered the Constitution. In doing so, Barr said, Clinton violated what Barr called a [...] "fundamental right" [...] of any American citizen – [...] "the unshakable right {{each one of us}} has to walk into a courtroom and demand the righting of a wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 she boxed against <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> [...] on the Fox TV network Celebrity Boxing event, {{winning the}} fight. On February 22, 2003, {{she made her}} {{official}} women's professional boxing debut, losing a four-round decision in the undercard of the Mike Tyson-Clifford Etienne bout, amid rumors {{that she was having}} financial difficulties and needed to fight in the ring to earn money. She did another celebrity boxing match, on The Man Show, and won against co-host Doug Stanhope. Stanhope later claimed on his podcast that the fight was fixed because Tonya Harding refused to [...] "fight a man".|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 1994, former Arkansas state {{employee}} <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> filed {{a sexual}} harassment suit against U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Arkansas State Police Officer Danny Ferguson. She claimed that on May 8, 1991, Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas, propositioned her. David Brock had written, in the January 1994 issue of The American Spectator, that an Arkansas state employee named [...] "Paula" [...] had offered to be Clinton's mistress. According to the story, Ferguson had escorted Jones to Clinton's hotel room, stood guard, and overheard Jones say {{that she would not}} mind being Clinton's mistress.|$|E
2500|$|Lewinsky {{confided in}} [...] Linda Tripp about her {{relationship}} with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress. Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them, which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{and bring them to}} the attention of people working on the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case. In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1998, Tripp {{discovered}} that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case, denying {{a relationship with}} Clinton. She delivered tapes to Kenneth Starr, the Independent Counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater scandal, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued, [...] "It {{depends on what the}} meaning of the word 'is' is," [...] with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that [...] "there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship." ...|$|E
2500|$|The case came to {{the fore}} in 1998, when Bill Clinton's {{attorneys}} invoked it as a defense to perjury charges brought by the House of Representatives during his impeachment. They argued that lawyers for <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> had failed to follow up on questions asking Clinton generally if he had ever been alone with Monica Lewinsky to which he had answered [...] "I don't recall". Even though later testimony had established that she was indeed alone with him on several brief occasions, he had not specifically denied it and that the Jones lawyers' failure to ask follow-up questions about specific occasions barred prosecution as surely as the similar failure by Bronston's questioner. They also cited other occasions where Clinton had similarly claimed he didn't remember, and his questioners had simply left the answer at that. The president's purportedly false testimony was, to them, [...] "simply a confused deposition record that could have been clarified contemporaneously".|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Norville {{was named}} anchor of Inside Edition, a {{syndicated}} newsmagazine, a position {{she continues to}} hold. [...] In March 2015, the show celebrated her 20th anniversary on the program, noting that she was now the longest serving female anchor on national television. [...] Among Norville’s reports were her reports from the Davidson County, North Carolina jail, billed as the [...] "toughest in America"; her interview with <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones,</b> whose accusation of sexual harassment by [...] then-President Bill Clinton led to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment proceedings; and her series of [...] "jobs", notably the song she wrote and performed, “Keep On Movin.” [...] Set to music written by noted producer Junior Vasquez, Norville wrote the lyrics, a challenge she described in O, The Oprah Magazine. [...] “The strength from meeting that challenge”, she said, “is still with me. [...] It’s the boost you get from accomplishing something you never dreamed you could do”.|$|E
2500|$|The Lewinsky scandal was an American {{political}} {{sex scandal}} that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The sexual relationship {{took place between}} 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech {{with the statement that}} he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky. [...] Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{had also}} said, [...] "there {{is not a}} sexual relationship, an {{improper}} sexual relationship or {{any other kind of}} improper relationship" [...] which he defended as truthful on August 17, 1998 because of his use of the present tense, famously arguing [...] "it depends on what {{the meaning of the word}} 'is' is" [...] (i.e., he was not, at the time he made that statement, still in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky). Under pressure from Starr, who had obtained from Lewinsky a blue dress with Clinton's semen stain, as well as testimony from Lewinsky that the President had inserted a cigar tube into her vagina, Clinton stated, [...] "I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate." [...] Clinton denied having committed perjury because, according to Clinton, the legal definition of oral sex was not encompassed by [...] "sex" [...] per se. In addition, relying upon the definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] as proposed by the prosecution and agreed by the defense and by Judge Susan Webber Wright, who was hearing the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case, Clinton claimed that because certain acts were performed on him, not by him, he did not engage in sexual relations. Lewinsky's testimony to the Starr Commission, however, contradicted Clinton's claim of being totally passive in their encounters.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the <b>Paula</b> <b>Jones</b> case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E
