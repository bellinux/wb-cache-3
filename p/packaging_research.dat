40|$|The {{production}} of barrier packaging materials, e. g., for food, by {{physical vapor deposition}} (PVD) of inorganic coatings such as aluminum on polymer substrates is an established and well understood functionalization technique today. In order to achieve a sufficient barrier against gases, a coating thickness of approximately 40 nm aluminum is necessary. This review provides a holistic overview of relevant methods commonly used in the packaging industry {{as well as in}} <b>packaging</b> <b>research</b> for determining the aluminum coating thickness. The theoretical background, explanation of methods, analysis and effects on measured values, limitations, and resolutions are provided. In industrial applications, quartz micro balances (QCM) and optical density (OD) are commonly used for monitoring thickness homogeneity. Additionally, AFM (atomic force microscopy), electrical conductivity, eddy current measurement, interference, and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are presented as more <b>packaging</b> <b>research</b> related methods. This work aims {{to be used as a}} guiding handbook regarding the thickness measurement of aluminum coatings for packaging technologists working in the field of metallization...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this chapter {{is to examine the}} {{frequency}} of multi-study <b>research</b> <b>packages</b> in the organizational sciences and advocate for their use by detailing strengths and recognizing limitations. Methodology/approach: Philosophy of science research, focusing on multi-study <b>research</b> <b>packages,</b> is discussed followed by a 20 -year review of incidence of these packages in top organizational sciences journals. Findings: The publication of multi-study <b>research</b> <b>packages</b> have increased over the past 10 years, most notably in micro-level journals. Social implications: For reasons of validity and generalizability, society benefits if scholars adopt multi-study approaches to knowledge generation and disseminate. Originality/value of the chapter: This chapter provides the most comprehensive review of multiple-study <b>research</b> <b>packages</b> in the organizational sciences to date, examining publication trends in eight leading micro-and macro-level journals. We also summarize the use of multi-study packages in our own research and offer recommendations for improving the science of replication...|$|R

For decades, marketing professionals have used branding to differentiate and build name recognition for their company’s products and services.

Deliverables can experience the same benefits of branding as commercial products do.
