40|$|Although lipid {{autoxidation}} in {{the boiling}} kettle {{is a key}} determinant of the cardboard flavor of aged beers, recent results show that mashing is another significant source of wort nonenal potential, the well-known indicator of how a beer will release (E) - 2 -nonenal during storage. Although unstable, deuterated (E) - 2 -nonenal nitrogen adducts created during mashing can in some cases partially persist in the <b>pitching</b> <b>wort,</b> to release deuterated (E) - 2 -nonenal during beer aging. In the experiment described here, the relative contributions of mashing and boiling were estimated at 30 and 70 %, respectively. The presence of oxygen during mashing and, to a lesser extent, high lipoxygenase activity can intensify the stale cardboard flavor...|$|E
40|$|The use of labeled nonenal {{enabled the}} {{demonstration}} that {{the appearance of}} the cardboard flavor in finished beer comes from lipid auto-oxidation during wort boiling and not from lipoxygenasic activity during mashing. Free trans- 2 -nonenal produced by linoleic acid auto-oxidation in the kettle disappears, owing to retention by wort amino acids and proteins. This binding linkage protects trans- 2 -nonenal from yeast reduction but is reversible, allowing release of the compound at lower pH during aging. Labeled trans- 2 -nonenal is detected after aging when deuterated precursors form in the boiling kettle. The amount of alkenal released correlates with the concentration of reversible associations in the <b>pitching</b> <b>wort.</b> This work brings new illumination to the formation of trans- 2 -nonenal and overturns many previous hypotheses. It also explains why a reduction in the beer pH intensifies the cardboard flavor...|$|E
40|$|Oxidation {{is usually}} {{recognized}} as the major cause of development of a stale flavor in beer. However, {{no significant difference in}} trans- 2 -nonenal concentration has been observed between oxygen-receiving and oxygen-free beers after aging. Moreover,O- 18 (2) was not incorporated into the carbonyl fraction, indicating that the cardboard flavor in beer is not due to lipid oxidation in the bottle. As shown by adding deuterated nonenol to the <b>pitching</b> <b>wort,</b> nonenal oxidation and sulfitic adduct degradation were also inefficient pathways of trans- 2 -nonenal synthesis. On the other hand, wort nonenal linked to amino acids and proteins revealed to be able to release nonenal at the beer pH. The measured nonenal potential proved a good indicator of beer staling; therefore, UV spectroscopy was used to find which experimental conditions destabilize trans- 2 -nonenal precursors in wort Laboratory-scale experiments confirmed that SO 2 can reduce both lipid autooxidation and the nonenal potential rise while the wort is boiling...|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{productivity}} of the beer fermentation process, several strategies can be adopted. One of these promising strategies could be the increase of suspended yeast cells in the reactor. Therefore, the fermentation characteristics of 11 lager yeast strains were studied in normal <b>pitched</b> <b>worts</b> (20 × 106 cells/ mL) (LD) and in worts with a four-fold higher pitching rate (HD). The fermentation rate was 2 - 4 times increased when high initial cell levels were used. The net yeast growth was somewhat similar between the LD and the HD fermentations, although the FAN uptake level was about 35 % higher in the HD fermentations compared with LD. High viabilities were observed throughout the fermentations with high cell loadings. HD fermentations resulted in higher concentrations of all the measured fusel alcohols and higher maxima and residual concentrations of total diacetyl were observed. In contrast, higher levels {{of most of the}} esters were found at the normal pitching rate, although the results of isoamyl acetate were not significant.

40|$|The “kettle hop” or “hoppy” aroma, one of {{the most}} {{complicated}} flavor characteristics of lager beer, has been a topic of interest for decades among both brewers and researchers. However, the knowledge on the hop-derived flavor-active constituents that play a role in hoppy aroma is still far from complete. This can be attributed to changes in the hop oil-derived volatile profile induced by several process steps such as wort boiling and fermentation. The oxygenated sesquiterpenoids in particular have been suggested to be correlated with the spicy aspect of hoppy aroma. These compounds arise when sesquiterpene hydrocarbons are oxidized during aging of hops, {{as well as in the}} case of kettle-hopping. To gain insight into the development of hoppy aroma, we here present a methodology in which hop essential oil is fractionated via solid-phase extraction (SPE) to obtain pure sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, which are subsequently boiled in an aqueous solution to mimic wort boiling. The resulting oxygenated sesquiterpenoids are then isolated by SPE and added to <b>pitching</b> <b>wort</b> (brewed on a 5 hL pilot scale), which is allowed to ferment on lab scale, in order to elucidate their behavior during fermentation. Samples were taken before and after fermentation, after maturation, and after centrifugation. About 30 oxygenated sesquiterpenoids were formed upon boiling of the pure sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. After isolation of these sesquiterpenoids, we obtained a fraction with a composition similar to the hop oil-derived volatile profile of lager beer, proving the relevance for brewing practice. Addition of this fraction to non-aromatized iso-alpha-bittered beer caused a shift in the aroma profile in favor of “woody,” “hay,” “hoppy,” and “spicy” notes. The fraction was also added to <b>pitching</b> <b>wort.</b> After fermentation, the change in the sesquiterpenoid-derived volatile profile could mainly be attributed to huge losses, probably due to adsorption to the yeast. However, some of the sesquiterpenoids were still detected via GC-O, even after this strong decline in their level, proving the flavor-activity of these compounds. The decrease in sesquiterpenoid level after maturation and centrifugation was less pronounced. The compounds that survived centrifugation are also found in commercial lager beers. In conclusion, our innovative approach delivers a new hop oil-derived oxygenated sesquiterpenoid fraction with clear sensorial impressions and evidence for the flavor-activity of individual oxygenated sesquiterpenoids. Further research will focus on application of this boiled hop oil fraction in brewing practice. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Fine milling in {{combination}} with thinbed mash filters has been introduced into the brewing industry more than 20 years ago. Although clearest worts can be obtained at highest gravity, {{in combination}} with high extract yield and improved starch conversion, a majority of brewers still use the conventional coarse milling {{in combination with}} lautertuns. Brewers seem still afraid having a negative impact of fine milling on wort and beer quality {{especially with regard to}} over extraction of polyphenols, proteins and oxidative enzymes. A lack of detailed data comparing both wort production methods could be a reason. In this study, the faster wort filtration as well as higher extract yield has been confirmed when using fine milling and a thin bed filter. A higher concentration of fermentable sugar led to this increased yield and not an increased level of proteins and polyphenols. On the contrary, fine milling in combination with thicker mash and thin bed filtration results in a lower level of haze sensitive protein in the <b>pitching</b> <b>wort</b> in comparison to coarse grist and the use of a lautertun. No striking differences have been found comparing analyses of fresh beer. Also during forced ageing of the beers at 30 [*]°C, no difference in the formation of flavour negative compounds or degradation of bitterness has been noticed. Both wort production methods result in highly comparable beers with equal flavour stability. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project is to study the impact of an innovative wort production method on flavour quality and flavour stability of lager beer. The innovation comprises 1) thick and fast mashing under anti-oxidative conditions to save time and energy; 2) high mashing-off temperature (95 &# 176;C) compared to conventional mashing-off temperature of 78 &# 176;C; 3) acidified sparging; and 4) in-line wort stripping with culinary steam and in-kettle stripping during filling of the kettle (till kettle is full) for continuously stripping of unwanted volatiles. After wort filtration and in-line stripping, no additional boiling is required. Special {{attention was paid to}} mashing-in conditions (O 2, pH, temperature), in order to prevent early oxidation. During transfer of the mash to the mash vessel, the malt aldehydes are to be stripped off as much as possible. Clean steam injectors in combination with over-sized chimneys and condensate traps and high mashing-off temperatures should facilitate the release and stripping of unwanted volatile aldehydes. Mashing-off at temperatures above 95 &# 176;C has three aims: 1. strip off unwanted volatile aldehydes; 2. partially degrade of SMM to DMS (flavour of Brussels sprouts); 3. coagulate and flocculate high molecular weight proteins. The holding time of the elevated mashing-off temperature will depend on these three items. The fastest and thickest mashing conditions were first evaluated to produce concentrated mashes in the shortest time frame. A thick mash results in smaller total volumes so that low water and reduced energy input is required during mashing. An efficient sparging will then lead to lowest volumes for boiling with highest extract content which is again beneficial in view of energy consumption and brewhouse capacity. Fine milling in combination with thinbed wort filtration resulted in highly comparable wort, beer, and ageing profiles compared to conventional coarse milling/lautertun operations. High mashing-off temperature resulted in a fast wort filtration, bright sweet wort and a low heat load (based on the TB-Index). Due to the high mashing-off and wort filtration temperature, SMM is already transformed into free DMS which evaporates partially at mashing-off. Sufficient conversion of SMM and removal of DMS is possible by in-line and in-kettle clean steam injection during filling of the combination vessel. Sparging with acidified water at high temperature minimised the extraction of extra proanthocyanidins during the sparging step ending up with comparable amounts compared to conventional wort production. High mashing-off temperature also resulted in decreased levels of haze sensitive proteins, in comparison with conventional mashing-off temperature. The use of steam to form and strip DMS however results in the formation of a low trub content, but the small protein flocks are difficult to remove. No striking differences have been found when comparing conventionally produced beers with the innovative beers. However, important differences have been observed when the beers were subjected to ageing. Due to the acidified sparging, high aldehyde contents have been found in the <b>pitching</b> <b>wort</b> upon innovative wort production. The low pH of sparging liquor seems to result in an enhanced release of imine-bound aldehydes. As apparent from analysis of <b>pitching</b> <b>wort,</b> these free aldehydes have not been efficiently stripped off (in contrast to DMS), but after fermentation, comparable levels of free aldehydes were found in the fresh beers. However, during ageing of the innovative beer, lower levels of aldehydes were found resulting in significantly lower overall ageing sensory scores. The release of aldehydes during acidified sparging, even at conventional sparge temperatures of 78 &# 176;C, is also malt dependent. In conclusion, the innovative wort production, executed in less than 3. 5 hours, results in a highly comparable fresh beer, but with an extended flavour stability compared to conventional beer production. Concentrated mashes and highest extract content due to low sparge rates will result in a decreased need of energy for wort production. The high throughput of the two vessel brewhouse with a thinbed filter will also reduce the investment cost.

Considering nutritional aspects of the brewing process, the yeast could be affected before <b>pitching</b> the <b>wort</b> or/and during the fermentations. Using as target yeast, yeast slurry collected from an industrial storage tank (where the yeast is stored between re-pitching, from industrial fermentation to a new one), several nutrients were tested to evaluate the feasibility of the nutritional yeast pre-treatment regarding to an improved fermentation performance during VHG wort fermentations. The yeast was firstly kept in contact with the nutrients in study (one or a combination of many) at the same conditions of temperature and steering as the industrial plant. The yeast was stored in those conditions during different periods followed by lab-scale fermentations with high stressful medium, i. e. high gravity wort to evaluate the fermentation performance. Linoleic acid and Tween 80 are nutrients that could be added just few hours before <b>pitching</b> the <b>wort</b> to the yeast storage tanks, inducing a positive effect on the extract consuming and viability of the cropped yeast. The addition of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Fe 2 + and K+ were also studied as yeast supplements on yeast storage tanks.

40|$|Abstract]: Yeasts {{require a}} range of metals for optimal growth, {{metabolism}} and fermentation performance. In production of fermented beverages, zinc is of prime importance, with levels of at least 0. 3 ppm preferable for optimal fermentation and avoidance of stuck ferments. Zinc is a co-factor for numerous important biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes including, significantly, various glycolytic enzymes and alcohol dehydrogenase. In addition it plays critical regulatory roles through the action of Znfinger DNA binding proteins, and affects yeast-yeast flocculation. Zinc is also known to modulate yeast stress responses, mainly due to {{its role as a}} co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, zinc ions are thought to have some effects on stability and dynamics of cell membranes, which may lead to downstream effects on cell permeability and signalling systems. In brewing fermentations, zinc is actively assimilated by yeast from malt wort. However, in some instances its bioavailability may be limiting due to decrease of zinc levels during mashing, lautering and boiling through complexing in precipitated trub. Consequently low zinc levels in wort may lead to slow and incomplete fermentations. We have studied the impact of varying zinc levels in a model brewing situation, utilising a wort medium initially depleted of zinc. The zinc was depleted by biochelation using yeast cells, providing a wort normal in all aspects except zinc levels. A brewer's strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was extensively cultured in low zinc medium to deplete cellular zinc levels, and then <b>pitched</b> into <b>worts</b> containing zinc concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 ppm (provided as zinc acetate). In addition to growth and fermentation parameters we assessed membrane fluidity by measuring Generalized Polarization of the membrane-localising fluorescent probe laurdan (6 -lauroyl- 2 -dimethylamino naphthalene). We observed that zinc levels impacted upon growth rate, ethanol yields and membrane fluidity. The membrane fluidity varied with culture age and ethanol accumulation, as well as in relation to cellular zinc levels. Results will be discussed with reference to the impact of zinc on brewing yeast fermentation performance and stress physiology...|$|R
40|$|For beer wort {{fermentation}} {{the addition}} of unsaturated fatty acids has sometimes been suggested {{as an alternative to}} wort oxygenation. This can however negatively affect the synthesis of acetate esters and consequently beer flavour. This work investigates the effect of supplementing a cropped yeast with an unsaturated fatty acid on the fermentation performance of the pitching yeast. Cropped yeast is in a different physiological state to yeast <b>pitched</b> in unfermented <b>wort.</b> Using a synthetic medium for the fermentations, {{it was found that the}} incubation of cropped yeast with linoleic acid resulted in two important changes in the yeasts composition: (1) the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids increased from 0. 53 to 0. 66 and (2) the ratio of trehalose to glycogen increased from 0. 17 to 0. 49. The performance of this yeast in subsequent fermentations was compared to unsupplemented yeast under three conditions: medium pre-aeration, de-aerated medium and de-aerated medium with newly added unsaturated fatty acid. It was found that the supplemented pitching yeast showed growth, attenuation and ethanol formation profiles similar to those obtained with unsupplemented yeast in pre-aerated medium, which simulated the normal brewing practice. Compared to fermentations with unsaturated fatty acids added to the medium, the supplemented cropped yeast did not induce a reduction in acetate ester synthesis. Results indicated that the supplementation of cropped yeast with unsaturated fatty acids could be an interesting alternative to wort oxygenation to restore the optimal membrane fluidity of the yeast. status: publishe...|$|R

The results obtained demonstrate that very high gravity worts at 22 ºP can be fermented in the same period of time as 15 ºP wort, by raising the temperature to 18 ºC, the initial oxygen level to about 22 ppm and increasing the pitching rate to 22 million cells per ml. By using this strategy, a finished beer at 11. 5 ºP extract will increase the volumetric brewing capacity (by dilution) by 91 % for the 22 ºP wort, comparing to 30 % for 15 ºP wort. The effect of the operation variables on the most important aromatic compounds was limited. Within the range of tested conditions, the concentration of the higher alcohols did not change beyond the respective thresholds as well as the acetaldehyde concentration. However, the esters variation indicated that the concentrations obtained at the very high gravity conditions could affect the aroma profile.

The second studied approach to overcome VHG limitations corresponded to the nutritional supplementation of the yeast slurry. For this, several simple and complex nutrients reported in the literature as being relevant in the fermentation performance were tested, and the ones with higher positive effect were selected. The combination of linoleic acid (6 mg. g- 1), MgCl 2 (5 g. l- 1) and Tween 80 (6 mg. g- 1) on the supplementation of the yeast slurry during 24 h before <b>pitching</b> the <b>wort</b> produced higher ethanol concentration (11. 7 %, v/v) than the unsuplemented yeast at the same conditions (10. 1 %, v/v). The scale-up of the studied conditions to pilot plant fermentations indicated that although the results obtained in EBC tall tubes are extremely useful to compare brewing conditions, the absolute profile of an industrial scale fermentation would be different. In large 250 L fermentations, many physico-chemical indicators were different between a beer produced from a VHG wort at 18 ºC and a beer from a standard 15 ºP wort fermented at 12 ºC. However, in the sensorial triangular test those beers were indistinguishable. This is an important indicator of the feasability of a VHG brewing at 18 ºC with 22 ºP wort to produce an identical beer as the one produced in standard conditions. The study of the cropped yeast indicated that the yeast settled {{on the bottom of the}} cylindroconical fermenter after a lager brewing fermentation can be in similar physiologic conditions. The lab-fermentation trials using samples collected along the yeast cropping presented similar profiles. However, the fractionation of the yeast slurry by density indicated that several types of cells with distinct physiological state are present in the brewer’s storage tank. This work suggests that the last formed cells at the end of the fermentation may have their physiological state compromised by the absence of nutrients. Another finding suggests that the proportion of young virgin cells in the cropped yeast may increase during brewing fermentations. This fact can have an important impact on the yeast slurry recycling procedure widely used by the brewers. A presente tese teve como objetivo principal a otimização do desempenho fermentativo de uma estirpe de levedura cervejeira para produção de cerveja a partir de mosto de muito alto extrato. Neste estudo foram abordadas duas estratégias para ultrapassar as limitações impostas pelo stress inerente às fermentações de mosto concentrado. A primeira abordagem consistiu na otimização das variáveis ambientais influentes na atividade da levedura. A segunda estratégia baseou-se no pré-acondicionamento nutricional da levedura antes de ser usada para inocular o mosto cervejeiro. O estudo das variáveis ambientais de fermentação nomeadamente a concentração do mosto, a temperatura e as taxas de oxigenação e de inóculo foi efetuado em tubos EBC- 2 L com a levedura cervejeira. Os resultados obtidos demonstraram que o mosto de alto extrato a 22 ºP pode ser fermentado no mesmo período de tempo que as fermentações de mosto a 15 ºP aumentando a temperatura de 12 ºC para 18 ºC, o oxigénio dissolvido para 22 ppm e o inóculo para 22 milhões de células por mililitro. A cerveja após diluição para um extrato de 11. 5 ºP aumentaria a capacidade volumétrica em 91 % for 22 ºP, em comparação com o aumento de 30 % para o mosto a 15 ºP. Foi ainda demonstrado que o efeito das condições ótimas de produtividade no perfil aromático é limitado. A variação na concentração de ésteres não ultrapassa o limite de deteção nos compostos analisados, embora o aumento na concentração de ésteres indique que a cerveja produzida nestas condições apresenta um aroma mais frutado quando comparado com a cerveja produzida nas condições padrão. A segunda alternativa estudada para ultrapassar as limitações mosto VHG correspondeu à suplementação nutricional da levedura. Para tal foi efetuado um levantamento de nutrientes simples ou compostos referenciados na literatura como influentes no desempenho fermentativo, seguido de um rastreio daqueles com maior impacto positivo na fermentação. A combinação dos nutrientes como o ácido linoleico (6 mg. g- 1), MgCl 2 (5 g. l- 1) e Tween 80 (6 mg. g- 1) usada para acondicionamento da pasta de levedura durante 24 h antes de inocular permitiu uma concentração final em etanol de 11. 7 %. A fermentação nas mesmas condições com levedura não suplementada produziu 10. 1 % em etanol. Os estudos de aumento de escala das fermentações cervejeiras para a escala piloto indicaram que embora os resultados obtidos em tubos EBC- 2 L são uteis para comparação de condições experimentais, os perfis absolutos de uma fermentação à escala industrial serão diferentes. Em fermentações com volume de 250 L, vários parâmetros físicoquímicos apresentaram diferenças entre a cerveja produzida por mosto VHG a 18 ºC e a cerveja produzida a partir de mosto 15 ºP a 12 ºC. Contudo, na análise sensorial triangular essas cervejas foram consideradas idênticas sendo um excelente indicador da viabilidade da produção de uma cerveja por fermentação de alto extrato idêntica à produzida nas condições padrão. O estudo da levedura recolhida após a fermentação cervejeira sugere que a levedura sedimentada no cone do fermentador após a fermentação cervejeira do tipo lager pode encontrar-se em condições fisiológicas similares. Os ensaios fermentativos laboratoriais realizados com as amostras de leveduras retiradas ao longo da remoção da levedura do cone para o tanque de armazenamento apresentaram perfis similares de desempenho. Contudo, o fraccinamento de amostras de levedura homogeneizada do tanque de armazenamento de acordo com a densidade demonstrou a existência de diferentes tipos de células relativamente ao estado fisiologico e ao número da geração. Este trabalho sugere que as últimas células capazes de se dividirem durante a fermentação cervejeira possam ter baixo estado fisiológico causado pela ausência de nutrientes. Os resultados indicam ainda que a proporção de células virgens na levedura recolhida poderá aumentar ao longo da fermentação. Este facto terá um impacto importante na prática corrente da indústria cervejeira na reutilização da levedura entre ciclos fermentativos...|$|R
40|$|Most breweries collect yeast from a {{previous}} fermentation cycle for further use in a subsequent cycle. However, the cropped cells are deficient in membrane sterols and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) which are required for good fermentation performance in the next cycle. Consequently, the cellular levels of these compounds must be restored to obtain an optimal fermentation performance. There are currently three possibilities to satisfy this requirement. The common practice is aeration of the <b>wort</b> before <b>pitching,</b> thus providing oxygen needed for lipid synthesis during the first stages of fermentation. Oxygenation (aeration) of cropped yeast slurries is a second alternative. Finally, {{the addition of the}} required lipids to wort is sometimes suggested as an alternative to aeration. We examined a fourth possibility, namely the supplementation with UFA of cropped cells. Previously, we reported that the supplementation of stationary phase cropped brewer's yeast with linoleic acid is a good alternative to wort aeration. This conclusion resulted from results obtained with a well-defined stir-red synthetic fermentation medium. We also showed that cells cropped from non-stirred tall-tube fermented malt wort incorporated linoleic acid into different cellular lipid fractions, when suspended and supplemented in fermented wort. Now, we report that such yeast, <b>pitched</b> in malt <b>wort</b> in non-stirred tall-tubes, showed growth and attenuation profiles comparable to unsupplemented yeast in pre-aerated wort. Moreover, the synthesis of acetate esters, which is known to be affected when UFAs are added directly to the wort, was not significantly affected. We hypothesize that the active uptake of linoleic acid during fermentation and its activation by coenzyme A (CoA) and phospholipid synthesis are responsible for the effects on ester synthesis, through repression of the alcohol acetyltransferase-encoding gene, ATF 1. In supplemented cropped yeast, these reactions occur prior to fermentation, thus avoiding interferences with acetate ester synthesis. In serial repitching experiments with repeated linoleic acid supplementation of the cropped yeast, the fermentation performances of the yeast remained comparable to those of non-supplemented yeast in pre-aerated wort. However, due to a progressive increase of cellular UFA, negative effects on acetate ester synthesis appeared. Nevertheless, the supplementation of cropped yeast with UFAs can be considered as an interesting alternative to wort oxygenation to restore optimal membrane functions. status: publishe...|$|R
