40|$|Biopharmaceutical {{industries}} consistently applied Water for Injection (WFI) as {{a solvent}} during their production stage. Generally, water is considered as non-hazardous material, {{but in the}} pharmaceutical industries the involved treatments to produce WET typically consumes {{a large amount of}} energy. This energy usually comes from the use of utility steam as well as electricity to heat the water as part of the purification process. Consequently, generation of utility steam and electricity needed to produce WFI releases gas pollutants and directly affecting the environment. However, such potential environmental impact (PEI), which is associated to the demand of WFI in a biopharmaceutical process, is typically not included in the environmental assessment of the process as water is considered benign. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the PET value from WFT and <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> generation using a simple algorithm which is modified from Waste Reduction (WAR) Algorithm. The PEI is estimated based on the gas pollutants emitted from the energy generation process, which is in this case, the electricity and utility steam. In order to determine the energy needed in WET and <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> generation, their generation system was modelled and simulated in SuperPro Designer®. WFI is typically produced in Multiple Effect Distillation (MED) system or Vapour Compression Distillation (VCD) system and meanwhile <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> is produced in <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> generator (PSG). A hypothetical large-scale of monoclonal antibody (MAb) production is used as a case study to demonstrate the environmental impact assessment using WAR Algorithm inclusive of PET from WFI and <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> demand during manufacturing process. From the case study, it can be concluded that the WET generation, regardless of using MED or VCD, occupied the largest percentage of energy consumption. The PET shows a major contribution to the total PET value, particularly in global warming potential. The hotspot based on the highest WET consumption is Protein A chromatography. This equipment is used in the downstream processing step to purify the target product. As biopharmaceutical process needs a large amount of WET in the process, therefore it is important to include PET from WFI as part of the environmental assessment.

40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} {{studies have been}} carried out to better understand production mechanisms of heavy oil under steam injection with propane and petroleum distillate as steam additives. The studies have been conducted for heavy oil from San Ardo field (12 oAPI, 2800 cp at 53. 3 oC), under current reservoir conditions. The experiments consist of injecting <b>pure</b> <b>steam,</b> steam-propane, and steampetroleum distillate into a vertical cell containing a mixture of sand, water and San Ardo oil. The injection cell (68. 58 cm long with an ID of 7. 376 cm) is placed inside a vacuum jacket, set at the reservoir temperature of 53. 3 oC. Superheated steam at 230 oC is injected at 5. 5 ml/min (cold-water equivalent) simultaneously with propane or a petroleum distillate slug. The cell outlet pressure is maintained at 260 psig. Six runs were performed, two runs using <b>pure</b> <b>steam,</b> two steam-propane runs using 5 : 100 propane:steam mass ratio, and two steam-petroleum distillate runs using 5 : 100 petroleum distillate:steam mass ratio. We develop a simplified analytical model that describes steam front advancement and oil production for the 1 D displacement experiments. The model incorporates heat and material balance, fillup time and Darcy??????s law pertaining to the injection cell. The analytical model results are compared against the experimental data to verify the validity of the model. The main results of the study are as follows. First, experimental results indicate that compared to <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> injection, oil production was accelerated by 30 % for 5 : 100 propane:steam injection and 38 % for 5 : 100 petroleum distillate:steam injection respectively. Second, steam injectivity with steam-propane and steam-petroleum distillate increases to 1. 4 and 1. 9 times respectively, compared with <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> injection. Third, steam front advancement and oil production data are in good agreement with results based on the new analytical model. The analytical model indicates that the oil production acceleration observed is due to oil viscosity reduction resulting from the addition of propane and petroleum distillate to the steam. Oil viscosity at the initial temperature with <b>pure</b> <b>steam</b> injection is 2281 cp, which is reduced to 261 cp with steam-propane injection and 227 cp with steam-petroleum distillate injection...|$|E

40|$|The slow {{alteration}} {{of the surface}} of charred biomass (biochar) over time may contribute to an improved nutrient retention and thus fertility of tropical soils. Here, we investigated soils from temperate climates and investigated whether a technical steam activation of biochar could accelerate its positive effects on nutrient retention and uptake by plants relative to nonactivated biochar. To this aim, we performed microcosm experiments with sandy or silty soil, mixed with 2. 0, 7. 5 and 15. 0 g/kg soil of fine (< 2 mm) or coarse-sized (2 – 10 mm) biochar from beech wood (Fagus sp.). After initial fertilizer (NPK), ashes and excess nutrients were leached with water, and the microcosms were planted for 142 days with Italian Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum ssp. italicum). Thereafter, leachate, soil and plant samples were analysed for their nutrient contents. The results showed that biochar additions of ≤ 15 g/kg soil left elevated contents of available P and N in the surface soil but reduced their uptake into the plants. As a result, total biomass production was unchanged. Different particle size and application amounts influenced these findings only marginally. Nitrate leaching was enhanced in the sandy soil (+ 41 % for nitrate, but reduced in the silty soil − 17 %) and P was immobilized. Hence, the fertility of the temperate soils under study was only marginally affected by <b>pure</b> biochar amendments. <b>Steam</b> activation, however, almost doubled {{the positive effects of}} biochars in all instances, thus being an interesting option for future biochar applications...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTPurposeCoal {{gasification}} {{is complex}} technology, which results depend on many variables, connected among others with fuel, the converting agent {{and the process}} itself. The paper aims to analyze, by means of simulations, {{the influence of the}} following factors – temperature, pressure, characteristic parameters of coal and gasifying agent, on the composition and heating value of the obtained syngas. The other aim of this paper is the determination of gasification efficiency (based on the definition of cold gas efficiency) for various process conditions. MethodsComputer simulations were used as the research method for the work presented. An equilibrium model, based on the stoichiometric method with four independent reactions, was formulated and used in this paper. This model was implemented in Mathematica software. The influence of temperature (in a range from 500 to 1500 °C), pressure (changed from atmospheric to 35 atm), three types of gasifying agent (mixtures of air, <b>pure</b> oxygen and <b>steam)</b> and the composition of four Polish coals (lignite and three hard-coals) on syngas parameters were analyzed in this paper. ResultsConcentrations of CO 2, CO, CH 4, H 2 O, H 2, N 2 in the equilibrium syngas, for the chosen temperature, pressure and parameters of the fuel and converting agent were the results of the simulations carried out. Subsequently, the lower heating value and process efficiency for each syngas composition was calculated. Practical implications: The simulations indicated the thermodynamic limits of gasification and allowed for the formulation of the general principles ruling this process. Resultspresented in this paper may be useful in the preliminary optimization and analysis of coal gasification. They also can be a point of reference for more advanced simulations. Originality/valueThis paper presents own results obtained from equilibrium simulations of coal gasification.
