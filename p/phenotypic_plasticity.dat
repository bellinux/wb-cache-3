5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of <b>phenotypic</b> <b>plasticity</b> the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E
5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>plasticity</b> of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we compare}} the {{reaction}} norms to foliage shade (changes in light quality, spatially fine-grained environmental variation) and photoperiod (day length, spatially coarse-grained environmental variation) in several haplotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana from Scandinavia. We {{found that both}} across-environment means and <b>phenotypic</b> <b>plasticities</b> evolved continuously and very rapidly within this group. Both character means and trait plasticities were highly integrated, in part as predicted by the adaptive plasticity hypothesis for response to foliage shade (the so-called shade-avoidance syndrome). We found that a significant but {{small fraction of the}} variance in across-treatment trait means and plasticities in response to one environmental factor is explained by variation of the same traits in response to the other factor. Genetic relatedness based on chloroplast DNA sequence variation among haplotypes was not associated with variation in across-treatment character means or their plasticities, suggesting that evolution of these characters has occurred on a local geographic scale via reticulation (outcrossing) among maternal lines rather than by the differential survival of selfing lineages...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} {{greatest}} threats to biodiversity, therefore understanding and determining how organisms will respond to potentially rapid environmental change is becoming increasingly important. The impact of {{climate change is}} likely to operate at all levels of biological organisation: from the genome, to biochemical and physiological function; to organismal performance, and to the maintenance of ecosystem services and biodiversity. The challenge ahead for biologists is to predict how organisms will respond and adapt to climate change. To this end, the emerging field of conservation physiology [Wikelski, M. and Cooke, S. J. (2006). Conservation physiology. Trends in Ecol. & Evol. 21, 38 – 46. ] will feature more prominently in future studies and will assist in helping to determine the likely impacts of climate change on organisms.

25|$|<b>Phenotypic</b> <b>plasticity</b> is {{important}} because it allows an individual to adapt to a changing environment and can ultimately alter their evolutionary path. It not only plays an indirect role in defense as individuals prepare themselves physically to take on the task of avoiding predation through camouflage or developing collective mechanical traits to protect a social hive, but also a direct one. For example, cues elicited from a predator, which may be visual, acoustic, chemical, or vibrational, may cause rapid responses that alter the prey’s phenotype in real time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenotypic</b> <b>plasticity</b> is the {{capacity}} of a single genotype to exhibit a range of phenotypes in response to variation in the environment. For example, in Nemoria arizonaria caterpillars, the cryptic pattern changes according to season and is triggered by dietary cues. In the spring, the first brood of caterpillars resembles oak catkins, or flowers. By the summer when the catkins have fallen, the caterpillars discreetly mimic oak twigs. No intermediate forms are present in this species, although {{other members of the}} Nemoria genus, such as N. darwiniata, do exhibit transitional forms.|$|E
30|$|The {{high degree}} of <b>phenotypic</b> and {{functional}} <b>plasticity</b> has been increasingly {{recognized as one of}} the significant properties of CSCs driving therapeutic resistance. We recently reported that breast CSCs display two reversible phenotypic and functional states: an EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition state and an MET, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition state [8]. The transition between these two states in breast CSCs may facilitate breast cancer growth, dissemination and formation of distal metastasis. In this review, we will discuss emerging aspects regarding the plasticity of CSCs, the signaling pathways that regulate this plasticity during tumor growth and the role of CSC plasticity in tumor progression and metastasis. We will also discuss the clinical significance of targeting CSC plasticity.|$|R

40|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{effects of}} rearing temperature on several fitness {{components of the}} koinobiont parasitoid, Aphidius colemani, were examined. Temperatures experienced during development induced a plastic linear response in the dry and fat masses of the immature stage and a non-linear response in the growth rate {{as well as in}} the size of adults. We investigated if the <b>phenotypic</b> morphometrical <b>plasticity</b> exhibited by parasitoids reared at different temperatures can induce variations in fitness-related traits in females. We did not find any difference in immature (pupal) mortality in accordance to rearing temperature. However, when examining adult longevity, we found an inverse linear relation with developmental temperature, confirming the usual rule that larger and fatter wasps live longer than smaller ones. The pattern of female fecundity was non-linear; wasps that developed at high and low temperatures were less productive. We suggest that when development is short, the accumulated reserves are not adequate to support both fecundity and survival. By manipulating adult size through changes in the rearing temperature, we showed that the usual shape of the size/fitness function is not always linear as expected. Developmental temperature induced a plasticity in energy reserves which affected the functional constraints between survival and reproduction...|$|R

Effects that cause or reward a loss in genetic diversity can increase the chances of extinction of a species.

30|$|The {{adaptation}} patterns {{observed in}} our study, including the long-term adaptation, could thus {{be due to}} a combination of a variety of genetic changes and stochastic switching that are either triggered by the harsh environment (Acar et al. 2008) or are already present in a subpopulation (Delvigne and Goffin 2014; Levy et al. 2012).

40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Central {{sensitization}} is {{an important}} phenomenon for pain chronicity and is present in neuropathic pain. This study aimed at addressing some pathophysiological aspects of this phenomenon. CONTENTS: Some extra and intracellular aspects responsible for central sensitization genesis, especially <b>phenotypic</b> changes in <b>plasticity</b> of neurons {{involved in the process}} are described. CONCLUSION: Pain chronicity may result from changes in central nervous system neurons properties by the central sensitization phenomenon with constant changes in membrane excitability, inhibitory transmission reduction and increase in synaptic efficacy mediated by several convergent and divergent molecular mechanisms over a background of phenotypic and structural changes. Neuroplasticity deeply alters painful sensation, contributing for many clinical painful syndromes and may represent a major target for therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in BRAF {{are present}} in the {{majority}} of patients with melanoma, rendering these tumors sensitive to targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance almost invariably develops. Recently, a phenomenon called "phenotype switching" has been identified as an escape route. By switching from a proliferative to an invasive state, melanoma cells can acquire resistance to these targeted therapeutics. Interestingly, phenotype switching bears a striking resemblance to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition that has been described to occur in cancer stem cells in other tumor types. We propose that these changes are manifestations of one and the same underlying feature, namely a dynamic and reversible <b>phenotypic</b> tumor cell <b>plasticity</b> that renders a proportion of cells both more invasive and resistant to therapy. At the same time, the specific characteristics of these tumor cell populations offer potential for being explored as target for therapeutic intervention...|$|R

25|$|The Australian {{painted and}} the painted lady have very similar lifestyles and behaviours, but the Australian painted lady {{lives in an}} arid and {{stressful}} environment.

This demonstrates the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>plasticity,</b> or the tendency for visible traits to vary with changing environmental conditions, of the painted lady butterflies. It also suggests that the painted lady is the ancestral form, and environmental stress slowly drove speciation by adaptation into the Australian painted lady. In other words, the Australian painted lady most likely evolved from the painted lady due to the environmental conditions in Australia.|$|E
25|$|In biology, {{regeneration}} is {{the process}} of renewal, restoration, and growth that makes genomes, cells, organisms, and ecosystems resilient to natural fluctuations or events that cause disturbance or damage. Every species is capable of regeneration, from bacteria to humans. Regeneration can either be complete where the new tissue {{is the same as the}} lost tissue, or incomplete where after the necrotic tissue comes fibrosis. At its most elementary level, regeneration is mediated by the molecular processes of gene regulation. Regeneration in biology, however, mainly refers to the morphogenic processes that characterize the <b>phenotypic</b> <b>plasticity</b> of traits allowing multi-cellular organisms to repair and maintain the integrity of their physiological and morphological states. Above the genetic level, regeneration is fundamentally regulated by asexual cellular processes. Regeneration is different from reproduction. For example, hydra perform regeneration but reproduce by the method of budding.|$|E
40|$|Alveolar macrophages are {{specialised}} resident phagocytes in the alveolus, constituting {{the first}} line of immune cellular defence in the lung. As the lung microenvironment is challenged and remodelled by inhaled pathogens and air particles, so is the alveolar macrophage pool altered by signals that maintain and/or replace its composition.

In this review, we summarise the unique characteristics of the alveolar macrophage pool ontogeny, <b>phenotypic</b> heterogeneity and <b>plasticity</b> during homeostasis, tissue injury and normal ageing. We also discuss new evidence arising from recent studies where investigators described how the epigenetic landscape drives the specific gene expression profile of alveolar macrophages.

In the absence of Hsp 104, Dicer accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions and heterochromatin becomes unstable at elevated temperatures, an epigenetic state inherited for many cell divisions after the heat stress.

25|$|The {{existence}} of CSCs is under debate, because many studies found no cells with their specific characteristics. Cancer cells must {{be capable of}} continuous proliferation and self-renewal to retain the many mutations required for carcinogenesis and to sustain {{the growth of a}} tumor, since differentiated cells (constrained by the Hayflick Limit) cannot divide indefinitely. For therapeutic consideration, if most tumor cells are endowed with stem cell properties, targeting tumor size directly is a valid strategy. If they are a small minority, targeting them may be more effective. Another debate is over the origin of CSCs - whether from disregulation of normal stem cells or from a more specialized population that acquired the ability to self-renew (which is related to the issue of stem cell plasticity). Confounding this debate is the discovery that many cancer cells demonstrate a <b>Phenotypic</b> <b>plasticity</b> under therapeutic challenge, altering their transcriptomes to a more stem-like state to escape destruction.|$|E

40|$|Why {{are some}} traits {{constitutive}} and others inducible? The term costs often appears in work addressing this issue {{but may be}} ambiguously defined. This review distin-guishes two conceptually distinct types of costs: <b>phenotypic</b> costs and <b>plasticity</b> costs. <b>Phenotypic</b> costs are assessed from patterns of covariation, typically between a focal trait and a separate trait relevant to fitness.
