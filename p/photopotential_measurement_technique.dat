The oxide films were obtained by two different procedures: thermal oxidation in air, and anodic oxidation.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of anodic {{dissolution of}} silver and Ag-Au alloys (xAu = 0. 1 – 30 %) in aqueous alkaline solution under the conditions of AgI oxide formation has been examined. Using the techniques of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry it has been established that Ag 2 O anodic formation and cathodic reduction on silver and on alloys of all compositions under review are controlled by Ag+ cation migration in the oxide layer. The oxide film consists of a thin inner layer (apparently AgOH) and of a thicker outer layer Ag 2 O. These layers slightly differ in specific electro-conductivity. Using the <b>photopotential</b> <b>measurements</b> {{it has been shown}} that Ag 2 O oxide is an n-type semiconductor with an excess of silver atoms. The AgI oxide layer formed on monocrystalline Ag(111) is more stoichiometric than the layer formed on polycrystalline Ag...|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} sol-gel and hydrothermal {{method was}} developed for preparing a three-dimensional titanate nanowire network film on titanium substrates to achieve an especial photocathodic protection effect for 403 stainless steel. <b>Photopotential</b> <b>measurements</b> were performed to study the protection effect of the film. The {{results indicated that the}} titanate film exhibited a special all-dimensional uniform porous structure composed of branched titanate nanowires. When we coupled the steel in a 0. 5 M NaCl solution to the titanate film photoanode in a 1. 0 M NaOH solution under illumination, its potential decreased by 560 mV. Especially after the light source was cut off, the photopotential of the steel increased by only 50 - 145 mV, and kept at the lower values than the corrosion potential under dark conditions for over 10 h, indicating that the titanate nanowire network film could produce a striking photocathodic protection effect for 403 stainless steel under illumination and dark conditions.

40|$|The {{performance}} of quantum dot (QD) sensitized solar cells depends mainly on both electron injection from the QDs to the oxide matrix and recombination rates. Here we show a direct correlation between ultrafast carrier dynamics and photoanode (and complete solar cell) performance. TiO 2 nanoparticulate electrodes sensitized with colloidal CdSe QDs are prepared by either direct or linker-assisted adsorption (using cysteine, p-mercaptobenzoic acid, and mercaptopropionic acid). These electrodes are examined by ultrafast carrier dynamics, photopotential, and incident photon-to-current efficiency measurements to unravel factors controlling the efficiency {{in a closed}} solar cell. Subpicosecond time-resolved measurements are carried out {{by means of a}} lens-free heterodyne transient grating technique. In general, faster electron injection is observed for QDs directly adsorbed on TiO 2, which correlates with a better cell performance. Otherwise, increasingly faster electron injection is obtained as QD size decreases, regardless the mode of attachment. <b>Photopotential</b> <b>measurements</b> are performed in either sulfite or polysulfide solutions, in order to isolate different recombination pathways. The slowest recombination is reported for direct adsorption, whereas cysteine-mediated adsorption shows faster recombination.
