40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the intracentre electron junctions in the diamond, silicon and germanium alloyed by the additions of the 3 -rd and 5 -th {{groups has}} been studied. The {{aim is to}} discover {{the existence of the}} long-living excitated states in the mixtures and to investigate the photoelectric and optic phenomena stipulated with the accumulation of the charge carriers in these states. The methods for contact-free diagnostics of the semiconductors have been developed; the cryogenic, microwave, laser and spectroscopic methods of the investigation have been used. It has been determined that the lifetimes of the charge carriers in the most lower excitated states can exceed for much orders the lifetimes of the free carriers. It has been discovered that the accumulation of the carriers in these states leads to the predominance of the jump photoconduction in the strong-alloyed crystals and induced infrared absorption at quant energies being lesser than energy of the addition ionization. The theoretical model of the jump photoconduction with participation of the long-living excitated states of the additions coordinating with experiment has been proposed. The results can be used at development of the added <b>photoresistances</b> on base of the diamond-similar semiconductors, and also in the organizations occupied with the investigations on the kinetics of the electron junctions in the addition semiconductors.

Supplementary {{data for this}} article {{is available in the}} Loughborough Data Repository at doi: 10. 17028 /rd. lboro. 4986233. We report the discovery of remarkable photo-physical phenomena with characteristics unique to epitaxial graphene grown on 6 H-SiC (000 - 1). Surprisingly, the graphene electrical resistance increases under light illumination in contrast to conventional materials where it normally decreases. The resistance shows logarithmic temperature dependences which may be attributed to an Altshuler-Aronov effect. We show that the <b>photoresistance</b> depends on the frequency of the irradiating light, with three lasers (red, green, and violet) used to demonstrate the phenomenon. The counterintuitive rise of the positive <b>photoresistance</b> may be attributed to a creation of trapped charges upon irradiation. We argue that the origin of the <b>photoresistance</b> is related to the texture formed by graphene flakes. The photovoltage also exists and increases with light intensity. However, its value saturates quickly with irradiation and does not change in time. The saturation of the photovoltage may be associated with the formation of a quasi-equilibrium state of the excited electrons and holes associated with a charge redistribution between the graphene and SiC substrate. The obtained physical picture is in agreement with the <b>photoresistance</b> measurements: X-Ray photoelectron spectrometry "XPS", atomic force microscopy "AFM", Raman spectroscopy and the magnetic dependence of photo resistance decay measurements. We also observed non-decaying <b>photoresistance</b> and linear magnetoresistance in magnetic fields up to 1 T.

Most of our observations {{can be explained}} in terms of indirect electron transitions using a new, ``combined'' resonant condition.

To solve this doubt, a new scheme for measuring magneto-optical (MO) effect is developed, called magnetic <b>photoresistance</b> circular dichroism (PR-MCD), which detects the differential <b>photoresistance</b> of materials between two circularly polarized excitations. That allows us to detect the MO effect induced only by interband transitions, and provide unambiguous evidence that the host semiconductor band structure is indeed modified by the strong exchange interactions.

Through microwave <b>photoresistance</b> measurements, the in- and out-of-plane precessing angles of the magnetization are determined and enabled for the exact determination of the injected pure spin current. This method is demonstrated with an almost perfect Lorentz line-shape for the obtained ISHE signal and the frequency independent SHA value as predicted by theory.

40|$|International audienceNumerous {{research}} efforts {{are investigating the}} possibility of using light interactions with metallic nanoparticles to improve the fluorescence properties of nearby molecules. Few investigations have considered the encapsulation of molecules in metallic nanocavities. In this paper, we present the optical properties of new hybrid nanoparticles consisting of gold nanoshells and fluorescent organic dyes in their liquid cores. Microspectroscopy on single nanoparticle demonstrates that the extinction spectra are in good agreement with Mie's theory. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) calculations reveal that excitation and emission radiations are efficiently transmitted through the thin gold nanoshells. Thus, they can be considered as transparent plasmonic nanocontainers for photoactive cores. In agreement with FDTD calculations, measurements show that fluorophores encapsulated in gold nanoshells keep their brightness, but they show fluorescence lifetimes 1 order of magnitude shorter. As a salient consequence, the <b>photoresistance</b> of encapsulated organic dyes is also improved by an order of magnitude.

40|$|We study {{experimentally}} the photoconductivity of CdS-CdSe sintered granular films {{obtained by}} the screen printing method. We mostly focus on the dependences of photoconductivity on film's microstructure, which varies with changing heat-treatment conditions. The maximum photoconductivity is found for samples with compact packing of individual grains, which nevertheless are separated by gaps. Such a microstructure is typical for films heat-treated during an intermediate (optimal) time. In order to understand whether the dominant mechanism of charge transfer is identical with the one in monocrystals, we perform temperature measurements of <b>photoresistance.</b> Corresponding curves have the same peculiar nonmonotonic shape as in CdSe monocrystals, from which we conclude that the basic mechanism is also the same. It is suggested that the optimal heat-treatment time appears {{as a result of}} a competition between two mechanisms: improvement of film's connectivity and its oxidation. <b>Photoresistance</b> is also measured in vacuum and in helium atmosphere, which suppress oxygen and water absorption/chemisorption at intergrain boundaries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fast and {{reversible}} modulation of {{ion flow}} through nanosized apertures {{is important for}} many nanofluidic applications, including sensing and separation systems. Here, we present the first demonstration of a reversible plasmon-controlled nanofluidic valve. We show that plasmonic nanopores (solid-state nanopores integrated with metal nanocavities) {{can be used as}} a fluidic switch upon optical excitation. We systematically investigate the effects of laser illumination of single plasmonic nanopores and experimentally demonstrate <b>photoresistance</b> switching where fluidic transport and ion flow are switched on or off. This is manifested as a large (∼ 1 − 2 orders of magnitude) increase in the ionic nanopore resistance and an accompanying current rectification upon illumination at high laser powers (tens of milliwatts). At lower laser powers, the resistance decreases monotonically with increasing power, followed by an abrupt transition to high resistances at a certain threshold power. A similar rapid transition, although at a lower threshold power, is observed when the power is instead swept from high to low power. This hysteretic behavior is found to be dependent on the rate of the power sweep. The <b>photoresistance</b> switching effect is attributed to plasmon-induced formation and growth of nanobubbles that reversibly block the ionic current through the nanopore from one side of the membrane. This explanation is corroborated by finite-element simulations of a nanobubble in the nanopore that show the switching and the rectification...|$|E
