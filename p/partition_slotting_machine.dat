40|$|When {{entering}} the casino gaming area, gamers {{are faced with}} hundreds of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> that vary in terms of themes, colours and sounds. Some gaming situations are characterized by low gamer involvement, but with considerable brand differences. Gamers visiting a casino {{have the option to}} play on various types of <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> <b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> games range from single-bar to triple-bar combinations that range in themes and symbols. Some gamers prefer to play on the same <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> game each time they visit the casino; while other gamers often do <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> switching. The hypothesis set for {{this study was to determine}} if any differences exist between male and female <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers regarding the way they perceive theme as a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> attribute. The sample population identified consists of <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers busy playing at a specific <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> in the gaming area of the casino. Cluster sampling was used in the selection of the six South African casinos. A total of six hundred and thirty structured questionnaires were obtained through personal interviews in the gaming areas of the casinos. The raw data collected were statistically analysed on the SPSS program. The main findings of the research indicated that no significant differences exist between male and female <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers regarding the way they perceive theme as a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> attribute. The findings of this study could assist the casino management and <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturers in understanding how themes as <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> attributes influence gamers. By understanding the importance of themes for <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gamers can assist casino management and <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturers in the development of new <b>slot</b> <b>machines...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Slot Variance [...] At {{the heart}} of <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{gameplay}} {{is the concept of}} slot variance (or slot volatility) that is fundamental to how a <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> ‘feels’ to play. Slot variance is a measure of risk associated with playing a <b>slot</b> <b>machine.</b> A low variance <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> has regular but smaller wins and a high variance <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> has fewer but bigger wins.|$|R
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{computer}} technology in bingo has blurred the lines between traditional <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and bingo <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> To the average person, bingo-based <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> are physically indistinguishable from an RNG based <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> typically seen in Atlantic City or Las Vegas. These devices are commonly called Class II machines, because the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act separated bingo, including electronic and mechanical aids, where players play against each other, from Class III <b>slot</b> <b>machines,</b> where player play against the house.|$|R

50|$|In late 1969, Okada’s {{first visit}} to Las Vegas led to his {{decision}} to enter the business of <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturing. He invented the “near-miss” feature in his <b>slot</b> <b>machines,</b> an innovation that helped expand the Japanese market of “pachislot” (a hybrid of Japan’s pachinko and Las Vegas <b>slot</b> <b>machines)</b> and also made Okada’s <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> popular in Las Vegas.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{the public}} and private {{availability}} of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> is highly regulated by state governments. Many states have established gaming control boards to regulate the possession and use of <b>slot</b> <b>machines.</b> Nevada is the only state that has no significant restrictions against <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> both for public and private use. In New Jersey, <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> are only allowed in hotel casinos operated in Atlantic City. Several states (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana and Missouri) allow <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> (as well as any casino-style gambling) only on licensed riverboats or permanently anchored barges. Since Hurricane Katrina, Mississippi has removed the requirement that casinos on the Gulf Coast operate on barges and now allows them on land along the shoreline. Delaware allows <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> at three horse tracks; they are regulated by the state lottery commission.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to assess the {{influence}} of table games on <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> and total casino revenues. The subjects of the analysis are 24 rierboat casinos in the midwestern states of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri and three racinos in Iowa. A racino is a parimutuel racetrack which also offers <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> gaming to its customers. Two econometric models were developed, one for <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> revenue and one for total (<b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> plus table game) revenue at riverboats and racinos. Of particular interest is the effect on <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> and total revenue of adding table games to the gaming operation. <b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> revenue was found to increase with the number of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and decrease with the number of table games. <b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> revenue was estimated to decrease by 11. 5 % in the presence of 40 table games, the mean number of table games over the sample. Total win was found to increase with an increase in both <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and table games. The elasticity of total win with respect to the number of <b>slot</b> <b>machines</b> and table games was estimated to be 0. 786 and 0. 219, respectively. Total revenue was estimated to increase by 24. 5 % for an additional 40 table games. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slot</b> <b>machine</b> {{games have}} become the most popular form of {{gambling}} worldwide. In Finland, their pervasiveness in public spaces and popularity makes them {{one of the most}} common form of gaming. However, in game studies, gambling games are often regarded as borderline games due to the player’s lack of control. In this thesis I ask whether modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games can be considered as games and if so, what similarities there are between them and contemporary video games. To find out if modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games are in fact games, I compare their features with influential definitions of game and play. After this, I utilize an analysis framework derived from the method of close reading to analyze a popular Finnish video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> game Emma. The comparison between modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games and the various definitions of game and play reveals that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games fit very well into these definitions, and thus they can be considered as games. This notion enables them to be analyzed with game analysis methods. The analysis showed that modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games feature many elements that are commonly found in traditional video games, such as contextual aesthetics, narratives, interaction, as well as some form of player control via choices. Research regarding <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games as games is scarce despite their many intriguing elements that cross disciplinary borders. Modern video <b>slot</b> <b>machine</b> games have evolved into a form of complex digital entertainment, which calls for open-minded collaboration of game studies and gambling studies in particular, but many other disciplines as well...|$|R
