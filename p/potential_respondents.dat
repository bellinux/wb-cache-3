5000|$|At a {{transition}} relevance place (TRP) {{which is a}} place in the conversation in where who is speaking shifts, a set of rules apply in quick succession so that turns are allocated instantly: 1. Current speaker selects next speaker: this can be done by the use of addressing terms (e.g. names), initiating action with eye contact, initiating action that limits the potential eligible respondents and the availability of environmental cues (e.g. requesting the passing of salt in a situation where only a particular person is sitting close to the salt). 2. Next speaker self-selects: when there is no apparent addressee and <b>potential</b> <b>respondents,</b> one might self-select to continue the conversation. This can be done by overlapping, using turn-entry devices such as [...] "well" [...] or [...] "you know"; and recycled turn beginning, which is a practice that involves repeating the part of a turn beginning that gets absorbed in an overlap.3. Current speaker continues: If no one takes up the conversation, the original speaker may again speak to provide further information to aid the continuation of the conversation. This can be done by adding an increment, which is a grammatically fitted continuation of an already completed turn construction unit (TCU). Alternatively, the speaker can choose to start a new TCU, usually to offer clarification or to start a new topic.|$|E

In recent years, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a federally sponsored annual survey that gathers data on substance use and abuse among the non-institutionalized household population of the United States, has seen an increase in the amount of nonresponse attributed to controlled access. Through this experience, NSDUH researchers have developed protocols for overcoming barriers to data collection.

The selection of participants was based on purposive sampling based on their extensive knowledge and experience. In order to find participants, we established rapport with members of the pastoral community through visits and interactions. We visited cattle posts and examined watering points.

Mannitol and hypertonic saline are therapeutic options for intracranial hypertension occurring in the acute phase of care. However, current practices of emergency physicians are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a self-administered survey of emergency physicians {{in the province of}} Québec, Canada, to understand their attitudes surrounding the use of hyperosmolar solutions in patients with severe {{traumatic brain}} injury. Using information from a systematic review of hypertonic saline solutions and experts' opinion, we developed a questionnaire following a systematic approach (items generation and reduction). We tested the questionnaire for face and content validity, and test-retest reliability. Physicians were identified through the department head of each eligible level I and II trauma centers. We administered the survey using a web-based interface and planned email reminders. RESULTS: We received 210 questionnaires out of 429 <b>potentials</b> <b>respondents</b> (response rate 49 %). Most respondents worked in level II trauma centers (69 %). Fifty-three percent (53 %) of emergency physicians stated using hypertonic saline to treat severe {{traumatic brain injury}}. Most reported using hyperosmolar therapy in the presence of severe traumatic brain injury and unilateral reactive mydriasis, midline shift or cistern compression on brain computed tomography. CONCLUSION: Hyperosmolar therapy is believed being broadly used by emergency physicians in Quebec following severe traumatic brain injury.

This research investigated {{the process by which}} individuals make decisions about opening and reading versus deleting electronic mail and also assessed attitudes towards electronic mail surveys. The sample received an electronic mail message followed by a telephone interview.

Those interviewed reacted favorably to electronic mail surveys for scientific research despite issues of anonymity. However, respondents overwhelmingly described a dislike for commercially based electronic mail surveys. Tracy L.

For the experimental group, a message was left informing {{them about the}} study and promising a call-back; for the control group, no message was left.

If the <b>potential</b> <b>respondent</b> is at home and using the machine to screen out unwanted calls, a message may convince him or her that the call is for worthy research purposes and motivate acceptance of the call.
