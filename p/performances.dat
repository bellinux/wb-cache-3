40|$|Abstract — <b>Performance</b> {{regression}} testing detects <b>performance</b> regressions {{in a system}} under load. Such regressions refer to situations where software <b>performance</b> degrades compared to previous releases, although the new version behaves correctly. In current practice, <b>performance</b> analysts must manually analyze <b>performance</b> {{regression testing}} data to uncover <b>performance</b> regressions. This process is both time-consuming and error-prone due to the large volume of metrics collected, the absence of formal <b>performance</b> objectives and the subjectivity of individual <b>performance</b> analysts. In this paper, we present an automated approach to detect potential <b>performance</b> regressions in a <b>performance</b> regression test. Our approach compares the test results against correlations among <b>performance</b> metrics extracted from <b>performance</b> regression testing repositories. Our approach scales well to large industrial systems, and detects <b>performance</b> problems that are often overlooked by <b>performance</b> analysts...|$|R

This chapter presents a functional taxonomy of <b>performance</b> that incorporates <b>performance</b> outcomes, <b>performance</b> drivers, and their evalua-tion In addition, implications for practice are discussed. erformance is multidimensional and usually poorly defined. People say that individuals perform, departments perform, organizations perform, groups perform, animals perform, and machines per-form. So what does it mean when people use the terms <b>performance</b> and <b>performance</b> improvement? More importantly, what should the perfor-mance improvement professions mean when they talk about these ideas? The purpose of this chapter is to specify the domains of <b>performance.</b> A taxonomy of <b>performance</b> is proposed that integrates diverse perspec-tives of <b>performance</b> important to the profession. This taxonomy clarifies the distinction between <b>performance,</b> <b>performance</b> outcomes, and per-formance drivers. It has application in the professions committed to per-formance improvement (PI). Perspectives on <b>Performance</b> Many professions are interested in <b>performance</b> and <b>performance</b> improvement.
