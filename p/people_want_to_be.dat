500|$|Approximately 41,000 {{tickets to}} the game were made {{available}} to the general public, selling out within 30 minutes of being made available on September 18, 2007. In the face of controversy about the quickness of ticket sales, an official spokesperson for the Sabres called it [...] "a testament to how popular the Sabres are and how many <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the event."

500|$|Although he {{had done}} {{research}} on pandemics six {{months prior to the}} 2009 flu pandemic, the outbreak was [...] "really helpful" [...] to his studies, because it provided a glimpse of the societal apparatus following the onset stages of a pandemic. To him, it was not solely the virus itself that one had to be concerned about, but how society handles the situation. [...] "I saw them come to life", Burns said, [...] "and I saw issues about, 'Well, do you close the schools and if you close the schools, then who stays home with the kids? And will everyone keep their kids at home?' Things happening online, which is where the Jude Law character came from, that there's going to be information that comes out online where <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ahead of the curve, so some people will write things about anti-virals or different treatment protocols, and so there's always going to be an information and that information also has sort of a viral pulse." ...|$|E
500|$|... "All Around the World" [...] {{is a song}} by Canadian singer Justin Bieber, {{from his}} third studio album, Believe (2012). It was written by Bieber, Sir Nolan and Nasri of The Messengers in {{collaboration}} with Ludacris, who guest features. This was the second collaboration between Bieber and Ludacris, having previously collaborated on [...] "Baby" [...] (2010). It was first released on June 4, 2012, as a promotional single from the album. The song was released as the fourth international single, and the fifth and final US single on February 26, 2013. The Eurodance track features a similar instrumentation to songs by Britney Spears, Chris Brown and Usher. Lyrically, it features Bieber singing to his love interest that [...] "all around the world, <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved". [...] "All Around the World" [...] received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who welcomed the song's Eurodance style. The song had moderate success worldwide, reaching the top ten in several countries, such as Belgium, Canada and Norway. Bieber promoted the song through live performances and a music video.|$|E

500|$|It is an Eurodance song, which {{incorporates}} heavy synth-pop {{elements in}} its instrumentation and {{is similar to}} previous works by producer David Guetta. Contemporary critics compared the track to Britney Spears' [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] (2011) and Chris Brown's [...] "Beautiful People" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Bieber sings for his love interest and says that [...] "all around the world, <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved". The track opens with he singing, [...] "You're beautiful, beautiful/You should know it/I think it's time, think it's time/That you show it", lines that were compared to One Direction's [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] (2011). As the track follows, Bieber encourages girls to release their inner beauty: [...] "Light it up, so explosive/Why you acting so shy, holding back/DJ bring that back." [...] During the rap section, Ludacris references their previous collaboration on [...] "Baby" [...] (2010), saying, [...] "Once again, the dynamic duo is back at it!/ JB, Ludacris!/ I love everything about you/ You're imperfectly perfect/ Everyone's itching for beauty/But they're just scratching the surface." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{criticism}} often {{leveled against}} the Western Rite {{is based on}} the fact that the majority of the members of Western Rite parishes are converts to Orthodoxy. The argument states that Christians want to be Orthodox but [...] "not too Orthodox" [...] so they keep their familiar rites under a new bishop. The unstated assumption behind this argument, however, is similar to the argument against all non-Byzantine liturgical traditions: that the Orthodox Church includes only the Byzantine Rite and if <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> truly Orthodox they must also be Byzantine.|$|E

2500|$|Lichtblau and John {{illustrate}} {{the split between}} the German and Jewish communities with a sample from one of Straucher's parliamentary speeches, which reads: [...] "Why [...] are the Germans engaged in an economic and political war against the Jews?

And nevertheless we remain friends of the German people because we are admirers of the prodigious German culture.

[...] Straucher also reacted against the claims of Viennese politicians that Bukovina was destitute and [...] "semi-asiatic", deeming them [...] "most unfair".

6000|$|But {{the point}} is that a story is {{exciting}} because it has in it so strong an element of will, of what theology calls free-will. You cannot finish a sum how you like. But you can finish a story how you like. When somebody discovered the Differential Calculus there was only one Differential Calculus he could discover. But when Shakespeare killed Romeo he might have married him to Juliet's old nurse if he had felt inclined. And Christendom has excelled in the narrative romance exactly because it has insisted on the theological free-will. It is a large matter and too much {{to one side of the}} road to be discussed adequately here; but this is the real objection to that torrent of modern talk about treating crime as disease, about making a prison merely a hygienic environment like a hospital, of healing sin by slow scientific methods. The fallacy of the whole thing is that evil is a matter of active choice whereas disease is not. If you say that you are going to cure a profligate as you cure an asthmatic, my cheap and obvious answer is, [...] "Produce the people who want to be asthmatics as many <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> profligates." [...] A man may lie still and be cured of a malady. But he must not lie still if he wants to be cured of a sin; on the contrary, he must get up and jump about violently. The whole point indeed is perfectly expressed in the very word which we use for a man in hospital; [...] "patient" [...] is in the passive mood; [...] "sinner" [...] is in the active. If a man is to be saved from influenza, he may be a patient. But if he is to be saved from forging, he must be not a patient but an IMPATIENT. He must be personally impatient with forgery. All moral reform must start in the active not the passive will.|$|E
6000|$|Spiders of {{both sexes}} kept their nets at Gretna Green, but a tragedy was only enacted at the hall between a score of comedies; and they were {{generally}} love-sick youths and maidens who interrupted the priest to ask if {{that was not the}} [...] "so--sound of wh--wheels on the gravel walk?" [...] A couple whom it would almost have been a satisfaction to marry without a fee (for the mere example of the thing) was that which raced from the south of England with the lady's father. When they reached the top of a hill his arms were gesticulating at the bottom, and they never turned one corner without seeing his steaming horse take another. Poor was the fond lover (dark his prospects at Gretna Green in consequence) but brave the maid, to whom her friends would insist on leaving money, which was the cause of the whole to-do. The father, looking on the swain with suspicious eye, took to dreaming of postillions, high-roads, blacksmiths and Gretna Green. He would not suffer his daughter to move from his sight, and even to dances he escorted her in his private carriage, returning for her (for he was a busy man) at night. Quick of invention were the infuriated lovers. Threading the mazes of a dance, the girl was one evening snatched from her partner's arms by the announcement that her father's carriage barred the way below. A hurried explanation of why he had come so soon, a tripping down the stairs with trembling limbs into a close coach, a maiden in white in her lover's arms, and hey-ho for Gretna Green. Jardine is mellowed with a gentle cynicism, and sometimes he breaks off in his reminiscences to wonder what <b>people</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married for. The Springfield priest, he chuckles, is a blacksmith at whom love cannot afford to laugh. Ay, friend Jardine, but what about the blacksmith who laughs at love? ...|$|E
