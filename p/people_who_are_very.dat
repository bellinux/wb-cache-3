25|$|BMI is {{particularly}} inaccurate for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> fit or athletic, as their high muscle mass can classify {{them in the}} overweight category by BMI, even though their body fat percentages frequently fall in the 10–15% category, which is below that of a more sedentary person of average build who has a normal BMI number. Body composition for athletes is often better calculated using measures of body fat, as determined by such techniques as skinfold measurements or underwater weighing and the limitations of manual measurement have also led to new, alternative methods to measure obesity, such as the body volume index.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} have an {{uncomplicated}} skin abscess should not use antibiotics. Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of cellulitis, symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing immunosuppression. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> young or very old may also need antibiotics. If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is {{in a place that}} is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that between people, Ebola disease spreads only by {{direct contact with the}} blood or other body fluids of a person who has developed symptoms of the disease. Body fluids that may contain Ebola viruses include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine and semen. The WHO states that only <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> sick are able to spread Ebola disease in saliva, and whole virus has not been reported to be transmitted through sweat. Most people spread the virus through blood, feces and vomit. Entry points for the virus include the nose, mouth, eyes, open wounds, cuts and abrasions. Ebola may be spread through large droplets; however, this {{is believed}} to occur only when a person is very sick. This contamination can happen if a person is splashed with droplets. Contact with surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus, particularly needles and syringes, may also transmit the infection. The virus is able to survive on objects for a few hours in a dried state, and can survive for a few days within body fluids outside of a person.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Professor of Bioethics Arthur Caplan stated, [...] "Look, I {{think you}} can make the {{connections}} that...they are using prisoners, and they need prisoners who are relatively healthy, they need prisoners who are relatively younger. It doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination that some Falun Gong [...] are going to be among those {{who are going to be}} killed for parts. It just follows, because remember you can't take very old people as sources of organs and you can't take <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> sick. They, Falun Gong, are in part younger, and by lifestyle, healthier. I would be astounded if they weren't using some of those prisoners as sources of organs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clear Channel Communications, {{owner of}} many popular radio {{stations}} and affiliated with Super Bowl broadcaster CBS, had also censored or removed many songs from radio following the event, including blacklisting Jackson from receiving airplay as well as focusing on editing rock radio formats in particular. Rolling Stone stated [...] "Stations all over the country, the petition notes, are dropping or editing dozens of songs, including the Who's 'Who Are You,' Lou Reed's 'Walk on the Wild Side,' Pearl Jam's 'Jeremy' and John Mellencamp's 'Jack and Diane.' According to the petition, a Clear Channel programmer combed through the song database for five Denver stations and made changes to everything from Steve Miller's 'Jet Airliner' to Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer.' Cleveland classic-rock station WNCX 98.5 has yanked Warren Zevon's 'Lawyers, Guns and Money,' Pink Floyd's 'Money' and several other classics. 'It's absurd,' says Reed. 'It's like being censored by a squirrel. It's beneath me, it's beneath all these artists. It's done by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> pious and stupid.'" [...] Clear Channel Communications also removed talk-radio host Howard Stern from several of its large-market radio stations within a month of the incident, citing the raunchy content of Stern's show. The FCC fined Clear Channel over allegedly indecent content on the Bubba the Love Sponge radio show. As {{a result of the}} incident, some networks established regulations requiring time delays of as much as five minutes for live broadcasts such as awards shows and sporting events. In late 2004, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the maximum FCC fine penalty from said US$27,500 to US$500,000 per violation; the United States Senate voted to decrease it to US$275,000 per incident, with a cap of US$3 million per day. By June 2006, the two houses reconciled the differences in fine levels, settling for a fine of US$325,000 per violation in the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{continuing}} debate {{about the extent of}} anti-Semitic prejudice {{to be found in the}} views of Gilbert and Cecil Chesterton as well as of Belloc.

60|$|Once more a {{sense of}} the irony of the {{position}} overcame Geoffrey, and he smiled grimly as he lit his candle and went to bed. At {{the back of the house}} was a long passage, which terminated at one end in the room where he slept, and at the other in that occupied by Elizabeth and Beatrice. This passage was lit by two windows, and built out of it were two more rooms--that of Mr. Granger, and another which had been Effie's. The windows of the passage, like most of the others in the Vicarage, were innocent of shutters, and Geoffrey stood for a moment at one of them, watching the lightning illumine the broad breast of the mountain behind. Then looking towards the door of Beatrice's room, he gazed at it with the peculiar reverence that sometimes afflicts <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> much in love, and, with a sigh, turned and sought his own.|$|E

If they are sincere, and are moved by any real danger of the loss of Southern trade, they will simply get their names on the white list, and then, instead of persuading Republicans to do likewise, they will be glad to keep you away! Don't you see that they cut off competition? They would not be whispering around to Republicans to come in and share the profits with them. But if they are not sincere, and are merely trying to fool Republicans out of their votes, they will grow very anxious about your pecuniary prospects; they are afraid {{you are going to get}} broken up and ruined; they do not care about Democratic votes, oh, no, no, no!

60|$|The {{genius of}} old Siena, however, would make little of any stress of such distinctions; one {{representative}} of a far-off social platitude being about as much in order as another as he stands before the great loggia of the Casino di Nobili, the club of the best society. The nobility, which is very numerous and very rich, is still, says the apparently competent native I began by quoting, perfectly feudal and uplifted and separate. Morally and intellectually, behind the walls of its palaces, the fourteenth century, it's thrilling to think, hasn't ceased to hang on. There is no bourgeoisie to speak of; immediately after the aristocracy come the poor <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> poor indeed. My friend's account of these matters made me wish more than ever, as a lover of the preserved social specimen, of type at almost any price, that one weren't, a helpless victim of the historic sense, reduced simply to staring at black stones and peeping up stately staircases; and that when one had examined the street-face of the palace, Murray in hand, one might {{walk up to the}} great drawing- room, make one's bow to the master and mistress, the old abbe and the young count, and invite them to favour one with a sketch of their social philosophy or a few first-hand family anecdotes.|$|E

50|$|In {{the town}} of Okeno, an old tanuki settled down in the cellar of a soy sauce shop, and laying waste to the {{agricultural}} produce, it turned into an ōnyūdō and performed misdeeds like menacing <b>people.</b> The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> trouble about this made a doll of an ōnyūdō to oppose it, but the tanuki then became an ōnyūdō that was even bigger than the doll.

It is not possible to make great buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself, places where you feel alive, except by following this way.
