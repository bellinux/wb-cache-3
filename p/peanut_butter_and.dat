5|$|A fluffernutter is a {{sandwich}} made with <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> marshmallow fluff usually served on white bread. Variations of the sandwich include {{the substitution of}} wheat bread {{and the addition of}} various sweet, salty and savory ingredients. The term fluffernutter {{can also be used to}} describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> marshmallow fluff.|$|E

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to <b>peanut</b> <b>butter,</b> <b>and</b> the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|The term fluffernutter {{has also}} been used to {{describe}} other foods that feature <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> marshmallow fluff, including Fluffernutter cookies, bars and cupcakes. Durkee-Mower, the company that produces Marshmallow Fluff, a brand of marshmallow fluff, produces a cookbook that features recipes for Fluffernutter bars, frosting, pie and a shake. In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> Marshmallow Fluff in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also {{the name of a}} candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{was first}} {{created in the}} early twentieth century after marshmallow creme, a sweet marshmallow-like spread, was invented in Massachusetts. During World War I, a recipe for a <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> marshmallow creme sandwich, the earliest known example of the sandwich, was published. The term “fluffernutter” was created by an advertising agency in 1960 as a more effective way to market the sandwich.|$|E

5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War I hurt {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E

Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops, and from sources as diverse as <b>peanut</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> cannabis. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chillies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices intended for human or animal consumption.
