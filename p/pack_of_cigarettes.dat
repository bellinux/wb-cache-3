5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the tension}} between them, James leaves {{to go for a}} drive and {{purchase}} a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. When she returns to the living room, she sees the smoke alarm now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house. When she hears a noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a knife, and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask, staring at her. Panicked, she stumbles into the hallway, and watches as the front door opens. When she goes to push [...] the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now wearing a doll mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears people outside banging violently against the walls of the house.|$|E

[...] However, in October 2012, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev commenced an anti-tobacco strategy that has led to proposals from the Russian Health Ministry to cease advertising, increase tax on cigarette sales and ban smoking in public spaces. The Prime Minister lamented the smoking death rate in the country with 400,000 citizens dying every year of smoking-related causes and this is also compounded by the fact that a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> in Russia typically costs around the £1 mark.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} claimed the {{cigarette}} brand Lucky Strike is {{so named because}} every so often, a consumer of the product would have a [...] "lucky strike," [...] finding a marijuana spliff in a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> The rumor varies in how often the marijuana cigarette would be included, anywhere from one in every thousand cartons to one in every pack. It is unclear when this myth originated; Snopes.com claims it has been floating around for [...] "many years." [...] Lucky Strike's slogan [...] "It's Toasted" [...] fueled belief in the myth further ('toasted' being one slang term for being high on marijuana). Despite {{the popularity of the}} myth, there are no reliable reports of any Lucky Strike cigarette containing marijuana. The name [...] "Lucky Strike," [...] in reality, is only a marketing ploy, implying to customers that obtaining their brand is a [...] "Lucky Strike." [...] The [...] "It's Toasted" [...] slogan refers to the product's tobacco being toasted instead of sun-dried, making a supposedly better-tasting product.|$|E
2500|$|Born to Bernard Hopkins, Sr. and {{his wife}} Shirley, Bernard grew up {{with his family in}} the Raymond Rosen housing project in Philadelphia. Hopkins turned to crime early in his life. [...] By the age of {{thirteen}} he was mugging people and had been stabbed three times. At seventeen, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in Graterford Prison for nine felonies. While in prison he witnessed the murder of another inmate in an argument over a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> but also discovered his passion for boxing. After serving almost five years, Hopkins was released from prison in 1988. He then decided to use boxing as an escape from his previous life, and converted to Islam. While Hopkins was leaving the prison for the final time, the warden told him he'd [...] "see [...] again when you wind up back in here", to which Hopkins replied [...] "I ain't ever coming back here."

2500|$|Another event dubbed a [...] "Battle of the Sexes" [...] {{took place}} during the 1998 Australian Open between Karsten Braasch and the Williams sisters. Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world's top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, {{challenged}} them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as [...] "a man whose training regime centered around a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager". The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park, after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2. Braasch said afterwards, [...] "500 and above, no chance". He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th {{in order to keep the}} game [...] "fun". Braasch said the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier, and that men put spin on the ball that the women can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.|$|E
2500|$|Blue was {{an almost}} instant {{critical}} and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced [...] "Carey" [...] was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of Blue departed further from the sounds of Ladies of the Canyon. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions ("All I Want", [...] "A Case of You"), while others such as [...] "Blue", [...] "River" [...] and [...] "The Last Time I Saw Richard" [...] were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, Mitchell later said of Blue, [...] "I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup,... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, {{but at the time}} of Blue, our pop stars never admitted these things." [...] In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in [...] "California"). Mitchell later remarked, [...] "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{countries}} {{where there is}} a universally funded healthcare system, the government covers the cost of medical care for smokers who become ill through smoking in the form of increased taxes. Two broad debating positions exist on this front, the [...] "pro-smoking" [...] argument suggesting that heavy smokers generally don't live long enough to develop the costly and chronic illnesses which affect the elderly, reducing society's healthcare burden, and the [...] "anti-smoking" [...] argument suggests that the healthcare burden is increased because smokers get chronic illnesses younger and at a higher rate than the general population. [...] Data on both positions has been contested. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published research in 2002 claiming that the cost of each <b>pack</b> <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> sold in the United States was more than $7 in medical care and lost productivity. The cost may be higher, with another study putting it as high as $41 per pack, most of which however is on the individual and his/her family. This is how one author of that study puts it when he explains the very low cost for others: [...] "The reason the number is low is that for private pensions, Social Security, and Medicare — the biggest factors in calculating costs to society — smoking actually saves money. Smokers die at a younger age and don't draw on the funds they've paid into those systems." [...] Other research demonstrates that premature death caused by smoking may redistribute Social Security income in unexpected ways that affect behavior and reduce the economic well-being of smokers and their dependents. To further support this, whatever the rate of smoking [...] consumption [...] is per day, smokers have a greater lifetime medical cost on average compared to a non smoker by an estimated $6000 [...] Between the cost for lost productivity and health care expenditures combined, cigarette smoking costs at least 193 billion dollars (Research also shows that smokers earn less money than nonsmokers). As for secondhand smoke, the cost is over 10 billion dollars.|$|E
