40|$|Measurements of {{potential}} gradient, <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> {{and rate of}} rainfall were made at ground level and simultaneously measurements {{of potential}} gradient and <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> were attempted {{at the top of}} a 22 m mast. On the mast reliable measurements of <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> could not be obtained and the calibration of the field mill proved difficult. An attempt was made to calculate its exposure factor and response to low level space charge by numerical methods. Some success was achieved in this and the mill was found to be about half as sensitive to space charges below it as it was to those above, which halved the experimental arrangement's sensitivity as a space charge detector. Despite this space charges of several hundred picocoulombs per cubic metre were observed when the potential gradient exceeded about 800 Vm(^- 1). On one occasion it was possible to show that the space charge was produced by corona discharge from a group of trees. The <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> at ground level could be adequately described by the equation I = - 2. 6 R(F - 112) pAm(^- 2) where R is in mm min(^- 1) and F in Vm(^- 1). Although no direct measurements of variations of <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> with height could be made it was clear that the rain sometimes did gain charge close to the ground by collecting local space charge...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{records of}} <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> density, {{potential}} gradient and wind speed {{have been obtained}} with mobile equipment mounted on a Land-Rover and with fixed equipment located at a field station in the Pennines. Measurements were made in quiet precipitation with {{the two sets of}} equipment separated by horizontal distances of up to 8 km in a direction in line with the cloud movement. Maximum cross-correlation between the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> density records at the two stations was usually for time lags corresponding to the time of travel of the clouds between the stations. On one occasion of low wind speed, simultaneous <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> correlation was obtained at the two stations when separated by 5 km. It was deduced that the time variations of electrical parameters observed at a ground station would normally be the result of movement of the cloud system rather than its electrical development. Analysis of the effects of wind speed has shown that rain electrification is more intense at sites more exposed to the wind and that the effects may be due to a process operating from ground level up to a height of several hundred metres. The persistence of potential gradient and of <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> density {{has been shown to be}} inversely proportional to cloud speed. The horizontal dimensions of cloud across which persistence exists at a given point in time has been shown to be independent of wind speed and to be of the order of several kilometres. It is suggested that these dimensions may be a characteristic of cloud type and may be used as a criterion for their identification. A theoretical model to explain the electrical structure of nimbostratus clouds has been proposed, and it has been shown to be consistent with observations. The model satisfactorily explains the inverse relation between <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> density and potential gradient and it explains observed differences in phase between precipitation current-time and potential gradient-time curves in terms of the periodicity of the electrical changes within the cloud...|$|E

An investigation into these effects {{was carried out by}} making measurements of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> and potential gradient {{at the top of a}} mast and simultaneously at ground level. Unfortunately the investigation was "brought to a premature end and the potential gradient measurements were rendered ambiguous through difficulties encountered when calibrating the instrument to be used on the mast. It was possible however to detect the presence of some space charge. The current at the top of the mast was found to be several times greater than that at the ground and their variations did not correspond exactly, suggesting that some charging process was operating in the lower 30 m of the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Early {{workers in}} Atmospheric Electricity, {{found that in}} steady {{continuous}} rain, when fields were in the range ± 400 V/m, the Potential Gradients {{at the top and}} bottom, of a high mast were positive and negative, respectively, giving a charge at top and bottom of negative and positive. This indicates the presence of negative space charge in the layers of air between the ground and the top of the mast. As yet this phenomena has received no satisfactory explanation and the problem in hand was to investigate the origin of this negative space charge. The proposed idea was to measure <b>precipitation</b> <b>currents</b> at the ground and at various heights above the ground, using a 30 metre mast, situated in a field adjoining Durham Observatory. Simultaneous measurements of Potential Gradient would serve to show the height to which the space charge extended. Shielded rain collectors were situated at ground level and at 30 metres above the ground together with Field Mills for Potential Gradient measurements. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>currents</b> and Field changes were recorded photographically by connecting the respective outputs to four mirror galvanometers. The Field Mill amplifiers and a monitoring panel were situated in a separate room at the observatory. Unfortunately, once all the apparatus was in working order, only two periods of suitable conditions arose, The results so obtained could not possibly give any conclusive evidence in view of the small number of readings taken. A large difference in value of the <b>Precipitation</b> <b>Currents</b> at the two levels was observed, and is discussed in Chapter IV.

The system was expanded to include an 1 -hour smoothing and sampling action for recording aveiaged values of fair weather Atmospheric Electricity. At times of electrically quiet precipitation, measurements {{have been made}} of potential gradient, <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> density, space charge density and both polar conductivities. A new method of compensation for displacement currents has been used. Conductivity measurements have revealed a charge separation process close to the ground in rain, but not in snow. Techniques of variance spectrum analysis have been adopted for the precipitation work. Coherency spectra of potential gradient with <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> have indicated electrical 'cells' in nimbostratus and their relevance to weather forecasting is discussed. The phase spectra for these two parameters have been examined to measure the height of electrical activity and this is found to coincide with the melting level, and an estimate is made of the conductivity of the charging region of the cloud. Digital filtering of records has disclosed a mechanical-transfer current of space charges, to an exposed rain receiver, opposite to the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current.</b> The diurnal variation of potential gradient at Lanehead has been refined with a further year's continuous observations in fair weather and seasonal differences in the diurnal variations of potential gradient, air- earth -current density and space charge density have been explained by increased convection in summer. The conduction current has been estimated, by the indirect method and the difference between this and the total air-earth current to an exposed plate is attributed to a mechanical-transfer current of space charges.

40|$|An outdoor site {{adjoining}} Durham Observatory was instrumented {{to measure}} the atmospheric potential gradient and <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> at the ground during periods of steady, quiet precipitation. A system was constructed to automatically record these quantities and to present the data in a form suitable for input to a computer. Examination of most periods of quiet precipitation between January and June 1972 shows that rain is usually positively charged, with the potential gradient being negative, while during snow these signs are reversed. There is nearly always significant correlation between the two electrical quantities, with during rain variations in potential gradient most often leading those in <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> by several minutes; during snow the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> leads by a similar amount. These two effects correspond to the so-called "inverse relation" and "mirror-image- effect" often quoted in previous work. These results are shown {{to be consistent with}} the precipitation charge being due to two charging processes, one acting on solid precipitation within the cloud, and the second occurring during the melting of snow to rain. Examination of aerological data shows that the time lags between corresponding variations of the electrical quantities can be explained during rain by the effects of the wind shear between the cloud and the ground on the falling precipitation. The different electrical behaviour of a few periods of precipitation can be explained by,the effects of a slow-moving cloud where electrical development is taking place, rather than by a passing cloud with constant electrical activity. Comparison of periods of quiet precipitation with "disturbed" periods, when the electrical activity is much greater, suggests that the transition to disturbed precipitation occurs when the rate of electrical sign reversals exceeds 2 per hour and the precipitation rate exceeds 1 - 0 mm hr,^ The connection between the degrees of electrical and meteorological activity agrees with the suggestion that the electrical activity reflects the degree of atmospheric stability within the cloud...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on {{research}} carried out in Sierra Leone {{over a period of}} several years. An asymmetric field mill and a 'wide-angle' shielded receiver have been developed for the measurement of electric field and <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> in tropical thunderstorms. A detailed field-mill theory is presented which analyses the effects of leakage currents, inadequate grounding, contact potentials, conduction current, 'pick-up' of fluctuating electric fields and noise in the amplifier. Principles are deduced for the optimum design of a precision field mill using either a phase sensitive detector or an asymmetric signal. Measurements of <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> and its response to step changes in the field show that turbulent diffusion of splash droplets probably constitutes an important, even dominant, electrical process in heavy rain. The response of <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> to a lightning flash, averaged over many flashes, is large and has a delay of a few seconds. From the analysis of various models considered as a mechanism to explain the results it is deduced that charge carried on splash droplets is being diffused upwards by turbulence, transported by wind and is itself precipitating into the rain receiver. An experiment was performed to measure the electric current due to evaporation. The results show that the current due to evaporation in the presence of an electric field is much smaller than that due to conduction in air. The observation of a 'warm' thunderstorm cloud is reported. A project was developed to make visual and electrical measurements simultaneously on the same cloud. A time lapse film of tropical clouds, together with some electric field measurements beneath them, are used to discuss the flow pattern associated with a tropical thunderstorm and the mechanism by which it becomes charged. Appendices include an analysis of the shielding effect of a vertical rod at ground potential, the description of some further instrumentation, including a data processing system designed by the author which uses a novel but effective method of detecting the occurrence of the peak of a signal, more detailed mathematical derivations of equations used in the main text and a filming schedule for the time-lapse photography...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{electrostatic}} field is measured below thunderstorms at two sites in south-western France {{thanks to a}} field mill. It is recorded with a 1 -s time resolution, simultaneously to the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> measured with a specific sensor. The variations of both parameters are analyzed for two cases out of three storms considered in the study. Cloud-to-Ground (CG) lightning data from Météorage network and scans from a C-band radar included in the French network ARAMIS are used to characterize the storms. The magnitude of the {{electrostatic field}} can reach large values below the weak precipitation regions compared to the convective regions: between 5 and 6 kVm− 1, and between 2 and 3 kVm− 1, respectively. The field polarity is commonly negative (downward field) but it can reverse as the rainfall carries positive charge to the ground. So, the mirror effect is generally observed between the electrostatic field and the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current.</b> The electrostatic field magnitude can indicate the presence of large amounts of charge within the weak precipitation region above, although the lightning ground strokes remain relatively far. The fast field variations produced by CG flashes are analyzed. A strong dissymmetry for both CG polarities is observed: the +CG flashes can produce larger field discontinuities (~ 10 kVm− 1) even when their striking points are at about a distance of 40 km from the sensor, while the −CG flashes produce discontinuities lower than 4 kVm− 1 even when the striking points are within 4 km around the sensor. This indicates that either the charge removed by a +CG flash can be horizontally displaced {{with respect to the}} ground stroke location, or it can be much larger compared to that removed by a negative CG flash. Our observations suggest the surface electrostatic field measured below these regions may provide valuable information for estimating local lightning risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and propagation of precipitation cores {{on a variety}} of cold fronts are described. The shapes of the cores, and their orientations with respect to the synoptic-scale front, are not always uniform either between fronts or within the same front. Interactions between cores depend on their proximity and relative strength. Large gaps between precipitation cores move along the cold front at a slower speed than the cores and affect the evolution of the precipitation cores. The spacing of precipitation cores, the height of the head of the density current associated with the cold front, and the strength of the cold front are positively correlated with precipitation strength. This suggests that interactions between cores are strongly influenced by <b>precipitation.</b> <b>Current</b> theories for precipitation cores on narrow cold-frontal rainbands cannot account for these observations.

Most chronological statistics, except for mean sensitivity (MS), decreased from west to east. The first principal component (PC 1) loadings indicated that stands in a similar climate condition were most important to the variability of radial growth. PC 2 loadings decreased from west to east, suggesting the difference of tree-growth between eastern and western Anyemaqen Mountains. Correlations between standard chronologies and climatic factors revealed different climatic influences on radial growth along a west-east gradient in the study area.

40|$|It {{was found}} by early workers in {{atmospheric}} electricity that, during conditions of steady rain, when the potential gradient at the ground was negative the potential gradient {{at the top of}} a high mast was occasionally positive. This indicated the presence of negative space charge in the layer between the two measurements. To farther investigate this effect simultaneous recordings were taken of the potential gradient and the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> at the top and bottom of the mast, 21 metres high, situated in a field adjacent to Durham Observatory. Large differences in the values of the precipitation currents at the two levels were found. Due to the concentration of the lines of force on the earthed mast, and so on the upper shielded collector, laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the charging effects caused when drops splash in a region of high potential gradient. It was found that the differences between the currents could be accounted for by the splashing of drops on the edges of the upper collector. As there is no obvious way of correcting for this effect it would appear that the shielded rain collector of the design used in the present work is unsuitable for measuring the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> in regions of high potential gradient and even in other regions, the recorded currents must be considered with caution. Also drops were found to release negative charge to the air in regions of aero potential gradient. The actual reversal of sign of potential gradient between the top and bottom of the mast was only observed tor a number of very short periods, the longest being 4 ½ minutes, during low potential gradients. But on the majority of recordings the potential gradients did indicate the presence of excess of negative space charge in the layer below the top of the meat, although on occasions the space charge was positive. The space charge was of the same sign, and varied in the same sense, as the potential gradient recorded at the ground. Considering these points an attempt is made to explain the reversal effect in terms of layers of space charge between the cloud and the ground. The layer being due to the charge on the rain, the charge released when drops splash, and a separation or electrode effect due to the potential gradient of the cloud...|$|E
40|$|ENSO {{is capable}} of {{affecting}} normal climatic patterns around the world. El Niño, and its counterpart, La Niña, modify the normal precipitation patterns in Mexico. In general, during El Niño (La Niña) winters, precipitation increases (decreases) over northwestern Mexico, while it decreases (increases) in the region around the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. A southward shift {{in the position of}} the subtropical jet stream increases the number of Northerners over {{the southern part of the}} Gulf of Mexico. A summer El Niño causes a deficit in precipitation. Various mechanisms, associated with El Niño, result in negative precipitation anomalies over most of Mexico. Enhanced subsidence associated with a southward shift of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITZC), more intense trade winds, a decreased number of tropical cyclones over the Intra Americas Seas (IAS) and reduced relative humidity, may result in severe droughts.

We show that positive trends in OC in 474 streams, lakes, and rivers in boreal and subarctic ecosystems in Norway, Sweden, and Finland between 1990 and 2013 are surprisingly constant across climatic gradients and catchment sizes (median, + 1. 4 % year(- 1); interquartile range, + 0. 8 - 2. 0 % year(- 1)), implying that water bodies across the entire landscape are browning. The largest trends (median, + 1. 7 % year(- 1)) were found in regions impacted by strong reductions in sulfur deposition, while subarctic regions showed the least browning (median, + 0. 8 % year(- 1)). In dry regions, precipitation was a strong and positive driver of OC concentrations, declining in strength moving toward high rainfall sites. We estimate that a 10 % increase in precipitation will increase mobilization of OC from soils to freshwaters by at least 30 %, demonstrating the importance of climate wetting for the carbon cycle.

Here, we compiled a continental dataset on the distributions of African lizard {{species in the}} reptile subfamily Agaminae (a relatively young, Neogene radiation of agamid lizards which ancestors colonized Africa from the Arabian peninsula) and tested to what extent historical colonization and dispersal limitation (i. e. accessibility from areas of geographic origin) can explain present-day species richness relative to current climate, topography, and climate change since the late Miocene (~ 10 mya), the Pliocene (~ 3 mya), and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 0. 021 mya).

30|$|The sources {{other than}} the air-Earth {{conduction}} current {{that contribute to the}} measured current density are (i) the convection current, (ii) the displacement current, (iii) the point discharge current, (iv) the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current,</b> and (v) the lightning current (Israel, 1973). The sum of all these currents is collectively called the Maxwell current. Out of these, the convection current arises when the charge carriers are moved by the winds, and hence it is a possible source for the locally induced component in the measured current. The lightning and precipitation currents are not considered since the datasets selected are during fairweather periods. The location of the experimental setup on a barren land does not favour point discharge current because the sharp edges provided by plants and trees allow for point-discharge currents but in Antarctica there are no trees and plants hence, contribution of point-discharge current is negligible.

40|$|The long-standing {{mainstay}} {{of support for}} C. T. R. Wilson’s global circuit hypothesis is the similarity between the diurnal variation of thunderstorm days in universal time and the Carnegie curve of electrical potential gradient. This rough agreement has sustained the widespread view that thunderstorms are the “batteries” for the global electrical circuit. This study utilizes 10 years of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations to quantify the global occurrence of thunderstorms with much better accuracy and to validate the comparison by F. J. W. Whipple 80 years ago. The results support Wilson’s original ideas that both thunderstorms and electrified shower clouds contribute to the DC global circuit by virtue of negative charge carried downward by precipitation. First, the precipitation features (PFs) are defined by grouping the pixels with rain using 10 years of TRMM observations. Thunderstorms are identified from these PFs with lightning flashes observed by the Lightning Imaging Sensor. PFs without lightning flashes but with a 30 -dBZ radar echo-top temperature lower than − 10 °C over land and − 17 °C over ocean are selected as possibly electrified shower clouds. The universal diurnal variation of rainfall, the raining area from the thunderstorms, and possibly electrified shower clouds in different seasons are derived and compared with the diurnal variations of the electric field observed at Vostok, Antarctica. The result shows a substantially better match from the updated diurnal variations of the thunderstorm area to the Carnegie curve than Whipple showed. However, to fully understand and quantify the amount of negative charge carried downward by precipitation in electrified storms, more observations of <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> in different types of electrified shower clouds are required.

The conclusion is reached that no significant difference could be obtained between the correlation coefficients calculated when the receivers were side by side {{and when they were}} at such a short distance apart, especially under continuous rainfall conditions. Comparisons were, therefore, made between the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current</b> measured at the Laboratory and that measured 900 metres away. Significant correlation was obtained for instantaneous measurements of the currents when there was no wind, but when the wind was blowing roughly {{in the direction of the}} receivers, a definite time lag was found between similar variations of the currents. By applying the same method of correlation-time lag analysis to the current, I, and the potential gradient, F, the author found on one occasion, for sleet and snow, that a significant negative correlation existed between the two parameters for a time lag- [...] of about 1 + 0 seconds of the current on the potential gradient, consistent with the idea that the time of fall of precipitation particles should be considered when fitting the functional relationship I = a(F + C) : the discrepancy between the values of constants a and C for Summer and Winter results found by Ramsay (1959) could thus be resolved. Some of the records, especially those of rain showers, did show that the space charge on the falling precipitation (as pointed out by Magono and Orikasa (1960)) is an important factor in the "Mirror- Image" phenomenon in low potential gradients, The author's results indicate, also, that the melting process is a plausible mechanism of precipitation charging...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{measurements}} {{have been}} made of the air-earth current density, by the direct method, potential gradient, space charge density, by filtration, and the positive conductivity at Lanehead, situated in the N. Penninea, 440 m above sea level. Wind speed, wind direction and rate of rainfall were also recorded, but the measurements used only qualitatively. The problems of making continuous measurements {{for long periods of time}} and under difficult weather conditions are discussed. The results can be divided into two types; fair weather and disturbed weather. Of the former, diurnal variations for the one-year period July 1967 to June 1968 were calculated. That of potential gradient shows a close similarity with the variation found on the Carnegie in the Pacific (TORRESON et al, 1946), contrary to expectations for a land station within the austausch region. The air-earth current, on the other hand, is found to depend on the variation in columnar resistance, and its variation is similar to that of the space charge density. The diurnal variation of columnar resistance is estimated, and the role of pollution in controlling this variation is discussed. For disturbed weather, a high positive correlation has been found between space charge density and potential gradient at the ground during steady precipitation. Both were mostly negative during the precipitation, i. e. of opposite sign to the <b>precipitation</b> <b>current.</b> Splashing and point discharge are ruled out as sources of the space charge, so that the results imply some charge separation process within a few tens of metres of the ground giving positive charge to the rain and negative to the air. For 42 periods of steady rain, with some of snow, relations of the form F = Ao + B were calculated and the frequency distributions of A and B are given. The importance of making continuous measurements of several electric parameters is stressed, together with the necessity of using statistical methods to eliminate the effects of unknown variables such as meteorological conditions. An atmospheric electric station has been set up at Lanehead, where air pollution is low, and an atmospheric electric climate for the station has been established...|$|E
40|$|The high-latitude {{ionosphere}} is {{a dynamic}} region, in which a variety of phenomena including particle <b>precipitation,</b> <b>currents</b> and waves contribute to the energy budget. In this thesis, statistical and case studies of ion frictional heating are presented, including investigations into the dependence of enhanced ion temperature on time and altitude. The relationship between parallel ion temperature and ion velocity is compared to simplified forms of the ion energy balance equation. In addition, the generation mechanisms of atmospheric gravity waves are studied by means of measurements made during the WAGS campaign of October 1985. The results indicate that auroral precipitation can influence frictional heating events {{to a greater extent}} than has previously been realised and that during frictional heating the molecular content of the lower ionosphere is enhanced, affecting the electron density. Any analysis which takes no account of the modified composition underestimates the parallel ion temperature, particularly between 200 and 300 km altitude. The relationship between ion velocity and parallel ion temperature is most easily explained by an anisotropic ion velocity distribution, consistent with resonant charge exchange collisions. The relationship varies with altitude, however, possibly due to ion-ion collisions. An experimental method is described by which the temperature anisotropy can be obtained directly and early results are discussed. For the investigation of atmospheric gravity waves and their sources, HF Doppler observations in the UK enabled wave speeds and azimuths to be deduced, whilst EISCAT simultaneously observed the possible source region. Although the study was characterised by moderate activity, more active days showed higher phase speeds and southerly azimuths. Some of these waves may have originated at high latitudes during positive bay activity, when both Joule heating and the Lorentz force contributed to wave generation...|$|R

The basic theory of climate simulation which includes the fundamental equations, models, and numerical techniques for simulating the atmosphere, oceans, and sea ice is described. Simulated wind, temperature, <b>precipitation,</b> ocean <b>current,</b> and sea ice distribution data are presented and compared to observational data. The responses of the climate to various environmental changes, such as variations in solar output or increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, are modeled.

This mapping modifies the initial electric field induced by the solar wind and requires that the modelling of magnetospheric plasma convection has to take account of the coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere induced by the <b>precipitation,</b> the field-aligned <b>currents,</b> and the equipotentiality of the magnetic field lines.|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves [57]- 61. ix, 63, A- 2, B- 2 l illusThe {{problem of}} {{electrical}} charges on raindrops from non-thunderstorm clouds is investigated. Measurements of raindrop charges, <b>precipitation</b> <b>currents</b> and space charges made {{in various parts}} of the world indicate that on the average positive charges prevail on raindrops. To explain rain charges, a well known hypothesis requires the melting of snow. In Hawaii, however, rain often forms by condensation and coalescence without ice or snow in the upper portions of the cloud. Yet raindrop charges do not differ from charges measured in other type s of rain. Measurements of charges on Hawaiian rain are discussed together with observations of electric field and condensation nuclei profiles. It was found that positive charges are of the order of 10 ^- 4 esu. A correlation of these charges with wind speed was found. Electric fields in rain clouds are generally positive except at the lower cloud boundary where negative fields of up to - 1000 V/m exist. Several thunderstorm theories are discussed and their applicability to the warm rain mechanism is examined. A new hypothesis is necessary to explain the observed electrical features of warm rain. A theory based on influence is presented and formulated. Due to low electrical conductivity inside the cloud, positive space charges form in the upper:. part of the cloud and negative in the lower, influenced by an impressed conduction current from above the cloud. These space charges diffuse to the raindrops. Considering a coalescence mechanism for drop growth, the residence time of raindrops in the negative space charge area is much smaller than the corresponding time in the positive area, and so the drops usually leave the cloud with a positive charge. Numerical solutions to drop charges and electric field profiles using a realistic cloud model were obtained through the use of digital computer techniques. The theoretical results for charges on raindrops and electric field patterns agree well with observations...|$|R
