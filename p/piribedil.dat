40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Sleep {{attacks were}} {{initially}} described in 1999 {{in patients with}} Parkinson disease (PD) treated by dopamine agonists (DAs). Because the respective role of DAs or PD-induced excessive daytime sleepiness is still unclear, reports of sleep attacks in non-PD patients treated with DA would support the specific role of these drugs. <b>Piribedil,</b> a nonergot dopamine D 2 /D 3 agonist with alpha(2) -noradrenergic properties, is indicated {{in the treatment of}} PD as well as in patients with circulatory disorders. After a spontaneous report of sleep attack associated with <b>piribedil</b> use in a non-PD patient, we reviewed other cases from the French pharmacovigilance database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of <b>piribedil</b> associated with sleep attacks recorded between 1988 and December 2008 were identified in the French Pharmacovigilance database. Cases were retained for analysis only if patients were treated for conditions other than PD. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 35 cases of piribedil-induced sleep disorders were retrieved, and 7 cases suggestive of sleep attacks were retained for analysis. The mean time to onset after starting <b>piribedil</b> was 2. 5 days. <b>Piribedil</b> was the only suspected drug in all but 1 patient.

40|$|Apathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} encountered in Parkinson's disease, and is defined as a lack of motivation accompanied by reduced goal-directed cognition, behaviour and emotional involvement. In a previous study we have described a delayed withdrawal syndrome after successful motor improvement related to subthalamic stimulation allowing for a major decrease in dopaminergic treatment. This withdrawal syndrome correlated with a diffuse mesolimbic dopaminergic denervation. To confirm our hypothesis of parkinsonian apathy being related to mesolimbic dopaminergic denervation, we performed a randomized controlled study using <b>piribedil,</b> a relatively selective D 2 /D 3 dopamine agonist to treat parkinsonian apathy, using the model of postoperative apathy. A 12 -week prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded trial was conducted in 37 patients with Parkinson's disease presenting with apathy (Starkstein Apathy Scale score > 14) following subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Patients received either <b>piribedil</b> up to 300 mg per day (n = 19) or placebo (n = 18) for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the improvement of apathy under treatment, as assessed by the reduction of the Starkstein Apathy Scale score in both treatment groups. Secondary end points included alleviation in depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), improvement of quality of life (PDQ 39) and anhedonia (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale). Exploratory endpoints consisted in changes of the Robert Inventory score and Hamilton depression scales. An intention to treat analysis of covariance analysis was performed to compare treatment effects (P < 0. 05). The number of premature study dropouts was seven in the placebo and five in the <b>piribedil</b> groups, mostly related to intolerance to hypodopaminergic symptoms. At follow-up evaluation, the apathy score was reduced by 34. 6 % on <b>piribedil</b> versus 3. 2 % on placebo (P = 0. 015). With <b>piribedil,</b> modifications in the Beck depression and anxiety scores were - 19. 8 % and - 22. 8 %, respectively versus + 1. 4 % and - 8. 3 % with placebo, without reaching significance level. <b>Piribedil</b> led to a trend towards improvement in quality of life (- 16. 2 % versus + 6. 7 % on placebo; P = 0. 08) and anhedonia (- 49 % versus - 5. 6 % on the placebo; P = 0. 08).

40|$|Dopamine (DA) {{agonists}} {{provide evidence}} that different receptor subtypes in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) have influence in sexual behavior. Sleep deprivation induces supersensibility of DA receptors and previous work has shown that the DA agonist apomorphine enhances spontaneous genital reflexes (penile erection-PE and ejaculation-EJ) in rats deprived of paradoxical sleep. the present study sought to extend the latter finding by assessing the effects of other DA agonists in paradoxical sleep-deprived (PSD) male rats. the DA drugs (bromocriptine and <b>piribedil)</b> were acutely administered to rats that had been deprived of sleep for 4 days and to normal controls. Sleep deprivation alone induced PE and this effect was potentiated by <b>piribedil,</b> with maximal effects occurring with the 8 mg/kg dose, whereas only one dose of bromocriptine (8 mg/kg) induced more PE in PSD rats than in non-deprived treated controls. EJs were increased in <b>piribedil</b> PSD groups but this response was absent after bromocriptine treatment in the dose range tested. Our data show the genital reflexes that occurred in PSD rats are potentialized by <b>piribedil</b> and not by bromocriptine.

40|$|Although {{levodopa}} is the first-line {{medication for}} the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) showing unsurpassable efficiency, its chronic use causes dyskinesia. Accordingly, dopamine agonists are increasingly employed as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa {{to reduce the risk of}} motor complications. It is well recognized that patients with PD often exhibit cognitive deficits. However, clinical and animal studies assessing the effects of dopaminergic medications on cognition are controversial. Amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive deficit. Interestingly, the abnormal accumulation of Aβ is also detected in PD patients with cognitive deficits. Evidence indicated that levodopa induced a mild increase of Aβ plaque number and size in the brain of AD mouse. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we present that both levodopa and <b>piribedil</b> enhance the generation of Aβ and the activity of γ-secretase in human neuronal cells and primary neurons isolated from AD mouse.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{complicated}} disease, commonly diagnosed among the elderly, which leads to degeneration of the central nervous system. It presently lacks an effective therapy for its complex pathogenesis. Adverse effects from Western drug-based medical intervention prevent long-term adherence to these therapies in many patients. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has long been used to improve the treatment of PD by alleviating the toxic and adverse effects of Western drug-based intervention. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Xifeng Dingchan Pill (XFDCP), a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, taken in conjunction with Western medicine in the treatment of PD patients at different stages in the progression of the disease. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. In total, 320 patients with early- (n = 160) and middle-stage PD (n = 160) will be enrolled and divided evenly into control and trial groups. Of the 160 patients with early-stage PD, the trial group (n = 80) will be given XFDCP, and the control group (n = 80) will be given Madopar. Of the 160 patients with middle-stage PD, the trial group (n = 80) will be given XFDCP combined with Madopar and <b>Piribedil,</b> and the control group (n = 80) will be given Madopar and <b>Piribedil.</b> The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale scores, TCM symptoms scores, quality of life, change of Madopar’s dosage and the toxic and adverse effects of Madopar will be observed during a 3 -month treatment period and through a further 6 -month follow-up period. DISCUSSION: It is hypothesized that XFDCP, combined with Madopar and <b>Piribedil,</b> will have beneficial effects on patients with PD. The results of this study will provide evidence for developing a comprehensive therapy regimen, which can delay the progress of the disease and improve the quality of life for PD patients in different stages. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with the identifer ChiCTR-TRC- 12002150...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the serotonin (5 -HT) and the dopamine (DA) systems in the modulation of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), a DA-dependent behavior, was investigated. Chronically implanted rats for ICSS in the medial forebrain bundle were tested {{for the effects of}} fenfluramine at a dose of 20 mg/kg, and then for the effects of 10 mg/kg <b>piribedil</b> plus 2 mg/kg amphetamine, injected 30 min before fenfluramine or 60 min after fenfluramine. Our aim was to determine whether the action of fenfluramine at the DA binding site could be blocked by prior occupation, or whether if it were occupied by fenfluramine it could be reversed. Fenfluramine, 20 mg/kg, injected alone, suppressed ICSS for 5 – 7 h. The suppression was followed by a prolonged recovery during which ICSS was profounded depressed. Repeating the treatment 7 days later produced the same response, except that the suppression was of shorter duration. In another group of animals, pretreatment with <b>piribedil</b> plus amphetamine 30 min before fenfluramine prevented the suppression of ICSS. Instead, ICSS was briefly attenuated, then restored to baseline levels, and then facilitated. Repeating the treatment 7 days after the first treatment potentiated this response. The attenuation was now even briefer, the recovery more rapid, and the facilitation more robust. In still another group of animals, fenfluramine was given just before the ICSS session began. Predictably, the effect was a total cessation of ICSS. At 60 min into the session, <b>piribedil</b> plus amphetamine was injected. The response showed a rapid recovery of ICSS followed by facilitation. Repeating the treatment 7 days later potentiated this response. Recovery to baseline ICSS was more rapid and facilitation was larger and longer lasting. These results are discussed in terms of a possible neuroleptic-like action of fenfluramine being responsible for a portion of the effects of fenfluramine on ICSS, which suggests a basis for the protection afforded by the DA agonists...|$|E
