25|$|Mannock {{made only}} one claim on 25 September, his last for 1917. The combat report {{for that day}} {{describes}} an incident in which he fired on an enemy reconnaissance aircraft at 16,000ft but ran out of ammunition. The machine's <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped</b> but it glided eastward. Another was fired on this day and dived toward German lines apparently damaged. Mannock made no claim for these combats. Biographer Norman Franks suggests his total may have been slightly higher than official figure of 61.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Omsk at 0:30 and was refueled with 38 tons of jet fuel. 5 hours after landing, the four engine propfan lifted off the runway {{on its way}} to Yakutsk for cold weather testing. Within seconds of becoming airborne one of the Progress D-27 engines with Contra-rotating propellers reached an over-speed condition and automatically shut down. The forward <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped</b> rotating but {{due to the nature of}} the failure the aft propeller kept turning, producing negative thrust. At this point the flight crew increased power to the remaining three engines but a problem with the RPM sensors on one of them led to automatic engine shut-off. Thus, the An-70 ended up flying at low speed with only two properly functioning engines, with the third engine generating over 11,000 pounds of negative thrust and disrupting airflow across the wing.|$|E
25|$|For Richthofen, {{this was}} the first of the 80 {{confirmed}} aerial combat victories with which he was credited before his death in April 1918. The circumstances foreshadowed his death later in the war. His account of the event noted that the pilot was probably experienced, as he appeared conscious of the danger he was in and did his best to escape, as von Richthofen manoeuvred his new Albatros D.II serial number 491/16, into position to attack. Rees, in the observer's position, fired constantly from the forward-facing Lewis machine-gun (which could also be turned to fire backwards over the pilot). Von Richthofen recounted that at the time he was not sure whether the F.E.2b would fall, until he was able to close up behind it during a moment of non-evasive flying, taking advantage of the F.E.2b's vulnerability underneath. After he fired, the <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped</b> turning, indicating that he must have hit the engine. Rees was not visible and the plane was flying unsteadily, indicating to von Richthofen that both British men had been injured. Morris managed to land the aeroplane at a nearby German airfield at Flesquières. Von Richthofen followed the F. E. 2b down and saw the dead observer and badly wounded pilot (who died later the same day), then flew back to his squadron's base at Bertincourt.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} fuze is {{the same}} as a classic armor-piercing bomb: a combination of timer and a sturdy dynamic propeller on the rear of the bomb. The fuze is armed when the bomb is released, and detonates when the <b>propeller</b> <b>stops</b> turning and the timer has expired.|$|R
50|$|The Embraer EMB-110P1 Bandeirante twin {{turboprop}} aircraft, registration PT-SEA and {{serial number}} 110352, was carrying twenty-eight people, {{though it was}} certificated for twenty-one. Shortly before the crash, the pilot reportedly attempted to turn back to Coari due to heavy rainfall, but then had to make an emergency landing in the Manacapuru River, {{a tributary of the}} Amazon located between Santo Antonio and Montecristo. Survivors said they saw one of the airplane's <b>propellers</b> <b>stop</b> rotating before the crash.|$|R
5000|$|The {{balanced}} propeller, {{with four}} to eight blades, rotates inside a protective ring. The position of a lever controls the propeller. In down position the <b>propeller</b> is <b>stopped</b> and the instrument is lowered, after which reaching the desired depth a weight called a messenger is dropped to move the lever into the middle position which allows the propeller to turn freely. When the measurement has been taken another weight is dropped to push the level to its highest position at which the <b>propeller</b> is again <b>stopped.</b>|$|R

60|$|The winch {{began to}} rattle {{and an hour}} or two later Grahame went up to the bridge while the anchor was broken out. When the men were stowing it the engines throbbed and the Miranda turned her head toward open water. In another half hour the <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped</b> and the captain turned to his guests with a grin as the Enchantress's gig came alongside.|$|E
60|$|While we were waiting, the engineer, {{who was a}} round-faced {{and rather}} green boy, fell under the {{influences}} of a large, plump, and very talkative lady who made the portage just behind us. She so absorbed and fascinated the lad that he let the engine run itself into some cramp of piston or wheel. There was a sudden crunching sound and the <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped.</b> The boy minimized the accident, but the captain upon arrival told us {{it would be necessary}} to unload from the boat while the engine was being repaired.|$|E
50|$|In large ships, an {{emergency}} stop button pulls the countershaft for the fuel pumps to the stop position, cutting off the fuel supply and stopping the engines. With a controllable-pitch <b>propeller,</b> the <b>stop</b> button may declutch the engine from the propeller.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{additional}} drag of the <b>stopped</b> <b>propeller</b> and landing gear reduces their gliding performance, TMGs are seldom used in competition.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{constructed}} {{of wood and}} since 1967 {{constructed of}} steel, the barge-like vessel features the controllman's room to one side, with the diesel engine sitting aside the control room. As a powered cable ferry, the vessel is guided by a steel cable drawn across the river, secured on each shore by steel anchors. The cable is lowered into the river when the ferry is not operational and is stretched across the river during hours of operation. There is sufficient clearance for small boats to pass under the cable, but it is lowered when barges pass, though barge traffic on the Cape Fear river in this section ceased in the 1990s. The ferry {{is powered by a}} diesel engine and a <b>propeller.</b> <b>Stopping</b> is controlled by the operator's throttle. As the ferry cannot turn around, each end includes a ramp, and alignment of the ferry at each end is automatic.|$|R
60|$|Mayne {{signed to}} the {{quartermaster}} {{in the pilot}} house and the bows swung round. Half an hour afterwards, he rang his telegraph and the clang of engines died away while the throb of the <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped.</b> In what seemed an unnatural silence, a few barefooted deck-hands began to move about, and one stood on the forecastle, where his dark figure cut against the shining sea. The rest went aft with a line the other held, and when Mayne raised his hand there was a splash as the deep-sea lead plunged. A man aft called the depth while he gathered up the line, and Mayne beckoned another, who climbed to a little platform outside the bridge and fastened a strap round his waist.|$|E

5|$|According to Admiral Kummetz' report, {{the first}} torpedo hit Kesselraum 2 (boileroom 2, {{just under the}} funnel) and the second hit Turbinenraum 2/3 (the turbine room for the side shafts). Boiler 1 had already been {{destroyed}} by gunfire. Only one boiler remained, but the steam pipes through boiler 1 and 2 and turbine room 2/3 had been damaged and turbine 1 for the main shaft lost its power. By 04:34, the ship had been severely damaged, but had successfully passed through the firing zone; the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her. The 15cm guns in the Kopås battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing. After the torpedo hits, Blücher was still within range. The battery asked for orders, but Eriksen concluded: The fortress has served its purpose. With all <b>propellers</b> <b>stopped,</b> about 60% of the electric power gone, Blucher quickly lost speed and at about 04:50 dropped anchors at Askoholmene.|$|R
50|$|At 08:30, two {{lifeboats}} {{from the}} boat station assigned to Third Officer Francis Laws were lowered, without his knowledge, {{through the use of}} the automatic release gear. Those two lifeboats dropped some 6 ft and hit the water violently. The two lifeboats soon drifted back into the still-turning propellers, which were beginning to rise out of the water due to the water flooding into the front of the ship. As they reached the turning blades, both lifeboats, together with their occupants, were torn to pieces. Word of the carnage arrived on the bridge, and Captain Bartlett, seeing that water was entering more rapidly as Britannic was moving and that there was a risk of more victims, gave the order to stop the engines. The <b>propellers</b> <b>stopped</b> turning the moment a third lifeboat was about to be reduced to splinters. RAMC occupants of this boat pushed against the blades and got away from them safely.|$|R

50|$|After leaving Finland, Onyx {{stopped at}} Portland, England, on 12 November 2009 and left on 21 November, but ran into {{problems}} soon afterwards when the reduction gear {{broke down in}} heavy weather and the ship's only working <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped.</b> The ship, damaged by the storm, was towed to the port of Brest, France, where the French maritime officials were afraid that the owner would abandon the ship, leaving her to be scrapped at their expense. French environmental associations such as Robin des Bois blamed Finnish environmental officials for letting Onyx leave Finland in the first place, claiming that it was certain that the ship would be scrapped and demanded the ship {{to be returned to}} Finland. The crew told the press that they hadn't received their pay for two months, resulting in the French officials detaining the ship, and most of them refused to continue journey before all four engines were in working order. The captain also admitted that the ship was heading for a scrap yard in Bangladesh instead of a ship yard in Turkey and was reportedly fired afterwards, but a representative of the shipping company later denied this. However, the only shipyard in Iskenderun, Turkey, where the owner claimed the ship would be heading for repairs, announced that they were not expecting Onyx to arrive there. The destination was subsequently changed to a shipyard in Piraeus, Greece, and the ship left Brest on 10 February 2010, heading for Gibraltar.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of flight test of the Pitcairn "PCA- 2 " autogiro. Lift and drag coefficients with the <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped</b> have been determined over approximately a 90 degree range of angles of attack. Based on the sum of fixed-wing and swept-disk areas, the maximum lift coefficient is 0. 895, the minimum drag coefficient with <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped</b> is 0. 015, and the maximum l/d with <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped</b> is 4. 8. Lift coefficients were found also with the propeller delivering positive thrust and did not differ consistently from those found with <b>propeller</b> <b>stopped.</b> Curves of gliding performance included in this report show a minimum vertical velocity of 15 feet per second at an air speed of 36 miles per hour and a flight-path angle of - 17 degrees. In vertical descent the vertical velocity is 35 feet per second...|$|E
40|$|Course keeping {{is hard to}} {{implement}} under {{the condition of the}} <b>propeller</b> <b>stopping</b> or reversing at slow speed for berthing due to the ship's dynamic motion becoming highly nonlinear. To solve this problem, a practical Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) ship mathematic model with propeller reversing transverse forces and low speed correction is first discussed to be applied for the right-handed single-screw ship. Secondly, a novel PID-based nonlinear feedback algorithm driven by bipolar sigmoid function is proposed. The PID parameters are determined by a closed-loop gain shaping algorithm directly, while the closed-loop gain shaping theory was employed for effects analysis of this algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments were carried out on an LPG ship. It is shown that the energy consumption and the smoothness performance of the nonlinear feedback control are reduced by 4. 2 % and 14. 6 % with satisfactory control effects; the proposed algorithm has the advantages of robustness, energy saving and safety in berthing practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{discussion}} of the results of tests with Zeppelin airships, in which the <b>propellers</b> were <b>stopped</b> as quickly as possible while the airship was in full flight. In this paper the author refers to the theory involved in these tests and calls attention to one scientifically interesting fact which can be derived from the tests and which has not yet been noted. The most important question concerning the tests is, of course: does the negative acceleration of an airship with <b>stopped</b> <b>propellers</b> supply proper data for determining the drag of the airship when in uniform flight? This can not be absolutely answered, however, except that in this particular case the agreement is sufficient and that the data obtained from the test are the true quantities, or, at least, the approximate quantities wanted...|$|R

2500|$|A report {{released}} by the investigation team in mid-March, by Ukrainian [...] "Aviation and Time" [...] magazine, provided preliminary details into the cause. According to the report, immediately after take-off one of the engines was automatically shut off by its electronic safeguards after it exceeded the safe RPM limit. The front set of blades of the contra rotating <b>propeller</b> assembly <b>stopped</b> but the aft [...] part of the propeller assembly continued turning due to the damaged oil line that powered the blade actuators. This caused the negative air flow estimated at 5,000kg/11,023lbs. of thrust.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports wind-tunnel tests {{giving the}} lift {{coefficients}} of large-scale wing-nacelle combinations both {{with and without}} the propeller. The tests were made to show the effect of nacelles, and idling and <b>stopped</b> <b>propellers</b> on the landing speeds of tractor monoplanes. Four types of nacelles with various cowlings were used in numerous positions with respect to both a Clark Y and a thick airfoil. The effect of both the idling and <b>stopped</b> <b>propeller</b> on lift, and consequently on landing speed, was negligible. A nacelle with exposed engine cylinders when placed {{directly in front of}} an airfoil caused a slight reduction in lift, consequently an increase in landing speed, over the condition with the wing alone. With this exception no appreciable effect on landing speed was indicated for any of the other combinations...|$|R

The landing gear features bungee suspension on all three wheels and the tail wheel is steerable. No brakes are fitted. The standard engine supplied was the single cylinder two-stroke Rotax 277 of [...] and it is mounted on the wing trailing edge, with the propeller turning in between the tail boom tubes. The engine utilizes a 2:1 belt reduction drive with a centrifugal clutch to allow the <b>propeller</b> to <b>stop</b> when the engine is at idle.|$|R
5000|$|Rubber-powered {{models are}} {{powered by the}} stored energy of a twisted elastic material. These range from the simple rubber-band powered toys {{available}} in many toy stores, up to the open rubber class, examples of which often use 200 g of rubber in their [...] "motor". Rubber does not produce a constant power output; when fully wound a rubber motor produces its maximum torque, but this drops rapidly at first before 'plateau-ing', finally declining again, after which the <b>propeller</b> <b>stops.</b> Using this initial burst efficiently is vital, and automatically variable-pitch propellers help here, together with timer-operated changes of wing and tailplane incidence and of rudder setting. At {{the end of the}} power run the blades fold back alongside the fuselage to minimise drag during the glide.The FAI rubber class is F1B, also known as Wakefield. Charles Dennis Rushing has written {{on the history of the}} Wakefield Cup. F1B models may have a maximum of 30 g of rubber motor, and the empty weight of the airframe must be at least 200 g. The maximum total area of the model must be less than 19 dm2.The mini rubber class is Coupe d'Hiver (also known as F1G). [...] "Coupe" [...] models have no area restrictions. The maximum weight of rubber allowed is 10 g, and the minimum empty weight of the airframe is 70g[...]Open rubber is a popular event, featuring large models with enormous amounts of rubber crammed into them. Open models often have 50% of their flying weight composed of rubber.P-30 is a common beginner's event. A P-30 must use an unmodified commercially available plastic propeller. P-30 has a maximum wingspan and overall length of 30 inches (76.2 cm), and uses maximum 10 g of rubber. The empty airframe must weigh at least 40 g.|$|R

5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} distance {{that it was impossible}} to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard <b>propellers</b> to <b>stop</b> for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|R
50|$|The Rotax engine {{cylinder}} heads are liquid-cooled; there are cooling vanes on the cylinder barrels. Thus both cooling airflow through the nacelle, and a cooling radiator, are required in each cowl. The electric starters, used {{to start the}} engines on the ground, must {{also be used for}} an inflight restart, since the highly geared engines cannot be turned by airflow past the <b>stopped</b> <b>propeller.</b> Thus, for FAA certification, the company was required to add a backup battery in addition to the standard battery. The pilot's power quadrant contains three controls for each engine: throttle, propeller rpm, and carburetor heat. The engines have automatic mixture adjustment, so there is no mixture control required on the panel.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{focus is}} on ice-class propellers. Methods exist for predicting hydrodynamic and contact ice loads on conventional ice-class propellers under normal operating conditions in ice.

The present research aims to extend these ice load predictions to extreme and transient operating conditions. [...] To address these extreme conditions, a numerical model was developed using existing empirical results of ice-structure interaction. This model was incorporated into an existing Fortran code for predicting ice loads on propellers under normal operating conditions. The refined code was used to predict loads on a series of propellers under extreme operating conditions such as when the <b>propeller</b> was <b>stopped</b> and the ship is moving and these results were used to check the design procedure. [...] To verify the correctness of the numerical model a series of model scale indentation tests were performed at the Institute of Marine Dynamics, using an MTS machine. A propeller blade shaped indentor with a geometry of that of R-Class propeller was used as an indentor to indent against laboratory grown ice. The tests were performed at high speeds. These results are compared with the numerical simulations...|$|R
