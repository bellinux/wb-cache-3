The lumbricals attach {{in part to the}} flexor digitorum profundus tendons. As the wrist flexes, the flexor digitorum profundus contracts in a <b>proximal</b> <b>direction,</b> drawing the lumbricals along with it. In some individuals, the lumbricals can be [...] "dragged" [...] into the carpal tunnel with flexor digitorum profundus contraction. As such, Phalen's maneuver can moderately increase the pressure in the carpal tunnel via this mass effect, pinching the median nerve between the proximal edge of the transverse carpal ligament and the anterior border of the distal end of the radius. By compressing the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, characteristic symptoms (such as burning, tingling or numb sensation over the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers) conveys a positive test result and suggests carpal tunnel syndrome. Because not all individuals will draw the lumbricals into the carpal tunnel with this maneuver, this test cannot be perfectly sensitive or specific for carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} seeking a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix in a closed convex set to approximate a given matrix. This problem may arise in several areas of numerical linear algebra or come from finance industry or statistics and thus has many applications. For solving this class of matrix optimization problems, many methods have been proposed in the literature. The <b>proximal</b> alternating <b>direction</b> method {{is one of those}} methods which can be easily applied to solve these matrix optimization problems. Generally, the proximal parameters of the <b>proximal</b> alternating <b>direction</b> method are greater than zero. In this paper, we conclude that the restriction on the proximal parameters can be relaxed for solving this kind of matrix optimization problems. Numerical experiments also show that the <b>proximal</b> alternating <b>direction</b> method with the relaxed proximal parameters is convergent and generally has a better performance than the classical <b>proximal</b> alternating <b>direction</b> method...|$|R

In the registration step, surface matching was performed with digitizing points on the pelvic bone surface after coarse paired matching. In the present study, we made model bones from the CT data of patients whose acetabular shapes had various deformities. We measured the distances and angles after surface matching from the fiducial points and evaluated the ability to correct surface-matching registration on each pelvic form, using several areas and numbers of points. When the surface-matching points were taken on the superior area of the acetabulum, the correction was easy for the external direction, but {{it was difficult to}} correct for the anterior and <b>proximal</b> <b>directions.</b> The correction was difficult for external and <b>proximal</b> <b>directions</b> on the posterior area. Each area of surface-matching points has particular directions that are easily corrected and other directions that are difficult to correct. The shape of the pelvis also affected the correction ability.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Traditional {{celiac disease}} {{guidelines}} recommend follow-up endoscopy and duodenal biopsies at 6 – 12 months after commencing a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, histology may remain abnormal even 1 – 2 years later. We evaluated {{the role of}} capsule endoscopy in patients with celiac disease after treatment with a GFD. METHODS: Twelve adult patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease were prospectively enrolled. All patients had baseline symptom assessment, celiac serology (tissue transglutaminase antibody, tTG), and capsule endoscopy. Twelve months after commencing a GFD, patients underwent repeat symptom assessment, celiac serology, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and capsule endoscopy. RESULTS: At baseline, capsule endoscopy detected endoscopic markers of villous atrophy in the duodenum and extending to a variable distance along the small intestine. On the basis of small bowel transit time, the mean±s. e. m. percentage of small intestine with villous atrophy was 18. 2 ± 3. 7 %. After 12 months on a GFD, repeat capsule endoscopy demonstrated mucosal healing from a distal to <b>proximal</b> <b>direction,</b> {{and the percentage of}} small intestine with villous atrophy was significantly reduced to 3. 4 ± 1. 2 % (P¼ 0. 0014) and this correlated with improvement in the symptom score (correlation 0. 69, P¼ 0. 01). There was a significant improvement in symptom score (5. 2 ± 1. 0 vs. 1. 7 ± 0. 4, P¼ 0. 0012) and reduction in immunoglobulin A–tTG levels (81. 5 ± 10. 6 vs. 17. 5 ± 8. 2, P¼ 0. 0005). However, 42 % of subjects demonstrated persistent villous abnormality as assessed by duodenal histology. CONCLUSIONS: After 12 months on a GFD, patients with celiac disease demonstrate an improvement in symptoms, celiac serology, and the extent of disease as measured by capsule endoscopy. Mucosal healing occurs in a distal to <b>proximal</b> <b>direction.</b> The extent of mucosal healing correlates with improvement in symptoms.

Various stimulus durations and interstimulation distances were used to obtain each double peak in the different age groups. The latency and amplitude of the second peak were measured.

30|$|There is no {{standard}} {{treatment for}} length-unstable diaphyseal femur fractures among school-age children [1]. The most common surgical treatment for children aged 4 – 14  years in our clinic is titanium elastic nails (TEN) {{inserted in the}} distal femur in a <b>proximal</b> <b>direction.</b> This stabilization {{is based on the}} principle of creating a six-point fixation using two C-shaped nails [2]. However, the technique does not always provide optimal stability, and can result in shortening, angulation, and rotation [3, 4]. From biomechanical studies and clinical experience, we have learned that end caps prevent the nails from sliding back through the insertion site, and therefore increase the axial stabilization in femur fractures [5, 6]. Another treatment option, beside external fixation and submuscular plating [7, 8], is the more recently introduced semi-rigid pediatric locking nail (PLN) [9]. The PLN is inserted through the lateral greater trochanter, avoiding the piriformis fossa, to avoid injury to the vascular supply to the proximal femoral epiphysis, which could result in avascular necrosis of the femoral head [2]. To date, there are limited reports on the semi-rigid pediatric interlocking nail regarding stability [10, 11].|$|E

The normal HL function depends on the integrity of a critical 4 -kb window of mostly noncoding sequences within the wupA transcription unit that encodes the muscle protein troponin I (TNI).
