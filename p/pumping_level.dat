40|$|A finite {{difference}} {{model was}} developed specifically for analyzing the Grand Island, Nebraska aquifer test. Time-drawdown {{data for the}} aquifer test were fitted by least squares to an exponential type equation. To facilitate calibration of the model, interpolated distance-drawdown profiles also were fitted to an exponential type equation. The treatment of aquifer boundaries and the assumption of isotropic aquifer conditions affected the model computed water table profile. The effect was significant enough as to defy making accurate estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific yield. When the analysis was extended to long time periods of discharge, problems with the boundaries, particularly {{the distance to the}} lateral constant head boundary, led to unrealistic estimates of <b>pumping</b> <b>level.</b> The finite difference technique has its greatest application as a research method for analyzing short-duration aquifer tests provided that the aquifer conditions are well defined, measurements of <b>pumping</b> <b>level</b> are available and drawdown measurements have been secured for at least two observation wells within close proximity of the discharge well. Because of difficulties in maintaining convergence and model stability, the finite difference model reviewed in this study is too cumbersome to be considered a practical, field method for the analysis of unconfined aquifer parameters...|$|E
40|$|RIN is an {{indicator}} of the minute changes in laser light intensity normalized by the total light intensity. In Raman amplification the lifetime of the <b>pumping</b> <b>level</b> that gives rise to gain is short (a few femtoseconds), so that the presence of noise in the pumping light will, through the amplification process, be turned directly into signal noise. In the traditional EDFA, on the other hand, the lifetime of the <b>pumping</b> <b>level</b> is comparatively long (approximately 10 msec), so that this sort of problem does not occur. In Raman amplification the gain per length is much smaller than in an EDFA, but in co-propagating Raman amplification, where the signal and pumping light propagate together in the fiber over long distances, pumping light noise is gradually superimposed onto signal noise. In a counter-propagating Raman amplifier, where the signal and pump light propagate in opposite directions, the crossover time between pumping light having a noise component and the signal is short, and the effect of pumping light noise on the signal is minimal. And since the pumping light noise is random, any effect that the signal might receive will be flattened as it proceeds in the opposite direction and not give rise to any problem. As will be understood from the above, a pump laser for 1...|$|E
