40|$|In this Essay, we contest one of {{the main}} {{arguments}} for restricting corporate board voting to shareholders. In justifying the limitation of the franchise to shareholders, scholars have repeatedly turned to social choice theory — specifically, Arrow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> — to justify the exclusive shareholder franchise. Citing to the theorem, corporate law commentators have argued that lumping different groups of stakeholders together into the electorate would result in a lack of consensus and, ultimately, the lack of coherence that attends intransitive social choices, perhaps even leading the corporation to self-destruct. We contend that this argument is misguided. First, we argue that scholars have greatly overestimated the relative likelihood of cyclical outcomes with an expanded electorate. Second, even if a nascent intransitivity were to occur, there is almost no chance that it would manifest itself in inconsistent corporate decisions, much less ones that would cause a firm to self-destruct. Moreover, the exclusive shareholder franchise, like any other preference aggregation system, may avoid violating {{one of the}} conditions of Arrow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> only by violating another — a tradeoff that has never been explicitly acknowledged or defended.

The central theme of this paper is a powerful theorem due to Kruskal, the 2 ̆ 2 tree theorem 2 ̆ 2, as well as a 2 ̆ 2 finite miniaturization 2 ̆ 2 of Kruskal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> due to Harvey Friedman.

40|$|The {{classical}} Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theorem, proved in 1915 by Pick and in 1919 by Nevanlinna, gives {{a condition}} for when there exists an interpolating function in H∞(D) for a specified set of data in the complex plane. In 1967, Sarason proved his commutant lifting theorem for H∞(D), from which an operator theoretic proof of the classical Nevanlinna-Pick theorem followed. Several competing noncommutative generalizations arose {{as a consequence of}} Sarason 2 ̆ 7 s result, and two strategies emerged for proving generalized Nevanlinna-Pick theorems: via a commutant lifting theorem or via a resolvent, or displacement, equation. We explore the difference between these two approaches. Specifically, we compare two theorems: one by Constantinescu-Johnson from 2003 and one by Muhly-Solel from 2004. Muhly-Solel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> is stated in the highly general context of W*-correspondences and is proved via commutant lifting. Constantinescu-Johnson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem,</b> while stated in a less general context, has the advantage of an elegant proof via a displacement equation. In order to make the comparison, we first generalize Constantinescu-Johnson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> to the setting of W*-correspondences in Theorem 3. 0. 1. Our proof, modeled after Constantinescu-Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s, hinges on a modified version of their displacement equation. Then we show that Theorem 3. 0. 1 is fundamentally different from Muhly-Solel 2 ̆ 7 s. More specifically, interpolation in the sense of Muhly-Solel 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>theorem</b> implies interpolation in the sense of Theorem 3. 0. 1, but the converse is not true. Nevertheless, we identify a commutativity assumption under which the two theorems yield the same result. In addition to the two main theorems, we include smaller results that clarify the connections between the notation, space of interpolating maps, and point evaluation employed by Constantinescu-Johnson and those employed by Muhly-Solel.
