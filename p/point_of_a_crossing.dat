40|$|In {{this survey}} we {{describe}} several physically motivated problems {{in which the}} corresponding mathematical models lead to overdetermined elliptic boun-dary-value problems. Such situations appear for instance in fluid mechanics and capillarity theory, theory of elasticity, electrostatics. Our goal here is to give <b>an</b> idea <b>of</b> how they have been treated mathematically. 1. 1 Interior overdetermined problems. Examples In this section we describe three physical problems which were first given mathematical consideration and solved by Serrin in his classical paper [21]. They lead to overdetermined elliptic boundary-value problems in bounded domains. Fluid moving in a straight pipe. We begin with a simple example which will help us to introduce the kind of problems we consider. Suppose we have a viscous incompressible fluid moving in a straight pipe with <b>a</b> given <b>cross</b> section. Fix rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) in space with the z−axis directed along the pipe. Then the {{cross section of the}} pipe containing the origin is a domain in the (x, y) -plane, which we denote by Ω. It is a standard result from fluid mechanics that the flow velocity does not depend on z and therefore can be regarded as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> x and y, defined in Ω. Furthermore, it is known (see for example [12]) that u satisfies the Poisson equation ∆u = − δ ηl in Ω, (1) where η denotes the dynamic viscosity, l is the length of the pipe and δ is the change of pressure between the two ends of the pipe. 1 The adherence condition {{on the wall of the}} pipe is expressed by the Dirich-let boundary condition u = 0 on ∂Ω. (2) Finally, the tangential stress on the wall is η ∂u ∂n, where n denotes the interior normal to ∂Ω. The precise determination <b>of</b> the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> maximal tangential stress is an important but mathematically very difficult problem. Here we are interested in the following question: when is the tangential stress the same at each <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> section <b>of</b> the wall? In other words, can we have <b>a</b> solution <b>of</b> (1) –(2) which satisfies the Neumann type boundary conditio...|$|R

The station survived the Second World War largely undamaged, only suffering from low-flying strafing, which caused little damage. After the war, the second track of the railway was dismantled for reparations and many rail connections within the station became superfluous and were dismantled. The traffic to Roßbach, which was interrupted {{at the end of}} the Second World War, was not resumed, and the route to Roßbach between 1946 and 1951 was also dismantled.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of visual information, humans cannot {{maintain}} a straight walking path. We examined the hypothesis that step frequency during walking affects the magnitude of veering in healthy adults. Subject walked at a preferred (1. 77 +/- 0. 18 Hz), low (0. 8 x preferred, 1. 41 +/- 0. 15 Hz), and high (1. 2 x preferred, 2. 13 +/- 0. 20 Hz) step frequency with and without a blindfold. We compared the absolute differences between estimated and measured <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>a</b> target line after 16 m of forward walking at the three step frequencies. There {{was no significant difference}} in veering when subjects walked at the different frequencies without a blindfold. However, the magnitude of veering was the smallest at the preferred (mean +/- SE = 91. 6 +/- 33. 6 cm) compared with the low (204. 3 +/- 43. 0 cm) and high (112. 7 +/- 34. 0 cm) frequency gaits with a blindfold. Thus, walking at a preferred step frequency minimizes veering, which occurs in {{the absence of}} visual information. This phenomenon may be associated with the previously reported minimization of movement variability, energy cost, and attentional demand while walking at a preferred step frequency.

40|$|OSInternational audienceThe {{purpose here}} is to study the {{behaviour}} of different types <b>of</b> actors within <b>a</b> heterogeneous population, {{as well as their}} interactions, from <b>a</b> pluridisciplinary <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. Through <b>a</b> <b>cross</b> analysis <b>of</b> the fields of economics, sociology and philosophy, we try to establish the dimensions of the notion of social complexity, particularly that which concerns the architecture of knowledge, the co-construction of representations and the complex mediation processes which the interacting agents require. Therefore, this study concerns a world where the actor is plural in the sense described by Bernard Lahire; the latter takes us to Jon Elster’s notion of the multi-self. This plural character is seen here using different coding processes as manipulations of symbols and overcoding processes; as manipulations of codes among themselves. The basic question confronting us here brings us to the interaction between the notions of social identity, social complexity and complex action, which gives rise to the occurrence of the different forms of engagement - {{to be taken into account}} in the sense used by Laurent Thévenot - related to the behaviours of actors participating in the emergence and development of social networks, of forums, like hybrid forms emerging from the modeling of complex systems as described by Herbert Simon. From <b>a</b> methodological <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, the paradigms of methodological individualism and holism are abandoned by taking the systemic approach based on the interactionist paradigm. The works of Mark Granovetter and his notion of embeddedness, as well as those of Harrison White on his notion of decoupling, are used in order to develop this analysis and thus to establish the links between codes, overcodes and different types of device Chapter One 2 within the meaning of the aesthetics of philosophy. The purpose {{here is to}} lend epistemological content to the actor-network notion within the meaning of the sociology of translation as artefact in the sense used by Simon. The operating character of this type of modelling rests in particular on cognitive shortcuts, whose nature is closely linked with the identity of actors. At this level, we examine the link existing between the autonomy of actors and the different forms of engagement participating in the emergence of hybrid structures, and we study this emergence in terms of opacity and ambiguity...|$|R
