Anthony Balderrama of Consequence of Sound wrote that the song [...] "is what you’d expect to hear: a smooth beat and an international sound, but nothing you’ll keep on repeat.

Critics claimed that Samsung knocked out smaller businesses, limiting choices for South Korean consumers, and sometimes colluded with fellow giants to fix prices while bullying those who investigate.

During subsequent years, the [...] plot of land known as [...] "People's Park" [...] has remained a focus of controversy between {{the university}}, and disparate elements of the Berkeley community. Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates has stated that [...] "over time, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realize that the park has not become what they had hoped it would be... I {{love the idea of}} having some kind of memorial recognition there, but right now it is not a place {{that a lot of people}} are comfortable going to."

2500|$|<b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> use nonviolent {{methods of}} {{struggle}} {{from a wide}} range of perspectives and traditions. A landless peasant in Brazil may nonviolently occupy a parcel of land for purely practical motivations. If they do not, the family will starve. A Buddhist monk in Thailand may [...] "ordain" [...] trees in a threatened forest, drawing on the teachings of Buddha to resist its destruction. A waterside worker in England may go on strike in socialist and union political traditions. All the above are using nonviolent methods but from different standpoints. Likewise, secular political movements have utilized nonviolent methods, either as a tactical tool or as a strategic program on purely pragmatic and strategic levels, relying on their political effectiveness rather than a claim to any religious, moral or ethical worthiness.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review in}} Hong Kong Free Press responded that [...] "while Global Times and other reviewers have {{primarily}} directed their critiques at {{the likelihood of}} the film's events actually taking place, the film cannot be entirely interpreted as a prediction for the year 2025. Ten Years is not a forecast calculated via econometric modelling; it is simply a portrayal of the Hong Kong public's worst fears. Perhaps a more pertinent question raised by the film is why <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> dread – rather than look forward to – the city’s future. The answer is probably because we have been shown no realistic alternative." [...] The same reviewer observed a message about belonging in Hong Kong: [...] "For example, Extras and Self-Immolator [...] portray mainland immigrants, South Asians and elderly characters without treating them as antagonists or resorting to stereotypes. The latter film even features a mixed-race relationship, advocating the idea that Hong Kong identity should be based on civic, not ethnic, factors." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{album of}} the songs sung in Monty Python's Life of Brian was {{released}} on the Disky label. [...] "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" [...] was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British football fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the Falklands War when sailors aboard the destroyer HMS Sheffield, severely damaged in an Argentinean Exocet missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue. Many <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see the song as a life-affirming ode to optimism. One of its more famous renditions was by the dignitaries of Manchester's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games, just after they were awarded to Sydney. Idle later performed the song {{as part of the}} 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. [...] "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" [...] is also featured in Eric Idle's Spamalot, a Broadway musical based upon Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and was sung {{by the rest of the}} Monty Python group at Graham Chapman's memorial service and at the Monty Python Live At Aspen special. The song is a staple at Iron Maiden concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.|$|E

In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating [...] "Obviously, Drake and I, we’ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be kind of intrigued about us and it’s where we’re shooting the video together. So I was like, {{there has to be some}} sort of romantic storyline. It’s Drake and me." [...] Drake additionally added [...] "I mean, it’s a fantasy video. You’ve got a very regal environment, and you’ve got Nicki doing what she does—big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. I’m not going to lie to you. The twist of it, the concept of it, I don’t want to give it all away." ...|$|E

60|$|Another savage {{trait of}} our time is the {{disposition}} to talk about material substances instead of about ideas. The old civilisation talked about the sin of gluttony or excess.

The people who talk about the curse of drink will probably progress down that dark hill. In a little while we shall have them calling the practice of wife-beating the Problem of Pokers; the habit of housebreaking will be called the Problem of the Skeleton-Key Trade; and for all I know they may try to prevent forgery by shutting up all the stationers' shops by Act of Parliament.|$|E
