40|$|Abstract. In this article, {{the issue}} of the Great Patriotic War is concretized through the study of the history <b>of</b> Soviet <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The poor {{treatment}} <b>of</b> Soviet <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> in Nazi camps is investigated in the context of international conventions that defined the status <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Without duplicating commonly known facts on the legal issues of military captivity, the author explores one of the subject’s most important aspects – issues related to the USSR’s joining international conventions on the rules for treatment <b>of</b> <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The first section of the article is dedicated to a discussion in the highest military and diplomatic circles of Germany and certain neutral countries on the definition of the legal status <b>of</b> Eastern front <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The second section focuses on the discussion of {{the issue of}} the USSR’s joining the 1907 Hague convention on ―the Laws and Customs <b>of</b> <b>War</b> on Land‖. As a result of an analysis of sources, the author comes {{to the conclusion that the}} main reason behind the poor treatment of Soviet and German <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> lies in that the attitude towards Soviet <b>prisoners</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> was defined by the Nazi’s primary goal in the war against the USSR – a total annihilation of the Soviet Union...|$|R
