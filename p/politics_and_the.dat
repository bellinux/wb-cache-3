5|$|Gandhi {{joined the}} Indian National Congress and was {{introduced}} to Indian issues, <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party {{best known for his}} restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> FAA's administrators.|$|E

5|$|The French Overseas Minister, Christian Estrozy and French Prime Minister, Francois Fillon visited French Caribbean {{island to}} assess the storm's damage.

5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker {{told her that she}} could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates reacted with skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo {{studied for}} the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After {{returning}} to India {{he took up}} various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and began increasingly involved in nationalist <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. He was arrested {{in the aftermath of}} a number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, but in a highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution-witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.|$|E

5|$|Bryant, who {{retained}} {{her maiden}} name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> women's suffrage movement by her friend Sara Bard Field, she joined the Oregon branch of the College Equal Suffrage League in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual Flag Day parade. Led by Abigail Scott Duniway, women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley's first concern {{during these}} years was the welfare of Percy Florence. She honoured her late husband's wish that his son attend public school, and, with Sir Timothy's grudging help, had him educated at Harrow. To avoid {{boarding}} fees, she moved to Harrow on the Hill herself so that Percy could attend as a day scholar. Though Percy went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, and dabbled in <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> law, he {{showed no sign of}} his parents' gifts. He was devoted to his mother, and after he left university in 1841, he came to live with her.|$|E
5|$|While Chamberlain had {{continued}} to give speeches at general elections, his entry into politics at age 42 in 1911 stemmed from interest in local <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opportunities they offered for social improvement. In 1910, Chamberlain appeared before a Parliamentary committee, testifying in favour of a bill to merge Birmingham with its suburbs. The bill passed, tripling {{the size of the}} city and greatly increasing its population. Chamberlain was very interested in city planning for Birmingham. In November 1911, standing as a Liberal Unionist, he was elected to Birmingham City Council for All Saints' Ward, located within his father's parliamentary constituency. Chamberlain's party merged with the Conservatives the following year, forming the Unionist Party, which was given its present formal name of the Conservative and Unionist Party in 1925.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained {{international}} renown for its lavish {{dinner parties}} and galas, {{often at the}} center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. Particularly after World War II it {{played a significant role in}} world <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949 at the hotel, in which Stalinism was widely denounced. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s, and in October 2014 it was announced that the Anbang Insurance Group of China had purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US$1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced that it would convert some of the Waldorf's hotel rooms into condominiums, closing the hotel for a three-year renovation on March 1, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
5|$|Most of the monarchies in Europe are {{constitutional}} monarchies, {{which means}} that the monarch does not influence the politics of the state: either the monarch is legally prohibited from doing so, or the monarch does not utilize the political powers vested in the office by convention. The exceptions are Liechtenstein and Monaco, which are usually considered semi-constitutional monarchies due to the large influence the princes still have on <b>politics,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Vatican City, which is a theocratic absolute elective monarchy. There is currently no major campaign to abolish the monarchy (see monarchism and republicanism) in any of the twelve states, although there is a significant minority of republicans in many of them (e.g. the political organisation Republic in the United Kingdom). Currently seven of the twelve monarchies are members of the European Union: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Specter {{died from}} {{complications}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, aged 82, on October 14, 2012, {{at his home}} in Philadelphia. Statements of condolence were issued by President and Mrs. Obama, Vice President and Mrs. Biden, the Office of the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by many of his colleagues and former opponents in the U.S. Congress, the Pennsylvania legislature, and the city of Philadelphia, among many others. Senator Specter, while he had been accused of alienating both parties due to certain positions he took and due to the two times he switched parties, among other issues, was nonetheless respected by many as a principled statesman who did much for his state and country, including by those in <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legislature, both in Pennsylvania and his home state, Kansas, as well as across the U.S. and beyond. He was the longest-serving of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators, and it was said that he had done more for the state than anyone else, {{with the possible exception of}} Benjamin Franklin himself. As a sign of this respect and out of mourning, President Obama ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff at public institutions and military bases in Washington, D.C. and the rest of the country on his day of interment.|$|E
5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of discussion in the country's academics, <b>politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> broader public.|$|E
