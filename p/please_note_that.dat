25|$|The {{largest and}} most {{widespread}} industry in Cumbria is tourism. The Lake District National Park alone receives some 15.8million visitors every year. Despite this, fewer than 50,000 people reside permanently within the Lake District – mostly in Ambleside, Bowness-on-Windermere, Coniston, Keswick, Grasmere and Windermere. Over 36,000 Cumbrians are employed in the tourism industry which adds £1.1billion {{a year to the}} county's economy. The Lake District and county as a whole attracts visitors from across the UK, Europe, North America and the Far East (particularly Japan). The tables below show the twenty most-visited attractions in Cumbria in 2009 (<b>please</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> not all visitor attractions provided data to Cumbria Tourism who collated the list. Notable examples are Furness Abbey, the Lakes Aquarium and South Lakes Safari Zoo, the latter of which would almost certainly rank within the top five).|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} step of duplex {{sequencing}} library preparation, Illumina sequencing adapters {{are added to the}} tagged double stranded libraries by PCR amplification using primers containing sequencing adapters. During PCR amplification both complementary strands of DNA are amplified and generate two types of PCR products. Product 1 derive from strand 1 which have a unique tag sequence (called α in the figure 2) next to the Illumina adapter 1 and product 2 that have a unique tag (called β in the figure 2) next to illumina adapter 1. (<b>Please</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> in each strand, tag a is the retrograde, complementary version of tag b and vice versa). The libraries containing duplex tags and Illumina adapters are sequenced using Illumina TruSeq system. Reads that are originating from each single strand of DNA form a group of reads (tag families) that are sharing the same tag. The detected families of reads will be used in next step for analyzing sequencing data.|$|E
