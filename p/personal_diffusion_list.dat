40|$|A four-stage <b>personal</b> <b>diffusion</b> battery (pDB) was {{designed}} and constructed to measure submicron particle size distributions. The pDB consisted of a screen-type diffusion battery, solenoid valve system, and electronic controller. A data inversion spreadsheet was created to solve for the number median diameter (NMD), geometric standard deviation (GSD), and particle number concentration of unimodal aerosols using stage number concentrations from the pDB combined with a handheld condensation particle counter (pDB+CPC). The inversion spreadsheet included particle entry losses, theoretical penetrations across screens, the detection efficiency of the CPC, and constraints so the spreadsheet solved to values within the pDB range. Size distribution parameters (NMD, GSD, and number concentration) measured with the pDB+CPC with inversion spreadsheet were within 25 % of those measured with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) for 5 of 12 polydisperse combustion aerosols. For three tests conducted with propylene torch exhaust, the pDB+CPC with inversion spreadsheet successfully identified that the NMD was smaller than the constraint value of 16 nm. The ratio of the nanoparticle portion of the aerosol compared to the reference (R nano) was calculated to determine the ability of pDB+CPC with inversion spreadsheet to measure the nanoparticle portion of the aerosols. The R nano ranged from 0. 87 to 1. 01 when the inversion solved and from 0. 06 to 2. 01 when the inversion solved to a constraint. The pDB combined with CPC has limited use as a personal monitor but combining the pDB with a different detector would allow for the pDB {{to be used as}} a personal monitor.

40|$|This work strived to {{increase}} knowledge of assessing airborne nanoparticles {{in the workplace}} by characterizing nanoparticle concentrations in a workplace using direct-reading instruments, evaluating a DC 2000 CE diffusion charger, {{and the creation of}} a <b>personal</b> <b>diffusion</b> battery (pDB). Direct-reading instruments were used with aerosol mapping and task monitoring to evaluate airborne nanoparticle concentrations in an apparel company that produces waterproof jackets composed of polytetrafluoroethylene membrane laminated fabric. Jacket production required that sewn seams be sealed with waterproof tape applied with hot air (600 °C). Particle number concentrations were greater in the sewing and sealing areas than the office area while respirable mass was negligible throughout the facility. The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who sealed the sewn seams were highly variable and significantly greater when sealing seams than when conducting other tasks (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). The effectiveness of the canopy hoods used to ventilate sealing operations was poor. These measurements support the idea that work places were hot processes are conducted may have substantially greater concentrations of airborne nanoparticles than background measurements even with control measures in place. Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate a commercially available diffusion charger, the DC 2000 CE, that measures nanoparticle surface area concentration. The surface area concentrations of unimodal and multimodal polydispersed aerosols measured by the DC 2000 CE were less than the surface area concentrations measured by the reference instruments. The differences in results were attributed to a difference of measuring active versus geometric surface area concentration and the design of the DC 2000 CE. The maximum measurable active surface area concentration (2, 500 mm 2 m- 3) was found to be greater than the manufacturer stated maximum (1000 mm 2 m- 3). Moving or vibrating a DC 2000 CE while taking measurements can cause the appearance of increased surface area concentration results. The DC 2000 CE has limitations that must be acknowledged when using the DC 2000 CE to measure airborne nanoparticle surface area concentrations in a workplace. A four stage pDB (3. 2 kg) composed of a screen-type diffusion battery, solenoid valve system, and an electronic controller was developed. The pDB was combined with a CPC and a data inversion was created that could be used to solve for the number median diameter, geometric standard deviation, and particle number concentration of a unimodal distribution. The pDB+CPC with inversion was evaluated using unimodal propylene torch exhaust and incense exhaust.

Diffusion is anomalous in cold chromatographic grade silicones, especially with long-chain n-alkanes, yeilding skewed peaks and, in the methyl-sillcones, high diffusion coefficients. The anomaly is less apparent above 150 °C and with low mole-cular weight methylsilicones. Butler and Hawkes (1) reported that diffusion of /i-alkanes in the polydimethylsilicone SE- 30 (mol. wt. 4 x 10 s) is faster than in the lower molecular weight polydimethylsilicone SF- 96 - 200 (mol. wt. 1. 1 x 104). The investigation of diffusion coefficients of /i-alkanes and other organic compounds in polydimethysilicones has been continued with commercial polydimethylsilicones of intermediate molecular weights, along with three phenylmethylsilicones of varying phenyl content and molecular weights, two fluoropropylsilicones of different molecular weights and a cyanosilicone. The gas chromatographic system for measuring diffusion coefficients is exactly the same as in (1). During this investiga-tion it was realized that data obtained from the gas chromato-graph for very volatile samples are unreliable because of blow-back of volatile samples from the injection system into the carrier gas feed stream.

As a panacea, many governments have called on organizations and individuals to pay greater interest in landscaping and embark on landscaping projects through planting trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses in their immediate and distant environments. Through landscaping, the greenery, beauty, and scenic architecture of a place are preserved. This research, therefore, aims to evaluate landscaping adoption and adoption determinants by Malaysian and Nigerian organizations. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the theory of organizational buying behavior and the innovation <b>diffusion</b> theory, a <b>list</b> of potential facilitators of landscaping adoption was derived and used as the basis for collecting data from the organizations. These data were factor analyzed to determine the key dimensions of facilitators for landscaping adoption. On the basis of the resulting dimensions, discriminant analysis was conducted to identify the factors that are sufficient in discriminating between the organizations that have adopted landscaping (adopters) and those that have not done so (non-adopters). Findings - The results show that organizational factors such as environmental sensitivity of the firm, organization's size, organization's people, and cost implication, as well as innovation characteristics, namely relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity, are significantly sufficient for discriminating between adopters and non-adopters. An organization's structure and divisibility are not significant determinants. Practical implications - The finding of this research is beneficial in designing strategies for the protection and enhancement of the greenery and beauty of the environment, and for overall environmental management.

We tested 196 isolates of Acinetobacter spp. from nine U. S. hospitals and from the Centers for Disease Control culture collection by using BMD and DD and clinically appropriate antimicrobial agents. Categorical results for amikacin, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were comparable for the two methods: {{there was only one}} very major (VM) error, with tobramycin, and only one major (M) error, with meropenem, when DD results were compared with BMD results. However, VM errors were frequent with the β-lactams and β-lactam-β-lactam inhibitor combinations, while M errors were often observed with tetracyclines. For BMD, tests frequently exhibited subtle growth patterns that were difficult to interpret, especially for β-lactams. If subtle growth (i. e., granular, small button, or “starry” growth) was considered positive, error rates between BMD and DD were unacceptably high for ampicillin-sulbactam (VM error, 9. 8 %; minor [m] error, 16. 1 %), piperacillin (VM error, 5. 7 %; m error, 13. 5 %), piperacillin-tazobactam (VM error, 9. 3 %; m error, 12. 9 %), ceftazidime (VM error, 6. 2 %; m error, 11. 4 %), cefepime (VM error, 6. 2 %; m error, 13. 0 %), cefotaxime (m error, 21. 2 %), ceftriaxone (m error, 23. 3 %), tetracycline (M error, 11. 4 %; m error, 32. 1 %), and doxycycline (M error, 2. 6 %). When subtle growth patterns were ignored, the agreement still did not achieve acceptable levels. To determine if the problems with BMD testing occurred in other laboratories, we sent frozen BMD panels containing β-lactam drugs and nine isolates to six labs with experience in performing BMD and DD. Among these laboratories, cefepime MICs ranged from ≤ 8 to ≥ 32 μg/ml for four of the nine strains, confirming the problem in interpreting BMD results. Discrepancies between the categorical interpretations of BMD and DD tests were noted primarily with cefepime and piperacillin, for which the BMD results were typically more resistant.

40|$|The exemplum is {{a privileged}} {{target for the}} {{cultural}} study of the medieval society. If the research regarding the content of those edifying anecdotes is already well advanced, {{the analysis of the}} real audiences and concrete uses of the exempla remained yet to be undertaken. Because the expansion and characterization of this typology is directly linked with the emergence of the collections of exempla, our investigation was based on this kind of works. To succeed with this project, we used the information existing in the manuscripts copies and in medieval booklists. With these two kinds of sources, we analysed books as physical objects (cover, writing, etc.), vehicles of culture (versions, surrounding works, etc.) and historical witness (purchase, legacies, etc.). The thesis focused on the following central questions: how did books of exempla diffused in time and space? Which works achieved success? Who were the owners of these books? How did they read and use them? In the first part of our analysis, the theoretical one, historiographical and historical definitions of the exemplum and the collections of exempla have been clarified. This was indispensable because {{a large part of the}} scientific literature, especially in France, only considered the exemplum as a kind of story, which appeared in the twelfth century and was used by preachers in sermons to illustrate a salutary message. By saying so, they neglected the persuasive nature of the exemplum, confining it to a literary genre. In reality, the exemplum should be primarily considered as a rhetorical argument based on a deed or a word that happened in the past. Nevertheless, its persuasive power, which comes from its visual imagery, is especially effective when the case is told in the form of a story. This phenomenon is currently studied in the storytelling management, which uses stories to improve communication. In sum, the exemplum is an argument stemming from reality in the form of a story. The history of the exemplum does not start with the mendicant orders, but within democracy and the rhetoric schools of Athena and later in Rome. With the emergence of Christianity, church fathers use it to fight against heretics and monks to share the spiritual experience of elders to novices. A pro domo use of the exempla appears with the creation of the new religious orders, first Cluny, then the Cistercians and finally the mendicants. The latter put exempla in theirs sermons to attract the attention of their audience, though not only. They use them in conversations, lectiones and also in didactic and moral treatises. This was no novelty: previous writers such as John of Salisbury in his Polycraticus uses it abundantly. If the years 1250 - 1350 are the magnificent era of the exemplum, since the second half of the 14 th century, we can notice a decline of the exemplum, which becomes either an illustration, an allegory, or an open, facetious, entertaining or devote story. As far as the books of exempla are concerned, for a long time scholars did not try to define them precisely. They looked at these collections only for the stories they contained. To their minds, an exempla collection was simply a book in which there were exempla. To make a necessary distinction between very differing books of exempla, we need to precise: a) the proportion of exempla; b) if the exempla are used by the authors as arguments or offered to the readers for rhetorical purposes; c) if there is an organizational system. Those questions successively allow distinguishing books of exempla from books with exempla, exempla treaties from exempla collections and exempla repositories. Nonetheless, due to the fact that exemplum is not a genre but a function, it is very hard to define a clear corpus. The first important book of exempla comes from Roman Antiquity. The Facta et dicta memorabilia of Valerius Maximus was used as a text book for students in rhetoric. With the flourishing of monasticism, exempla collections of the Vitae patrum spread all over the Christian world, diffusing the good examples of the desert Fathers. In the beginning of the second millennium, religious orders continued this practice, but with the new will of putting their respective orders forward. The first alphabetical repositories of exempla appear at the end of the 13 th century due to the necessity of preaching and of tidying up growing knowledge. However, alongside the existence of these collections of exempla made for preaching purposes, there are many others books and treaties of exempla, whose function is either to instruct, or to give the rules of social morality, or simply to edify readers. The second part of the thesis puts the stress on the concrete diffusion and uses of the exempla collections. The investigation on the manuscript copies shows, inter alia, an increase in their number during the centuries (13 times more in the 15 th than in the 13 th century), the predominant place of the German area, especially in the 15 th century, and the growing importance of the treatises of exempla, taking advantage on the repertories. With regards to the incunabula, we count 172 Latin and 74 vernacular editions of exempla collections before 1500. This mainly concerns repositories for the former when the latter contains almost exclusively treaties. The production of this edition starts in the years 1470, culminates in the years 1480 and declines at the end of the century. Geographically, we notice the same importance of the German speaking area, especially in the city of Strasbourg. At the second place we find Italy, which produces mainly antique exempla collections. For the manuscript copies as for the incunabula editions, we have to keep in mind that it exists huge differences of success between books of exempla. The last chapter focuses on the diffusion and uses of the books of exempla written by the Dominicans, the biggest producer of such collections. We also see big discrepancies of success, owners and uses. For example, the Gerard of Frachet’s Vitas fratrum were mainly read in continental Europe by Dominicans and Canons regular to keep conventual order and morality, while the John Herolt’s Promptuarium exemplorum was used by different orders and persons in the German world for pastoral purposes and John of Bromyard’s Summa praedicantium was located in England in highly intellectual institutions, such as universities and big Benedictine monasteries. A collection of exempla can also have different readers and uses. Thomas of Cantimpre’s Bonum universale de apibus, written for conventual purposes, was also used either as a repertory of exempla for preaching or as a treaty of social morality. John of Cessoles’ Liber de moribus was not only read by preachers and pastors but also by lay people as spiritual lecture. Across the study of the different exempla collections, we notice many German 15 th century manuscripts exclusively elaborated for pastoral uses. In these Priesterhandbücher we can find, next to exempla collections, sermons, artes predicandi, treaties on the Mass, explanation of the sacraments, the Ten Commandments and Credo. Unlike a common vision of exempla collections produced and used within the preaching, this global study shows, on the one hand, the great diversity of production environments and aims intended by exempla compilers, as well as, on the second hand, an equally important variety concerning diffusion and real uses of such works. Added to the thesis, there is an appendix of more than 300 pages presenting 68 Latin books of exempla, in which the characteristics of the work are exposed, the objectives of use pursued by the author, and the modalities of <b>diffusion</b> (including the <b>list</b> of manuscripts, medieval mentions, translations and editions).
