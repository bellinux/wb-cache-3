25|$|Perception {{of color}} depends {{heavily on the}} context in which the {{perceived}} object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or <b>purple</b> <b>light</b> will reflect mostly blue, pink, or <b>purple</b> <b>light</b> to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as color constancy.|$|E
25|$|Natural sources {{also include}} mollusks, the Murex sea snails produce {{a mixture of}} indigo and dibromoindigo (red) which {{together}} produce a range of purple hues known as Tyrian <b>purple.</b> <b>Light</b> exposure during part of the dying process can convert the dibromoindigo into indigo resulting in blue hues known as royal blue or hyacinth purple.|$|E
50|$|<b>Purple</b> <b>Lighting</b> (Zi-Dian or Zidian, 紫电) is a UAV in flying wing layout with winglets, {{and it has}} fixed {{tricycle}} landing gear. <b>Purple</b> <b>Lighting</b> {{is designed}} {{by a team of}} graduate students of NUAA led by Professor Mr. Shi Zhi-Wei (史志伟). Development of <b>Purple</b> <b>Lighting</b> first begun in 2008, and it took six years to complete, after scrapping nine prototypes within {{the first nine months of}} development, a time to apply theories to build an actual aircraft. <b>Purple</b> <b>Lighting</b> is unique in that its utilizes plasma for flight control, the first of its kind in China. Plasma exciters are installed on wings, and when these high-voltage exciters are turned on, plasma stream is generated, producing lift that can be used to control the UAV. For example, when plasma exciters on the right wing are turned on and thus generating greater lift, the UAV would tilt toward left. The color of the plasma stream generated in purple, hence the name <b>purple</b> <b>lighting,</b> because the plasma stream resembles <b>purple</b> colored <b>lighting</b> in the dark. Another benefit of utilizing plasma control is that the plasma generated absorbs radar wave, helping to improve stealth.|$|R

25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a <b>purple</b> <b>light.</b> Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E
500|$|Limited in {{exposure}} to eligible men, Sophia {{and several of}} her sisters became involved with courtiers and equerries. Sophia entered into a relationship with her father's chief equerry, Major-General Thomas Garth, a man thirty-three years her senior. He had a large purple birthmark on his face, causing Sophia's sister Mary to refer to him as [...] "the <b>purple</b> <b>light</b> of love" [...] and courtier and diarist Charles Greville to call him a [...] "hideous old devil". Despite this, one lady-in-waiting noted [...] "the princess was so violently {{in love with him}} that everyone saw it. She could not contain herself in his presence." [...] Greville wrote about Sophia and her sisters' affairs in a diary entry, [...] "women fall in love with anything – and opportunity and the accidents of the passions are of more importance than any positive merits of mind or of body... were secluded from the world, mixing with few people – their passions boiling over and ready to {{fall into the hands of}} the first man whom circumstances enabled to get at them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of the songs {{that had already been}} performed during the 2013 shows remained the same; however some of them were shortened and mixed together. Many new songs from the singer's fifth album were added to the set list with a specific staging and theme. The projections shown on the stage followed the concept behind the singer's visual album. The performance of [...] "Flawless", the second song on the set, opened with the words from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TED talk projected with big letters on the screen and later Beyoncé performed a choreography with her female dancers similarly to the song's music video. A performance of [...] "Yoncé" [...] followed with a new choreography with her dancers. [...] "Blow" [...] was merged with [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] (2003) and featured a burlesque and disco-era theme. During the end of the performance a projection of Pac-Man, the character of the game with the same name, eating cherries was projected on an LED screen onstage. [...] "Partition" [...] was performed in a similar fashion to its music video with Beyoncé appearing with a silhouette, dancing on a couch in front of a <b>purple</b> <b>light.</b> For [...] "Drunk in Love", the singer performed a choreographed chair dance. During [...] "Haunted", strobing lights and dancers were present on stage. [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "XO" [...] were performed as the concert's last songs along with [...] "Halo".|$|E

500|$|As Kiedis {{begins to}} sing, he appears on camera bathed in <b>purple</b> <b>light</b> with blue {{fluorescent}} {{stars as a}} backdrop, surrounded by clouds. As the camera pans closer, {{an image of the}} skyline of Van Sant's home city, Portland, is superimposed from his chin downwards. Flea and Chad Smith are then placed into the image while playing their instruments. Van Sant wanted superimposing to be a notable component in the overall theme of the video; the idea came from a project he worked on with novelist William S. Burroughs. The scenes in the studio are coupled with scenes of Kiedis walking the streets of L.A., wearing a white T-shirt with [...] "To Hell And Back" [...] printed on the front; as he walks, the camera focuses on various people. He can, at various points in the video, be seen {{standing in front of the}} Belmont Tunnel before its closure. This, according to Kiedis, was vital; he felt that the studio portion alone would not convey enough emotion: [...] "the first time we shot [...] it was all in a studio and that didn't seem to capture everything we needed to capture. It needed more; it needed to be combined with an outdoor, streets-of-Los-Angeles thing". Towards the end, Kiedis is seen running down the Los Angeles River channel in slow motion; the background is a nuclear explosion (the [...] "Baker" [...] shot of Operation Crossroads). The video ends with various superimposed images of the band, followed by Frusciante playing alone on a pedestal—this time with an inverted shot of the ocean as the sky.|$|E
2500|$|The 1883 Krakatoa {{eruption}} darkened the sky worldwide {{for years}} afterwards, and produced spectacular sunsets {{throughout the world}} for many months. British artist William Ashcroft made thousands of colour sketches of the red sunsets {{halfway around the world}} from Krakatoa in the years after the eruption. The ash caused [...] "such vivid red sunsets that fire engines were called out in New York, Poughkeepsie, and New Haven to quench the apparent conflagration." [...] This eruption also produced a Bishop's Ring around the sun by day, and a volcanic <b>purple</b> <b>light</b> at twilight.|$|E
2500|$|The six {{previous}} colors (silver, black, mint, turquoise, berry red, {{and rose}} pink) {{were replaced by}} silver, black, <b>purple,</b> <b>light</b> blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and pink, {{for a total of}} nine, although the Product Red color was only available directly from Apple (website and retail stores). Apple marketed the new colors as [...] "Nano-chromatic". Also added was an accelerometer which allows the Nano to shuffle songs by shaking it, the option between portrait and landscape display modes by tilting the iPod left or right, and access to Cover Flow when tilted sideways. Videos, however, could only be played in landscape mode. The user interface was also refreshed, adding a more stylized look in keeping with the new hardware design. It included a new voice recording feature which started automatically when an Apple compatible microphone is plugged in. It also included the new [...] "Genius" [...] feature, introduced by Apple the same day. The Genius feature automatically creates playlists based on a selected song using an algorithm built by Apple.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{from its}} {{proximity}} to the worsted factory, the intense heat caused the sulphur to ignite, melt and stream in a burning blue flame liquidised state from the windows. The authorities, abandoning the mill, sought to save the warehouse, directing all their efforts on it, and were reinforced by the military with their fire engine. This effort was thwarted by the wide scattering of burning brands from the fallen factory roof, which gave additional stimulation to the burning sulphur. By 3 am, the entire warehouse was one body of flames [...] "most awfully magnificent". The sulphurous blaze illuminated the river and its shipping, the High Level Bridge, the Castle, the steeples of All Saints', St. Nicholas' and St. Mary's churches, and every prominent object, with a lurid <b>purple</b> <b>light.</b> From the various floors of the warehouse the sulphur flowed in torrents like streams of lava, and the building resembled [...] "a cataract on fire". Yet {{at this point the}} occurrence had borne no aspect other than that of a fearful blaze, a tremendous firestorm sufficiently serious of itself, and altogether unprecedented in the annals of the district.|$|E
2500|$|Most remote {{controls}} for electronic appliances use a near infrared diode to emit {{a beam of}} light that reaches the device. A 940 nm wavelength LED is typical. This infrared light is invisible to the human eye, but picked up by sensors on the receiving device. Video cameras [...] see the diode as if it produces visible <b>purple</b> <b>light.</b> With a single channel (single-function, one-button) remote control the presence of a carrier signal can be used to trigger a function. For multi-channel (normal multi-function) {{remote controls}} more sophisticated procedures are necessary: one consists of modulating the carrier with signals of different frequency. After the receiver demodulates the received signal, it applies the appropriate frequency filters to separate the respective signals. [...] One can often hear the signals being modulated on the infrared carrier by operating a remote control in very close proximity to an AM radio not tuned to a station. [...] Today, IR remote controls almost always use a pulse width modulated code, encoded and decoded by digital computer: a command from a remote control consists of a short train of pulses of carrier-present and carrier-not-present of varying widths.|$|E
