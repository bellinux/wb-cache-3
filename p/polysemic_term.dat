For concept-based video indexing and retrieval, this idea seems a priori valid. One of the major problems is then to provide a definition of the context and to choose the most appropriate methods for using it. Two kinds of contexts were exploited in the past to improve concepts detection: in some works, inter-concepts relations are used as semantic context, where other approaches use the temporal features of videos to improve concepts detection. Results of these works showed that the "temporal" and the "semantic" contexts can improve concept detection. In this work we use the semantic context through an ontology and exploit the efficiency of the temporal context in a "two-layers" re-ranking approach. Experiments conducted on TRECVID 2010 data show that the proposed approach always improves over initial results obtained using either MSVM or KNN classifiers or their late fusion, achieving relative gains between 9 % and 33 % of the MAP measure...|$|R

40|$|Definitions {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of any high-quality terminological resource as well as a privileged medium for knowledge representation since they offer a direct natural-language explanation of the content of a concept. The adequacy of the definitions thus largely determines the overall usefulness of the terminological resource for the user. This study has been motivated by the observation that terminological definitions often do not meet the needs of users. This is partly due to certain preconceptions about the purpose of definitions as well as the nature of meaning itself. These preconceptions thus affect how terminological definitions are created. Traditionally, defining a term has been seen as stating the necessary and sufficient characteristics that make up the meaning of the term. This approach, known as the Aristotelian definition (§ 3. 2), presupposes the existence of a stable meaning, independent of the context in which the term is used. In addition, it is assumed that meaning (or semantic knowledge) is independent of world knowledge (or encyclopedic knowledge). The key premises on which the traditional approach to definitions is based have been refuted in the field of cognitive linguistics (§ 2. 1) : i) it is not possible to determine the necessary and sufficient features of a concept because conceptual boundaries are fuzzy; ii) concepts have prototypical features not shared by all members of the category; iii) it is not possible to make a distinction between semantic and encyclopedic knowledge, nor between semantic and pragmatic knowledge. From a cognitive point of view, encyclopedic knowledge plays a central role in the study of meaning because concepts always appear embedded in frames, which are structures based on encyclopedic knowledge which attribute sense to concepts (Fillmore 1982 a). Moreover, meaning is not considered a stable entity. It is constructed in each usage event in accordance with the context (§ 2. 1. 2). As a consequence, meaning and context are inseparable. In this doctoral thesis, we apply these premises of cognitive linguistics to terminological definitions and present a proposal called the flexible terminological definition (§ 3. 6). This consists of a set of definitions of the same concept made up of a general definition (in this case, one encompassing the entire environmental domain) along with additional definitions describing the concept from the perspective of the subdomains in which it is relevant. Our proposal assumes that by eliminating the artificial boundaries between semantic and pragmatic knowledge, the representation of contextual variation in the terminological definition will no longer be a mere possibility. Given the ubiquity of context and its effects on cognition and language, the representation of the traits activated by concepts in accordance with the context becomes a necessity if one aspires to fully meet the user’s needs. This also entails the inclusion of prototypical characteristics in the definition, i. e. characteristics that are not always applicable to the concept, but which are relevant in a given context. Similarly, encyclopedic knowledge in the terminological definition is no longer forbidden. It now forms an integral part of the definition. The role that the defined concept plays in the frames it activates should be, as far as possible, part of the definition. Our proposal is specifically based on frame-based terminology (§ 2. 2), in addition to the theories of grounded cognition (§ 2. 1. 1), frame semantics (§ 2. 1. 2. 2), prototype theory (§ 2. 1. 3. 2), and the theory theory (§ 2. 1. 3. 3). We took as a starting point the application of frame-based terminology to the representation of specialized knowledge and to terminological definitions in EcoLexicon (a terminological knowledge base on the environment created in accordance with frame-based terminology). In fact, our proposal for a flexible definition was inspired by the recontextualization of EcoLexicon (§ 3. 6. 1), as a result of which conceptual maps only show the relevant information for the subdomain of the environment chosen by the user. Recontextualization in EcoLexicon represents contextual variation and avoids information overload, thus increasing knowledge acquisition by the users. EcoLexicon follows the principle proposed by Meyer, Bowker, and Eck (1992 : 159) according to which, for a terminological knowledge base to be truly useful, it must reflect the same conceptual organization as in the human brain. Since terminological definitions are a kind of knowledge representation (Faber 2002), in this doctoral thesis, we assume that the creation of terminological definitions should also be based on the organization of the human conceptual system. Since context is a determining factor in the construction of the meaning of lexical units (including terms), we assume that terminological definitions can, and should, reflect the effects of context, even though definitions have traditionally been treated as the expression of meaning void of any contextual effect. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the effects of contextual variation on specialized environmental concepts with a view to their representation in terminological definitions. Specifically, we focused on contextual variation based on thematic restrictions (§ 3. 5. 3. 4), i. e. how the different areas of knowledge comprising the vast domain of the environment conceptualize differently the same concepts, and how this can be reflected in the definition. One of the main fundamentals of our proposal is the notion in cognitive linguistics that lexical units only have meaning in real use events (§ 2. 1. 2). Outside of any use event, a lexical unit does not have any meaning, only semantic potential. A term’s semantic potential is the raw material for its definition, not its object. The semantic potential is not the object because this would mean that defining a term would involve describing all the conceptual content that the term could activate. This is not viable since a term’s semantic potential corresponds to a vast, immeasurable quantity of information that is never fully activated in real events. Lexical units have not only semantic potential, but also associated conventional and contextual constraints. These constraints cause some conceptual content to be activated more often than others, giving rise to what Croft and Cruse (2004 : 110) call pre-meanings. Pre-meanings are conceptual units that appear between the semantic potential and the meaning in the conceptualization process. The object of the definition is thus a subset of the semantic potential that corresponds to a pre-meaning. The pre-meaning that becomes the object of a given definition depends on the contextual constraints applied to the definition. In all cases, this subset always corresponds to a portion of a single concept and the frames that it can activate. By contextual constraints, we mean any situational factors that affect meaning construction and, indirectly, the content of terminological definitions. Given that the object of the definition (the pre-meaning) is an abstraction of the meanings that a lexical unit has under certain contextual constraints, we can state that the context associated with a pre-meaning is also a sort of abstraction from real contexts. As a consequence, we gave the name pre-context to the set of contextual restrictions that limit the semantic potential of a lexical unit in a relatively predictable way, giving rise to pre-meanings. Context comprises the linguistic context, discursive context, sociocultural context, and spatial-temporal context. The pre-context for terminological definitions includes linguistic constraints, thematic constraints, cultural constraints, ideological constraints, and diachronic constraints. Thematic constraints (i. e. discourse topic) allow for more accurate predictions about the way that the semantic potential of a given lexical unit is restricted than other contextual factors. Thematic constraints reduce the semantic potential of a lexical unit according to the topic at issue during a communicative act and the point of view taken. Our proposal of a flexible terminological definition relies on these types of constraint. Domains, in terms of a knowledge field, allow for the systematic characterization of thematic constraints in terminological definitions. They can be understood as macroframes that guide knowledge organization and categorization in a given conceptual area. In this doctoral thesis, we have used a simplified version of the domain classification that was created specifically for EcoLexicon. This work focuses on the phenomenon of contextual variation as opposed to lexical ambiguity (polysemy and homonymy). Contextual variation is the phenomenon that occurs when a concept does not always activate the same traits in use events and the relevance of these traits varies. For its part, lexical ambiguity is the phenomenon that occurs when a lexical unit is associated with more than one concept (Cruse 2011 : 100). To accomplish the objectives of this doctoral thesis, we conducted an empirical study (§ 5) consisting of the analysis of a set of contextually variable concepts and the creation of a flexible definition for two of them. Each of these two concepts presented different contextual profiles. To select the concepts to be analyzed, a terminological extraction was performed on 14 corpora of different environmental subdomains, specifically compiled for this doctoral thesis (§ 4. 1. 2. 1). The extraction was limited to simple nouns, and the results were compared so as to retain only those terms appearing (with a set frequency) in more than three domains. <b>Polysemic</b> <b>terms</b> were discarded manually. To extract the knowledge needed for the conceptual analysis and the writing of the flexible terminological definitions, the methodology of frame-based terminology (with certain additions) was followed (§ 4. 2. 2). This methodology consists of a combined top-down and bottom-up approach. The top-down method includes mainly the analysis of definitions from other terminological resources, whereas the bottom-up approach comprises corpus analysis. For more efficient knowledge extraction from the corpora, we employed hypernymic knowledge patterns (Meyer 2001 : 290) coded as word-sketches for SketchEngine. This allows for the extraction of superordinate concept candidates for the choice of genus in definitions. Moreover, we created a word-sketch for the extraction of contextonyms, which are the lexical units that tend to co-occur with a given lexical unit in linguistic contexts (Ji, Ploux, and Wehrli 2003; Ji and Ploux 2003). In this work, the analysis of contextonyms was used to determine the semantic traits activated by a concept in a given domain. As a result of the first part of our empirical study (the analysis of all the terms in our working list) (§ 5. 1), we divided our notion of domain-dependent contextual variation into three different phenomena: i) modulation (similar to Cruse’s modulation (§ 3. 5. 3. 5. 2)); ii) perspectivization (related to Cruse’s ways-of-seeing (§ 3. 5. 3. 5. 3)); iii) subconceptualization (akin to Cruse’s microsenses and local sub-senses (§ 3. 5. 3. 5. 4)). These phenomena are additive in that all concepts experience modulation, some concepts also undergo perspectivization, and finally, a small number of concepts are additionally subjected to subconceptualization. Modulation (§ 5. 2. 1) is the type of contextual variation that only alters minor characteristics of a concept which are neither necessary nor prototypical. These alterations are not represented in a terminological definition. For its part, perspectivization (§ 5. 2. 2) results in the change in the level of prototypicality of certain traits for a concept in relation to the general environmental premeaning. Finally, subconceptualization (§ 5. 2. 3) is the type of contextual variation in which the extension of the concept in relation to the general environmental premeaning is modified. In the second part of our empirical study (§ 5. 4), we created two flexible terminological definitions, one for a concept with subconceptualizations (POLLUTANT) and another for a concept with perspectives (CHLORINE). In this section, we presented guidelines on how to build them, from the extraction of knowledge to the actual writing of the definition. These guidelines ensure that the definition actually reflects how the defined concept is construed in different environmental domains, which might differ from the viewpoint adopted in the environment as a whole or other environmental subdomains. This doctoral thesis contributes to the improvement of the quality of terminological definitions because, with our approach, the user is presented with a definition tailored to the domain that he/she has chosen, thus multiplying the probabilities that the definition will offer him/her the information he/she needs. Furthermore, flexible terminological definitions provide a knowledge representation that better resembles the human conceptual system than traditional terminological definitions. As a consequence, a flexible definition not only provides more relevant information, but it also accomplishes this in a way that potentially facilitates and enhances knowledge acquisition...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on two decades’ scholarship in geography on cultural economy, assessing strides made {{against some of}} the expectations of early proponents. Cultural economy continues to be a <b>polysemic</b> <b>term.</b> In some quarters, it refers to a type of economic geography into which matters of ‘culture’ are absorbed. This work frequently focuses on the empirics of the so-called ‘cultural and creative industries’. Others see cultural economic research as an opportunity to move beyond the epistemological constraints of ‘culture’ and ‘economy’, questioning their status as foundational categories. This latter approach has been used in a broader set of empirical projects encompassing technology, knowledge, and society. Contrasting threads of cultural economic research have helpfully moved geographical scholarship beyond paradigmatic limitations, but jostle somewhat uncomfortably within existing (and increasingly specialised) disciplinary and subdisciplinary fields. The risk is that by questioning the categorical underpinnings of much specialised research, cultural economy struggles to ‘belong’ in the increasingly coded and compartmentalised university setting. I conclude with a discussion of future prospects. Some measure of vitality could be achieved through incorporation of a cultural economy perspective into the pressing issues of climate change, human sustenance, and urban infrastructure planning. These are issues for which the polysemy of cultural economy could prove constructive, transcending technocentric market ‘fixes’ and bland assumptions about how best to ‘green’ our cities – promoting instead ethnographic interrogations of how humans access, use, exchange, and value financial and material resources as moral and social beings...|$|E

METHODS We have carried out an analysis of the literature in database in Spanish, Portuguese, and English, without restriction by country. This is a review of the gray literature of government reports, articles, and documents from Latin America and the Caribbean. We have analyzed information on the informal economy, social-employment vulnerability, and subsistence workers. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The concept of informal economy is dispersed and suggested as synonymous with employment vulnerability. As a <b>polysemic</b> <b>term,</b> it generates confusion and difficulty in identifying defined profiles of employment vulnerability in informal subsistence workers, who sell their products on the streets and sidewalks of cities. The lack of a clear concept and profile of employment vulnerability for this type of workers generates a restriction on defined actions to reduce employment vulnerability. The profiles could facilitate access to the acquisition of assets that support their structure of opportunities, facilitating and mediating in the passage from vulnerability to social mobility with opportunities. We propose as a concept of employment vulnerability for subsistence workers in the informal sector, the condition of those who must work by day to eat at night, who have little or no ownership of assets, and who have a minimum structure of opportunities to prevent, face, and resist the critical situations that occur daily, putting at risk their subsistence and that of the persons who are their responsibility, thus making the connection between social and employment vulnerability...|$|E

How to exploit that analogy with non point source pollution is a challenge for landscape economics research. Each actor has his own objective and management criteria, either for agricultural, forestry, industrial or residential activities. Moreover, there are multiple public policies aimed at sustaining each activity. Inevitably, public policies failures arise, and so the need for coordination actions aimed at landscape maintenance and preservation. Because the local public good nature of the landscape, it’s worth to look at the models of public good joint production. How to agregate actions from different land owners into a resulting landscape, or how to coordinate actions scattered among multiple landowners {{in order to get a}} specific desired outcome is a real challenge ? In some case, the responsability of changes is concentrated in the hand of few decision makers, in some others, the responsability is more diffuse, and the non point production function of the landscape could be approximated by an additive function. The issue of the agregation of actions is closely related to the one of preferences heterogeneity and agregation. Because a specific landscape project could be appreciated as beneficial or detrimental by different people, it’s necessary to separate the stage of evaluation, the stage of decision making and the stage of implementation. Issues of coordination of actions arising at the implementation stage should take for granted the landscape objectives and the social value of the project. Eventually, the design of Institutional arrangements to manage landscape should take onto account his nature of common pool resource. The paper is organized so as to take stock from the contributions of the research community in Landscape economics, and also to signal some missing links and promising paths.

In this sense, this research suggests that, with various modalities of self-similarity, synecdochic intersemiosis acts as system of systems in coordination with greater or lesser development of structural consistency, and with a greater or lesser contextual dependence. 'Self-similarity' an abstract concept borrowed from mathematics is gradually becoming a keyword in musicology. This is due to the fact that self-similarity often refers to the multi-feature repetition observed in a set of relationships, and it is commonly valued as an indication for musical coherence and consistency. In their own way, coherence and consistency are notions closely related to typical features of music, independently of any tradition or historical period: symmetry, similarity, and repetition. Most, or almost all aspects of music, including relationships of harmony, metre, rhythm, melody, timbre, and texture, depend on criteria of symmetry; and comparison between these relationships, essential for forming musical sense, necessarily demands for criteria of similarity and contrast also refered to as dissimilarity. Accordingly, it is quite hard finding a musical example avoiding any kind of repetition, because somehow music is a repetition of sounds in time and space, in agreement with the conventions of a certain tradition. Research on musical self-similarity usually provide rich information about essential aspects of symmetry, similarity, and repetition, crucial for establishing any kind of musical sense...|$|E
40|$|To {{preserve}} the independence {{and quality of}} life of our seniors, it is essential to reconcile the requirements of security issues with mobility ones. Public action in road safety can be renewed by being sensitized to the issue of security management, i. e. by searching underlying rationalities from the observed behaviors. This requires studying the security in action from senior drivers' activity analysis. Most of the older drivers use their capabilities in order to build an appropriate response to the driving conditions encountered. These coping skills enable them to remain fit to drive. Starting from practice, this approach allows to redefine the "good driving" rules and thus shed new light on the driving assessment issue. In French, the translation of the word 'driving' is a <b>polysemic</b> <b>term.</b> In this 'habilitation to conduct research' dissertation, it will is used in its generic sense. It includes an objectified part (behavior) and a non-objectified part: the reason, the motive, the act(s) of thought that come before, during or after a performance. The research works I have conducted tried to elucidate the roles of cognitive, affective and conative processes to capture the processes' intermediate parts (or links) involved in the adopted behaviors; we based our investigations on the study of intra and inter-subjective processes. This approach allows us to objectivize the origins and sometimes the causes of behaviors. However, to better understand them, an observation approach must be associated. Indeed, through observation, the objective reasons to act are figured-out by building a posteriori arguments based on observed behavior and statements from the individuals. These two approaches are complementary, they allow to explain and to understand behaviors in order, ultimately, to better act. A central concept in the study of adaptation to normal cognitive aging is the cognitive control (ability to respond to stimuli based on the present context, past indices and internal aims). The study of cognitive control during driving allows the description of different forms of adaptation exploring their dimensions, their mechanisms and their determinants. To understand seniors' behaviors, it is also necessary to take into account their situation, their needs, their physical and social environments to better describe their difficulties and the risks they are exposed to. The complementarity of different tools and methods used to tackle this issue is addressed. The research conducted to date help to clarify aims to be reached in order to increase senior safety, to identify priority actions and also to help public authorities to take rational decisions that maximize both the mobility and safety of older drivers. Through examples, we described the adaptive strategies adopted by some older drivers to safe act against disturbances that appear while aging and we also describe how we can identify older drivers who do not adapt optimally. As attention capacities are essential to preserve a safe driving, an expand section on attentional failure while driving is also presented. Within the two research lines, whose main results are detailed below, it is shown that the concept of estimation bias is central to the implementation of driver' behavioral self-regulation. 1. Older drivers' self-regulatory behaviors were explored regarding declared aberrant driving behaviors and perceived abilities. The study suggests that perceived abilities, especially self-assessed driving related processing speed and attentional abilities, {{play a major role in}} the decision to self-regulate its own behaviors (avoiding difficult driving situations) and that such self-efficacy beliefs are a stronger predictors of avoidance than driver behavior questionnaire. The avoidance of difficult driving situations as a behavioral self-regulation option were also compared between young and older drivers : the older drivers reported greater avoidance situations than the younger drivers, more significant correlations were observed between self-reported driving avoidance and both health-related perceptions and objective indicators of cognitive function among them. To explore if older adults spontaneously draw on their monitoring skills to accurately self-regulate their behaviors, we explored drivers' self-regulation within discrepancy reduction framework and the region of proximal learning : we have shown that younger and older drivers were thus equally able to identify their region of proximal learning. In a complementary study, we have also shown that exposing older drivers to a stereotype threat severely impairs their self-regulatory skills; this is at least partly due to exhaustion of the executive resources appearing through working memory overload. These research works were the starting point for a wider reflection on the implementation of more effective training interventions, especially for older drivers that present a cognitive self-assessment bias. These interventions will allow to support behavior change in order to improve the comfort and safety of older drivers. 2. Due to substantial gains in road safety due to speed reduction, safety-belt wear, and the diminution of driving under alcohol influence, the proportion of accidents due to attention failure while driving increases. In a four years project funded by the French research agency (ANR), we worked in a multidisciplinary team (cognitive and mathematical sciences and epidemiology) to clarify the road safety issues and identify avenues for innovative actions to better supervise the driver. A first step was to identify the risk fractions attributable to different types of attention failure in order to better prevent them. A survey was conducted in Bordeaux hospitals. 955 drivers injured in a road accident were interviewed following their admission to the emergency rooms. They were asked to report their activity and the content and intensity of their thoughts in the moments before the accident. Of the 453 drivers related to mind wandering (MW), the contents proved intense or disturbing for 121. These thoughts were significantly more frequent among drivers responsible for the accident. It thus appears that an accident on ten is linked with a driver intrusive thought (Galéra et al., 2012). Distractions related to events outside the vehicle and driver activity are also associated with responsibility (OR 3. 3 and 9. 6 respectively). Attributable share of casualties related to external distraction is estimated at 9 % (Bakiri et al., 2013). These epidemiological findings show that attention failure during driving is a road safety deposit that may reduce the number of casualties on our roads. In a second step, we also tried to understand the influence of various failure of attention on driver behavior. First, three forms of cognitive interference were studied to describe their effects on simulated driving behavior and the treatment of information (studied with the evoked potentials technic). Visuospatial cognitive distractions impacted anticipation (by observing the contingent negative variation, CNV), while verbal distractions impacted the information processing at sensory and cognitive processing steps. The experimental results showed the differential influences of various types of cognitive control (attentional control, emotional control and behavioral inhibition). Experiments conducted on a simulator and on the road showed that: retrospective and prospective thoughts change ocular strategies (eye gaze and increased pupillary diameter; Lemercier et al., 2014), the increased cognitive effort results in increased heart rate associated with a decrease of its variability and different regulation strategies have been described for the control of cognitive effort while driving (Gabaude et al., 2012). A complementary study have then shown that the real-time detection of cognitive effort is feasible. A survey through the use of an off-line questionnaire was also conducted to reveal the individual and contextual characteristics of driving in a MW state, to describe behavioral consequences of MW on driving and to determine the characteristics of off-task thoughts while driving (Berthié et al., 2015). In this research project, the influences of MW on the accident risk and on the driving behavior have been demonstrated, it provides avenues of research and an insight into new original development. The complementarity of the two types of methods to analyze the impact of cognitive distraction on driving activity by exploratory and confirmatory analysis was discussed. Geometry information methods have been used to analyze data applied from the vehicle side to enable the thresholds identification beyond which it is probable that the driver performs driving competing activity (Letelier, 2012). These criteria are not always sensitive because of the variability of observed behaviors. The psycho-ergonomic analysis of the drivers' activities could help to better describe the various regulation strategies that can be adopted. This approach is required to identify, from the data side, the most sensitive and specific algorithms. This will be the first step towards the development of a driver supervision system, thus contributing to the objectives of reducing road accidents. By comparing different disciplinary perspectives, this project has allowed substantial progress on the subject of attention failure while driving. We began to understand the causes and origins of various attention failure and their consequences on driving. The exploratory analysis of sequential data and supervised learning techniques (data-mining) applied to the data collected on highway are used to search algorithms able to identify a distracted driver. New technological challenges, consisting in the adaptation of driving assistance depending on the driver state, will soon be addressed. The work presented in this dissertation also stress the need to broach health issues in their complexity and not to address the driving ability issue in regard of a unique road safety policy. To take advantage of successful aging, the elderly must evolve with their environment and adapt consequently. The increase of knowledge on this adaptation notion is essential. The knowledge gained on the adaptation to cognitive aging must now be exploited to develop interventions to accompany the older drivers in various stages of adoption of precautionary behavior. In the perspective section outlined in this dissertation, we develop four directions to implement research actions in order to: accompany the public authorities on issues related to the safe mobility of seniors, better prevent negative effects of aging, offer to older users the digital revolution opportunities taking place in the health and transportation domains and lastly to promote a continuum of mobility for our seniors. In future research, it will also be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the different actions or interventions proposed, some first ideas in this direction are suggested. Afin de préserver l'autonomie et la qualité de vie de nos aînés, il est indispensable de concilier des exigences de sécurité et de mobilité. L'action publique en sécurité routière peut être renouvelée en étant sensibilisée à la question de la sécurité gérée, c'est à dire en procédant à une logique de recherche des rationalités sous-jacentes aux comportements obserÎs. Ceci nécessite d'étudier la sécurité en action à partir de l'analyse de l'activité de conduite de nos ainés. La plupart des conducteurs âgés utilisent leurs capacités dans le but de bâtir une réponse adaptée aux situations de conduite rencontrées. Ces capacités d'adaptation leur permettent de rester aptes à conduire. Une telle démarche permet de partir des pratiques pour redéfinir les règles de « bonne conduite » et ainsi apporter un éclairage nouveau sur la question du bilan d'aptitude à la conduite. La conduite, terme polysémique pris ici dans son sens générique, contient : une partie objectivable (le comportement) et une partie non objectivable : le motif, le mobile, l(es) acte(s) de pensée qui accompagnent précèdent ou suivent un comportement. Les travaux que j'ai menés tentent d'élucider les processus cognitifs, affectifs et conatifs pour saisir les chainons intermédiaires des processus en cause dans nos conduites; nous fondons nos investigations sur des processus intra et intersubjectifs. Cette démarche nous permet d'objectiver les causes d'un comportement. Cependant, afin de mieux les comprendre, elle doit être accompagnée par une démarche d'observation : en effet, par l'observation, on objective les raisons d'agir en construisant a postériori une argumentation à partir des comportements obserÎs et des déclarations faites par les individus. Les deux approches sont complémentaires, elles permettent d'expliquer et de comprendre afin, au final, de pouvoir mieux agir. Une notion centrale dans l'étude de l'adaptation au vieillissement cognitif normal est celle de contrôle cognitif. L'étude du contrôle cognitif en conduite automobile permet de décrire différentes modalités de l'adaptation. Afin de comprendre les comportements de nos aînés, il est aussi nécessaire de prendre en compte leurs situations, leurs besoins, leurs environnements physique et social afin de mieux décrire les difficultés rencontrées et les risques encourus. La complémentarité de différents outils et méthodes utilisés pour aborder cette problématique est ainsi abordée. Les recherches menées à ce jour contribuent à préciser les objectifs à atteindre, à définir les actions prioritaires et à prendre des décisions rationnelles qui maximisent à la fois la mobilité et la sécurité des conducteurs âgés. Au travers d'exemples, nous verrons comment certains conducteurs âgés agissent en sécurité face aux perturbations apparaissant avec le vieillissement et comment nous pouvons identifier ceux qui ne s'adaptent pas de façon optimale. Nous verrons que la notion de biais d'estimation est centrale dans la mise en oeuvre d'autorégulations comportementales. Ces recherches ont permis de mettre en oeuvre des programmes d'entrainement destinés aux conducteurs âgés présentant un biais d'évaluation cognitive. Les premiers résultats indiquent que l'intervention semble efficace pour améliorer la calibration cognitive des participants, cette piste est novatrice. Elle permet d'accompagner les changements de comportements et ainsi améliorer le confort et la sécurité des conducteurs âgés. Les travaux présentés soulignent aussi la nécessité de penser les questions de santé dans leur complexité et de ne plus aborder cette question de l'aptitude à la conduite sous l'angle d'une unique politique de sécurité routière. Pour bénéficier d'un vieillissement réussi, la personne âgée doit évoluer avec son milieu et s'adapter, la progression des connaissances sur cette notion d'adaptation est donc essentielle. Les connaissances acquises sur l'adaptation au vieillissement cognitif doivent maintenant être mises à profit afin de mettre en place des interventions destinées à accompagner les personnes âgées dans les différents stades d'adoption de comportement de précaution. Dans les perspectives tracées dans ce travail d'HDR, nous proposons de développer différentes actions afin de promouvoir un continuum de mobilité pour nos aînés. Il sera nécessaire de prévoir d'évaluer l'efficacité des différentes interventions proposées, des premières propositions sont formulées...|$|E
