40|$|The {{paper by}} Stelljes [1] {{the subject of}} this {{discussion}} is a welcome addition to the Casualty Actuarial Society literature on nonlinear regression for loss reserving. This discussion will predominantly concern a key assumption made in [1]. In particular, on page 361 : “Based {{on the assumption that the}} incremental <b>pure</b> <b>premiums</b> for different development intervals are independent, the variance of IBNR <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> is the sum of the variances of the incremental <b>pure</b> <b>premiums</b> for the remaining development intervals. ” It may be true that the historical incremental <b>pure</b> <b>premiums</b> can be considered independent, but it does not follow that the future fitted incremental <b>pure</b> <b>premiums</b> are independent. An analogous situation exists for ordinary linear regression, where the hat matrix provides for the covariance of the fitted values. Since the variance of the sum of random variables depends on covariance between the random variables, the variance of the reserve will depend on the covariance of the incremental IBNRs. After providing a brief review on traditional nonlinear regression in section 2, the bulk of this discussion is concerned with two issues. First, modifying the methods of [1] to reflect covariance among the fitted values and is described in section 3. Second, there are times when a reliabl...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} aggregate loss distributions {{from the}} perspective of collective risk theory. An accurate, efficient and practical algorithm is given for calculating cumulative probabilities and excess <b>pure</b> <b>premiums.</b> The input re-quired is the claim severity and claim count distributions. One of the main drawbacks of the collective risk model is the uncertainty of the parameters of the claim severity and claim count distributions. Modifi-cations of the collective risk model are proposed to deal with these problems. These modifications are incorporated into the algorithm. Examples are given illustrating the use of this algorithm. They include (1) calculating the <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> for a policy with an aggregate limit; (2) calculating the <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> of an aggregate stop-loss policy for group life insurance; and (3) calculating the insurance charge for a multi-line retrospective rating plan, including a line which is itself subject to an aggregate limit. 1...|$|R
40|$|Agro-meteorological index {{insurance}} is an innovative agricultural insurance product that has solved problems of conventional agricultural insurances including excessive cost and moral hazard. Agro-meteorological index insurance {{has become an}} effective agricultural insurance scheme. This paper primarily uses meteorological data and winter wheat yield data in the Jiangsu Province for the last 35 years to build a yield loss model based on which we designed an agro-meteorological index. Using production data and the experience rate method, we calculate <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> rates for winter wheat in different cities for different deductible amounts. According to the calculation results, we divided the Jiangsu Province into three regions with different deductible amounts and determined <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> rates and <b>pure</b> <b>premiums</b> for each city, thereby completing {{the design of a}} winter wheat meteorological index insurance product.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} gain {{competitive advantage}} by offering better rates {{and services to}} attract and retain the best customers. Generalized linear models (GLMs) have become popular and proven techniques for ratemaking and actuarial work over the past decade. Claim frequency is typically modeled using a Poisson distribution; severity is modeled using a gamma distribution; and <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> is modeled using a Tweedie distribution. Insurance providers use these models to accurately estimate losses and set the most competitive rates accordingly.

Common choices include linear and log-linear models. This paper considers maximum likelihood estimation and testing for functional form using the power transformation sug-gested by Box and Cox. The linear and log-linear models are special cases of this transformation.

The predictive accuracy of the method compares favorably to that for the linear and log-linear models for both data sets.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating accurately the <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> of a property and casualty insurance portfolio when the individual aggregate losses are assumed to follow a compound Poisson distribution with gamma jump sizes. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with a Tweedie response distribution are analyzed as a method for this estimation. This approach is compared against the standard practice in the industry of combining estimations obtained separately for the frequency and severity by using GLMs with Poisson and gamma responses, respectively. We show that one important {{difference between these two}} methods is the variation of the scale parameter of the compound Poisson-gamma distribution when it is parametrized as an exponential dispersion model. We conclude that both approaches need to be considered during the process of model selection for the <b>pure</b> <b>premium...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} nonparametric Bayesian credibility without imposing stringent parametric assumptions on claim distributions. We {{suppose that}} a claim distribution {{associated with an}} unknown risk characteristic of a policyholder is an unknown parameter vector with infinite dimension. In this way, we incorporate {{the uncertainty of the}} functional form of the claim distribution associated with the unknown risk characteristic in calculating credibility premiums. Using the results of Ferguson (1973), formulas of the Bayesian credibility premiums are obtained. The formula for the Bayesian credibility <b>pure</b> <b>premium</b> is a linear combination of the overall mean and the sample mean of the claims. This is consistent with the result in the classical credibility theory. We perform a simulation study for the nonparametric Bayesian credibility <b>pure</b> <b>premiums</b> and compare them with the corresponding Bühlmann credibility premiums.
