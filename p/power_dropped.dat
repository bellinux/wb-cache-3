40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) {{systems have}} been {{regarded}} as maintenance-free; however, numerous failures have been reported recently during their operation. These failures not only cause <b>power</b> <b>drops</b> in the PV system but {{can also lead to}} serious accidents. This paper proposes a diagnosis method that utilizes the current–voltage (I–V) measurements of the PV string to detect the existence of a <b>power</b> <b>drop</b> module in the PV system. This diagnostic methodology is based on the calculation of the decrease {{in the area of the}} string I–V curve and dP/dV–V characteristic from the obtained data. A <b>power</b> <b>drop</b> module in the PV string is assumed and calculated. First, the normal and failed versions of the PV string are distinguished by plotting the decrease in the area of the I–V curve on one axis and the ratio of the <b>power</b> <b>drop</b> on the other axis. The differences among each failure mode are then obtained by evaluating the dP/dV–V characteristic of the PV string. Finally, experimental tests are performed on the PV string to validate the proposed method of detecting <b>power</b> <b>drop...</b>|$|R

2500|$|For 1973, Pontiac restyled its personal-luxury Grand Prix, mid-sized LeMans {{and compact}} Ventura models and {{introduced}} the all-new Grand Am {{as part of}} the LeMans line.

The 1973 Firebird Trans Am's factory applied hood decal, a John Schinella restylized interpretation of the Native American fire bird, took up most of the available space on the hood. Also in 1973, the new Super Duty 455 engine ("Super Duty" [...] harkening back to Pontiac's Racing Engines) was introduced. Although it was originally supposed to be available in GTOs and Firebirds, only a few SD 455 engines made it into Firebird Trans Ams that year. One so equipped was tested by 'Car and Driver' magazine, who proclaimed it the last of the fast cars. But the pendulum had swung, and the SD 455 only hung on one more year in the Trans Am.|$|E

Thought the rate of <b>power</b> <b>drop</b> was unexpected, it was thought that it could be due to a distortion of the mirrors during a time short compared to a the thermal diffusion time. This transient distortion might affect the laser more than the steady state distortion. This paper presents some analysis of the transient mirror heating problem and some recent experimental results using different mirror substrates and coatings. It is found that the behavior of the first mirror set cannot be reconciled with the observed power fall-off if a linear absorption is assumed. The <b>power</b> <b>drop</b> in more recent experiments is consistent with linear thermal analysis. No anomalous transient effects are seen...|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} Merlin and Griffon engine designs used single-stage superchargers. For engines {{equipped with}} a single-stage supercharger the air being forced through the supercharger air intake was compressed by the supercharger's impeller. In {{the case of the}} Merlin II/III, XII and 40 series as the air was being compressed it was mixed with fuel which was fed through an SU carburettor before being fed into the engine's cylinders. The Merlin III produced 1,030 hp (770kW) at +6¼lb/in² (43 kPa) of [...] "boost" [...] (the [...] "boost" [...] is the pressure to which the air/fuel mixture [...] is compressed before being fed to the cylinders). The limitation of the single stage supercharger was that the maximum <b>power</b> <b>dropped</b> quickly as higher altitudes were reached; because air pressure and air density decreases with altitude the efficiency of a piston engine drops because of the reduction in the weight of air that can be drawn into the engine; for example the air density, at [...] is 1/3 of that at sea level, thus only 1/3 of the amount of air can be drawn into the cylinder and only 1/3 of the fuel can be burnt.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was quickly}} evident the Mustang's performance, {{although}} exceptional up to [...] (the supercharger's critical altitude rating), was markedly reduced at higher altitudes. This {{was because the}} single-speed single-stage supercharger fitted to the V-1710 had been designed to produce maximum power at low altitude; above that, <b>power</b> <b>dropped</b> off rapidly. Prior to the Mustang project, the USAAC had Allison concentrate primarily on turbochargers in concert with General Electric; the turbochargers proved to be reliable and capable of providing significant power increases in the P-38 Lightning and other high-altitude aircraft, in particular in the Air Corps' four-engine bombers. Most of the other uses for the Allison were for low-altitude designs, where a simpler supercharger would suffice. Fitting a turbocharger into the Mustang proved impractical, and Allison was forced to use the only supercharger available. In spite of this, the Mustang's advanced aerodynamics showed to advantage, as the Mk I was about [...] faster than contemporary P-40s using the same V-1710-39 (producing [...] at , driving a [...] diameter, three-blade Curtiss-Electric propeller).
