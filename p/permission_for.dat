5|$|By 1857 a {{blast furnace}} had opened {{close to the}} Durham {{coalfield}} {{on the north side}} of the Tees. Backed by the rival West Hartlepool Harbour & Railway, the Durham & Cleveland Union Railway proposed a line from the mines in Skinningrove and Staithes, via Guisborough and a bridge over the Middlesbrough & Redcar Railway to a jetty at Cargo Fleet, from where a ferry would carry the ore across the Tees to the blast furnaces. When the proposal was before Parliament the S suggested that their Middlesbrough & Redcar could be extended to Saltburn, and the Tees crossed by a swing bridge. The Cleveland Railway received <b>permission</b> <b>for</b> a line from Skinningrove as far as Guisborough, and the S <b>permission</b> <b>for</b> an extension to Saltburn and a branch to a mine at Skelton. This 1858 S Act also authorised the merger of the S with the railways it held on lease.|$|E
