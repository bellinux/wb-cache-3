5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the <b>partially</b> <b>sighted.</b> Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a new visual device concept {{for patients with}} <b>partially</b> <b>sight</b> loss named Visual Signal Adaptive Restitution (ViSAR). This new concept adapt the signal visual itself to the patient's visual discomfort in real time. While most device tends to compensate for physiology anomaly, ViSAR concept allows to improve the patient-signal interaction and to favor an active vision. This system is the first interacting with eye movements and adapting signal to patient cognitive behavior. Patients do not do anything, ViSAR adapts visual signal to patient's visual discomfort without changing visual and referential reflexes. This new concept involves {{at the same time}} engineer, ophthalmologic, optometric and cognitive competencies. ViSAR concept offers a new visual device generation satisfying the growing needs in assistance technolog...|$|R

5|$|Bute's father, John, Lord Mount Stuart, died a {{few months}} after he was born and as a young child he was brought up first by his mother, the former Lady Elizabeth McDougall-Crichton, and later by his {{paternal}} grandfather, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. He travelled widely across Europe before attending Cambridge University. He contracted an eye condition and remained <b>partially</b> <b>sighted</b> {{for the rest of his}} life. Having inherited large estates across Britain, he married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818, and together they lived a relatively secluded life in Mount Stuart House in Scotland, one of Bute's four seats. Bute was dour but industrious, with a flair for land management. He focused his daily routine around extensive correspondence with his estate managers, making biennial tours of his lands around the country. The couple did not conceive any children, and Maria died in 1841. Bute remarried four years later, to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, and she gave birth to Bute's only child, John, in 1847.|$|E
5|$|At both Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors matches, away {{supporters}} are {{situated in the}} North Stand behind the goal. Occasionally, during rugby games which attract low away support, the 5,418 capacity North Stand is closed altogether, and the away fans who attend are put into an alternative stand. The eastern stand, known as 'The Boston Stand', and the western 'Springfield Stand' run across the longer sides of the pitch. The Boston Stand is the largest, capable of seating up to 8,238 fans and holding an electronic scoreboard. The Springfield Stand contains the stadium's vital facilities; four dressing rooms, benches, a doping control room and a treatment room for the players, as well as four executive boxes, ten radio commentary points and a designated TV studio, in addition to holding 6,100 fans. The North Stand and South Stand have a seating capacity of 5,418 and 5,412 respectively. The stadium also has facilities and access for up to 278 fans with disabilities, with facilities for <b>partially</b> <b>sighted</b> fans. The seats are a mixture of both resident teams' main colours — cherry red and blue. The stadium is fully compliant with safety guidelines for a sports ground.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} playing equipment, the major {{adaptation}} is the ball, which is significantly {{larger than a}} standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings. The size allows <b>partially</b> <b>sighted</b> players to see the ball and the contents allow blind players to hear it.

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanics of}} the VISOR (the transmission of images directly into the brain to overcome blindness) has been developed in the real world, albeit not as precisely as seen in Star Trek. In 2005, a team of medical researchers at Stanford University used a combination of microchip implants behind mice retinas and goggles equipped with LED readouts and a small camera to <b>partially</b> restore <b>sight</b> enough so that the mice could distinguish sets {{of black and white}} patterns. In 2006, a woman who lost her sight in a car crash had a similar procedure performed on her in Portugal which gave her the ability to see object outlines and differences in light.|$|R

50|$|Optical {{collimator}}s {{are also}} used as gun sights in the collimator sight, which is a simple optical collimator with a cross hair or some other reticle at its focus. The viewer only sees {{an image of the}} reticle. They have to use it either with both eyes open and one eye looking into the collimator sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and the target, or with one eye to <b>partially</b> see the <b>sight</b> and target at the same time. Adding a beam splitter allows the viewer to see the reticle and the field of view, making a reflector sight.|$|R
5000|$|Like most signed languages, ASL has an {{analogue}} to speaking {{loudly and}} whispering in oral language. In order to vary the [...] "volume", the signer increases or reduces their signing. [...] "Loud" [...] signs are {{larger and more}} separated, sometimes even with one-handed signs being produced with both hands. [...] "Whispered" [...] signs are smaller, off-center, and sometimes (<b>partially)</b> blocked from <b>sight</b> to unintended onlookers by the speaker's body {{or a piece of}} clothing. In fast signing, in particular in context, sign movements are smaller and there may be less repetition. Signs occurring {{at the end of a}} phrase may show repetition or may be held ("phrase-final lengthening").|$|R
25|$|Blind cricket is {{a version}} of the sport of cricket adapted for blind and <b>partially</b> <b>sighted</b> players. It has been governed by the World Blind Cricket Council (WBCC) since 1996. So far, four Blind World Cups have been held, New Delhi, India (1998); Chennai, India (2002) and Islamabad, Pakistan (2006). In 2012, the first Blind World Cup T20 was held in Bangalore, India. Blind cricket relies on common use of the 'sweep shot', in order to provide maximum chance of the bat hitting the ball.|$|E
25|$|Various other {{modifications}} to the rules apply. Verbal signals are widely used both by umpires and players: in particular, the bowler must shout 'Play!' as he releases the ball. The delivery is required to pitch at least twice when bowled to a completely blind batsman (once when bowled to a <b>partially</b> <b>sighted</b> batsman), but must not be rolling. Totally blind batsmen cannot be out stumped, and must be found to be LBW twice before going out. Totally blind fielders are allowed to take a catch on the bounce.|$|E
25|$|Special needs {{students}} {{are entitled to}} Ongoing Resource Scheme (ORS) funding, which is used for facilitating the adaption of the curriculum to fit the student, funding of teacher aides and specialists, and procuring any special equipment required. There are three levels of funding based on the student's needs: very high, high or combined moderate. For example, a student who is totally blind or deaf is classified as very high needs, while a student who is <b>partially</b> <b>sighted</b> (6/36 or worse) or severely or profoundly deaf (71dB loss or worse) is classified as high needs. ORS funding is permanent, so it continues until the student leaves school.|$|E
5000|$|A {{collimator}} sight {{is a type}} {{of optical}} sight that allows the user looking into it to see an illuminated aiming point aligned with the device the sight is attached-to regardless of eye position (with little parallax). Collimator sights are 'blind' sights; that is, they are used with both eyes open while one looks into the sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and then at the target, or using one eye to <b>partially</b> see the <b>sight</b> and target at the same time. Collimator sights are a relatively old idea, being used in many forms for almost 100 years. They are also referred to as collimating sights [...] or [...] "occluded eye gunsight" [...] (OEG).|$|R
60|$|Returning {{into the}} body of the cathedral, we next entered the choir, where, instead of the crimson {{cushions}} and draperies which we had seen yesterday, we found everything folded in black. It was a token of mourning for one of the canons, who died on Saturday night. The great east window, seventy-five feet high, and full of old painted glass in many exquisitely wrought and imagined Scriptural designs, is considered the most splendid object in the Minster. It is a pity that it is partially hidden from view, even in the choir, by a screen before the high altar; but indeed, the Gothic architects seem first to imagine beautiful and noble things, and then to consider how they may best be <b>partially</b> screened from <b>sight.</b> A certain secrecy and twilight effect belong to their plan.|$|R
50|$|Kaplan {{was born}} into a Jewish family, as one of seven children. She became a {{political}} revolutionary at an early age and joined a socialist group, the Socialist Revolutionaries. In 1906, when she was 16 years old, Kaplan was arrested in Kiev over her involvement in a terrorist bomb plot, and committed for life to the katorga (a hard-labor prison camp). She served in the Maltsev and Akatuy prisons of Nerchinsk katorga, Siberia, where she lost her <b>sight</b> (<b>partially</b> restored later). She was kept in the Maltzevskaya prison, where she was severely caned on her bare body as disciplinary corporal punishment. Fully undressed corporal punishment was not usual for political prisoners at that time. She was released on March 3, 1917, after the February Revolution overthrew the imperial government. As a result of her imprisonment, Kaplan suffered from continuous headaches and periods of blindness.|$|R
