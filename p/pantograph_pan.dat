50|$|While APT-E {{was still}} under construction, the team was well into {{the design of a}} {{production}} version. Jones found an ally in Graham Calder, who had been promoted to become BR's chief mechanical engineer (CME) in 1971. At the time they envisioned building two new experimental trains; one was essentially a stretched version of the APT-E with turbine power, and the other was similar, but powered by overhead electrical lines via <b>pantograph</b> (<b>pan).</b>|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{this system}} the {{electric}} traction overhead contact wire wear is continuously measured. A GaAs LED and lens combination produces a collimated {{beam of light}} along the <b>pantograph</b> <b>pan.</b> The beam, through which the contact wire slides, is monitored by a vertical array of phototransistors spaced at equal intervals. The number of phototransistors in shadow at any instant {{is proportional to the}} contact wire thickness. A fibre-optic data link conveys the encoded information from the pan at high tension to the locomotive at ground potential...|$|E

Again in the kit form, seven were {{completely knocked down}} and rest partially assembled. CLW started producing these traction motors on 11/1/1999. The units built by ABB have double-pan pantographs while CLW built units have single <b>pan</b> <b>pantographs</b> which are common in India. This class had a capacity to MU several units but IR restricts them to two because of dynamic loading restriction on most bridges. Regenerative brakes provide about 260 kN of braking effort.|$|R
