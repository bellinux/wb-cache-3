5|$|The Panzer IV saw {{service in}} all combat theaters {{involving}} Germany {{and was the}} only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war. Upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter new threats, extended its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the Panzer IV's armor protection or upgrading its weapons, although during {{the last months of}} the war, with Germany's <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|Although the Thames {{had been}} defended from naval attack since Henry VIII's time, when five blockhouses were built {{as part of}} the Device Forts chain of coastal defences, there were no {{equivalents}} on the Medway. Two medieval castles – Rochester Castle and Queenborough Castle – existed along the river's south bank, but both were intended to defend landward approaches and were of little use for defence. There was thus a <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> for proper defences to protect the vulnerable ships and shore facilities on the upper Medway.|$|E
5|$|In March 1949, British Railways {{ordered a}} final 20 from Brighton works despite a <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> for smaller tank locomotives. This {{imbalance}} was rectified by building forty-one {{examples of the}} LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T for the Southern Region. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic Leader class. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. Ashford works cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and Eastleigh works constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Wilson's {{prestige}} {{encouraged the}} almost immediate formation {{of more than}} a dozen companies of infantry in and around Boston. The <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> to send troops to the front required Wilson to abandon his original intention of raising multiple regiments of infantry and he instead selected the 10 companies closest to readiness, thus creating the 22nd Massachusetts Regiment. To this regiment were attached the 3rd Massachusetts Light Artillery and the 2nd Company Massachusetts Sharpshooters. Thus, the 22nd Massachusetts became one of the few infantry units in the Civil War with attached artillery and sharpshooters.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado was {{attracted}} by reports of gold, and also wished {{to prevent the}} complete abandonment of the territory by the Spanish. He invaded Higueras in 1536, with 80 well-armed soldiers of mixed infantry and cavalry, accompanied by about 3000 indigenous Guatemalan auxiliaries; Many of the auxiliaries were Achi Maya warriors with a particularly fearsome reputation. He also brought Indian and African slaves to work the mines, as well as livestock to assist the colonisation effort. His route took him past a strong native fortress called the Peñol of Cerquín, where native warriors had amassed to resist the Spanish. Alvarado, seeing {{the strength of the}} fortress and aware of the <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> to relieve Buena Esperanza, decided not to storm the fortress and pushed onwards to assist his countrymen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Bellerophon was launched, {{there was no}} <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> for new warships. The signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 brought the American War of Independence to an end while Bellerophon was still under construction. Though Greaves had been {{contracted}} to have her ready for launching by April 1784, she spent another two years on the slipway, probably because the Navy Board ordered construction work to be delayed to allow her timber to be seasoned, a luxury available now {{that there were no}} pressing military needs. When the launch came, it was delayed several times, finally taking place during a period of heavy autumn storms in October 1786. She was launched with little ceremony on 7 October 1786, by Commissioner Charles Proby, of Chatham Dockyard. She was then towed across the River Medway and anchored off Chatham Dockyard. She was taken into the dry dock there on 7 March 1787, where her hull was fitted with copper sheathing, and she was fitted for the Ordinary. Her final costs came to £30,232.14.4d paid to Greaves for building her, and a further £8,376.15.2d spent on fitting her for service.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his many}} successes, {{during the last}} twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh {{measures}} he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. Conscription was introduced, causing resentment among the peasantry, despite the <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> for new recruits to the imperial army. In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed. In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.|$|E
5|$|From 1905, Giovanni Bausan {{served as}} a {{training}} ship for stokers and mechanics until {{the outbreak of the}} Italo-Turkish War in 1912. Returning to active duty as Flagship Cyrenaica, she served in the shore bombardment role {{until the end of the}} war, when she was again returned to second-line service as a distilling ship. Fitted with four distillers and capable of producing 200 tons of fresh water every 24 hours, she was operating in this role at the start of the First World War. Because of the <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> for artillery for service with the army, Giovanni Bausan was partially disarmed in 1915, losing her 10-inch guns and two of the 6-inch pieces. Later in the war, the rest of her armament was removed. She was reassigned for service as a seaplane depot ship at Brindisi. Decommissioned in 1919, she was sold for scrap in March 1920 and broken up soon after.|$|E
5|$|While {{food was}} {{extremely}} {{hard to come}} by, an even more <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> was obtaining drinking water. Thirst {{and the search for}} water are mentioned in most of the Robinsons' memoirs. The most common sources originally included toilet cisterns, boilers, and standing water found inside bathtubs. As these ran out, those in hiding were forced to risk sneaking access to wells, which were often guarded by German soldiers. Some memoirs describe long periods observing a particular well and waiting for a chance to obtain a quick drink. Another method involved obtaining polluted sewer water from the canals, and then filtering it through coals wrapped in rags. Generally, records indicate that whatever scant water supplies existed were shared fairly among individuals hiding as a group. In at least one instance, one person was unable to withstand the thirst and drank the whole group's water supply. As a result, Jakub Wiśnia, a former Gęsiówka inmate and after its liberation, a Home Army soldier, was court-martialed by his fellow group members and sentenced to death. The execution was to be postponed until after liberation, but when that occurred, the Robinsons were so overwhelmed with joy, the crime was forgiven and the sentence was never mentioned again.|$|E

25|$|As more provinces joined Canadian Confederation, {{there was}} a <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> to formalize provincial {{boundaries}}.

25|$|Like many abolitionists, Douglass {{believed}} that education would be crucial for African Americans {{to improve their}} lives. This led Douglass to become an early advocate for school desegregation. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more <b>pressing</b> <b>need</b> for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.|$|E
