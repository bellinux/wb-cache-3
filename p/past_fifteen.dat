Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighborhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the National Human Development Initiative, under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.|$|E

Some of the more common terms are shortened versions of the trade name [...] "Xanax", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, Z-bars, footballs, planks, poles, blues, or blue footballs.

500|$|Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News {{considered}} the album's title {{to be influenced}} by Janet Jackson's Damita Jo, which was also based on an alternate persona. According to Jenson Macey from BBC News, The Emancipation of Mimi was Carey's strongest effort from the 2000s; he said that the album [...] "took her straight back {{to the top of the}} A-List." [...] Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five, calling it [...] "cool, focused and urban." [...] The New York Timess, Jon Pareles, complimented how Carey wrote all of the album's material. He felt the record's sound was fresh and innovative: [...] "on The Emancipation of Mimi, she disciplines herself into coherence, using fewer tricks and sounding more believable. She also finds what lesser singers can take for granted: a certain lightness that eases her constant sense of control." [...] Cummings from PopMatters gave the album seven stars out of ten, claiming it to be Carey's redemption from the manacles of her previous two releases. He praised the album's singles, but called some of its music [...] "corny" [...] and [...] "unnecessarily overproduced". Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine gave the album a B−, admiring its assortment of beats and tempos. Burns, however, called some of The Neptunes and Dupri's production [...] "ill-advised". He called some of Carey's vocals [...] "strained, thin and airy". While considering it as an improvement over her previous releases of the decade, he concluded that it [...] "suffers from the fact that her vocals have deteriorated – a simple fact of the ravages that her voice has undergone in the <b>past</b> <b>fifteen</b> years." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave The Emancipation of Mimi three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "redemption". He complimented its array of beats and its production. Critic Andre Meyer of CBS News thought the material on the album was [...] "stronger" [...] than on Charmbracelet, and described it as a move in Carey's long-term plan for pop domination, while giving off the [...] "jittery R vibe that made Destiny's Child so potent."
