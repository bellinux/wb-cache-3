Assuming the frame size is small compared to the wavelength, the homogenization method of periodic discrete media coupled with normalization is used to identify the macroscopic behavior at the leading order. The method is applied on a frame material with the vertical elements stiffer than the horizontal elements. Such a material is highly anisotropic and presents a large contrast between the rigidities of the possible mechanisms. Thus the waves associated with different kinematics appear in different frequency ranges. Moreover, the stiffer elements can deform in bending at the macroscopic scale.

40|$|A serious {{fairness}} problem occurs whenever homogeneous, variable bit–rate, video traflic streams are multiplexed at {{a finite}} buffer statistical multiplexer. Namely, the cell loss ratio performance varies widely across individual traffic streams, The {{cause of the}} problem is the particular random relation of the <b>periodic</b> <b>frame</b> transmission epochs of the video sources that feed the multiplexer. In this paper a protocol is presented which controls the frame transmission epochs, in order to achieve fair distribution of losses among the admitted connections. The protocol operates with the participation of the sources by imposing an additional per-source delay on the traffic entering the network. These additional delays are calculated whenever a connection is accepted or terminated. The overall additional delay imposed by the protocol is guaranteed to be minimal through the use of an appropriate optimization algorithm. The performance of the proposed protocol, operating in conjunction with the optimization algorithm, is simulated and evaluated. A basic framework is given for its implementation on an Am network. Finally, the issues of bufTer overhead and the impact of the protocol on the delay experienced at the multiplexer are also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the primary}} purpose of the signal {{received}} by amobile handset or smartphone is to enable wireless communication, the information extracted can be reused to provide a number of additional services. Two such services discussed in this thesis are: mobile speed estimation and signal anomaly detection. The proposed algorithms exploit the propagation environment specific information that is already imprinted on the received signal and therefore do not incur any additional signalling overhead. Speed estimation is useful for providing navigation and location based services in areas where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) based devices are unusable while the proposed anomaly detection algorithms can be used to locate signal faults and aid spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems. The speed estimation algorithms described within this thesis require a receiver with at least two antenna elements and a wideband radio frequency (RF) signal source. The channel transfer function observed at the antenna elements are compared to yield an estimate of the device speed. The basic algorithm is a one-dimensional and unidirectional two-antenna solution. The speed of the mobile receiver is estimated from a knowledge of the fixed inter-antenna distance and the time it takes for the trailing antenna to sense similar channel conditions previously observed at the leading antenna. A by-product of the algorithm is an environment specific spatial correlation function which may be combined with theoretical models of spatial correlation to extend and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Results obtained via computer simulations are provided. The anomaly detection algorithms proposed in this thesis highlight unusual signal features while ignoring events that are nominal. When the test signal possesses a <b>periodic</b> <b>frame</b> structure, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) analysis is employed to statistically compare successive signal frames. A method of automatically extracting the required frame period information from the signal is also provided. When the signal under test lacks a <b>periodic</b> <b>frame</b> structure, information content analysis of signal events can be used instead. Clean training data is required by this algorithm to initialise the reference event probabilities. In addition to the results obtained from extensive computer simulations, an architecture for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based hardware implementations of the KLD based algorithm is provided. Results showing the performance of the algorithms against real test signals captured over the air are also presented. Both sets of algorithms are simple, effective and have low computational complexity – implying that real-time implementations on platforms with limited processing power and energy are feasible. This is an important quality since location based services are expected to be an integral part of next generation cognitive radio handsets.

40|$|In this paper, a wavelet-based {{method is}} {{developed}} for wave-propagation {{analysis of a}} generic multi-coupled one-dimensional periodic structure (PS). The formulation {{is based on the}} periodicity condition and uses the dynamic stiffness matrix of the periodic cell obtained from finite-element (FE) or other numerical methods. Here, unlike its conventional definition, the dynamic stiffness matrix is obtained in the wavelet domain through a Daubechies wavelet transform. The proposed numerical scheme enables both time-and frequency-domain analysis of PSs under arbitrary loading conditions. This is in contrast to the existing Fourier-transform-based analysis that is restricted to frequency-domain study. Here, the dispersion characteristics of PSs, especially the band-gap features, are studied. In addition, the method is implemented to simulate time-domain wave response under impulse loading conditions. The two examples considered are periodically simply supported beam and <b>periodic</b> <b>frame</b> structures. In all cases, the responses obtained using the present periodic formulation are compared with the response simulated using the FE model without the periodicity assumption, and they show an exact match.

Subjects adjusted a small luminous test line parallel to the perceived direction of gravity, {{in the presence of}} a large peripheral visual frame line. These settings, referred to as the frame SVV, were compared with the SVV in complete darkness (dark SVV). The frame SVV was virtually identical to the dark SVV for frame lines parallel or orthogonal to the dark SVV. Away from these neutral positions, the frame induced a periodic SVV modulation, which was small in upright observers, but became quite pronounced when subjects were tilted. For upright, where the dark SVV was very accurate, the frame SVV showed errors in both directions, following a roughly symmetrical pattern. At 120 degrees tilt, where the dark SVV invariably showed tilt undercompensation (A-effect), the frame effect became asymmetrical, with a stronger tendency to improve than to worsen accuracy. We tested whether our findings could be explained by two spatial orientation models: Mittelstaedt's idiotropic model and a Bayesian scheme with a stage for the processing of visual cues. Both models show a <b>periodic</b> <b>frame</b> effect that becomes stronger with increasing body tilt and can explain why frame lines parallel or perpendicular to the dark SVV are ineffective.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{existence of}} global solutions to equations for three-dimensional rotating fluids in a <b>periodic</b> <b>frame</b> {{provided by a}} sufficiently large Coriolis force. The Coriolis force appears in {{almost all of the}} models of meteorology and geophysics dealing with large-scale phenomena. In the spatially decaying case, Koh, Lee and Takada (2014) showed existence for the large times of solutions of the rotating Euler equations provided by the large Coriolis force. In this case the resonant equation does not appear anymore. In the periodic case, however, the resonant equation appears, and thus the main subject in this case is to show existence of global solutions to the resonant equation. Research in this direction was initiated by Babin, Mahalov and Nicolaenko (1999) who treated the rotating Navier-Stokes equations on general periodic domains. On the other hand, Golse, Mahalov and Nicolaenko (2008) considered bursting dynamics of the resonant equation {{in the case of a}} cylinder with no viscosity. Thus we may not expect to show global existence of solutions to the resonant equation without viscosity in the periodic case. In this paper we show existence of global solutions for fractional Laplacian case (with its power strictly less than the usual Laplacian) in the periodic domain with the same period in each direction. The main ingredient is an improved estimate on resonant three-wave interactions, which is based on a combinatorial argument.

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{scheduling}} transmission in single hop and multi-hop wireless networks with arbitrary topology and physical interference {{model has been}} widely studied. However, the focus has been mainly on optimizing the efficiency in transmission parallelization through a minimum frame-length scheduling that, for a given set of traffic demands, provides the smallest number of time-slots for performing different sets of simultaneous and compatible (according to the interference model) transmissions. Unfortunately, this optimal resource reuse efficiency does not in general correspond to the best performance in terms of end-to- end packet delivery delay since multiple frames {{may be required to}} complete transfer from source to destination. In this paper we study the problem of minimizing the end-to-end delay in wireless network under Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints, and propose two schemes. The first scheme extends the minimum frame-length approach and minimizes delay over multiple frames. The second scheme directly optimizes delay without the constraint of <b>periodic</b> <b>framing.</b> We propose novel mixed integer programming models for the two schemes and study their properties and complexity.

40|$|International audienceThe {{non-reactive}} {{interactions of}} molecules with a metallic or ionic surface are subjects of numerous studies particularly for their importance in capture and release of molecules processes, in polarization of surfaces {{and also in}} energy transfers. In such studies one has specifically to deal with long range interactions. With the usual periodic codes (VASP or Crystal), the surface is described by a periodic 2 D-representation, namely a slab representation and the calculations are performed using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In the physisorption domain, the weak interaction is governed by van der Waals (vdW) forces and {{it is well known}} that so far standard exchange-correlation functionals provide a poor description of such dispersion interactions [1] even though recent studies have shown that sophisticated DFT approaches can give promising outcomes for such difficult cases. Alternative studies have been performed, modeling the metallic surface by a cluster as in recent theoretical calculations on the H 2 /Cu or H 2 /Ag systems using a cluster model consisting of 22 Cu or Ag atoms [Fig. 1]. It has been shown that the chemisorption and physisorption of H 2 layers can be satisfactorily reproduced by highly correlated electronic wavefunctions (MRCI or CCSD(T) methods using MOLPRO[2]). Such pure ab initio methods are very efficient, they can provide reliable local properties (as for example rotational spectroscopy of the physisorbed molecule[3]) but they are missing delocalization effects, they are expensive and cannot be used for large systems. In order to compensate the deficiencies of both, cluster and periodic approaches, the 22 atoms cluster has been included in a <b>periodic</b> <b>frame,</b> using the embedded method.

Such structures can represent an idealization of numerous reticulated systems, for example the microstructure of foams, plants, bones, the sandwich panels, stiffened plates and truss beams used in aerospace and marine structures, buildings. As beams are much stiffer in tension-compression than in bending, the propagation of compressional waves with wavelengths {{much greater than the}} cell size and the bending modes of the elements can occur in the same frequency range. Thus frame structures can behave as metamaterials and exhibit unusual dynamic properties. Since the condition of scale separation is respected for the compressional waves, the homogenization method of periodic discrete media is used to rigorously derive the macroscopic behaviour at the leading order. The main advantages of the method are the analytical formulation and the possibility to study the behaviour of the elements at the local scale. This provides a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the dynamics of the material. In the presence of the local resonance, the form of the equations is unchanged but some macroscopic parameters depend on the frequency. In particular, this applies to the mass leading to a generalization of the Newtonian mechanics. As a result, the longitudinal modes of <b>periodic</b> <b>frame</b> beams and the transfer function have unusual properties. The same macroscopic modal shape is associated with several resonant frequencies (but the deformation of the elements at the local scale is different). These atypical behaviours are first established theoretically and then, they are confirmed by numerical simulations...|$|E
