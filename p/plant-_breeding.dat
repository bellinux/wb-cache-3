40|$|Crop {{improvement}} {{has been}} one of the strong, continuous programs in the Mekong Delta for major crops, especially rice. However, most breeding programs have been set and designed by breeders, neglecting the role of users: farmers and farming communities. Farmers have been the passive users, receiving finished breeding lines varieties for their production. The dissemination process of â€œtechnology transfer" has been very slow and costly for both breeders and farmers. The use of participatory approaches in crop improvement have ensured the involvement of farmers in the whole process or, at least, in the evaluation process. This has resulted in better understanding and acceptability of new crop varieties generated through the breeding program. Can Tho University, as the leading research institution for adapting participatory approaches to rice improvement, started on-farm breeding programs as early as 1975, after the war, by sending out their staff and students to work closely with farmers on crop-improvement programs. In 1994, with the inception of the Community-Based Biodiversity Development and Conservation (CBDC) project, participatory <b>plant-</b> <b>breeding</b> (PPB) and participatory varietal-selection (PVS) approaches were introduced as methods to develop and identify crop varieties specific lo niche environments and farmers' preferences. These participatory approaches are also being used in one of the study sites, Tra Cu, of the global in situ Conservation project implemented in Vietnam in collaboration with Ihe international Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI). The result has been very positive, with many promising crop varieties selected from these programs and used in larger-scale production. Farmers have been successful in segregating material selection and many farmers have become well known through these activities. Participatory approaches are very important for crop improvement at the community level in Vietnam. PPB and PVS approaches are the key tool for crop improvement. Successful results from farmer selections have strongly proven that these approaches are right. This experience has been very useful for national crop-improvement programs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{advocacy}} for effective participatory crop improvement and {{plant genetic resource}} enhancement. First, the need for advocacy is highlighted; second, cases on the community-managed process of managing plant genetic resources is discussed. Advocacy is public action directed towards wider social change. It is about changing the policies, practices, attitudes, positions or programs of governing institutions within {{the public and private}} sectors that have a negative impact in the age of globalization, multinational transnational corporations (MNCs TINCs) increasingly influence policies, but these organizations are not bound by rights-related laws and regulations. The trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPs) agreement under the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a major threat to crop and variety development and genetic resource enhancement. Advancements in genetic engineering promoted by profit-oriented MNCs INCs is gradually taking over the classical research-and-development process. If we are concerned about participatory crop improvement, we have to pinpoint the issue now. We need to enforce favorable policies and effective implementation for the conservation of our genetic resources and participatory development of crops and varieties. Therefore, to have influence al the policy level, we have to develop links between operational work and advocacy. In this context, advocacy can support communities demanding their rights in germplasm conservations. It is about having an input when government is formulating relevant policies, considering the voice of the powerless in developing <b>plant-</b> <b>breeding</b> program or plans, and bringing about the realization of favorable promises or policies for the benefit of fanners. The case studies show that farmers have selected and maintained their rice crops for generations with their own experience. The role of women farmers vital to the process of seed selection, preservation, and maintenance. However, the cases indicate that men are still ignoring the role of women in the plant-breeding process. We argue that farmers are the owners of genetic resources, and they should have right to select, develop, conserve, and multiply them as they wish. Therefore, advocacy should be one of the major activities of all development organizations if they are to have any spillover effect for challenging sustained inequality and injustice lo farmers...|$|E
