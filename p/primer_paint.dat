25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to bare metal. The wing was then sprayed with two coats of <b>primer</b> <b>paint</b> and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E

50|$|Chromium(III) {{compounds}} and chromium metal {{are not considered}} a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been known {{since at least the}} late 19th century. In 1890, Newman described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Chromate-induced dermatitis was reported in aircraft workers during World War II. In 1963, an outbreak of dermatitis, ranging from erythema to exudative eczema, occurred amongst 60 automobile factory workers in England. The workers had been wet-sanding chromate-based <b>primer</b> <b>paint</b> that had been applied to car bodies. In Australia, chromium was released from the Newcastle Orica explosives plant on August 8, 2011. Up to 20 workers at the plant were exposed as were 70 nearby homes in Stockton.

40|$|The Boeing Company (Boeing) {{contracted}} with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to develop criteria {{for evaluating the}} efficacy of its parts cleaning processes. In particular, LLNL and Boeing are attempting to identify levels of contamination that lead to parts failures. Sufficient contamination to cause impairment of anodizing, alodining, painting, or welding operations is considered a �part failure. � In the �Phase 0 � {{part of the project}} that was recently completed, preliminary analyses of aluminum substrates were performed as a first step in determining suitable cleanliness criteria for actual Boeing parts made from this material. A wide spread of contamination levels was specified for the Phase 0 test coupons, in the hopes of finding a range in which an appropriate cleanliness specification might lie. It was planned that, {{based on the results of}} the Phase 0 testing, further more detailed analyses (�Phase 1 testing�) would be performed in order to more accurately identify the most appropriate criteria. For the Phase 0 testing, Boeing supplied LLNL with 3 � x 6 � and 3 � x 10 � aluminum test panels which LLNL contaminated with measured amounts of typical hydrocarbon substances encountered in Boeing� s fabrication operations. The panels were then subjected by Boeing to normal cleaning procedures, after which they went through one of the following sets of operations: l anodizing and <b>primer</b> <b>painting.</b> alodining (chromating) and <b>primer</b> <b>painting</b> l welding The coatings or welds were then examined by both Boeing and LLNL to determine whether any of the operations were impaired, and whether there was a correlation between contamination level and damage to the parts.

5000|$|Hands-on {{work began}} on the {{sculpture}} in February 2001. After documenting the statue’s initial condition, the paint was stripped away {{using a combination of}} pressure washers, propane torching, and solvent application. Once the brass surface had been cleaned, Wharton assessed the various stress cracks and gouges in the metal and determined that the damage was all relatively old, probably dating back to the shipwreck and its recovery from the sea. (Ref: Wharton 148-152.) In addition, much of the bronze disease once visible {{on the surface of the}} sculpture had been blasted away during the paint stripping process. After it was determined that the statue was in stable condition, any holes or gaps in the metal were filled in using a pH-neutral epoxy putty, and the brass surface was misted with a benzoltriazole solution in order to prevent future corrosion. To repaint the sculpture, Wharton selected a hearty paint system that could withstand the harsh Hawaiian sun and rain, which consisted of an automotive epoxy primer (See <b>primer</b> (<b>paint)),</b> a polyurethane paint, and a polyurethane clear top coat. Special care was taken to choose the proper colors for Kamehameha’s skin tone and red and yellow feathered garments. [...] Once the treatment was complete, Wharton helped train a group of local volunteers to carry out annual maintenance on the sculpture, and to watch for and record any condition changes or damage.|$|E

Other sampling of the pulverized dust by United States Geological Survey and RJ Lee did not report any evidence of thermite or explosives. It has been theorized the [...] "thermite material" [...] found was <b>primer</b> <b>paint.</b> Dave Thomas of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, noting that the residue in question was claimed to be thermotic because of its iron oxide and aluminum composition, pointed out that these substances are found in many items common to the towers. Thomas said that in order to cut through a vertical steel beam, special high-temperature containment must be added to prevent the molten iron from dropping down, and that the thermite reaction is too slow for it to be practically used in building demolition. Thomas pointed out that when Jesse Ventura hired New Mexico Tech to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam, the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam, even though it was in a horizontal, and therefore optimal position.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} solventborne paint systems applied on carbon steel and hot-dip galvanized steel {{in a wide range}} of atmospheric exposures. The study has involved paint systems exposure for 3. 5 years in eight natural atmospheres.

The paint systems included several alkyds formulated with a variety of pigments (anticorrosive and barrier), epoxies, chlorinated rubber, and zinc-rich (ethyl silicate and epoxy). It has been concluded that in rural and urban atmospheres alkyd systems afford equivalent anticorrosive protection of steel to the epoxy/polyurethane system. The toxic red lead pigment may be replaced in long linseed-oil alkyd <b>primer</b> <b>paints</b> by non-toxic pigments, such as a mixture of micaceous iron oxides (MIO) and black iron oxides or zinc phosphate, without affecting the anticorrosive properties of the paint system.
