40|$|Abstract <b>Parasiticides</b> {{are used}} in the {{treatment}} of livestock animals. Following use, they may be excreted to the environment where they can impact non-target organisms. European regulations require an environmental risk assessment (ERA) for <b>parasiticides</b> before they are authorised for use, and guidance exists on how risks should be assessed. The methods employed are simple and conservative so it would be beneficial if approaches could be developed that more accurately assess the risks. The aim of this study was therefore to develop, through a combination of field and modelling investigations, an improved understanding of those factors and processes determining the risks of <b>parasiticides</b> in the pasture environment. The study focused on the avermectin compound, ivermectin (IVM). Following administration to cattle, IVM was found in manure at levels up to 1. 3 mg/kg (dry weight); this is an order of magnitude greater than the No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) for IVM to dung flies. Once released into the field, residues persisted in dung. Small amounts of IVM were transported into soil, probably {{as a result of the}} activity of soil and dung fauna. Mesocosm studies showed that in surface waters IVM will rapidly dissipate from the water column through photodegradation and partitioning to the sediment. In sediment, the IVM is highly persistent. Matrix population modelling was used to extrapolate the results of excretion, persistence and ecotoxicity data to the wider environment. The modelling predicted only a small impact of IVM on the abundance of a fast-breeding fly, a finding supported by the results of published monitoring studies. The study has demonstrated that population modelling approaches provide a valuable tool for use in ERAs for <b>parasiticides.</b> The study has also highlighted a number of areas, including a rigorous consideration of analytical method performance that should be considered when assessing the fate and effects of <b>parasiticides</b> in the environment. ...|$|R

Such exploration has established that, in addition to the <b>parasiticide</b> effect, an immunomodulatory action could significantly contribute in therapeutics against leishmaniasis. The crucial observation through findings on immunomodulatory compounds is the non-activity against promastigotes but selective <b>parasiticide</b> effect against macrophage-internalized amastigotes.

40|$|Control of sea lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, on farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, {{relies heavily}} on chemotherapeutants. However, reduced {{efficacy}} of many treatments and need for integrated sea lice management plans require innovative strategies. Resistance to emamectin benzoate (EMB), a major sea lice <b>parasiticide,</b> has been linked with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. We hypothesized that host immunostimulation would complement EMB treatment outcome. Lepeophtheirus salmonis-infected Atlantic salmon were fed immunostimulatory or control feeds. Sea lice were collected for 24 -h EMB bioassays 1 and 2 weeks prior to commencement of EMB treatment of the fish. Two weeks after cessation of immunostimulant-treated feed, EMB was administered at 150 μg kg(- 1) fish biomass for 7 days. The bioassay revealed stage, gender and immunostimulant-related differences in EMB EC(50). Sea lice attached to salmon {{with a history of}} immunostimulation exhibited significantly greater survival than those on control feeds, despite similar levels of EMB in host tissues. Lepeophtheirus salmonis from salmon with a history of immunostimulation also exhibited higher P-gp mRNA expression as well as greater survivability compared to controls.

40|$|Conservation {{management}} of wild fish may include fish health management in sympatric populations of domesticated fish in aquaculture. We developed {{a mathematical model}} for the population dynamics of parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on domesticated populations of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Broughton Archipelago region of British Columbia. The model was fit to a seven-year dataset of monthly sea louse counts on farms {{in the area to}} estimate population growth rates in relation to abiotic factors (temperature and salinity), local host density (measured as cohort surface area), and the use of a <b>parasiticide,</b> emamectin benzoate, on farms.

40|$|Caligid {{sea lice}} are ectoparasites causing major disease {{problems}} in industrial salmon farming.

Four compounds, including two organophosphates and two pyrethroids, were tested individually and in all pair-wise combinations at one fixed concentration ratio.

40|$|A {{standardized}} bioassay {{using the}} face fly, Musca autumnalis L (Diptera: Muscidae), {{was developed to}} test the lethal and sublethal toxicity of <b>parasiticide</b> residues in livestock dung. The repeatability of this test was assessed for the <b>parasiticide</b> ivermectin in seven tests performed in four laboratories in Germany and France. Additional results of limit tests were provided by two laboratories from the UK. Test results had an acceptable range of heterogeneity. The calculated effect concentration at which 50 % emergence was observed (EC 50) averaged 4. 65 +/- 2. 17 (Standard Deviation (SD) mu g ivermectin/kg fresh dung (range: 1. 20 - 7. 7)). Effects on emergence were, with one exception, not observed below the No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) ranging between 1. 11 and 3. 33 mu g ivermectin/kg.

40|$|The risk {{of salmon}} lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) {{transmission}} to wild juvenile Pacific salmon has spurred management change to reduce lice on salmon farms. We studied {{the abundance of}} planktonic lice preceding the juvenile salmon outmigration {{as well as the}} abundance of lice on juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon in two distinct migration routes, one contain-ing only fallow farms and the other active farms that applied a <b>parasiticide.</b> Results indicate that fallowing reduces the abundance and flattens the spatial distribution of lice relative to that expected in areas without farms. Active farms remained the primary source of lice, but transmission was reduced 100 -fold relative to previous epizootics in the study area. On the migration route containing active farms, 50 % of the juvenile salmon showed evidence of louse damage to surface tissues and the estimated direct louse-induced mortality was, 10 %, not including indirect effects of infection on predation risk or competition. The survival of the pink salmon cohort was not stat-istically different from a reference region without salmon farms.

Test results had an acceptable range of heterogeneity. The calculated concentration at which 50 % egg-adult mortality was observed (Effect Concentration (EC 50) averaged 20. 8 +/- 19. 1 (Standard Deviation (SD)) microg ivermectin / kg fresh dung (range: 6. 33 - 67. 5).

However, prolonged developmental time, and in a subset of tests reduced body size, was observed above an average calculated NOEC of 0. 8 +/- 0. 8 microg / kg.
