This can leave farmers entering the industry with a heavy debt burden, or effectively exclude them from ever starting.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{implications}} of individual trans-ferable <b>quotas</b> (ITQs) <b>for</b> reducing harbor por-poise bycatch in a multi-species fishery are investigated. Our intra-year bioeconomic model incorporates {{spatial and temporal}} patterns of abundance and harvest rates of commercial fish species and porpoise. Results indicate that por-poise ITQs, when compared to closures, are more profitable than closures, and distribute effort and profit reductions more evenly across seasons and areas. Price estimates for a unit of porpoise quota ranges from $ 1, 395 to $ 5, 782, for total allowable catches ranging from 951 to 209 porpoise, respec-tively. Total annual willingness to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> porpoise <b>quota</b> is approximately $ 1. 25 million. (JEL Q 22) I...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a concern}} in many {{countries}} that a domestic tradable <b>quota</b> system <b>for</b> greenhouse gases, where all emitters must <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> their <b>quotas,</b> may lead to closures of emissions-intensive industrial companies. Allocating quotas free of charge to companies operating in competitive markets has been suggested {{as a means to}} reduce the likelihood of closures. Two different designs of quota systems are studied within a two-period model: one where the quotas given free of charge are tradable, and one where the quotas are non-tradable. The two quota systems are compared with respect to their ability both to induce the firms to implement investment in abatement technology and to prevent or postpone closures...|$|R

40|$|This article {{utilizes}} {{a census}} of vessels {{before and after}} implementation of catch shares in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island (BSAI) crab fisheries to examine the short-run effects of catch shares on employment and remuneration of crew. The number of individuals employed declined proportionately to the exit of vessels following implementation. Total crew hours dedicated to fishing activities remained roughly constant, while employment in redundant pre- and post-season activities declined due to the consolidation of quota on fewer vessels. We find little evidence of substantial changes in the share contracts used to compensate fishermen. Finally, we explore {{a wide array of}} remuneration measures for crew and conclude that both seasonal and daily employment remuneration increased substantially for many crew in the post-rationalization fishery, while remuneration per unit of landings declined {{as a result of a}} combination of increased crew productivity and the necessity of <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> fishing <b>quota</b> in the new system.
