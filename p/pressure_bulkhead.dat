5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture of the <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead</b> in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair {{to the rear}} bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October 1971, British European Airways Flight 706 {{operated}} by Vickers Vanguard G-APEC crashed near Aarsele in Belgium. The cause was {{the failure of}} the rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and subsequent destruction of the tailplane. All eight crew and 55 passengers died.|$|E
25|$|Despite having tailstrike {{protection}} {{built into}} the A340-500, the rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and the underlying structure were severely damaged during the take-off roll when the tail struck the runway with considerable force. The aircraft also suffered extensive damage to the hull as it scraped along the runway, a large surface having been completely stripped of its external sheet. During the investigation, {{it was discovered that}} the jet had experienced at least one but possibly three or more tail strikes during previous take-off rolls.|$|E

40|$|The {{supporting}} {{pressure is}} achieved through {{control of the}} incoming and outgoing materials in the head chamber in shield tunneling, i. e., through regulation of the screw conveyor rotation, thrust force of jacks and the excavation advance rate. The discrete state equation of controlling system is derived based on mechanical equilibrium principle. The objective function of model reference control for <b>bulkhead</b> <b>pressure</b> is proposed. Optimal controlled variables are determined by using weighted least square method. The numerical simulation results show that <b>bulkhead</b> <b>pressure</b> of shield machine can be controlled by individually adjusting speed of screw conveyor in most cases, and the regulation of thrust force of jacks plays a secondary role for controlling <b>bulkhead</b> <b>pressure.</b> Keywords model reference control, weighted least square method, regulation of the screw conveyor rotation, <b>bulkhead</b> <b>pressure,</b> shield machine. 1...|$|R
25|$|Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747, on 12 August 1985. A faulty repair {{years earlier}} had {{weakened}} the aircraft's rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> which failed in flight. The vertical stabilizer {{and much of}} the aircraft's empennage was blown off during the decompression. The decompression also ruptured all four hydraulic lines which controlled the aircraft's mechanical flight controls. The pilots were able to continue flying the aircraft with very limited control, but after 32 minutes the aircraft crashed into a mountain, killing 520 of the 524 people aboard in the deadliest single aircraft disaster in history.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} hit {{the water}} with the tail first. The impact caused the fuselage to break into three main parts. The largest was the 26-meter (85ft) forward section of the aircraft, from the nose to {{the trailing edge of}} the wings. It remained afloat after the accident for about twenty hours. The midsection was 13meters (42ft) long, from the trailing edge of the wing to the rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> The aft section consisted of the tail cone, including all of the horizontal stabilizers and the vertical stabilizers. The engines and landing gear separated from the aircraft at the time of impact.|$|E
25|$|Early on, the TBM 700 was {{available}} in several different configurations and models. The introduction of the TBM 700C2, which increased the maximum takeoff weight from 6,578lb to 7,394lb, enabled operators to fly with both fully laden fuel tanks and maximum cabin occupancy instead of comprising between the two due to weight restrictions. The modifications made upon this model included {{the addition of a}} baggage compartment aft of the rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> the strengthening of the wing and landing gear, and seat crashworthiness certification for up to 20 G to accommodate for an elevated stall speed at higher weights. Around the same time, SOCATA decided to re-design the interior of the aircraft, both in terms of the fittings and finish, along with the adoption of a new integrated environmental control system, to improve passenger comfort levels.|$|E

25|$|The crew {{wait out}} the storm so they can restore {{communications}} and be rescued. As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed an animated column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead</b> on it, causing it to retreat. The crew soon realize that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts {{over the edge of}} the trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and is taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{version was}} the type 800. The 800s were shorter ranged, higher {{passenger}} capacity aircraft than the 700s. The fuselage was lengthened 3' 10" [...] and the rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead</b> was moved aft 5' 5", allowing more passengers to be carried. The 800s (excepting the 806s) were powered by the Dart 510.|$|E
5000|$|The maximum {{fuel load}} for peace-time {{cruising}} was 5866 t but, in wartime, this figure {{was reduced to}} 4700 t to maximize the underwater protection system's effectiveness, since filling the liquid loading compartments to the brim created additional <b>pressure</b> on <b>bulkheads</b> instead of absorbing the pressure of explosion.

50|$|The maximum {{fuel load}} for peacetime {{cruising}} was 4,500 to 5,000 tons, but in wartime, this figure {{was reduced to}} 3,700 tons to maximise {{the effectiveness of the}} underwater protection system, as filling the liquid-loading compartments to the brim creates additional <b>pressure</b> on <b>bulkheads,</b> instead of absorbing the pressure of an explosion. The radius of the class was 7,850 nmi at 15 knots, 6,300 nmi at 20 knots, and 2,450 nmi at 28.5 knots.|$|R
40|$|A {{composite}} is {{a structural}} material {{that consists of}} two or more constituents that are combined at a macroscopic level and are not soluble in each other. One constituent is called the reinforcing phase and the one in which it is embedded is called the matrix.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{summarizes}} {{the main features}} of the CPACS fuselage structure description. Design/methodology/approach – The CPACS fuselage structure description includes the definition of arbitrary sheets and structural profiles which can be combined {{with a variety of}} material definitions to so-called structural elements. Besides the definition of these structural elements, the definitions of structural members, such as stringers, frames, floor structures and <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkheads</b> as well as the definitions of the complex load introduction regions that transfer loads from the wings and the empennage into the fuselage shell are introduced. Finally, exemplary models generated with different mesh generation tools developed at DLR Institute of Structures and Design are presented. These models are suitable for subsequent static or dynamic structural analyses. Findings – The CPACS fuselage structure description is suitable for defining standard fuselage configurations including complex load introduction regions suitable for different types of structural analysis. Practical implications – The work shows exemplary fuselage models generated from the introduced CPACS fuselage description suitable for subsequent static and dynamic structural analyses. As the CPACS standard is available for download the described definitions may be used by universities, research organizations or industry. Originality/value – The work presents the definitions of the fuselage structure within the CPACS schema that were mainly developed by the authors employed at the DLR Institute of Structures and Design.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{focus of}} this project was to assist the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program in developing a spin forming fabrication process for manufacture of the Orion crew module (CM) aft <b>pressure</b> vessel <b>bulkhead.</b> The spin forming process will enable a single piece aluminum (Al) alloy 2219 aft bulkhead resulting in {{the elimination of the}} current multiple piece welded construction, simplify CM fabrication, and lead to an enhanced design. Phase I (NASA TM- 2014 - 218163 (1)) of this assessment explored spin forming the single-piece CM forward <b>pressure</b> vessel <b>bulkhead.</b> The Orion MPCV Program and Lockheed Martin (LM) recently made two critical decisions relative to the NESC Phase I work scope: (1) LM selected the spin forming process to manufacture a single-piece aft bulkhead for the Orion CM, and (2) the aft bulkhead will be manufactured from Al 2219. Based on the Program's new emphasis related to the spin forming process, the NESC was asked to conduct a Phase II assessment to assist in the LM manufacture of the aft bulkhead and to conduct a feasibility study into spin forming the Orion CM cone. This activity was approved on June 19, 2013. Dr. Robert Piascik, NASA Technical Fellow for Materials at the Langley Research Center (LaRC), was selected to lead this assessment. The project plan was approved by the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) Review Board (NRB) on July 18, 2013. The primary stakeholders for this assessment were the NASA and LM MPCV Program offices. Additional benefactors are commercial launch providers developing CM concepts...|$|R
40|$|Large open stopes mined by {{vertical}} crater retreat or sublevel s {{are sometimes}} backfilled with uncemented sand {{to support the}} stope walls and alleviate rock bursts. The failure of bulkheads in two different mines prompted a research project at the Bureau of Mines to prevent a recurrence of these failures. A series of laboratory tests with drains and sand filters was conducted to measure the bulk-head pressures when adequate drainage was maintained. Results showed that <b>bulkhead</b> <b>pressure</b> was reduced to near zero while drains were in operation, as compared to full hydrostatic pressure when drains were blocked or drainage was restricted.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was involved in}} a tailstrike incident at Osaka International Airport seven years earlier as JAL Flight 115, which damaged the aircraft's rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examination {{from the}} aircraft's {{maintenance}} record showed that maintenance crew had conducted a radiographic {{examination of the}} rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead</b> of the aircraft prior to the accident. However, investigator questioned {{the effectiveness of the}} technique. The technique used to examine this particular area (the rear <b>pressure</b> <b>bulkhead)</b> of the Vanguard has been demonstrated to be ineffective as a sure means of detecting corrosion. This is because of the difficulty of interpreting the photographic plate details resulting from the complex structure. With the inspection technique then in use, investigators concluded that the corrosion on the aircraft was not detectable.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} {{residual}} strength pressure tests and nonlinear analyses of stringer- and frame-stiffened aluminum fuselage panels with longitudinal cracks are presented. Two types of damage are considered: a longitudinal crack located midway between stringers, and a longitudinal crack {{adjacent to a}} stringer and along a row of fasteners in a lap joint that has multiple-site damage (MSD). In both cases, the longitudinal crack is centered on a severed frame. The panels are subjected to internal pressure plus axial tension loads. The axial tension loads are equivalent to a <b>bulkhead</b> <b>pressure</b> load. Nonlinear elastic-plastic residual strength analyses of the fuselage panels are conducted using a finite element program and the crack-tip-opening-angle (CTOA) fracture criterion. Predicted crack growth and residual strength results from nonlinear analyses of the stiffened fuselage panels are compared with experimental measurements and observations. Both the test and analysis results indicate that [...] ...|$|R
500|$|The impact {{punched a}} hole some [...] deep and [...] wide in Otranto, from below the {{waterline}} {{up to the}} boat deck. The hole was right at the bulkhead between the fore and aft stokeholds (boiler rooms) and both instantly flooded, killing most of the crewmen in those spaces. When the engine room flooded shortly afterwards, Otranto lost all electrical power and began to drift towards the cliffs of Islay. The water <b>pressure</b> caused other <b>bulkheads</b> to collapse, quickly flooding other spaces below the waterline and giving the ship a massive list to starboard. The impact also damaged many of the remaining lifeboats on that side. The crew attempted to use collision mats to cover {{the hole in the}} ship's side, but it proved to be too large. Kashmirs bow was crushed by the impact, although she was able to steam off when a wave forced the two ships apart soon after the collision.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{cause of}} bulk carrier loss is ingress of sea water owing to {{cracks in the}} side shell {{as a consequence of}} main frame deterioration and the subsequent failure of transverse bulkheads adjacent to the flooded hold. When the hold is flooded the stresses in the bulkhead are known to exceed yield and the bulkhead to have undergone slight distortion. The vertical bulkheads are corrugated and have upper support from cross deck strips. Typical initial damages are cracks in the joint between bulkhead corrugations and deck plating due partly to corrosion. These can lead to portions of the cross deck strip becoming detached from the <b>bulkhead.</b> <b>Pressure</b> on the ship sides can then cause the bulkhead and cross deck strip to buckle, with minor and local buckles on the bulkhead leading to shear buckling of the whole structure. The purpose of the Study Group will be an investigation of this cracking and buckling process...|$|R

50|$|The {{boats were}} powered by two MAN М6V49/48 {{four-stroke}} atmospheric reversive diesels (2000 hp each at 465 rev/min) that drove two fixed pitch propellers together with two Electrosila PG-72/35 electric motors (550 hp at 275 rev/min), connecting by BAMAG (Berlin-Anhaltische Maschinenbau AG) type friction clutches. Delivery {{of the engines}} for the third boat was constantly delayed and eventually it was equipped with domestically produced ones. For underwater propulsion energy was supplied by 124 APA 38-MAK-760 accumulators, equipped with K-5 hydrogen burners. The batteries lacked the traditional central walkway, instead using special service trolleys suspended from the deckhead. This design significantly decreased {{the height of the}} battery compartment, freeing space for the crew. The electrical system omitted the complicated layout common on earlier Soviet designs, and was simple and reliable. All connections were insulated and the bulkhead feedthroughs were designed to withstand the same <b>pressure</b> as the <b>bulkheads</b> themselves. It had better maneuverability than other smaller Soviet, German, British and Italian submarines (e.g. the British U-class submarines, the German Type VII submarines and the Italian Acciaio-class submarine).|$|R
40|$|This degree {{thesis is}} part of the studies on wind energy. The company that has {{proposed}} this work is the XEMC Darwind. Darwind’s operations have been fully integrated with those of XEMC WINDPOWER. XEMC Darwind is developing a unique, top-down bottom-up, 5 MW offshore, Direct Drive Permanent Magnet wind turbine generator with a diameter of 115 meters at 90 meters hub height. The XD 115 wind turbine is in fact heir to the Dutch wind energy and offshore tradition. XEMC Darwind believes that offshore locations require ad hoc sealed and robust technology, designed for low cost installation, logistics and low cost maintenance & service throughout the lifetime of the turbine. This degree thesis becomes part of this project in relation to the interaction between the flows of air between the inside and the outside of the LM 55. 4 P blade. The rotation in blade is too high, about 18 rpm. This is the difference between Darwind’s turbine and the others companies. This means that the blade is subject to high centrifugal force. For this force inside the blade builds up a pressure gradient from the bulkhead to the tip. Our studies investigate if this gradient is dangerous for the blade in term of static resistance of the bulkhead {{and if there is a}} leakage and where is that leakage. Because the position of leak is important for the pressure gradient. The work is developed in the follow point. • Preliminary studies of <b>bulkhead</b> <b>pressure</b> in different situation. • Studies of drain holes resistance • Studies of diffuser resistance • Experimental test in Hammelev, Denmark • Elaboration of experimental data and estimation of leakage • CFD simulation of blade in operative condition...|$|R
