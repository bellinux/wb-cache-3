50|$|Ella's protectiveness {{turns to}} savage jealousy, even as Allan is {{informed}} that his condition may be reversible. First, she kills Allan's former girlfriend Linda Aikman (Janine Turner), {{who is now}} in a relationship with his former doctor John Wiseman (Stanley Tucci), by setting their romantic hideaway on fire. Ella then kills Allan's jealous, overbearing mother Dorothy (Joyce Van Patten), by electrocuting her in the bathtub. Ella then kills Geoffrey by injecting him with the very syringe of sodium <b>pentobarbitone</b> he had intended to use on her, and disables Melanie, before trying to light her on fire. Allan, helpless and alone, is able to summon the strength to turn on the tape player with the romantic music, summoning Ella to cuddle close to him. When Ella cradles Allan's head, Allan, rightfully betraying Ella's trust, bites and thrashes his head back and forth in a violent manner, hitting Ella into the handles of his wheelchair before finally relinquishing his bite and throwing her toward the open deck of his tape machine, killing Ella.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pentobarbitone</b> sodium (Sodium 5 -ethyl- 5 [1 -methylbutyl]-pentobarbitone) is a short-acting {{barbiturate}} that {{is commonly used}} to euthanase animals. As part of our studies into the molecular genetics of copper toxicosis in Bedlington terrier dogs, reverse-transcription (RT) -PCR was noted to always fail on RNA samples collected from livers of dogs sacrificed by <b>pentobarbitone</b> injection. When samples were collected without <b>pentobarbitone,</b> however, RTPCR was always successful. We suspected the possible inhibition by <b>pentobarbitone</b> sodium of either reverse transcriptase or Taq polymerase. In vitro studies showed that <b>pentobarbitone</b> interference of PCR occurred at > 4 mug/mul. To identify if <b>pentobarbitone</b> produced competitive inhibition, each components (Taq polymerase, MgCl 2, dNTP, etc.) of the PCR was individually altered. However, inhibition still persisted, suggesting that multiple PCR components may be affected. Also it was shown that <b>pentobarbitone</b> interference was not dependent on the PCR product size. Simple dilution of <b>pentobarbitone</b> contaminated DNA solutions, {{and the addition of}} bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the PCR mix overcame <b>pentobarbitone</b> interference. In vivo, PCR by <b>pentobarbitone</b> was found to be compounded by high DNA concentration and <b>pentobarbitone</b> contamination. In addition, both high DNA concentration and <b>pentobarbitone</b> contamination could be overcome through dilution and the addition of BSA. Further work is required to quantify <b>pentobarbitone</b> concentration in the liver-extracted DNA and RNA samples before this inhibition effect on PCR can be fully elucidated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.

The increased <b>pentobarbitone</b> metabolism was inhibited by ethionine injected shortly before treatment. Using a liver slice preparation, increased <b>pentobarbitone</b> metabolism was also observed in vitro.

40|$|Neurons were {{obtained}} from the CA 1 region of the hippocampus of newborn rats and maintained in culture. Channels were activated by <b>pentobarbitone</b> in cell-attached, inside-out or outside-out patches, normally by applying <b>pentobarbitone</b> in flowing bath solution. Currents were outwardly rectifying and blocked by bicuculline, properties of GABAA channels in these cells. Maximum channel conductance increased as <b>pentobarbitone</b> concentration was increased to 500 microM but conductance then decreased as <b>pentobarbitone</b> concentration was raised further. The best fit of a Hill-type equation to the relationship between maximum channel conductance and <b>pentobarbitone</b> concentration (up to 500 microM) gave an EC 50 of 41 microM, a maximum conductance of 36 pS and a Hill coefficient of 1. 6. Bicuculline decreased the maximum conductance of the channels activated by <b>pentobarbitone,</b> with an IC 50 of 224 microM. Diazepam increased channel conductance, with a maximum effect being obtained with 1 microM diazepam. Diazepam (1 microM) decreased the EC 50 of the <b>pentobarbitone</b> effect on channel conductance from 41 microM to 7. 2 microM and increased maximum conductance to 72 pS. We conclude that GABAA channel conductance is related to the concentration of the allosteric agonist <b>pentobarbitone...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} <b>pentobarbitone</b> on stimulus-secretion {{coupling}} was studied in bovine isolated adrenal medullary cells. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> inhibited catecholamine release evoked by 500 microM carbachol with half maximal inhibition (IC 50) around 50 microM. It also inhibited catecholamine release induced by depolarization with 77 mM potassium (IC 50 100 microM). These effects of <b>pentobarbitone</b> were observed with concentrations that lie {{within the range}} encountered during general anaesthesia. Evoked secretion required the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium and was associated with an influx of Ca 2 + through voltage-sensitive channels. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> inhibited 45 Ca influx in response to both carbachol (IC 50 50 microM) and K+-depolarization (IC 50 150 microM). The action of <b>pentobarbitone</b> {{on the relationship between}} intracellular free Ca and exocytosis was examined using electropermeabilised cells which were suspended in solutions containing a range of concentrations of ionised calcium between 10 (- 8) and 10 (- 4) M. Catecholamine secretion was measured in the presence of 0, 50, 200 or 500 microM <b>pentobarbitone.</b> The anaesthetic had no effect on the activation of exocytosis by intracellular free calcium. When catecholamine secretion in response to potassium or carbachol was modulated by varying extracellular calcium or by adding <b>pentobarbitone</b> to the incubation medium, the amount of catecholamine secretion for a given Ca 2 + entry was the same. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> inhibited the secretion and 45 Ca uptake induced by carbachol in a non-competitive manner. The secretion evoked by nicotinic agonists was associated with an increase in 22 Na influx. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> inhibited this influx with an IC 50 of 100 microM. We concluded that: (a) <b>Pentobarbitone</b> inhibits the catecholamine secretion from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells induced by nicotinic agonists by non-competitive inhibition of the nicotinic receptor. (b) The decrease in Ca influx caused by <b>pentobarbitone</b> accounts fully for the decrease in secretion in response to depolarization with potassium...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>pentobarbitone</b> on Ca 2 + current (ICa), {{separated}} from other ionic currents was studied under voltage clamp using a suction pipette technique in Helix neurones. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> depressed the maximal peak amplitude (MPA) of ICa in a concentration-dependent manner without shifting the current-voltage (I-V) relationships along the voltage axis. Increases in external Ca 2 +-concentration [(Ca 2 +]o) overcame the inhibitory {{action of the}} agent on MPA. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> markedly accelerated the decay phase of ICa which took a distinctly different time course {{from that of the}} control. The accelerating action of the agent on the decay phase of ICa was not overcome by increases in [Ca 2 +]o. In the presence of internal EGTA (20 mM), <b>pentobarbitone</b> also accelerated the decay of ICa. Changes in pH of the external perfusing solution altered the potency of <b>pentobarbitone</b> in depressing MPA; in the presence of <b>pentobarbitone</b> (3 X 10 (- 4) M) at pH of 7. 0, 8. 0 and 9. 0, fractional inhibition was approx. 46 %, 21 % and 4 %, respectively. Internal application of <b>pentobarbitone</b> (10 (- 4) - 10 (- 3) M) inhibited MPA, but exerted no effect on the decay phase of ICa. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> (10 (- 4) M) markedly accelerated the decrease of MPA of ICa induced by repetitive stimuli applied at an interval of 150 ms, indicating a use-dependent depression of MPA.

40|$|Summary. Injection of an ovulation-blocking dose of <b>pentobarbitone</b> sodium {{given in}} the early {{afternoon}} of pro-oestrus in rats decreased follicular oestradiol production in vitro the next day (2 =. 2 =+-=. 1 ng/ 4 h/follicle in pro-oestrous rats, 0 =. 9 =+-=. 4 ng/ 4 h/ follicle in pentobarbitone-treated rats). <b>Pentobarbitone,</b> given 1 day earlier (at di-oestrus II), prevented the increase in oestradiol production that normally occurs between di-oestrus II and pro-oestrus. Injection of a subovulatory amount of hCG (0 =. i. u.) given after <b>pentobarbitone</b> injection inhibited the decrease in follicular oestradiol production induced by <b>pentobarbitone.</b> The pentobarbitone-induced decrease in oestradiol production was also prevented by bromocriptine (1 mg) given at di-oestrus II (15 : 00 h) and pro-oestrus (09 : 00 h). Bromocriptine is an effective inhibitor of prolactin secretion and this suggests therefore that the decrease in follicular oestradiol production after <b>pentobarbitone</b> is due to the preovulatory surge of prolactin. However, pretreatment with bromocriptine also inhi-bited the effect of <b>pentobarbitone</b> on oestradiol production when <b>pentobarbitone</b> was given at di-oestrus II. Moreover, when ergocornine (another inhibitor of prolactin secretion) was used instead of <b>pentobarbitone</b> to block ovulation, follicular oestradiol production was also decreased the next day. In contrast to bromocriptine, ergocornine was not able to prevent the pentobarbitone-induced decrease in follicular oestradiol production. These results indicate that the decrease in follicular oestradiol production after <b>pentobarbitone</b> injection is due to inhibition of the serum concentrations of LH rather than the preovulatory surge of prolactin. How bromocriptine (but not ergocornine) prevents the pentobarbitone-induced decrease in oestradiol production is not clear...|$|E

40|$|Although barbiturates, {{like other}} general anaesthetics, depress {{excitatory}} synaptic transmission {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS), the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unresolved. They may increase the likelihood that an action potential will fail to invade every branch of the axonal arbour, thereby decreasing the synaptic drive to the postsynaptic neurons. Alternatively, they may inhibit calcium entry into the presynaptic terminals, thus reducing transmitter release. To resolve these issues, we have used two-photon microscopy to monitor calcium transients evoked by action potentials in axons, axonal varicosities (synaptic boutons) and fine axon collaterals of hippocampal CA 1 neurons. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> (75 – 300 μM) did not block the invasion of the axonal arbour or the synaptic boutons, but it did reduce the amplitude of the calcium transients recorded from the axons in a concentration-dependent manner.

Results - In Group I no significant changes were observed in renal hemodynamic parameters and creatinine clearance. The extracellular volume expansion increased urinary volume and decreased urinary osmolarity as a consequence of sodium, potassium and free water clearance. The fractionary excretion of sodium was maintained. The plasmatic osmolarity increased. In Group 2, renal hemodynamic parameters and creatinine clearance were also maintained. There was an increase in renal sodium clearance, as detected by the increase in the fractionary excretion of sodium.

40|$|The {{technique}} produces good anaesthesia {{with low}} mortality, {{and may be}} used repeatedly. Until recent years, the most popular injectable anaesthetics for small laboratory animals have been the barbiturates with <b>pentobarbitone</b> being the most commonly employed. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> is, however, a long-acting drug which produces considerable res-piratory depression; it is thus difficult to accurately titrate depth and duration of anaesthesia (Taber & Irwin, 1969), and its use is associated with significant mortality (Green, 1975). During the last decade, various other techniques for use in small animals have been developed, using ketamine (Mulder, 1978; Connolly & Quimby, 1978), neuroleptanalgesic combinations such as fentanyl...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from neurones in slices of guinea-pig olfactory cortex maintained in vitro at 37 degrees C. The average membrane potential was 63 +/- 12 mV and the input resistance of these cells was 42 +/- 20 M omega (mean +/- s. d.). Stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract (l. o. t.) generated a transient depolarization in these cells which had the characteristics of an excitatory postsynaptic potential (e. p. s. p.). If the e. p. s. p. was of sufficient amplitude it culminated in an action potential. The e. p. s. p. was potentiated by repetitive stimulation at 10 - 50 Hz and showed post-tetanic potentiation after a prolonged period of high frequency stimulation (50 - 100 Hz for 30 - 60 s). <b>Pentobarbitone</b> (0. 1 - 0. 5 mM) depressed the e. p. s. p. reversibly but was without effect on the resting membrane potential, input resistance or time constant of the neurones. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> did not inhibit potentiation of the e. p. s. p. by a preceding conditioning shock. It is concluded that <b>pentobarbitone</b> {{does not affect the}} passive membrane properties of neurones in the olfactory cortex. The depressant action of <b>pentobarbitone</b> on synaptic transmission results from a decrease in the amount of transmitter released in response to a nerve impulse, or a decrease in the sensitivity of the postsynaptic membrane to the transmitter or a combination of both effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} halothane-induced sleeping time in the rat. 2 The sleeping time exhibited a diurnal variation which was due, at least in part, {{to a change in}} the sensitivity of the central nervous system (CNS) to the anaesthetic. 3 Tolerance to halothane did not develop in rats repeatedly exposed to the anaesthetic over a period of over 48 hours. 4 Repeated sleeping time determinations have been used to follow changes in the sensitivity of the CNS to the anaesthetic occurring with time. 5 A tolerance to halothane was induced by pretreatment of rats with doses of amylobarbitone, <b>pentobarbitone</b> or meprobamate sufficient to keep animals anaesthetized for approximately 12 hours. This tolerance was followed by a period of halothane-hypersensitivity. 6 Halothane-tolerant animals awakened with higher brain halothane concentrations and were also tolerant to intracerebroventricularly administered <b>pentobarbitone.</b> 7 Halothane-hypertensive rats awakened with lower brain halothane concentrations and were also hypersensitivity to intracerebroventricularly administered <b>pentobarbitone.</b> 8 The possibility that the induction of cross-tolerance to halothane may be indicative of a drug's potential to produce dependence is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} 3 muscle relaxants {{on the blood}} {{circulation}} were studied in <b>pentobarbitone</b> anaesthetized dogs. Tubocurarine steeply decreased aortic pressure and cardiac output. Pancuronium and succinylcholine had only minor effects upon the haemodynamics. As pancuronium has a longer duration of action it was considered more useful than succinylcholine in experimental work with dogs. KARDIOVASKULARE REAKTION AUF MUSKELENTSPANNUNG BEIM HUND Die Wirkung von 3 Muskelrelaxanten auf den Blutkreislauf wurde in mit <b>Pentobarbitone</b> anasthesierten Hunden studiert.

40|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the extent to which}} {{presynaptic}} noradrenergic mechanisms contribute to the anaesthetic-sparing effects of α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists in vivo microdialysis was used to investigate the combined effects of sodium <b>pentobarbitone</b> and imidazol(in) e α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists on extracellular levels of noradrenaline (NA) in the rat frontal cortex. Dialysate levels of NA were markedly reduced by the addition of TTX (2 [*]μM) or by the removal of calcium in the perfusate. These data imply that dialysate NA levels are ultimately dependent on exocytotic release mechanisms from afferent coeruleo-cortical neurones. Systemic administration of sodium <b>pentobarbitone</b> (85 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) induced general anaesthesia and reduced NA levels by 92 % after 30 [*]min. The restoration of basal levels 90 [*]min later was closely associated with a return of the corneal blink reflex. Basal NA levels in conscious animals were not affected by an intravenous infusion of equally radioactive solutions of either imidazoline (clonidine) or imidazole (mivazerol) α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists. The dose rate employed for each compound was 2 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]h− 1 over 2 [*]h. The co-administration of intravenous clonidine or mivazerol, each at 2 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]h− 1 for 2 [*]h, with sodium <b>pentobarbitone</b> (85 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.), produced a marked and prolonged reduction in NA efflux. After 2 [*]h, NA levels remained suppressed by 95 % (clonidine) and 80 % (mivazerol) and animals remained deeply anaesthetized. The accumulation of tritium in brain tissue was 42 – 73 % lower across all brain regions examined after [3 H]-mivazerol administration than after [3 H]-clonidine administration. Sodium <b>pentobarbitone</b> did not alter the accumulation of tritium in brain tissue after the administration of either α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist. These data demonstrate that α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists potentiate the inhibitory effects of sodium <b>pentobarbitone</b> on extracellular levels of NA in the frontal cortex. Further studies will be necessary to establish a causal role of noradrenergic mechanisms in the potentiation of anaesthesia by selective α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists...|$|E

40|$|Plasma {{levels of}} luteinizing hormone (LH) were {{measured}} by radio-immunoassay in serial samples obtained from unanaesthetized, unre-strained rats {{by means of}} intracardiac cannulae (i) {{in relation to the}} critical period of neural facilitation (CP) during the afternoon of pro-oestrus and(ii) before and after an injection of sodium <b>pentobarbitone</b> given at specific times in relation to the critical period. Samples were also obtained by car-diac puncture before and after hypophysectomy carried out at specific times in relation to the CP. The effect ofpentobarbitone or hypophysectomy on ovulation was also determined in the same animals. The CP as defined by <b>pentobarbitone</b> injection and hypophysectomy lasted from 15. 00 to 16. 00 h in the majority of rats. During this period the LH levels rose gradually above the basal value, and rose sharply thereafter to reach peak values at 17. 00 - 18. 00 h. <b>Pentobarbitone</b> given before the CP delayed the surge by 24 h, while its administration {{at the end of the}} CP caused an abrupt fall in plasma LH, indicating a reliance on the neurogenic stimulus both to initiate and to maintain the LH surge. LH levels reached immediately after <b>pentobarbitone</b> administration or hypophysectomy were correlated with the subsequent pattern of ovulation. Only a small increase in LH, amounting to about 14 % of the peak values attained during the afternoon of pro-oestrus, was required for ovulation per se. This amount is similar to the small rise in circulating LH observed during the CP. The bulk of LH secreted during the 'pre-ovulatory surge ' does not appear to be required for ovulation...|$|E

Each of the barbiturates significantly prolonged sleep and hastened its onset. They also reduced the patients' motility, recorded by an electronic apparatus attached to the bed. There was no clear difference between these barbiturates in onset and duration of action during the 8 hr of recording; some effect upon sleep or motility was present throughout this period.
