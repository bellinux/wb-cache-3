40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to demonstrate, through close reading of the first {{judgment}} containing a substantive reasoning on the Racial Equality Directive, that in several respects the ECJ in its <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> does not provide the national court with a useful answer, as it does not respond to particular questions and because of an unsound or at least confusing way of reasoning. In this respect, the substantive clarification of the RED is not optimal. At a more procedural level the argument is developed that the ECJ should adopt, especially in <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedures,</b> broad, more systematic and thus elaborate, rather than narrow, condensed <b>rulings.</b> differentiation; <b>preliminary</b> rulings; minorities; non-discrimination; European Court of Justice; European Court of Justice; law...|$|R
40|$|The European Union is {{a member}} of the {{international}} community and is a party to numerous international agreements. The status of these international agreements in the EU legal order however is not made expressly clear by the Treaties. The most pertinent question that arises is whether secondary EU law may be reviewed in the light of international agreements in annulment <b>procedures</b> or <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedures</b> before the Court of Justice of the EU. In its jurisprudence the Court of Justice has tied the possibility of review to the question of the direct effect of international treaties, but there are some issues of consistency in this regard. This problem is a part of the broader question of the relationship of international law and EU law, including the question whether this relationship is more akin to a monist or a dualist approach...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{attempts}} {{to give an}} overview on the cases relating to Hungary before European Court of Justice in the period between 2004 – 2007, which are classified into four categories. The {{first part of the}} article analyses eleven procedures concerning petitions for <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings,</b> illustrating the bearings of the cases and pointing out the importance as well as consequences {{from the point of view}} of the Hungarian legal order. The essay refers to the fact that activity of Hungarian courts to apply <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedures</b> is exceptionally high comparing with the other nine Member States acceded to EU in 2004 and in almost each cases concerned, the references were profoundly considered by the Hungarian court. The second category described in this paper includes cases, in which Hungarian individual persons participate as litigants (including the cases before Civil Service Tribunal). The experiences of these procedures on the basis of direct complaints indicate the conclusion that in several cases, the attorneys representing the plaintiff before ECJ involve not enough responsibilities to avoid bringing obviously inadmissible actions. In the third part of the paper the reader can get an insight into the cases in which the Republic of Hungary appears as litigant. Finally the fourth category embraces cases with indirect interest relating Hungary. These are referred but not deeply examined in the article...|$|R

50|$|AG Jacobs' Opinion {{said the}} court's {{existing}} case law was incompatible with effective judicial protection. Non-privileged applicants {{should be regarded}} as individually concerned when a measure was liable to have substantial adverse effects on his or her interests. He Argued the law should be liberalised because (1) the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> gave no right for individuals to make a reference, and therefore had no right of access to the CJ (2) only allowing standing when there is no national law way to trigger a preliminary ruling is not enough (3) there could be, as here, an absence of remedy as of right when national law fails to contain any (4) so the solution is to recognise standing where a measure has 'a substantial adverse effect on his interests' (5) objections to enlarge standing are flawed - there is nothing against it in the treaties (6) the settled case law is ripe for change, especially since member states have liberalised JR themselves.|$|E
40|$|Opinion 1 / 09 may be {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most conspicuous contributions the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has given to the constitutional building of the European Union (EU). For the first time in its case law, it has labelled national courts as the ‘guardians’ and ‘ordinary courts’ of the EU legal order, focusing particularly on their role of referring courts in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure.</b> Reiterating a monistic approach, national courts have been entrusted with judicial powers Member States cannot rule out. Even though the ECJ remains the ultimate umpire of the EU legality, the Opinion makes the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> an instrument of judicial protection of individual rights stemming from EU law...|$|E
40|$|In CILFIT (case 283 / 81), the European Court of Justice (ECJ) {{endorsed}} {{the use of}} the acte clair doctrine – the notion that national courts of “last resort” may decide to refrain from seeking a <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> under Article 234 (3) EC. The Court also stipulated a list of factors – the CILFIT criteria – that should be satisfied before the doctrine may be properly invoked. One criterion is that the national court “must be convinced that the matter is equally obvious to the courts of the other Member States” (emphasis added). In 1982, there were nine “other” Member States; in 2008, there are 26. Another criterion requires courts to bear in mind that Community legislation is “drafted in several languages”. There were seven official languages in 1982; there are now 22 (23 if Irish is included). The CILFIT criteria were difficult to satisfy in 1982; they have become increasingly more difficult as EU membership has expanded; they are, it is submitted, practically impossible to satisfy in any meaningful sense in 2008. The CILFIT criteria should therefore be re-written. As EU membership has expanded (and looks set for further expansion in the not too distant future), various reform proposals concerning the <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> <b>procedure</b> have been formulated, the central idea being to change the “judicial architecture” to allow the ECJ to cope with its ever increasing workload. The most notable of these is (by default, given that it {{is the only one that}} has actually been implemented) : the insertion of the present Article 225 (3) EC by the Treaty of Amsterdam, conferring limited jurisdiction for dealing with <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> on the Court of First Instance (CFI). More specifically, the CFI is authorised to deal with <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> in as yet unspecified ‘specific areas’.

40|$|The Dzodzi line of cases� {{evidence}} that {{the functioning of the}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> <b>procedure</b> under Article 234 EC is not restricted to the scope of Community law, but extends also to the cases governed by national law referring to certain Community provision or concept. Most controversially {{in the context of this}} far-reaching pronouncement, the Court dismissed the views expressed by its Advocates General, actually, in all the cases of this type (recently in Roman Angonese, 6 June 2000). Ten years after the judgment in Dzodzi has been delivered, the future development of the tendency seems to be still open to radically different solutions. A compromise solution may be found in the acceptance of jurisdiction in �comparable� situations, ascertained on the basis of relationship between the interpretation and the facts of a particular case. This solution should be based on the assessment of the �ability to provide helpful interpretation� and the possibility to define a legal problem precisely, as a prerequisite for the full exchange of arguments. Then, it could provide a consistent attitude of the Court towards all the cases on the admissibility of references under Article 234 EC. The uncertainty inevitably following such a solution could be outweighed by the need to retain a flexible and cooperative attitude.

40|$|The rules {{governing}} {{the free flow}} o f goods on the Community internal market, fundamental for full integration of the areas o f law necessary to achieve aims set by the Founding Treaties, {{have been included in}} the state order. Member States, however, can introduce and maintain legal measures limiting the free flow o f goods and services in consideration of public interest. The measures can only have limited scope due to the countries’ obligation to respect the purposefulness requirement and proportionality criteria.

We can hardly overrate the Court’s interpretation work in determining accurately the referents o f the notion “public interest” and defining individual critria whose fulfilment is requisite for a member state to benefit from legal derogation from the free flow. In relation to Poland’s accesión to the European Union, discussion on “limits to the free flow of goods and services in the common market because of public interest in the light o f the European Court o f Justice’s decisions” can be found useful, particularly for legislative process and the practice of application of the state law...|$|R

40|$|The Nordic {{countries}} have no tradition {{of judicial review}} by courts and have generally been hesitant {{to make use of}} the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> in the European Union. New data indicate that Nordic courts prefer to solve as many EU-related judicial disputes as possible without involving a supranational organ such as the ECJ. Building on two comprehensive surveys of Danish and Swedish courts and judges, this study challenges the theory of judicial empowerment when explaining judicial integration in the EU. The article argues that in order to explain when and why Member State courts make use of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure,</b> a much deeper understanding of the prevalent legal/political culture and concept of democracy in each Member State is required.

50|$|A <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> is a {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the interpretation of European Union law, made {{at the request of}} a court or tribunal of a European Union member state. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> are final determinations of Union law in question by the EU courts. The final decision remains with the referring court to be decided after it received the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling.</b> European Union <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> can only be made by the European Court of Justice. The Treaty of Lisbon provided that jurisdiction may be conferred on the General Court, but this has not been put into effect.|$|R
40|$|For years, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{has been}} {{overloaded}} with requests for preliminary rulings, given that these proceedings make {{up more than}} three-quarters of the Court caseload. Such circumstances constitute a significant constraint to the operation of the Court, which is unable to quickly and effectively respond to the preliminary questions which are referred to this Court by the national courts of Member States. In addition, the duration of the regular preliminary ruling proceedings jeopardizes the European standards {{not only in terms of}} the lengthy procedure but also in terms of observing the right of each individual to effective judicial protection within a reasonable time. In order to make the proceedings faster and more effective, the procedural rules have been repeatedly amended and supplemented. The applicable Rules of Procedure of the Court stipulate some exceptions from the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure.</b> The first one is the so-called simplified procedure, where the Court renders a final decision in the form of a reasoned order, without scheduling an oral hearing and obtaining the written opinion of the Advocate-General. The Court may also decide to institute the expedited procedure, by means of which the case at issue is given absolute priority over other cases. The last exception is the urgent procedure, which is applicable only in the area of freedom, security and justice; it implies the omission of certain stages of the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure.</b> The analyses presented in this paper show that the results achieved in terms of reducing the length of the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> are generally positive. Thus, the average time required for rendering a decision in the expedited procedure is approximately four and a half months, which is certainly a significant improvement as compared to the length of the regular procedure which takes sixteen to seventeen months. The initial results accomplished by instituting the urgent procedure are even more encouraging, as the average duration of this procedure is approximately two months. The time required for deliberation in an urgent procedure has never exceeded three months, which makes this procedure faster and more efficient than the expedited procedure...|$|E

The importance of the Article 267 <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> in developing key principles of EU law, has been stressed on numerous occasions, and in a competition law context, it has been noted that “the preliminary reference procedure has had a disproportionately significant impact on the substantive development of EU competition law. ” The significance of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> for EU competition law was clearly demonstrated by my earlier work in this area in Article 234 and Competition Law: An Analysis which provided an analysis of all of the competition-law related rulings by the Court of Justice to 1 st May 2004 and this was followed by work which gave an overview of preliminary rulings between 1 May 2004 and end November 2011.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the action for annulment under Art 230 EC and the control of validity within the scope of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> under Art 234 (1) (b) EC. Despite some fundamental differences between both procedures - Art 230 EC is a direct action before the community courts, while Art 234 EC is a procedure of co-operation between national courts and the ECJ - overlaps are possible: After expiration of the time-limit, pursuant to Art. 230 (5) EC, legal acts of community institutions become final. Yet, since the institution of a <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> is not subject to any time-limit, such legal acts can be subject to a preliminary reference concerning their validity after the time limit pursuant to Art 230 (5) has already expired. Making a reference in favour of a person who could bring an action for annulment against such an act but has failed to do so, would thus circumvent the finality of that act. For this reason the ECJ rejects references concerning the validity of acts under Art 234 EC, if an annulment action of the person in whose favour the reference is made was obviously admissible but no such action was brought. The article analyses the case-law existing on this issue and attempts to determine more precisely the criterion of obviousness. In addition, the article highlights constellations of overlap that have not yet been subject of the existing case-law...|$|E
