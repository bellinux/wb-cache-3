5|$|Sprigg {{relocated}} to Cumberland in 1890. He {{was one of}} three incorporators of the Allegany County Bar Association, and in 1899 he was elected by the association as one of its directors. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the Cumberland city council in 1905 and a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1907. In response to pollution of the North Branch Potomac River, Sprigg became chairman of the Pure Water League and waged a successful campaign to require the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company to abandon the sulfite process of <b>pulping</b> in favor of a cleaner soda <b>pulping</b> method. While chairman of the Allegany County Democratic Convention in 1907, a resolution supporting an eight-hour workday was formally adopted by the convention. In 1908, he was appointed city attorney for Cumberland. Following a prolonged illness, he died in 1911.|$|E

Only 3 percent of the β-carotene in raw carrots is {{released}} during digestion: this can be improved to 39% by <b>pulping,</b> cooking and adding cooking oil. Alternatively they may be chopped and boiled, fried or steamed, and cooked in soups and stews, as well as baby and pet foods. A well-known dish is carrots julienne. Together with onion and celery, carrots are one of the primary vegetables used in a mirepoix to make various broths.|$|E

25|$|Several {{companies}} in the {{pulp and paper industry}} are interested in utilizing GM technology to alter the lignin content of plantation trees. It is estimated that reducing lignin in plantation trees by genetic modification could reduce <b>pulping</b> costs by up to $15 per cubic metre. Lignin removal from wood fibres conventionally relies on costly and environmentally hazardous chemicals. By developing low-lignin GM trees it is hoped that <b>pulping</b> and bleaching processes will require fewer inputs, therefore, mills supplied by low-lignin GM trees may have a reduced impact on their surrounding ecosystems and communities. However, it is argued that reductions in lignin may compromise the structural integrity of the plant, thereby making it more susceptible to pathogens and disease, which could necessitate pesticide use exceeding that on traditional plantations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{electrochemically}} mediated delignification of <b>pulp</b> fibers {{is one of}} {{the promising}} bleaching methods, which can give the delignified <b>pulp</b> with good subsequent bleachability and high <b>pulp</b> viscosity. Our previous work has shown that the poplar kraft <b>pulp</b> can be delignified to 45 % delignification ratio with less than 10 % <b>pulp</b> viscosity loss at the condition of 1 % <b>pulp</b> consistency which limits the application of this method in <b>pulp</b> industry. The high-consistency electrochemical delignification of poplar kraft <b>pulp</b> was investigated in this paper. The delignification ratio, <b>pulp</b> viscosity loss and brightness were measured as well as the delignification conditions, such as <b>pulp</b> consistency, voltage of electrolysis cell, temperature, circulation of electrolysis liquor and time, were discussed. The results showed that at the 10 % <b>pulp</b> consistency, the circulation of electrolysis liquor between <b>pulp</b> cell and electrolysis cell can efficiently improve the delignification ratio, and the <b>pulp</b> viscosity loss is less than 10 %. The subsequent bleachability for H 2 O 2 is similar as that of 1 % consistency delignified <b>pulp.</b> The <b>pulp</b> also can be bleached to higher than 80 % ISO with following EP stage at 2. 5 % H 2 O 2 dosage...|$|R

25|$|The {{next step}} was {{introduction}} of a new pulp process, thermomechanical pulp (TMP), replacing the former grindstone mechanical <b>pulping.</b> TMP allowed for more long fibers to be retained, thus improving the strength. This allowed for cellulose content to be dropped from fifteen percent, which would allow for cost-savings along with faster processing through the paper machines. The first TMP machine was installed in 1977, with a daily capacity of 120 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Economist Steven Landsburg has {{suggested}} that the sole benefit of reducing landfill space is trumped by the energy needed and resulting pollution from the recycling process. Others, however, have calculated through life-cycle assessment that producing recycled paper uses less energy and water than harvesting, <b>pulping,</b> processing, and transporting virgin trees. When less recycled paper is used, additional energy is needed to create and maintain farmed forests until these forests are as self-sustainable as virgin forests.|$|E
25|$|Recovery boiler is {{the part}} of Kraft process of <b>pulping</b> where {{chemicals}} for white liquor are recovered and reformed from black liquor, which contains lignin from previously processed wood. The black liquor is burned, generating heat, which is usually used in the process or in making electricity, much as in a conventional steam power plant. The invention of the recovery boiler by G.H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.|$|E

Industrial wood waste <b>pulp</b> was more effectively bleached than loblolly pine <b>pulp</b> and consumed less chlorine dioxide under similar bleaching conditions. Mechanical properties of paper from industrial wood waste <b>pulp</b> and loblolly pine <b>pulp</b> were very similar except for tear values, which were about two points higher for loblolly pine.

25|$|Camphor can be {{produced}} from alpha-pinene, which is abundant in the oils of coniferous trees and can be distilled from turpentine produced as a side product of chemical <b>pulping.</b> With acetic acid as the solvent and with catalysis by a strong acid, alpha-pinene readily rearranges into camphene, which in turn undergoes Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement into the isobornyl cation, which is captured by acetate to give isobornyl acetate. Hydrolysis into isoborneol followed by oxidation gives racemic camphor. By contrast, camphor occurs naturally as D-camphor, the (R)-enantiomer.|$|E
25|$|This {{property}} {{arises from}} adjacently aligned glucan chains participating in inter- and intrachain hydrogen bonding. Bacterial cellulose subfibrils are crystallized into microfibrils which group to form bundles, that then form 'ribbons'. These fibers are two {{orders of magnitude}} thinner than cellulose fibers produced by <b>pulping</b> wood. Today, {{it is known that}} the pellicle comprises a random assembly of fibrils (< 130nbsp&nm wide), which are composed of a bundle of much finer microfibrils (2 to 4nbsp&nm diameter). It is also known that the pellicle gives a film or sheet when dried if the shrinkage across the plane is restricted.|$|E
