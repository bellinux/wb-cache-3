50|$|Electric <b>pulse</b> <b>fishing</b> is {{a fishing}} {{technique}} sometimes used in trawl fisheries which produces a limited electric field above the seabed to catch fish. The pulse trawl gear {{consists of a}} number of electrodes, attached to the gear in the tow direction, that emit short electric pulses. The electrodes replace the tickler chains that are used in traditional beam trawl fishery. The pulse trawl fishery is mainly aimed at flatfish like sole, with by-catch plaice. In addition, the pulse trawl gear is applied in shrimp fisheries on a limited scale. Technically, the use of electricity to catch fish is prohibited in European waters. However, the European Union is able to provides exemptions to this rule since 2007. These exemptions are now mainly used by Dutch and British trawlers in the North Sea.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{fish can}} be {{classified}} into two types: <b>pulse</b> <b>fish</b> or wave fish. Gymnarchus niloticus is a wave fish, producing a near-sinusoidal discharge of around 500 Hz. The electric discharge is produced from an electric organ that evolved from muscle, as {{can also be seen}} in Gymnotiform electric fish, electric rays and skates. The convergent evolution between the South American Gymnotiforms and the African Mormyridae is remarkable, with the electric organ being produced via the substitution of the same amino acid in the same voltage-gated sodium channel despite the two groups of fish being on different continents and the evolution of the electric sense organ being separated in time by around 60 million years.|$|R
25|$|For the myogoenic fishes, {{this change}} in signal {{waveform}} occurs with the initial larval electrocytes fusing together forming new electrocytes with different shapes, along with redistribution of ion-gated channels, formation of new extracellular structures on the electrocytes, etc. Some <b>pulse</b> <b>fishes</b> also develop accessory electric organs located on {{other parts of the}} body; these extra electric organs further play a role in adding phases to the EODs. For the only neurogenic fish known so far, apteronotids, EOD changes during the developmental process seemed to be more dramatic than that of the myogenic fishes, which might indicate that neurogenic electrocytes are more easily prone to modifications. Similar with the myogenic fishes, apteronotids has its electric organ formed by myocytes. As apteronotids matures, new neurogenic electrocytes derived from spinal motoneurons replace the myogenic electrocytes.|$|R

25|$|In gymnotiforms, electrocytes differ between wave-type and pulse-type {{electric}} fishes. In wave-type fishes, electrocytes {{are in a}} tubular form. In <b>pulse</b> <b>fish</b> the electrocytes tend to be flattened disks. The electocytes also form columns, {{but unlike}} the shorter size of electric organ in mormyrids, gymnotiforms have long electric organs that extend throughout almost the entire longitudinal body length. Also different from the stalk system in mormyrids, stalks in gymnotiforms only make one type of innervation at the posterior side of electrocyte. Pulse-type gymnotifoms generally show a higher complexity than the wave-type fishes. For instance, their electrocytes can be either cylindrical or drum-shaped with stalks innervating from either posterior or anterior side. Another important difference is that, unlike mormyrids or wave-type gymnotiforms, electrocytes of pulse-type gymnotiforms are not homogenous along the long electric organ that traverses the fish body. Different parts of the electric organs of some gymnotoiforms are innervated differently or may have different cellular firing properties.|$|R

Many Dutch fishermen see <b>pulse</b> <b>fishing</b> as their future because of reduced fuel costs and good catches. At the same time, it is a heavily debated fishing method.

To extend the amount of licenses for <b>pulse</b> <b>fishing</b> or to change the temporary license into a permanent one, more information was and is needed on the catch composition in <b>pulse</b> <b>fishing.</b> The Dutch government asked the fishing industry to provide these data. Therefore, in 2011 the fishing industry started a catch monitoring program together in kilograms in the sample of the quantities of plaice, sole, cod and other fish species (commercial and noncommercial), benthic species, stones, peat and shells. When registering fish species, a distinction is made in landing size and undersized fish. Halfway through the program, a quality check of the data was carried out. Based on the outcome, some changes were made in the program. Also, extra attention was given to fishermen that had problems filling in the forms in the correct way.

A {{spontaneous}} EOD {{response to}} sound {{is described in}} two gymnotoids of the pulse Electric Organ Discharge (EOD) type, Hypopomus and Gym-notus, and in one mormyrid, Brienomyrus (Figs. 2 - 4). 2. In all three species, the EOD response to the sound onset was a transient EOD rate increase. In the low EOD rate Hypopomus (3 - 6 EODs/s at rest) the first, second, or third EOD interval following sound onset was significantly shorter than the average EOD interval before stimulation. The shortest latency found was 100 ms, the longest ca. 1. 2 s. Gymnotus (around 50 EODs/s at rest) responded similarly, but the third interval after sound onset {{was the first to}} be affected even at highest intensities (shortest laten-cies approx. 60 ms; latencies> 0. 5 s at low sound in-tensities). In Brienomyrus (4 - 8 EODs/s at rest) the response occurred already at the first EOD interval after sound onset. 3. An EOD sound response was recorded in Hypo-porous and in Gymnotus up to 5, 000 Hz sound fre-quency (in one Gymnotus individual: up to 7, 000 Hz). Due to technical limitations the low frequency limit of the response could not be exactly determined: the fishes responded well even below 100 Hz. Hypopomus had its maximum sensitivity around 500 Hz (Fig. 5), Gymnotus around 1, 000 Hz (Fig. 6). 4. In all three species the EOD sound response was graded with sound intensity (Hypopomus: Fig. 7). 5. No EOD response to sound was found in two gymnotoids of the wave type, Eigenmannia and Apter-onotus, and in the gymnotoid <b>pulse</b> <b>fish</b> Rhamph-ichthys.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To model food group {{consumption}} and price of diet associated with achieving UK dietary recommendations while deviating {{as little as}} possible from the current UK diet, in order to support the redevelopment of the UK food-based dietary guidelines (now called the Eatwell Guide). DESIGN: Optimisation modelling, minimising an objective function of the difference between population mean modelled and current consumption of 125 food groups, and constraints of nutrient and food-based recommendations. SETTING: The UK. POPULATION: Adults aged 19  years and above from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008 - 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of diet consisting of major foods groups and price of the optimised diet. RESULTS: The optimised diet has an increase in consumption of 'potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy carbohydrates' (+ 69 %) and 'fruit and vegetables' (+ 54 %) and reductions in consumption of 'beans, <b>pulses,</b> <b>fish,</b> eggs, meat and other proteins' (- 24 %), 'dairy and alternatives' (- 21 %) and 'foods high in fat and sugar' (- 53 %). Results within food groups show considerable variety (eg, + 90 % for beans and pulses, - 78 % for red meat). The modelled diet would cost £ 5. 99 (£ 5. 93 to £ 6. 05) per adult per day, very similar to the cost of the current diet: £ 6. 02 (£ 5. 96 to £ 6. 08). The optimised diet would result in increased consumption of n- 3 fatty acids and most micronutrients (including iron and folate), but decreased consumption of zinc and small decreases in consumption of calcium and riboflavin. CONCLUSIONS: To achieve the UK dietary recommendations would require large changes in the average diet of UK adults, including in food groups where current average consumption is well within the recommended range (eg, processed meat) or where there are no current recommendations (eg, dairy). These large changes in the diet will not lead to significant changes in the price of the diet. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
