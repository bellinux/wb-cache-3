40|$|This work gives a {{comprehensive}} look on talk <b>programmes</b> <b>for</b> the young in {{the offer of}} Czech Radio since 1992 to present. It focuses on characteristics of talk <b>programmes</b> <b>for</b> the young across stations of Czech Radio (2, 3 and 6) and a summary of talk <b>programmes</b> of station <b>for</b> the young Radio Wave. The offer of talk <b>programmes</b> <b>for</b> the young since 1992 to present shows that Czech Radio since its inception deals with insufficient or imbalanced filling of the Act, which obliges Czech Radio in relation to young listeners. Its current offer could be considered sufficient but certainly not balanced. Prevailing journalistic talk <b>programmes</b> <b>for</b> the young tend to expand their field of interest {{but on the other}} hand they deal with narrowing range of genres. Programmes Assault (Přepadení) and Demolition (Bourání) prove that talk <b>programmes</b> <b>for</b> the young have the potention to enrich radio production in general with new topics and new forms. But talk <b>programmes</b> <b>for</b> the young of Czech Radio are facing one crucial problem and that is of lack of audience in the age between 15 and 30. Some of necessary steps that will lead to improvement will probably be putting station for the young back to analogue broadcasting and extension of programmess for youth on the internet...|$|R
