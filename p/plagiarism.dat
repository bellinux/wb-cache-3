5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards <b>plagiarism,</b> he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On <b>Plagiarism,</b> an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: JPlag is a {{web service}} that finds pairs of similar {{programs}} among a given set of programs. It has successfully {{been used in}} practice for detecting <b>plagiarisms</b> among student Java program submissions. Support for the languages C, C++ and Scheme is also available. We describe JPlag’s architecture and its comparsion algorithm, {{which is based on}} a known one called Greedy String Tiling. Then, the contribution of this paper is threefold: First, an evaluation of JPlag’s performance on several rather different sets of Java programs shows that JPlag is very hard to deceive. More than 90 percent of the 77 <b>plagiarisms</b> within our various benchmark program sets are reliably detected and a majority of the others at least raise suspicion. The run time is just a few seconds for submissions of 100 programs of several hundred lines each. Second, a parameter study shows that the approach is fairly robust with respect to its configuration parameters. Third, we study the kinds of attempts used for disguising <b>plagiarisms,</b> their frequency, and their success...|$|R

It has successfully been used in practice to detect <b>plagiarisms</b> among student Java exercise submissions. Support for the languages C, C++ and Scheme is also available. This report presents the design of JPlag, in particular the comparison algorithm, and carefully evaluates JPlag's performance on 12 rather different sets of Java programs. The results indicate that JPlag will find all <b>plagiarisms</b> with only very few exceptions.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{copyright}} registrations for music documents is increasing each year.

Nevertheless, adaptation to the musical context raises specific problems and a direct adaptation does not lead to an accurate detection algorithm: indeed, very different sequences can represent very similar musical pieces. We are developing an improved system which mainly considers melody but takes also into account elements of music theory in order to detect musically important differences between sequences. In this paper, we present the improvements proposed by our system {{in the context of the}} near-duplicate music document detection. Several experiments with famous music copyright infringement cases are proposed. In both monophonic and polyphonic context, the system allows the detection of <b>plagiarisms.</b> 1...|$|R

In response to claims of <b>plagiarism,</b> the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for copyright infringement, and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals {{in the case of}} Whaam!, as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.|$|E
