"Project Apollo" [...] was {{designed}} to be a single source, national market research service based on Nielsen's Homescan technology for measuring consumer purchase behavior, combined with Arbitron's Portable People Meter system, measuring electronic media exposure. In January 2006, The Nielsen Company and Arbitron Inc. completed the deployment of a national <b>pilot</b> <b>panel</b> of more than 11,000 persons in 5,000 households. Seven advertisers (P&G, Unilever, Wal*Mart, Pfizer, Pepsi, Kraft), S.C. Johnson, signed on as members of the Project Apollo Steering Committee. The Committee worked with Arbitron and Nielsen to evaluate the utility of multi-media and purchase information from a common sample of consumers. Individuals within the sample were given incentives to voluntarily carry Arbitron's Portable People Meter, a small, pager-sized device that collects the person's exposure to electronic media sources: broadcast television networks, cable networks, and network radio as well as audio-based commercials broadcast on these platforms. Consumer exposure to other media such as newspapers, magazines and circulars were collected through additional survey instruments. The project was shuttered in February 2008 due to sample size, cost and insufficient client commitment.|$|E
5000|$|The Do 217 usually {{carried a}} crew of four. Included were a pilot, an observer/bomb aimer/forward gunner, dorsal gunner/radio {{operator}} and a flight engineer/ventral gunner. As with the Dornier Do 17, the crew were positioned in the cockpit cabin forward of the engines and leading edge. The pilot sat on the port side, with a spectacle-type control column mounted on a swinging arm centered in the instrument panel. The entire arm could be swung 180deg to starboard, placing the yoke {{in front of the}} bombardier, in case of emergencies. In the later Do 217K with stepless windscreen, the center pivot was mounted on a rocking control arm or pedestal, rather than a sliding piston, since the instrument panel itself was eliminated (replaced with smaller panels holding the gauges, hung {{from the edge of the}} fueslage wall and from the glazing frames above the yoke, respectively.) The bomb aimer sat on his immediate right, slightly below and behind. In combat he could move forward into the nose and operate the bomb release gear or aim the forward machine gun (or 20 mm cannon). On the right side of the nose, the bomb aimer's window penetrates the cockpit and is visible as a bulge on the exterior. Back-to-back with the bombardiers seat, the flight engineer/ventral gunner sat on the port side, his seat facing to the rear. The seat of the ventral gunner/flight engineer was next to the radio operator facing forward, behind the bomb aimer. During operations the ventral gunner/engineer would lie on his stomach facing aft, his post as a gunner taking immediate and first priority.The radio-operator/dorsal gunner sat in a pivoting seat in the extreme rear, above the ventral gun position. His head was inside the B-Stand gun position, and the instruments mounted in a semi-circle around his torso level. The pilot had a curved shield of Armour plating, 8.5 mm thick, placed behind his seat. His seat had a further 5mm ( [...] in) of armour and another 5mm ( [...] in) plate above his head, installed in the top of the cockpit roof. The dorsal gunner was also protected by armour plating.The Funkgerät or FuG radio communication device compartments were located in the extreme rear of the cockpit, near the leading edge. The automatic <b>pilot</b> <b>panel</b> was located next the FuG boxes. In the right-rear of the cockpit the piping that was also attached to the de-icing ducts in wings also entered the cockpit, as part of a single heating system to emit warm air to heat the cabin if needed.The FuG X, 16, navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 2 blind landing devices were used in the E-2.|$|E

40|$|An {{estimated}} 5. 6 {{million children}} under the age of 18 suffer from asthma in the United States making asthma one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Because of the nature of the disease, the treatment regimen necessary to manage asthma has considerably changed as new drugs are developed and improved. The complexity of the treatment regimen recommended by the physician, however, has been linked with problems in adherence. Accordingly, the purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of adherence to medication regimens among children between 9 to 15 years of age with physician-diagnosed asthma in Houston, Texas. The study used a set of data from a sample of children who participated in a <b>pilot,</b> <b>panel</b> asthma study to investigate the association between exposure to oxygenated air toxics and asthma health outcomes, conducted between 2002 and 2003. Data on daily intake of medication and onset of asthma-related symptoms were collected for each child per 10 -day sampling period. Information was gathered through telephone or personal interviews for the 28 study participants who completed the study. The prevalence of adherence was calculated based on the number of times the participant reported taking his or her maintenance medication. The Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Exact test and the Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test were used to compare the level of adherence between the first and the last sampling cycle (Cycle 1 and Cycle 4) among the study participants by age, gender, and ethnicity. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{absence of}} highly {{sensitive}} and specific serum biomarkers makes mass screening for ovarian cancer impossible. The claudin proteins are frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancers, but their potential as prognostic, diagnostic, or detection markers remains unclear. Here, we have explored the possible {{use of these}} proteins as screening biomarkers for ovarian cancer detection. Methods Claudin protein shedding from cells was examined by immunoblotting of conditioned culture media. The presence of claudins in exosomes released from ovarian cancer cells was demonstrated by sucrose gradient separation and immunogold electron microscopy experiments. Claudin- 4 -containing exosomes in the plasma of ovarian cancer patients were evaluated in a <b>pilot</b> <b>panel</b> of 63 ovarian cancer patients and 50 healthy volunteers. The CA 125 marker was also assessed in these samples and compared with claudin- 4 positivity. Results We show that full-length claudins can be shed from ovarian cancer cells in culture and found in the media as part of small lipid vesicles known as exosomes. Moreover, 32 of 63 plasma samples from ovarian cancer patients exhibited the presence of claudin- 4 -containing exosomes. In contrast, only one of 50 samples from individuals without cancer exhibited claudin- 4 -positive exosomes. In our small panel, at a specificity of 98 %, the claudin- 4 and CA 125 tests had sensitivities of 51 % and 71 %, respectively. The two tests {{did not appear to}} be independent and were strongly correlated. Conclusion Our work shows for the first time that claudin- 4 can be released from ovarian cancer cells and can be detected in the peripheral circulation of ovarian cancer patients. The development of sensitive assays for the detection of claudin- 4 in blood will be crucial in determining whether this approach can be useful, alone or in combination with other screening methods, for the detection of ovarian cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|VIDEO {{segmentation}} facilitates e±cient video indexing {{and navigation}} in large digital video archives. It {{is an important}} process in a content-based video indexing and retrieval (CBVIR) system. Many automated solutions performed seg- mentation by utilizing information about the " of the video. These " {{come in the form}} of labels that describe the objects which are captured by the cam- era. This type of solutions was able to achieve good and consistent results for some video genres such as news programs and informational presentations. The content format of this type of videos is generally quite standard, and automated solutions were designed to follow these format rules. For example in [1], the presence of news anchor persons was used as a cue to determine the start and end of a meaningful news segment. The same cannot be said for video genres such as movies and feature films. This is because makers of this type of videos utilized different filming techniques to design their videos in order to elicit certain affective response from their targeted audience. Humans usually perform manual video segmentation by trying to relate changes in time and locale to discontinuities in meaning [2]. As a result, viewers usually have doubts about the boundary locations of a meaningful video segment due to their different affective responses. This thesis presents an entirely new view to the problem of high level video segmentation. We developed a novel probabilistic method for affective level video content analysis and segmentation. Our method had two stages. In the first stage, a®ective content labels were assigned to video shots by means of a dynamic bayesian 0. Abstract 3 network (DBN). A novel hierarchical-coupled dynamic bayesian network (HCDBN) topology was proposed for this stage. The topology was based on the pleasure- arousal-dominance (P-A-D) model of a®ect representation [3]. In principle, this model can represent a large number of emotions. In the second stage, the visual, audio and a®ective information of the video was used to compute a statistical feature vector to represent the content of each shot. Affective level video segmentation was achieved by applying spectral clustering to the feature vectors. We evaluated the first stage of our proposal by comparing its emotion detec- tion ability with all the existing works which are related to the field of a®ective video content analysis. To evaluate the second stage, we used the time adaptive clustering (TAC) algorithm as our performance benchmark. The TAC algorithm was the best high level video segmentation method [2]. However, it is a very computationally intensive algorithm. To accelerate its computation speed, we developed a modified TAC (modTAC) algorithm which was designed to be mapped easily onto a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. Both the TAC and modTAC algorithms were used as performance benchmarks for our proposed method. Since affective video content is a perceptual concept, the segmentation per- formance and human agreement rates were used as our evaluation criteria. To obtain our ground truth data and viewer agreement rates, a <b>pilot</b> <b>panel</b> study which was based on the work of Gross et al. [4] was conducted. Experiment results will show the feasibility of our proposed method. For the first stage of our proposal, our experiment results will show that an average improvement of as high as 38...|$|E

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis investigate key questions about leptospirosis diagnostics in animals and humans in New Zealand (NZ) : how do different diagnostic tests perform on various specimens collected {{at different stages of}} infection; how well do tests from a commercial and a research laboratory agree; how do serological test results and urine/kidney quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) results compare; and what is the utility of PCRs on blood from acute human cases? Additional studies investigate occupational risk at the human-animal interface. In trials where the animals were challenged with Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjobovis (Hardjobovis) and/or Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona (Pomona), sequential samples were taken from sheep and cattle to evaluate diagnostic tests at various known times post-infection. Although no statistically significant differences were found, results suggested that during the early stage of a Pomona infection in sheep, qPCR on serum had the highest sensitivity for detecting leptospires in blood, followed by blood culture and qPCR on whole blood. In sheep infected under carefully controlled experimental conditions, culture tended to have higher sensitivity for detecting leptospires (either Hardjobovis or Pomona) in urine than qPCR; whereas in cattle with Hardjobovis infection, higher sensitivity was apparent using qPCR. Sensitivity was similar in culture and qPCR for detecting leptospires in kidney from sheep with either Hardjobovis or Pomona infections. There was low sensitivity and specificity of dark field microscopy for both urine and kidney samples, thus questioning the usefulness of this technique in veterinary settings. A cross-sectional study was carried out at a NZ sheep and cattle abattoir to investigate the seroprevalence (by microscopic agglutination test (MAT)), shedding rate (by urine qPCR), and renal colonisation rate (by kidney qPCR) of slaughtered animals. Urine, kidney and blood samples were collected from carcasses of 399 sheep and 146 cattle. The animal-level seroprevalence found in sheep (57 %, predominately lambs) and cattle (73 %, predominately ≤ 18 months old) was substantially higher than in previous studies; these and the recorded shedding rate (27 %) and renal colonisation rate (27 %) raised occupational health concerns that meat workers from this abattoir may be at risk of exposure to leptospires during their daily work routine. iv Samples from this abattoir study were used to investigate the inter-laboratory test agreements between a research (HLRL) and a commercial veterinary diagnostic laboratory (GV), and test agreements (HLRL) between specimens for leptospirosis diagnosis. Urine qPCR results on from the two laboratories had almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0. 93). The MAT agreement between these two laboratories was higher for Hardjobovis (kappa = 0. 94) than Pomona (kappa = 0. 53). This serovar-dependent difference suggested that the different MAT results may be more likely due to the different source of antigen cultures (especially serovar Pomona) used in two laboratories than observer variation. These inter-laboratory comparisons can assist researchers and diagnosticians in understanding the sometimes discrepant test results received. Within HLRL, almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0. 84) between qPCR results on urine and kidney suggested that the qPCR on these two specimens can be used interchangeably. The comparisons between MAT and qPCR on both kidney and urine, suggested that except from Hardjobovis-seropositivity in sheep, Pomona-seropositivity in sheep and seropositivity of both Hardjobovis and Pomona in cattle was not considered to be predictive for indicating shedding/renal colonisation at individual animal level. A <b>pilot</b> <b>panel</b> of isolates from 18 sheep and five cattle kidney cultures demonstrated the utility of a multi-locus sequence typing scheme for genotyping Leptospira spp. field isolates from sheep and cattle in NZ. The sequence results provided sufficient genetic variability to assign the isolates to two distinct species, those being L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans. Two dominant serovars (Hardjobovis and Kenniwicki) were identified. Identical sequences found in Hardjobovis isolates from sheep and cattle provided evidence for inter-species transmission of Leptospira spp. Aiming to establish the best diagnostic test or combination of tests for the early diagnosis of human leptospirosis, suspect leptospirosis patients were recruited via rural general practitioners (GP), hospital doctors and phlebotomists within the Waikato District Health Board area. For each recruited patient (n = 14), blood culture, MAT (on acute and convalescent serum), and whole blood/serum PCRs (by three laboratories) were performed. Although it is difficult to make conclusions based on findings from 14 patients recruited from one region, this is the first attempt to compare different diagnostic tests for acute leptospirosis cases in NZ. The information of clinical v symptoms, demographics, and exposure to risk factors can contribute to the GPs‟ suspicion of future leptospirosis cases. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence and quantify putative risk factors for both intra- and extra-curricular exposure to leptospirosis among undergraduate veterinary students at Massey University, NZ. All participating students (n = 302) were MAT negative for each serovar (Hardjobovis, Pomona, and Ballum), using a cut-point of ≥ 48. This study demonstrated that these veterinary students were at low risk of contracting leptospirosis, despite frequent exposure to potential sources of infection (e. g. animal urine within and outside veterinary curriculum, home slaughtering, hunting, and outdoor activities involving fresh water). The similar frequency of exposure to the non-work putative risky activities (hunting and home slaughtering) reported in veterinary students as previously reported in meat workers, added strength to the finding that non-work activities are less important risk factors compared to within-work activities...|$|E

This user's manual contains complete input and output descriptions. A brief description of the method is given as well as practical {{instructions for}} proper configurations modeling. Computed results are also included to demonstrate some of the capabilities of the pilot code. The computer program is written in FORTRAN IV for the SCOPE 3. 4. 4 operations system of the Ames CDC 7600 computer. The program uses overlay structure and thirteen disk files, and it requires approximately 132000 (Octal) central memory words...|$|R
50|$|Z-10 is {{also the}} very first Chinese {{helicopter}} that adopts HOTAS, but a traditional conventional control system had been developed in parallel as a backup, just as the case of cockpit MFDs, and for exactly the same reason why two configurations of flight instrumentation were developed in parallel. The erroneous claim of installing Russian K-36/37 ejection seat in the cockpit of Z-10 proved to be false, and the survival of pilots in emergency landings depends on the crash worthiness of the helicopter. To counterbalance {{the weight of the}} armor protecting the <b>pilots,</b> flight instrumentation <b>panel</b> is the place where composite material is mostly used, {{as in the case of}} the dashboard of automobiles, where plastic material concentrates. One of the greatest challenges was to find the right composite material that is fit to use, while at the same time, also meets the safety standard so that during a fire, the pilots would not be knocked out by the toxic fume released by the burning composite material.|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{the current}} pilot control system {{provides}} pilots {{the ability to}} manoeuvre the underwater Remotely Controlled Vehicle (ROV) {{with a high degree}} of precision and accuracy, the control signals between the individual control panels and the central processing hub are still analog. Because of this the physical interconnection system and hardware is cumbersome when compared to its digital counterpart. The proposed solution was to replace the current ribbon cables with a serial communication network; forming the basis for this project. The main objective of this project was to establish a serial communication link between a central node and the multiple <b>pilot</b> control <b>panels.</b> The design must be able to interface with multiple panels whilst still being robust, provide modularity, be expandable and most importantly maintain efficient communication to reduce latency. This report documents the extensive research into serial communication networks that was required to aid in designing a system that would meet the requirements. Several prototype systems were developed using pre-existing microprocessors boards before the final prototype system was realised. The development and testing of each system has been individually documented to provide the reader with an in depth understanding of each system, whilst demonstrating the methodology used to realise the final system. The final prototype system whilst using existing microprocessor boards was able to conclusively prove a serial communication interface could be used to collect the control signals from all ten panels, whilst maintaining efficient communication. Because time permitted the idea of a potentiometer fault detection system was investigate and documented, whilst the system was found to work with a degree of accuracy the future work is still required...|$|R
40|$|The results {{obtained}} from an evaluation for gust and draft velocities of acceleration and airspeed-altitude records taken by NACA recording instruments installed in P- 61 c airplanes participating in thunderstorm flights 6, 7, and 8 of July 9, 1946, July 10, 1946, and July 11, 1946, respectively, are presented herein. These data {{are summarized in}} tables I and II. In accordance with a recent discussion {{with a member of}} the U. S. Weather Bureau staff, the tabulated results for the present flight include in addition to data of the type presented in reference 1, the initial heading of the airplane for each traverse, the pressure altitude at the start of each traverse in increments of 500 feet, and the gust gradient distance when it could be evaluated. The cloud entry and exit times for the present data were taken from motion-picture records of the <b>pilot's</b> instrument <b>panels</b> whenever such records were available while the length fo the traverses in seconds and feet was taken from the airspeed-altitude records. In many cases, however, poor agreement is indicated between the duration of the cloud traverses as obtained from the motion-picture records and from the airspeed-altitude records. This result is believed to be due to camera stoppages, inaccurate spring mechanisms of the clocks, and loss of motion-picture record in exposure or development. With reference to the evaluation of gust data, the nominal threshold was about 2 feet per second. In making gust counts to this threshold, some gusts below that threshold have been included due to limitations of the procedure used. Thus, it will be noted that in some instances gust counts are given in table I although now corresponding gust velocities are listed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{experience}} of chronic {{patients with the}} care they receive, fuelled by the focus on patient-centeredness and the increasing evidence on its positive relation with other dimensions of quality, is being acknowledged as {{a key element in}} improving the quality of care. There are a dearth of accepted tools and metrics to assess patient experience from the patient’s perspective that have been adapted to the new chronic care context: continued, systemic, with multidisciplinary teams and new technologies. Methods: Development and validation of a scale conducting a literature review, expert <b>panel,</b> <b>pilot</b> and field studies with 356 chronic primary care patients, to assess content and face validities and reliability. Results: IEXPAC is an 11 + 1 item scale with adequate metric properties measured by Alpha Chronbach, Goodness of fit index, and satisfactory convergence validity around three factors named: productive interactions, new relational model and person’s self-management. Conclusions: IEXPAC allows measurement of the patient {{experience of}} chronic illness care. Together with other indicators, IEXPAC can determine the quality of care provided according to the Triple Aim framework, facilitating health systems reorientation towards integrated patient-centred care...|$|R
