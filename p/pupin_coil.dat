5000|$|The first {{recommendation}} for an electrical engineering department in Columbia came from Thomas Edison to President Barnard. Edison stated, [...] "Crocker and I maintained {{that there is}} an 'electrical science' which is the real soul of electrical engineering.'" [...] In the late 19th century, at Edison's suggestion, the Columbia trustees established a department of electrical engineering with two faculty members: Francis Bacon Crocker and Michael Idvorsky Pupin. Crocker was among the first presidents in the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Pupin was known for his invention of the <b>Pupin</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Mihajlo Pupin {{discovered}} {{a means of}} greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils of wire (known as <b>Pupin</b> <b>coils)</b> at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as [...] "pupinization").|$|R
5000|$|Michael Pupin, {{inventor}} and Serbian immigrant to the USA, {{also played}} a part in the story of loading <b>coils.</b> <b>Pupin</b> filed a rival patent to the one of Campbell's. [...] This patent of Pupin's dates from 1899. There is an earlier patent (1894, filed December 1893) which is sometimes cited as Pupin's loading coil patent but is, in fact, something different. The confusion is easy to understand, Pupin himself claims that he first thought of the idea of loading coils while climbing a mountain in 1894, although there is nothing from him published at that time.|$|R
