40|$|AbstractCarbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) were in-situ {{grown in}} carbon felts using ferric chloride as catalyst {{and natural gas}} as carbon precursor via thermal gradient chemical vapor infiltration (TGCVI). Subsequently, the carbon felts were densified to obtain CNT reinforced carbon/carbon (C/C) composites in the same furnace. Effects of CNTs on the microstructure and flexural property of C/C composites were investigated by polarized light microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and universal mechanical testing machine. The results of PLM observation and Raman analysis showed that CNTs have two-sided effects on the microstructure of pyrocarbon: the <b>pyrocarbons</b> in the region without CNTs show medium texture; while, in the region full of CNTs, the microstructure was low-textured or even isotropic though the TGCVD conditions {{would lead to the}} deposition of pure low texture <b>pyrocarbons.</b> Analysis based on stress–strain curves demonstrated that the flexural strength increased first and then decreased with the CNT content increasing. When the CNT content was 5. 23 wt%, the flexural strength was maximum and had a nearly 35 % improvement compared with pure C/C composite. Besides, after adding CNTs, the flexural modulus of the composites decreased and the ductility increased obviously, indicating CNTs can toughen C/C composites...|$|R
