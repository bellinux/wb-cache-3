5|$|Baeyertz's {{husband died}} on 6 March 1871 {{at the age}} of 28, two days after a {{shooting}} accident. She turned to the Anglican church to help her and she experienced a full conversion to the religion. She put her children into boarding school and became an evangelist, visiting jails and hospitals to spread the religion, as well as door-to-door <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> the Jewish areas of Melbourne. She did not manage to convert anyone, and ended up with her life threatened.|$|E
5|$|While the Social Gospel {{was making}} inroads within the denomination, the {{ministry}} of baseball player turned evangelist Billy Sunday demonstrated that Evangelicalism and the revivalist tradition was still a force within the denomination. Sunday became the most prominent evangelist of the early 20th century, <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> over 100 million people and leading an estimated million to conversion throughout his career. Whereas Stelzle emphasized the social aspects of Christianity, Sunday's focus was primarily on the conversion and moral responsibility of the individual.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E

60|$|Felix was surprised. He {{could not}} thus have {{discussed}} himself, {{even with his}} father; but he perceived that if Clement had no one else <b>to</b> <b>preach</b> <b>to</b> he would <b>preach</b> <b>to</b> himself, and that this anatomical examination was done in genuine sorrow.|$|R

5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Baeyertz {{joined the}} YWCA {{and was soon}} <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> large crowds. By 1879, she was the {{featured}} speaker for a campaign of sermons in Sandhurst, eventually converting 200 individuals. She then conducted a Christian mission to Ballarat, with crowds of 2,300 assembling to hear her talk. Emilia conducted a number of further missions around Victoria between 1880 and 1890. In 1890, she went to New Zealand to preach, {{before moving on to}} North America. She arrived in San Francisco in October 1890, and spent two years giving sermons in conjunction with the YMCA in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Boston in USA as well as Toronto and Ottawa in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} in Ohio {{and raised in the}} Lutheran faith. He moved to Kansas when he was 18 and embraced Seventh-day Adventism. He later {{attended}} college to become a licensed preacher. Eventually, Beilhart came to believe that it was more important to put faith into practice helping others so he left <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> study nursing and work in a sanitarium. He returned to Ohio in 1899 to start the Spirit Fruit Society, an intentional community based on his experiences, learning, and views. Beilhart led the group for nine years before he died of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1908. Beilhart's commune survived for another 22 years {{making it one of the}} longest surviving communes in America.|$|E

5|$|Coolsma left Cianjur in 1869 {{and went}} to Bogor, also a majority-Sundanese city. He found little success in <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> the European {{citizens}} of the city or converting the Sundanese. On 31 May 1869, he opened a school at his home, which provided a free education in both secular and religious studies. The first class had ten students, a total which grew quickly; at its peak, the school had 111 students. After a government-funded school was opened in 1872, most of the Sundanese students moved there to avoid the Christian teachings. The remaining students were mostly ethnic Chinese, few of whom converted.|$|E
5|$|In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which {{included}} among its provisions {{the creation of}} treaty ports in which Christian missionaries {{would be free to}} preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.|$|E
5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{spent the}} next five years <b>preaching</b> <b>to,</b> and {{converting}} the pagan inhabitants of Sussex, the South Saxons. He also founded Selsey Abbey, on an estate near Selsey of 87 hides, given to Wilfrid by Æthelwealh, king of the South Saxons. Bede attributes Wilfrid's ability to convert the South Saxons to his teaching them how to fish, and contrasts it with the lack of success of the Irish monk Dicuill. Bede also says that the Sussex area had been experiencing a drought for three years before Wilfrid's arrival, but miraculously when Wilfrid arrived, and started baptising converts, rain began to fall. Wilfrid worked with Bishop Erkenwald of London, helping to set up the church in Sussex. Erkenwald also helped reconcile Wilfrid and Theodore before Theodore's death in 690. The mission was jeopardised when King Æthelwealh died during an invasion of his kingdom by Cædwalla of Wessex. Wilfrid previously had contact with Cædwalla, and may have served as his spiritual advisor before Cædwalla's invasion of Sussex. After Æthelwealh's death and Cædwalla's accession to the throne of Wessex, Wilfrid became one of the new king's advisors, and the king was converted. Cædwalla confirmed Æthelwealh's grant of land in the Selsey area and Wilfrid built his cathedral church near the entrance to Pagham Harbour, believed to be what is now Church Norton.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Alma called him again <b>to</b> <b>preach</b> <b>to</b> the people. The last account in the Book of Mormon of Corianton is that he journeyed to a northern land to deliver provisions.|$|R
50|$|He preached twice each Sunday in Orange City {{and as the}} {{community}} grew and spread, he would journey {{three to four times}} a week to an outlying schoolhouse <b>to</b> <b>preach</b> <b>to</b> those who lived far from the church. Later, when churches organized in Sioux Center and Alton, he <b>preached</b> <b>to</b> these congregations until they received their own ministers.|$|R
25|$|In 1625 Fourier {{was charged}} with <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> {{the people of the}} Principality of Salm-Salm, which had embraced Calvinism. Within six months his gentle persuasion and efforts were rewarded with the {{re-establishment}} of Catholicism in the realm.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1780s, Rapp {{had begun}} <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> the Separatists, his {{followers}} in Iptengen, who met privately {{and refused to}} attend church services or take communion. As their numbers increased, Rapp’s group officially split with the Lutheran Church in 1785 and was banned from meeting. Despite warnings from local authorities, the group continued to meet privately and attract even more followers.|$|E
25|$|Several verses in the New Testament contain Jesus' {{predictions}} that the Second Coming {{would take place}} within a century following his death.

25|$|William Forbes Skene {{argued in}} 1837 that Pictish was a Goidelic language, the {{ancestor}} of modern Scottish Gaelic. He suggested that Columba's {{use of an}} interpreter reflected his <b>preaching</b> <b>to</b> the Picts in Latin, rather than any difference between the Irish and Pictish languages. This view, involving independent settlement of Ireland and Scotland by Goidelic people, obviated an Irish influence {{in the development of}} Gaelic Scotland and enjoyed wide popular acceptance in 19th century Scotland, but is no longer given credence.|$|E
