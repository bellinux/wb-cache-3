40|$|Multi-pantograph {{operation}} is a convenient and {{efficient way to}} operate railway rolling stock, but the influence between the pantographs makes the system more sensitive and vulnerable than a single-pantograph system. When a train passes through special sections or in an emergency condition, {{it is necessary to}} lower one or all of the pantographs and then raise them up again. In these circumstances, the motion of the pantographs can introduce a sudden impact to the catenary that may change the pantograph configuration, then disrupting the dynamic stability. To address the dynamic performance during pantograph raising and lowering, a numerical study on multi-pantograph {{operation is}} carried out with help of a 3 D pantograph-catenary finite element (FE) model under the conditions: up to three pantographs, various pantograph raising/lowering orders and different operating positions in a span. The results show that the leading pantograph is little influenced by the raising and lowering movement of any pantograph behind it. However, any trailing pantograph is significantly affected by any operation taking place ahead of it. The dynamic performance of the system depends on the <b>pantograph</b> <b>spacing</b> distance and the operational speed, but is little affected by the operating position in a span. To study auxiliary-pantograph operation where the leading pantograph works as an auxiliary pantograph, this paper shows how an optimal setting of the leading pantograph benefits the trailing pantograph and suggests specifying the speed where the leading pantograph gets into or out of service to avoid disruption.

40|$|In-line tests {{carried out}} on the Italian train called “Minuetto” showed that when two {{pantographs}} are used in order to run two coupled trains, the second pantograph suffers disturbances caused on the catenary by {{the passage of the}} first pantograph, which deteriorates the quality of current collection and causes interferences with the codified current signalling system, based on codified blocks of 50 Hz current circulating in the tracks. This phenomenon is heavily dependent on the distance between the pantographs, the catenary mechanical features, the vehicle speed, the filtering system features and the train electrical drive control.

40|$|Multi-pantograph {{operation}} allows several short electric {{multiple unit}} (EMU) trainsets to be coupled or decoupled {{to adapt to}} daily or seasonal passenger-flow variation. Although this is a convenient and efficient way to operate rolling stock and use railway infrastructure, pantographs significantly influence each other and even significantly change the dynamic behaviour of the system compared to single-pantograph operation in the same condition. The multi-pantograph system is more sensitive and vulnerable than the single-pantograph system, especially at high operational speeds or with <b>pantographs</b> <b>spaced</b> at short distances. Heavy oscillation in the system can result in low quality of current collection, electromagnetic interference, severe wear on the contact surfaces or even structural damage. The mechanical interaction between the pantograph and the catenary {{is one of the}} key issues which limits the maximum operational speed and decides the maintenance cost.     Many researchers have paid a lot of attention to the single-pantograph operation and have made great progress on system modelling, optimizing, parameter studies and active control. However, how the pantographs in a train configuration affect each other in multi-pantograph operation and which factors limit the number of pantographs is not fully investigated. Nowadays, to avoid risking operational safety, there are strict regulations to limit the maximum operational speed, the maximum number of pantographs in use, and the minimum <b>spacing</b> distance between <b>pantographs.</b> With the trend of high-speed railways, there are huge demands on increasing operational speed and shortening <b>spacing</b> distance between <b>pantographs.</b> Furthermore, it is desirable to explore more practical and budget-saving methods to achieve higher speed on existing lines without significant technical modification.     In addition to a literature survey of the dynamics of pantograph-catenary systems, this thesis carries out a numerical study on multi-pantograph operation based on a three-dimensional pantograph-catenary finite element (FE) model. In this study, the relationship between dynamic performance and other parameters, i. e. the number of pantographs in use, running speed and the position of the pantographs, are investigated. The results show that the <b>spacing</b> distance between <b>pantographs</b> is the most critical factor and the trailing pantograph does not always suffer from deterioration of the dynamic performance. By discussing the two-pantograph operation at short spacing distances, it is found that a properly excited catenary caused by the leading pantograph and the wave interference between pantographs can contribute to an improvement on the trailing pantograph performance. To avoid the additional wear caused by poor dynamic performance on the leading pantograph and achieve further improvement at high speeds, it is suggested to use the leading pantograph as an auxiliary pantograph, which does not conduct any electric current and optimize the uplift force on the leading pantograph. After a brief discussion on some system parameter deviations, it is shown that a 30 % of speed increase should be possible to achieve while still sustaining a good dynamic performance without large modifications on the existing catenary system.
