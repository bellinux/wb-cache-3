5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and embryo transfer are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final <b>product.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the structural interrelationships among consumer characteristics, shopping attitude, and shopping intention based on Fishbein and Azjen 2 ̆ 7 s (1975) Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Study objectives were: (1) to identify characteristics of consumers who shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, (2) to propose theoretical models explaining consumers 2 ̆ 7 shopping for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, and (3) to empirically test the proposed models using {{a random sample of}} subjects who shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet.;Findings from the present study indicated that consumer characteristics, the product, and the Website were all important factors to predict consumers 2 ̆ 7 intention to shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet. Individuals with certain characteristics of Cultural Creatives (Ray 2 ̆ 6 Anderson, 2000) appear to be an important target market for selling cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet. While both product quality and Website attributes were important factors influencing a positive attitude toward shopping for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, only consumers 2 ̆ 7 positive beliefs about the Website significantly influenced their intention to shop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet. Specifically, merchandising, such as keeping products in stock and offering competitive prices, appeared to be a critical factor in determining customers 2 ̆ 7 shopping intention. This study also revealed that consumers 2 ̆ 7 utilitarian shopping value appears to be more dominant than hedonic shopping value when they shop for cultural <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet. For consumers with utilitarian shopping value, all aspects of the Website, information quality, merchandising, interface, and protection were important to make their shopping trip successful. Finally, proposed models with good fit and significant paths between belief structures and intention supported the effectiveness of the extended TRA in the context of cultural <b>product</b> shopping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet.

25|$|While the Oilers found instant {{success in}} the AFL, other teams did not fare as well. The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans {{struggled}} {{on and off the}} field during their first few seasons in the league. Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses in their first season. Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the San Francisco Bay Area—which already had an established NFL team (the San Francisco 49ers)—but the <b>product</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field was also to blame. After winning six games in their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons. Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did little good. They participated in another such draft in 1962.|$|E

25|$|A similar argument. with quaternions {{replacing}} the complex numbers, shows uniquess for the symplectic group, which corresponds to Hermitian matrices over R. This can also been see more directly by using complex structures. A complex structure is an invertible operator J with J2 = −I. preserving the symplectic form B and such that −B(Jx,y) {{is a real}} inner product. The symplectic group acts transitively on complex structures by conjugation. Moreover, the subgroup commuting with J is naturally identified with the unitary group for the corresponding complex inner product space. Uniqueness follows by showing that any compact subgroup K commutes with some complex structure J. In fact, averaging over Haar measure, there is a K-invariant inner <b>product</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underlying space. The symplectic form yields an invertible skew-adjoint operator T commuting with K. The operator S = −T2 is positive, so has a unique positive square root, which commutes with K. So J = S−1/2T, the phase of T, has square −I and commutes with K.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} two {{prominent}} efforts to establish a major professional football league outside the NFL's auspices since the USFL's lawsuit, neither of which has resulted in lawsuits or antitrust challenges. In 2001, NBC, shut out of its TV contract with pro football {{for the first time}} since the 1960s, formed the XFL as a joint venture with the World Wrestling Federation. The league played one short season, during the winter, and emphasized entertainment value over top-flight competition. Amid rapidly declining interest and viewer disappointment in the product, the XFL shut down. The United Football League sought to create a parallel pro league in 2009; the UFL managed to put a respectable <b>product</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field but was shut out in its efforts to secure the paying television contract that was required to make the league's finances viable, and amid massive financial losses it played its last games in 2012, by which point the league was unable to draw fans or pay its players.|$|E
25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same <b>product</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E
