40|$|Introduction: Lipomas of {{the larynx}} are very rare benign lesions; macroscopically, they {{resemble}} retention cysts, so their diagnosis is usually made after surgery.   Case Report: A rare case of pediatric <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> Lipoma in an 11 -year-old boy is explained. The mass was mobile, soft, without fluctuation or pulsation. CT scan revealed a 5. 7 cm cervical fat density with regional lymphadenopathy. After lateral neck incision, a mass located deep in the carotid artery, which {{was attached to the}} larynx and which extended to the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space,</b> was excised completely. Pathologic evaluation revealed Lipoma without any evidence of malignant cells present.   Conclusion:  This rare differential diagnosis for neck masses in pediatric population should be considered. ...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent {{laryngeal}} nerve paralysis {{represents a}} major complication in oesoph-ageal cancer surgery. Nerve-muscle transplantation to the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> after resection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve with the ansa cervicalis (AC) has recently become the procedure of choice. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the anatomical variations of AC in order to avoid iatrogenic injuries and facilitate sur-gical procedures. We examined 100 adult human formalin-fixed cadavers. The ansa cervicalis showed a great degree of variation regarding origin and distribu-tion. The origin of the superior root of AC was found to be superior to the digas-tric muscle in 92 % of the cases. Its vertical descent was found to be superficial t...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The T-classification has {{shortcomings}} in {{the prediction of}} local outcome of glottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated by definitive radiation therapy. In this regard, the value of several CT-derived tumour parameters as predictors of local outcome was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pretreatment CT studies of 119 patients with glottic SCC (T 1, n= 61; T 2, n= 40; T 3, n= 14; T 4, n= 4) treated with curative intent by radiation therapy were reviewed for tumoral involvement of specific laryngeal anatomic subsites (including laryngeal cartilages). Tumour volume was calculated with the summation-of-areas technique. Actuarial (life-table) statistical analysis was done {{for each of the}} covariates; multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: In the actuarial analysis tumour volume was significantly correlated with local recurrence rate (P= 0. 0062). Involvement of the cricoid cartilage (P= 0. 0052), anterior commissure (P= 0. 0203), subglottis (P= 0. 0481) and preepiglottic space (P= 0. 0134) and degree of involvement of the true vocal cord (P= 0. 0441) and <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> {{at the level of the}} true vocal cord (P= 0. 0002) were also significantly correlated with local recurrence rate. In the multivariate analysis, only degree of involvement of the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> (at the level of the true vocal cord) (P= 0. 0001) and preepiglottic space (P= 0. 02) were found to be independent predictors of local recurrence. The T-category was significantly correlated with local outcome in the actuarial analysis (P= 0. 0001), but not in the multivariate analysis (P= 0. 5915). CONCLUSIONS: Several CT-derived parameters are powerful predictors of local outcome in glottic cancer treated with radiation therapy; some of these parameters are stronger linked to the local control rate than the T-classification. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cross-sectional imaging with CT, MRI {{and more}} {{recently}} PET CT plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic diagnostic and staging of laryngeal neoplasms and {{in the evaluation of}} the operated or irradiated larynx. Adequate interpretation of the CT, PET CT and MR images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality. In addition, one {{should be aware of the}} implications of imaging for staging and treatment. Both CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the preepiglottic and <b>paraglottic</b> <b>spaces,</b> subglottic region and cartilage. The high negative predictive value of both CT and MRI allows a relatively reliable exclusion of neoplasm cartilage invasion. The specificity of both CT and MRI is, however, moderately high and both methods may, therefore, overestimate the extent of tumor spread. However, recent investigations have shown that the specificity of MRI may be significantly improved by using new diagnostic criteria which allow differentiation of tumor from peritumoral inflammation in many instances. Both cross-sectional imaging methods also significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy. In the presence of a submucosal mass, CT and MRI play a key role for the diagnosis, as they may characterize the lesion, reliably depict its submucosal extent and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies which allow the definitive histological diagnosis. Cross-sectional imaging also plays a key role in the evaluation of laryngoceles, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and fractures...|$|R
40|$|Hibernoma is {{an unusual}} tumour of brown adipose tissue. Brown adipose tissue is common in {{mammalian}} hibernating animals and acts as a thermogenic organ. A first case of hibernoma was reported in 1906 by Merkel. This tumour usually arises in the back, shoulder region, mediastinum, retroperitoneum and in the neck. The neck location of hibernomas is rare and only 18 cases of cervical hibernoma {{have been reported in}} the English literature. A 48 -year-old male with hoarseness and soft voice, present for 8 months, showed a lesion involving the anterior part of the right vocal fold, with no impaired mobility. This is the first case to be reported of laryngeal hibernoma located in a vocal fold, originating from the white fat tissue of the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space.</b> Moreover, this report could be evidence of the development of hibernoma from white adipose tissue...|$|E
40|$|Acinic cell {{carcinoma}} (ACC) {{is a rare}} tumor generally involving the parotid gland and infrequently the minor salivary glands {{with the potential for}} both local recurrence and metastatic spread when tracked for decades. The biological behavior of ACC cannot be predicted on the basis of histological features, and surgical stage is still the best predictor of clinical outcome. Only 5 cases of ACC of the larynx {{have been reported in the}} English literature. The authors present a case of a rare transglottic ACC in a 74 -year-old woman. At admission, a submucosal mass involving the left arytenoid and adjacent aryepiglottic fold was noted. A CT scan of the head and neck region showed a mass of the left hemilarynx involving the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> and extending from the aryepiglottic fold to the sinus piriformis. Definitive histopathological examination showed an ACC with a large amount of clear cells. The patient was treated by radiotherapy alone (66 Gy in 7 weeks) with complete remission...|$|E
40|$|Supracricoid {{vertical}} hemipharyngolaryngectomy is {{a conservative}} surgical procedure which provides excellent local control of the disease without harming the laryngeal function. It is indicated in cases of malignant invasive tumors of the pyriform sinus (invasive squamous cell carcinomas) staged T 1 to T 3. The basic contraindications include old aged patients, significant pulmonary disease that leads to respiratory failure, invasion of the preepiglottic and/or <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space,</b> invasion of {{the apex of the}} pyriform sinus or the thyroid cartilage, invasion of the retrocricoid region or the posterior pharyngeal wall beyond the midline and invasion of the base of the tongue. The results of the long term follow up in our series, as well as in other surgical series of foreign institutions show that supracricoid hemipharyngolaryngectomy appears to be more effective regarding the local control of the disease, compared with radiotherapy or other conservative surgical procedures. Besides, the preservation of the larynx provides the patients with a better quality of life. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of review: Transoral laser {{microsurgery}} (TLM) is widely acknowledged to offer several advantages {{in the treatment}} of early and selected intermediate-advanced laryngeal cancers. Nevertheless, a number of issues are still under debate. The purpose of this review is to discuss the reasonable limits for TLM in laryngeal cancer to highlight its most appropriate and reproducible indications, putting this therapeutic tool in the right perspective within a comprehensive frame of alternative treatment strategies such as open partial laryngectomies and nonsurgical organ preservation protocols. Recent findings: Inadequate laryngeal exposure, anterior commissure involvement in the cranio-caudal plane (T 2), invasion of the posterior <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> with arytenoid fixation, massive infiltration of the preepiglottic space, and even minor thyroid cartilage erosion (T 3) represent the most controversial applications of TLM in management of glottic and supraglottic cancer. Summary: Published oncological results appear to be satisfactory when TLM is applied to T 1 -T 2 and accurately selected T 3 glottic and supraglottic cancers with favourable exposure. Caution should be used for more advanced tumours...|$|E
40|$|Glottis is {{a medium}} {{level of the}} larynx, {{involving}} the vocal cords, vocal process of arytenoid cartilage, and the anterior and posterior commissures. This region of heterogeneous histomorhological structure has specific characteristics: the internal striated muscles, the outer and inner perichondrium, atypical intra-cartilaginous areas of ossification, and unusual muscular insertion to cartilage. Microtomy of 3 thick successive sections was performed {{at the level of}} the upper surface of vocal cords. Standard histological staining methods were used. Microphotographs were taken by light microscope under different magnification along with histomorphometric measurements. Cancer spread is partially restricted by anatomic barriers: vocal ligament and tendon of the anterior commissure, and subsequently by the elastic cone. Easier tumor extension may be due to absence of the internal perichondrium and ossification of thyroid cartilage. Microvascularization of the anterior commissure is significant for tumor spread in glottis and <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space.</b> The role of commissural lymph network in local spread of the cancer is completely vague. It is certain that there are causes, still unrecognized, which have an effect on the pathways and direction of malignant tumor spread...|$|E
40|$|Teflon {{injection}} {{has been}} used for vocal fold medialization following paralysis. Recently, numerous articles have discussed the complications of Teflon injection, including overinjection, airway obstruction, Teflon granuloma, and an abnormal mass effect creating a decreased vibratory character of the true vocal fold. Multiple techniques for Teflon removal have been described. This report details our experience with complete Teflon granuloma removal via a lateral laryngotomy under local anesthesia. Micro-scopic dissection of the entire granuloma and the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> was accomplished in all patients. Due to extensive destruction caused by the granuloma, the vocal ligament was resected in 3 patients; it was partially resected and reanastomosed in 1 case, and spared in 6 patients. Laryngeal reconstruction was accomplished with an inferiorly based sternohyoid muscle rotation flap and ary-tenoid adduction. Effortful speech secondary to pressed vocal quality resolved in all patients. Near-normal to normal vocal quality was obtained in 4 patients, with the average "voice desirability " improving 60 % and the effective glottic width increasing 29 %. Factors that contributed to a successful outcome included noninvolvement of the vocal ligament and sparing of the mucosal cover. KEY WORDS- granuloma, laryngotomy. Teflon...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to review {{currently}} used imaging protocols for the evaluation of pathologic conditions of the larynx and hypopharynx, to describe key anatomic structures in the larynx and hypopharynx that are relevant to tumor spread and to discuss the clinical role of Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and PET CT in the pretherapeutic workup and posttherapeutic follow-up of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of this region. A detailed discussion of the characteristic neoplastic submucosal invasion patterns, including extension to the preepiglottic space, <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> and laryngeal cartilages and the implications of imaging for tumor staging and treatment planning is provided. The present article also reviews less common tumors of this region, such as chondrosarcoma, lymphoma, minor salivary gland tumors and lipoma. As the majority of non-neoplastic conditions do not require imaging the role of CT and MRI is discussed in some particular situations, such as to delineate cysts and laryngoceles, abscess formation in inflammatory conditions, to evaluate laryngeal and hypopharyngeal involvement in granulomatous and autoimmune diseases, and to evaluate the extent of laryngeal fractures due to severe blunt trauma...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Clinical staging is {{the most}} {{important}} time in management of glottic cancer in early stage (I-II). We have conducted a prospective study to evaluate if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more accurate than computed tomography (CT) about tumoral extension, to exactly choose the most appropriate surgical approach, from organ preservation surgery to demolitive surgery. Materials and Methods. This prospective study was conducted on 26 male patients, with suspected laryngeal neoplasia of glottic region. The images of MRI and CT were analyzed to define the expansion of glottic lesion to anterior commissure, laryngeal cartilages, subglottic and/or supraglottic site, and <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space.</b> The results of MRI and CT were compared {{with each other and with}} the pathology report. Results. CT accuracy was 70 % with low sensitivity but with high specific value. MRI showed a diagnostic accuracy in 80 % of cases, with a sensitivity of 100 % and high specificity. Statistical analysis showed that MRI has higher correlation than CT with the pathology report. Conclusion. Our study showed that MRI is more sensitive than CT in the preoperative staging of early glottic cancer, to select exactly the eligible patients in conservative surgery of the larynx, as supracricoid laryngectomy and cordectomy by CO 2 laser...|$|E
40|$|Subtotal {{laryngectomy}} with cricohyoidopexy (CHP) {{results in}} a satisfactory cure rate in selected T 1 b, T 2, and T 3 supraglottic and glottic cancers. The clinical, oncologic, and functional results {{of this type of}} surgery have led to an ever-increasing number of patients undergoing this procedure. This study involved 70 patients operated on from 1984 to 1993 using this surgical procedure. This report also discusses the clinical (cTNM) and pathologic (pTNM) classifications of CHP cases. Fifty-two of these patients were evaluated after a follow-up of more than 3 years. Lymph node treatment protocol comprised 51 functional ipsilateral neck dissections (FNDs), 9 bilateral FNDs, 1 radical ipsilateral dissection, and 1 radical ipsilateral and contralateral FND. There were 6 recurrences (5 local, 1 neck); after CHP physiologic deglutition was recovered in most of the patients (95. 5 %), and all but 6 (92 %) mere decannulated. Results were excellent after phoniatric rehabilitation. This surgical procedure may be indicated for selected laryngeal cancers and allows for the preservation of laryngeal functions even when the neoplastic lesions are advanced. However, care must be taken when evaluating the infiltration of the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space,</b> as that infiltration represents the main cause of failure in this type of surgery...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} several CT-derived tumor parameters as predictors of local outcome of supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma treated by definitive radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The pretreatment CT studies of 103 patients with supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma were reviewed for tumoral involvement of specific laryngeal anatomic subsites and extralaryngeal tumor spread. After redigitizing the films, tumor volume was calculated with the summation-of-areas technique. Mean follow-up time was 3. 4 years. Actuarial statistical analysis of local and locoregional outcome was done {{for each of the}} covariates; multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS: In the actuarial analysis CT-determined primary tumor volume was significantly correlated with local recurrence rate (p < 0. 001). Degree of involvement of the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> {{at the level of the}} true vocal cord (p < 0. 05) and subglottic extension (p < 0. 001) were also significantly correlated with local recurrence rate. In the multivariate analysis, only degree of involvement of the preepiglottic space (p < 0. 01) and subglottic extension (p < 0. 01) were found to be independent predictors of local recurrence. Total tumor volume was the strongest independent predictor of locoregional failure (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: CT-determined tumor parameters are strong predictors of local and locoregional outcome of supraglottic carcinoma treated by definitive irradiation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{principles}} of open versus laser microsurgical approaches for partial resections {{of the larynx}} are described, oncologic as well as functional results discussed and corresponding outcomes following primary radiotherapy are opposed. Over the last decade, the endoscopic partial resection of the larynx has developed to an accepted approach {{in the treatment of}} early glottic and supraglottic carcinomas thus leading to a remarkable decline in the use of open surgery. Comparing the various surgical approaches of laryngeal partial resections, the oncological outcome of the patients, as far as survival and organ preservation are concerned, are comparable, whereas functional results of the endoscopic procedures are superior with less morbidity. The surgical procedures put together, are all superior to radiotherapy concerning organ preservation. Transoral laser microsurgery has been used successfully for vocal cord carcinomas with impaired mobility or fixation of the vocal cord, supraglottic carcinomas with infiltration of the pre- and/or <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> as well as for selected hypopharyngeal carcinomas. It has been well documented that laser microsurgery achieves good oncological as well as functional results with reasonable morbidity. However, patients with those tumours have been successfully treated by open partial resections of the larynx at medical centres with appropriate expertise. The initially enthusiastic assessment of study results concerning the efficacy of various protocols of chemoradiation with the intent of organ preservation for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas are judged more cautious, today, due to recent reports of rather high rates of late toxicity complications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Myeloid Sarcoma (MS) or Granulocytic Sarcoma is an {{uncommon}} laryngeal malignancy. It {{may arise from}} myelodysplastic syndromes, malignancy or de novo. Presentation in the larynx is rare and some may present with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) whereby the later may be asymptomatic. Case Presentation: A 44 -year-old South East Asian lady presented with a six months history of hoarseness, shortness of breath, reduced exercise tolerance, weight loss and laryngeal irritation. Symptoms progressed to coughing with liquids two months prior. On examination, she had a resting biphasic stridor and laryngoscopy revealed right immobile vocal cord with a firm right ventricle mass extending into the right <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space.</b> She was pale and haematology investigations revealed microcytic hypochromic anaemia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the neck and thorax showed thickening of the right false cord, true cord and aryepiglottic fold. A biopsy taken during endolaryngeal microsurgery (ELMS) confirmed myeloid sarcoma of the right ventricle and para glottic mass. Further investigation revealed a background of AML and she then underwent chemotherapy. Discussion: MS is a rarity with only nine reported cases between the years of 1954 until 2015. Immunohistochemistry and immunophenotyping are definite for diagnosis confirmation as MS cells often exhibit myeloperoxidase (MPO), lymphocyte common antigen (LCA) and CD 117 markers. MS is treated with are chemotherapy (either systemic or intrathecal), radiotherapy, surgical excision or in combination. Systemic chemotherapy has better efficacy and prognosis as compared to localised treatment of radiotherapy or surgical excision. However, there {{has yet to be}} a definitive chemotherapy protocol. Prognosis is poor with a 5 -year survival rate of 48 %. Conclusion: Although laryngeal MS is a rare phenomenon, early recognition is key and patients should always be investigated for an underlying myeloproliferative or dysplastic disease...|$|E
40|$|Important {{aspects of}} {{histological}} organisation and topographic {{relations of the}} pre-epiglottic space are not fully understood. This region was therefore reinvestigated in plastinated serial sections of 19 human adult specimens. The cranial part of the pre-epiglottic space is homogenously filled with adipose tissue and extends around the epiglottis in a horseshoe fashion. Therefore, the term periepiglottic space (PES) is a more accurate description of this region. The cranial border of the PES is constituted by the hyoepiglottic membrane, which extends between the epiglottis and the tongue, and the hyoepiglottic ligament. The ligament consists of a cranial fibre layer anchored within the lingual muscles, and a caudal layer attached to the hyoid bone. Anterior to the lingual surface of the epiglottis, both fibre layers become apposed to form a dense collagenous mass, which may stabilise the epiglottis during deglutition. Contractions of the infrahyoid muscles will be transmitted to the thyrohyoid membrane anterior to the PES by numerous collagenous septa which originate from the membrane and radiate into the muscles. In contrast, the pre-epiglottic adipose tissue is not connected to the thyrohyoid membrane. The caudal part of the PES is subdivided by two paramedian sagittal collagenous septa. They include a medial compartment bordered by the epiglottis posteriorly and the thyroepiglottic ligament inferiorly. The two lateral subdivisions of the PES extend between the glands of the vestibular folds and towards the aryepiglottic folds, but a distinct confining collagenous layer is absent there. Posterolaterally, the PES is separated from the <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> by the thyroarytenoid muscle and by a cranial extension of the fibrous sheet of the muscle. This collagenous tissue is often split into several layers and displays gaps which may facilitate the spread of malignancies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our {{aim was to}} {{retrospectively}} {{investigate the}} prognostic significance {{of the degree of}} contrast enhancement in tumors and its additional value in previously considered MR imaging parameters with regard to local control of laryngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment MR images of 64 consecutive patients (54 men and 10 women, 43 - 80 years of age) with supraglottic and glottic cancer were retrospectively reviewed on clinical and previously considered MR imaging parameters such as tumor involvement of specific laryngeal anatomic subsites, including laryngeal cartilages, tumor volume, extralaryngeal tumor spread, and, in addition, the degree of contrast enhancement. Clinical and MR imaging parameters were associated with regard to local control at 2 years by using the Cox regression model. "Local control" was defined as absence of primary tumor recurrence. RESULTS: When using a threshold of the mean average contrast enhancement of 77 %, the 2 -year local control rate in the groups of patients with a degree of enhancement below and above this threshold was 57 % and 70 %, respectively (P =. 3). Enhancement of tumor tissue in pre-epiglottic space (PES) was low, most probably due to its adipose tissue and poor vascular content, whereas tumor tissue involving <b>paraglottic</b> <b>space</b> (PGS) did enhance. Results of multivariate analysis indicated that the degree of contrast enhancement yielded the prognostic information (P =. 07) with 2 independent prognostic factors: primary tumor volume (P =. 007) and subglottic extension (P =. 002) with regard to local control. Using these previously mentioned 3 MR imaging parameters as potential risk factors, we defined 4 categories, resulting in the following local control rates respectively: 90 % for the group without risk factors, 73 % for the group with 1, 60 % for the group with 2, and finally 0 % for the group with 3 risk factors, which was significantly lower than the rates in previous risk groups (P CONCLUSION: PES has a lower degree of contrast enhancement than the PGS and may correlate with the worse outcome. Including a low degree of contrast enhancement as a parameter to primary tumor volume and subglottic extension may increase the predictive value of MR imaging for local outcome and may be helpful to identify a subset of patients whose tumors all recurred locally within 2 years after primary RT...|$|E
