50|$|SpectreRF {{added the}} Periodic Steady State and Periodic small-signal {{analyses}} to Spectre. The Periodic Steady-State or PSS analysis directly computed the periodic steady-state response of a circuit. The periodic small-signal analyses use the periodic steady-state solution as a periodically time-varying operating point and linearize the circuit about that operating point and then computes {{the response of}} the circuit to small perturbation sources. Effectively they build a periodically time-varying linear model of the circuit. This is significant as periodically time-varying linear models, unlike the time-invariant linear models used by the traditional small-signal analyses (AC and noise) exhibit frequency conversion. SpectreRF pioneered a variety of periodic small-signal analyses, including periodic AC (pac), periodic noise (pnoise), <b>periodic</b> <b>transfer</b> function (pxf), periodic s-parameter (psp) and periodic stability (pstb).|$|E

The {{operational}} role of the Antiproton Source has shifted to exclusively producing antiprotons for <b>periodic</b> <b>transfers</b> to the Recycler. The process of transferring the antiprotons from the Accumulator to the Recycler has been greatly improved, leading to a dramatic reduction in the transfer time.

At configuration time, the BA is given a list of process variables to scan along with their corresponding periods. This piece of information is known as the bus arbitrator table. In this paper we provide a comprehensive study on how to configure a WorldFIP bus arbitrator table (BAT), in order to guarantee that <b>periodic</b> data <b>transfers</b> are performed before their deadlines. The main contributions of this paper are the provision of both an algorithmic approach for setting the WorldFIP BAT (using RM and EDF) and a feasibility test to check a priori the timeliness requirements of the <b>periodic</b> data <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Simple and {{effective}} computation methods {{are needed to}} calculate energy efficiency in buildings for building thermal comfort and HVAC system simulations. This paper, which {{is based upon the}} theory of thermoelectricity analogy, develops a new harmonic method, the thermoelectricity analogy method (TEAM), to compute the <b>periodic</b> heat <b>transfer</b> in external building envelopes (EBE). It presents, in detail, the principles and specific techniques of TEAM to calculate both the decay rates and time lags of EBE. First, a set of linear equations is established using the theory of thermoelectricity analogy. Second, the temperature of each node is calculated by solving the linear equations set. Finally, decay rates and time lags are found by solving simple mathematical expressions. Comparisons show that this method is highly accurate and efficient. Moreover, relative to the existing harmonic methods, which are based on the classical control theory and the method of separation of variables, TEAM does not require complicated derivation and is amenable to hand computation and programming.

They are generated by coupled codirectional space-time harmonic pairs, and occur in space-time periodic media whose constituent materials exhibit specific dispersion. Excitation of {{a slab of}} such a medium with subluminal modulation results in <b>periodic</b> <b>transfer</b> of energy between the incident frequency and a frequency shifted by a multiple of the modulation frequency, whereas superluminal modulation generates exponentially growing frequencies.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} the subcritical dynamics of typical fluid–structure interactions is carried out by applying the linear non-modal operators theory combined with direct numerical simulations. The cases of thin panel exposed to subsonic and supersonic fluid flows and pipe conveying a fluid are considered. In {{order to make the}} problem tractable for the rather wide range of cases, simple pressure models are employed, where the relevant instability is essentially of modal-coalescence type. Transient energy amplifications, here termed optimal and global, are found, which exhibit low-frequency oscillations corresponding to the continuous extraction/release of energy from/to the fluid. The low frequency is always related to the spacing between the imaginary parts of the coupling eigenvalues, which represent essentially the non-normal part of the spectrum. This suggests that the <b>periodic</b> <b>transfers</b> of energy along the route to the instability can be predicted by a simple model of damped forced vibrations. Although the major findings are obtained with crude pressure models, the authors’ opinion {{is that most of the}} effects discussed in the paper should survive to the use of flow dynamics modeling based on full Navier–Stokes equations, at least at high Reynolds number flows...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{commercial}} buildings are intermittently operated in practice. The {{use of the}} Radiant Time Series (RTS) method based on the continuous air-conditioning operation could result in largely underestimated peak cooling loads, and inconsistent design. Hence, a new method is developed based on the RTS. The new method only needs one more step after the current RTS design procedure, using the overall <b>periodic</b> <b>transfer</b> coefficients that have computed in this procedure. The additional cooling loads generated by the new method well agree with the results form EnergyPlus simulations. Analysis results also show that the additional peak cooling loads largely depend on building types, orientations, window sizes, and operation periods...|$|E

30|$|We {{believe that}} our {{findings}} are important because they {{provide us with a}} better understanding of household spending patterns crucial for policy-making in developing migrant-sending economies that rely heavily on remittance inflows. Take, for instance, policies regarding remittances from the United States to poor countries. Thus far, these policies have been primarily focused on: i) lowering transactions fees, and ii) integrating immigrant populations into the formal financial (banking) sector with the expectation that cheaper and more secure money transfer mechanisms will increase remittance flows. Yet, to date, we know little about the optimal design of these policies. Would we do best encouraging and facilitating large lump-sum transfers? How about smaller, evenly spaced, <b>periodic</b> <b>transfers</b> 31 ? Will remittance-receiving households respond in one way to transfers that are predictable and in another way to transfers that are less predictable? And, if so, does this help us understand the expenditure patterns of remittance inflows in various emigrant-sending economies? Our intent has been to learn about the conditions under which remittances are more likely to promote asset accumulation. We {{believe that our}} findings suggest that the predictability of remittance income should be given full consideration in order to better comprehend how households spend remittances and, accordingly, in the design of policies that leverage the most out of remittance inflows into developing economies.|$|R

40|$|One {{potential}} bottleneck {{point in}} a multimedia server is the disk system. The capacity and sustained transfer rates for inexpensive disks have increased significantly in recent years, making it plausible to build a multimedia storage server from commodity hardware. However, currently available file systems were not designed for use with multimedia access patterns, which involve <b>periodic</b> <b>transfer</b> of large quantities of data with real time constraints. We compare the performance of several different methods of accessing the disk system on Solaris and FreeBSD. We conclude that the performance overhead of accessing data through existing file systems outweighs the convenience advantage, and that scheduling disk accesses to minimize seek times and reduce the variation in response time is important in providing peak performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Current design weather data {{recommended}} by ASHRAE and CIBSE {{may result in}} overestimated peak cooling loads. This is because solar radiation, and outdoor dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures selected for design conditions do not occur coincidently. Hence, the data cannot reflect the joint statistical distribution of these three weather parameters. Moreover, the peak cooling load largely depends {{on the characteristics of}} both weather and buildings. A statistical method has been developed for the rational selection of sequences of coincident design weather parameters in order to properly determine peak cooling loads. Overall <b>periodic</b> <b>transfer</b> factors responding to different periodic weather heat sources are first derived based on the radiant time series (RTS) method. This allows us to utilize the available thermal and optical properties of a building without the need for tedious regenerating these data. The <b>periodic</b> <b>transfer</b> factors are then equivalently transformed to z-transfer coefficients. The model has been applied to hourly weather records of 25 years in Hong Kong to generate the hourly cooling loads of buildings with any thermal lag. Sequences of coincident design solar irradiance, dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures have been rationally determined through statistical analysis of the computed cooling loads. Results indicate that horizontal solar irradiance computed with the method {{recommended by}} ASHRAE is always higher, 4 – 20 %, than the measured value in different months. The peak cooling load resulted from the traditional design weather data is always much higher, 12 – 50 %, than the results from the new design weather data. An unreasonably oversized air-conditioning system would cause high initial cost and unnecessary significant use in embodied energy. It would also deteriorate the part-load energy efficiency and the system management effectiveness. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
