It is to summarize an evolutionary document collection at current time supposing the users have read some related <b>previous</b> <b>documents.</b> In this paper, we propose a graph-ranking-based method. It performs constrained reinforcements on a sentence graph, which unifies <b>previous</b> and current <b>documents,</b> to determine the salience of the sentences.

40|$|Legal {{document}} drafting is {{an essential}} professional skill for attorneys and judges. To maintain stylistic and substantive consistency and decrease drafting time, new documents are often created by modifying <b>previous</b> <b>documents.</b> This paper proposes a framework for document reuse based on an explicit representation of the illocutionary and rhetorical structure underlying documents. Explicit representation of this structure facilitates (1) interpretation of <b>previous</b> <b>documents</b> by enabling them to "explain themselves," (2) construction of documents by enabling document drafters to issue goal-based specifications and rapidly retrieve documents with similar intentional structure, and (3) maintenance of multi-generation documents. The applicability of this framework to a representative class of judicial orders [...] - jurisdictional show-cause orders [...] -is demonstrated. 1 Introduction Legal problem solving subsumes a number of distinct tasks, including analysis of the legal consequences of actual o [...] ...|$|R
