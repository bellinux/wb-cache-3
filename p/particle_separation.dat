Finding data show that the particles are discharged from the central zone to periphery by diffusive transport in the zone of high centripetal accelerations. It is found that the central zone is the ejection effect zone on the paraxial flow and intense discharge particle zone. The concentrations distribution and distribution of fractional efficiencies are presented. Cyclone devices are a major element in the gas dusting systems in the production of energy, chemicals and other industries.

The method has been applied to separations of U 0 {sub 2 } particles from environmental particulate material. For this, an integrated method was developed for capillary electrophoretic separation, collection of separated fractions, and determinations of U 0 {sub 2 } and environmental particles in each fraction. Experimental runs with the integrated method on mixtures of UO{sub 2 } particles and environmental particulate material demonstrated enrichment factors of 20 for UO{sub 2 } particles in respect to environmental particles in the U 0 {sub 2 }containing fractions.

50|$|Sensor-based sorting, is an {{umbrella}} term for all applications where particles are singularly detected by a sensor technique and rejected by an amplified mechanical, {{hydraulic or pneumatic}} process. The technique is generally applied in the three industries mining, recycling and food processing and used in the particle size range between 0.5 and 300 mm.

50|$|Unlike peeler {{centrifuge}}s, the pusher centrifuge {{does get}} influenced by feed condition which {{need to be}} kept as constant as possible due to continuous product transport by pushing motion. However pusher centrifuge {{is one of the}} most competitive processes to peeler centrifuges due to its effective washing and dewatering of any continuous centrifuge processes.

50|$|Thus, {{the only}} type of nuclei that are longer lived and undergo proton or neutron {{emission}} {{are in the}} class of beta-delayed decays, where first the isospin of one nucleon is reversed (proton to neutron or vice versa) via beta-decay, and then if the <b>particle</b> <b>separation</b> energy is non-positive, the daughter nucleus will undergo particle decay. Most naturally occurring γ-sources are technically β-delayed γ-decay, so this concept should be familiar; some gamma-sources are α-delayed but these are generally categorized with other alpha-sources.|$|E
50|$|When {{considering}} whether a specific nuclear transmutation, a reaction or a decay, is energetically allowed, one only needs to sum {{the masses of}} the initial nucleus/nuclei and subtract from that value {{the sum of the}} masses of the product particles. If the result, or Q-value, is positive, then the transmutation is allowed, or exothermic because it releases energy, and if the Q-value is a negative quantity, then it is endothermic as at least that much energy must be added to the system before the transmutation may proceed. For example, to determine if 12C, the most common isotope of carbon, can undergo proton emission to 11B, one finds that about 16 MeV must be added to the system for this process to be allowed. While Q-values can be used to describe any nuclear transmutation, for particle decay, the <b>particle</b> <b>separation</b> energy quantity S, is also used, and it is equivalent to the negative of the Q-value. In other words, the proton separation energy Sp indicates how much energy should be added to a given nucleus to remove a single proton. Thus, the particle drip lines defined the boundaries where the <b>particle</b> <b>separation</b> energy is {{less than or equal to}} zero, for which the spontaneous emission of that particle is energetically allowed.|$|E
