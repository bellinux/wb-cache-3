50|$|Time-hopping (TH) is a {{communications}} signal technique {{which can be}} used to achieve anti-jamming (AJ) or low probability of intercept (LPI). It can also refer to pulse-position modulation, which in its simplest form employs 2k discrete pulses (referring to the unique positions of the pulse within the transmission window) to transmit k bit(s) per pulse. To achieve LPI, the transmission time is changed randomly by varying the period and duty cycle of the <b>pulse</b> (<b>carrier)</b> using a pseudo-random sequence. The transmitted signal will then have intermittent start and stop times. Although often used to form hybrid spread-spectrum (SS) systems, TH is strictly speaking a non-SS technique. Spreading of the spectrum is caused by other factors associated with TH, such as using pulses with low duty cycle having a wide frequency response. An example of hybrid SS is TH-FHSS or hybrid TDMA (time division multiple access).|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the excitation <b>pulse</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency on the ultrafast charge recombination dynamics of excited donor-acceptor complexes has been explored both theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical description involves the explicit treatment of both the optical formation of the nuclear wave packet on the excited free energy surface and its ensuing dynamics.

It is shown that the variation of the <b>pulse</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency within the absorption band can significantly change the effective charge recombination dynamics. The mechanism of this phenomenon is analyzed and a semiquantitative interpretation is suggested. The role of the vibrational coherence in the recombination dynamics is discussed. An experimental investigation of the ultrafast charge recombination dynamics of two donor-acceptor complexes in valeronitrile also is presented. The decays of the excited state population were found to be highly nonexponential, the degree of non-exponentiality depending on the excitation frequency.

5000|$|Since the <b>pulses</b> of <b>carrier</b> have no audio modulation, a CW signal {{received}} by an AM radio receiver simply sounds like silence. In {{order to make}} the <b>carrier</b> <b>pulses</b> audible in the receiver, a beat frequency oscillator is used. The BFO is a radio frequency electronic oscillator that generates a constant sine wave at a frequency fBFO that is offset from the intermediate frequency fIF of the receiver. This signal is mixed with the IF before the receiver's second detector (demodulator). In the detector the two frequencies add and subtract, and a beat frequency (heterodyne) in the audio range results at the difference between them: faudio = |fIF - fBFO| which sounds like a tone in the receiver's speaker. During the <b>pulses</b> of <b>carrier,</b> the beat frequency is generated, while between the pulses there is no carrier so no tone is produced.

40|$|Recent {{simulations}} of continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) cochlear implant speech processors have used acoustic stimulation that provides only weak cues to pitch, periodicity, and aperiodicity, although these {{are regarded as}} important perceptual factors of speech. Four-channel vocoders simulating CIS processors have been constructed, in which the salience of speech-derived periodicity and pitch information was manipulated. The highest salience of pitch and periodicity was provided by an explicit encoding, using a <b>pulse</b> <b>carrier</b> following fundamental frequency for voiced speech, and a noise carrier during voiceless speech. Other processors included noise-excited vocoders with envelope cutoff frequencies of 32 and 400 Hz. The use of a <b>pulse</b> <b>carrier</b> following fundamental frequency gave substantially higher performance in identification of frequency glides than did vocoders using envelope-modulated noise carriers. The perception of consonant voicing information was improved by processors that preserved periodicity, and connected discourse tracking rates were slightly faster with noise carriers modulated by envelopes with a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz compared to 32 Hz. However, consonant and vowel identification, sentence intelligibility, and connected discourse tracking rates were generally similar {{through all of the}} processors. For these speech tasks, pitch and periodicity beyond the weak information available from 400 Hz envelope-modulated noise did not contribute substantially to performance.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{dynamical}} gain saturation, usually neglected for solid-state lasers, can contribute signi®cantly to the pulse-shaping mechanism in Kerr-lens mode-locked lasers. In particular, {{in combination with}} self-phase modulation it can cause red shifts and blue shifts of the laser spectrum. A control of the reciprocal gain and loss saturation rates using these shifts leads to improved mode-locking stability. Gain saturation (GS) strongly aects the mode-locking dynamics because it contributes to the competition between high- and low-intensity field spikes. In the presence of loss sat-uration, {{this leads to the}} formation of a solitary pulse, which saturates the gain and suppresses the laser noise [1]. Moreover, as will be demonstrated here, dynamical gain saturation is also an important pulse-shaping factor. It can contribute to the mode-locking dynamics in the sub- 100 fs region [2] and would be even more important for picosecond lasers. In combination with self-phase modulation (SPM), GS can cause a shift of the <b>pulse</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency {{from the center of the}} gain band. Since modern mode-locking tech-niques, e. g.
