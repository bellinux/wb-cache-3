25|$|Although Xeris {{spectrum}} {{does not}} have any symbiotic fungi, it often takes advantage of the fungal symbionts of other <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> species. A study of the reproductive strategies of Xeris spectrum showed that the females often lay their eggs on wood where other <b>wood</b> <b>wasps</b> of species with symbiotic fungi have already laid their eggs. This allows the Xeris spectrum larvae to benefit from the fungi. In addition, adult Xeris spectrum emerge from their holes at two different times: one group emerges in summer with the species of other <b>wood</b> <b>wasps,</b> while the other group emerges the next spring.|$|R

5000|$|The Anaxyelidae are a <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> family {{within the}} Symphyta, {{containing}} {{only a single}} living species, Syntexis libocedrii, (also called the cedar <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> or incense-cedar <b>wood</b> <b>wasp),</b> though the family has an extensive Mesozoic fossil record; this species is thus a [...] "living fossil". It has the remarkable behavior of ovipositing only in recently burnt incense-cedar (Calocedrus), red cedar (Thuja) or juniper (Juniperus); the wood is often still smoldering when the wasp is laying its eggs, and the larvae develop in the wood. It occurs from the mountains of central California to southern British Columbia, but is very rarely seen, except by firefighters.|$|R
40|$|IR-spectra of TMP and CTMP {{prepared}} from <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> and UF-bonded MDF {{made from}} <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> show characteristic differences. The typical band for carbonyl groups (C=O-groups) at wave number about 1740 cm(- 1) is strong in <b>pine</b> <b>wood,</b> but appears relatively weak in TMP {{and especially in}} CTMP made thereof. In UF-bonded MDF made from <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> the band at about 1740 cm- 1 is very weak compared to that in <b>pine</b> <b>wood.</b> Moreover, {{no significant difference in}} the IR-spectrum between TMP and CTMP made from UF-bonded MDF seems to exist. This is attributed to the fact that during thermo-mechanical pulping of UF-bonded boards hydrolytic degradation of the resin takes place enhancing the formation of ammonia which increases the pH-value of the fibres and leads therefore to chemo-thermo-mechanical pulping...|$|R

The confirmed vectors (Insecta: Cerambycidae - genus Monochamus) and potential vectors (Insecta: Curculionidae - genus Pissodes andScolytidae) of the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> nematode are presented within the framework ofits ecology. The range of potential host plants of the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> nematode inSlovenia, climatic conditions, and critical points for the entry and spread of pests are also given.

40|$|Anthracnose disease {{caused by}} Colletotrichum capsici {{is a major}} disease on red chili which causes great {{economic}} losses. Wood vinegar, {{as a result of}} condensation of smoke, can be used as bactericide and fungicide. The use of <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> vinegar is prospective for controlling anthracnose disease. The objective of this research was to study the potency of <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> vinegar in controlling anthracnose on red chili. In vitro test was carried out to measure the inhibition of <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> vinegar against the growth of mycelium mass and the germination of the conidium of C. capsici. The treatments were the concentration of the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> vinegar, i. e. 0, 1. 5, 2. 5, 3. 5, 4. 5, and 5 %, and a fungicide (2 % of antracol) as comparison. The results showed that the lower the concentration of the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> vinegar, the lower the inhibition of the mycelium growth. The highest inhibition of the mycelium growth (76. 1 %) was caused by 5 % of the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> vinegar, followed by 41. 04 % inhibition caused by 4. 5 % concentration.

There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we explain}} why the low gravity {{encountered}} on Mars or on the Moon and the low mass of the probes, landers and rovers that carry drilling devices limit classical drilling techniques. Novel boring solutions optimised in mass and power consumption are thus needed for space applications. Biologists have identified the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp,</b> an insect {{that is capable of}} "drilling" into wood to lay its eggs. A low mass and low power system, like an insect, capable of drilling into wood is of the highest interest for planetary drilling and terrestrial drilling alike. The general working principle of the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> drill ("dual reciprocating drilling") will be exposed and the potential benefits of imitating the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> for planetary drilling will be highlighted. Since the nature of wood is highly fibrous but the nature of extraterrestrial and terrestrial soils are not, it is necessary to adapt the <b>wood</b> <b>wasp</b> ovipositor to our target soils. A test bench to evaluate the influence of the different geometries and operational parameters was produced and is presented here. The dual reciprocating drilling experimental results obtained on this test bench are also highlighted. They should lead to a new and enhanced model and comprehension of dual-reciprocating-drilling...|$|R
40|$|Summary â Several {{methods were}} {{examined}} for extracting DNA from the woody tissues of Japanese black pine, including the general CTAB method which {{proved to be}} the most successful. To detect the <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> nematode, the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD) in <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> tissues, PWN-specific PCR was done using a DNA mixture obtained from 80 mg of <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> tissues and a single <b>pine</b> <b>wood</b> nematode as the DNA template. The results showed that nested PCR could amplify the ITS region specific to the PWN, even though the amount of nematode DNA was extremely small. Also, the PWN could be detected in diseased tissues of several Pinus spp. which had been inoculated with nematodes. The method described here can also be used as a simple and quick detection method {{for a wide range of}} wood-inhabiting pathogens...|$|R
