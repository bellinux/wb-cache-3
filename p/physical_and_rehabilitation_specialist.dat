MethodsThis is a cross-sectional descriptive study based on a structured and closed questionnaire. The study was carried out from October 2011 to May 2014. ResultsA total of 115 specialists from 19 countries completed the questionnaire. The mean characteristics of the <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> medicine (PRM) <b>specialists</b> who are also acupuncturists in Europe were: women (62. 6 %); mean age of 47. 91 years old; 4. 20 years of <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> medicine school <b>and</b> 2. 00 years of acupuncture training; 15. 03 years of mean time of clinical practice as <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> medicine <b>specialists</b> <b>and</b> 10. 42 years of experience as acupuncturists; 35. 65 % had a doctorate (PhD) degree, obtained at a mean age of 33. 55 years old; working in a public hospital (80 %); treating mainly neurological conditions (48. 1 %) and using mainly techniques such as kinesiotherapy (11. 81 %), orthosis (10. 40 %) and electrotherapy (9. 92 %). Acupuncture was applied by 32. 2 % of the participants mainly in musculoskeletal conditions (27. 38 %). A mean number of more than 20 patients a day were treated by 47. 04 % of the specialists, being 41. 8 % of the patients (adults and children). Significant {{differences were found between the}} variables, acupuncture and gender (Pearson's correlation Index = 0. 007). However, no differences were observed in relation to acupuncture and age, doctorate degree, years of clinical practice and workplace (all with P values > 0. 05). ConclusionIn the European area, <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> medicine <b>specialists</b> who are also acupuncturists are mainly female, middle-aged, with 15 years of professional experience, PhD holders, working in public hospitals, treating mainly neurological conditions with kinesiotherapy and acupuncture, and treating over 20 patients a day (adults and children) during a 7 h shift. Further epidemiological studies on PRM to provide more information regarding the real situation of this medical specialty and the possibility to open to Chinese traditional medicine techniques such as acupuncture are necessary...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give an {{overview}} of the Cochrane Collaboration, its development over the years, and its usefulness for <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> medicine <b>specialists.</b> After introducing the Cochrane Collaboration, we systematically analyzed all titles of the reviews in each of the 50 review groups. For ''Rehabilitation,'' we included not only exercise <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> therapy, but also all of the educational and pharmacological interventions aimed at supporting rehabilitation. The search was performed using Issue 2, 2007 of the Cochrane Library. We retrieved 138 completed reviews that dealt with rehabilitation interventions performed by 20 review groups. No umbrella reviews could be found at present. The most prolific groups in the rehabilitation field were: musculoskeletal (28 reviews), stroke (20), back (18), and the movement disorder group (13). The most discussed intervention was exercise (37 reviews), dealing with <b>physical</b> medicine (20) <b>and</b> pharmacological intervention (11). Six other reviews dealt with multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Low back pain treatment and stroke were the most investigated topics.

40|$|To look {{critically}} at {{the present}} reality of AIS (Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis) treatment and verify {{the hypothesis that the}} current prevalence of a single medical specialty could be creating distortions in patient care and/or cure. This is a multifaceted study comprising a review of the evidence on AIS, a bibliometric study of the general and orthopedic literature since Medline start, and two case reports. Evidence exists to support the efficacy of exercises, bracing and fusion (grade B, B and C recommendations, respectively), but in clinics exercises are generally ignored; braces are used with some criticism, while fusion is generally considered the only reliable treatment. The literature on AIS treatment prevails in journals of orthopedic surgery, and therapy papers focused on surgery have increased from 34 to 55 % over the past two decades. The two clinical cases show how an incorrect psychological approach to the patient and family, as well as inappropriate conservative treatments can have disastrous consequences for patients. Our results seem to confirm the initial hypothesis: The interest of the AIS treatment community (composed almost exclusively by orthopedic surgeons) has shifted toward fusion whereas research has increased, while conservative treatment is suffering a decrease in professional interest (and diminished research). AIS requires expert, committed evidence-based care, but other specialists totally devoted to conservative treatment, particularly (but not exclusively) <b>Physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> Medicine <b>specialists,</b> should enter the field to create better treating teams...|$|R

In this connection, this paper gives the readers of national and regional, and European PRM journals a complete overview of the European Journal of <b>Physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rehabilitation</b> Medicine (EJPRM), the official ESPRM journal, and a review of the papers published in 2008. MethodsThe evolution of the EJPRM {{in the last five years}} was analyzed, and the papers published in 2008 were systematically reviewed and classified by content and discussed. ResultsThe EJPRM is listed in PubMed and Current Contents; at now the unofficial 2008 Impact Factor is 1. 14, like the Impact Factor, also the independent SCImago Journal Rate and Cites per Doc (two years) have increased steadily since 2005. The EJPRM published 72  papers in 2008, with a well balanced coverage of different rehabilitation topics. The rejection rate is around 40 %; the review and publication times are 1. 2 and 10. 0  months, respectively. The published papers are presented here by topic, highlighting multi-journal initiatives (such as the EPRMJN and the Euro-American Focus with the American Journal of PRM), monographic Special Sections, systematic Cochrane PRM reviews, original papers and case reports, and other contents including the Internet Bookshelf.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} gastrointestinal risk {{profiles in}} patients with osteoarthritis who are currently being treated, or who are candidates for treatment, with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Methods: Patients with osteoarthritis treated by primary care physicians or <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> medicine (PRM) <b>specialists</b> in Belgium and Luxembourg were scored for gastrointestinal risk profile, low, moderate or high, based {{on the presence of}} gastrointestinal risk factors. These included advanced age, gastrointestinal history, comorbidities, medication use, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Use of gastro-protective agents (proton pump inhibitors) was also assessed. Results: A total of 190 primary care physicians and PRM specialists provided data on 885 patients. A large majority of patients were rated high-risk gastrointestinal (77. 8 %), with fewer moderate (19. 4 %) or low (2. 8 %) risk. The proportion of high-risk patients treated by PRM specialists was significantly lower than that treated by primary care physicians (64. 7 % vs 79. 9 %; p< 0. 0001). Only 37. 0 % of high-risk patients received proton pump inhibitors co-prescription with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Conclusion: A high prevalence of elevated gastrointestinal risk was found in this survey of patients with osteoarthritis who were current or candidate users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This appears to be insufficiently recognized, as preventative gastro-protective co-treatment was infrequently prescribed. Careful assessment of gastrointestinal risk factors should be made before prescribing non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with treatment tailored to the patient's gastrointestinal risk profile...|$|R
40|$|Rehabilitation {{is aimed}} at {{enabling}} people disabled by injury or disease to obtain their optimal <b>physical,</b> intellectual, psychological <b>and</b> social functioning. It requires an integrated team of health professionals using a bio-psycho-social model of health across the continuum of care. An aging population, emphasis on chronic disease management, and the move towards community living {{for people with disabilities}} requires the re-evaluation of rehabilitation services. The purpose of the <b>Rehabilitation</b> Gaps <b>and</b> Needs Assessment was to outline existing rehabilitation services, identify areas to improve care, and to provide the foundation for a strategic plan for rehabilitation within Eastern Health. Due to the tertiary role of Eastern Health, provincial input was sought and some recommendations made for other health authorities that would help improve services throughout the province. [...] Primary data was gathered from patients, families, managers, administrators, <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> providers using surveys, focus groups and key informant interviews. Secondary data was analyzed from provincial and regional health indicators and databases, previously completed human resources <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> reports, <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> reports from other provinces. The research process and results were directed by community stakeholders, managers and other experts in the field. [...] The results showed that, other than the physical facilities, existing inpatient and outpatient services at the L. A. Miller Centre were adequate overall. The greatest need identified was community-based rehabilitation; rehabilitation in homes, long term care facilities and personal care homes. Findings suggested {{that there is a need}} for inpatient restorative care for the elderly, for community-based management programs for people with chronic disease (cardiac, pulmonary, arthritis, obesity, etc.) and for vocational <b>and</b> cognitive <b>rehabilitation</b> for people with brain injury. Access to rehabilitation is polarized along rural and urban lines with rural areas having very limited access to inpatient, outpatient <b>and</b> community <b>rehabilitation.</b> We found that for people with rehabilitation needs, over half were readmitted to hospital within a year. There were 19, 418 alternate level of care days for rehabilitation patients in 2005 - 2006. Gaps in rehabilitative care cause impairment in patient flow through the system and ultimately limit the person’s ability to live independently at home. These substantial improvements in rehabilitation services would require an action plan over a period of 5 - 6 years. [...] There are ways to improve recruitment <b>and</b> retention of <b>rehabilitation</b> providers, including therapists, nurses <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> medicine <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>specialists</b> across the province. There are also methods such as reducing clerical duties and improving health record and patient information technology that have the potential to improve efficiency. [...] We found that gaps in the system can be improved through enhanced communication, patient navigation and development of a coordinated provincial rehabilitation network. Admission criteria designed to identify the most appropriate patients for a service, especially at the L. A. Miller Centre, causes confusion for health providers, patients and families and ultimately creates gaps. It is essential that we avoid a silo approach to care and ensure that patients and their families find the most appropriate rehabilitation service for them...|$|R

40|$|Compared {{with other}} specialties, {{the field of}} <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> {{medicine}} has not received the deserved recognition from clinicians and researchers in the scientific community. One {{of the reasons is}} the lack of sound evidence to support the traditional <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> medicine treatments.
