Primary data was collected {{through the use of}} structured questionnaire administered to randomly selected agrochemical marketers. All the marketers (100 %) were aware of the recently banned cocoa pesticides, however, majority still have the pesticides in stock. About 70. 6 % of the marketers in Osun state and 58. 8 % in Ogun state stated that they did not receive information on the banned pesticides from government agencies but through other channels. More than half of the marketers (52. 9 % in Ogun, 55 % in Kwara and 47. 1 % in Osun) strongly disagreed that government should place a ban on pesticides. Availability of banned pesticides in their stock, insufficient information from the concerned government agricultural agencies, and fear of short supply of approved pesticides are among the reasons proffered by the marketers for not supporting the ban of pesticides. Relevant government regulatory agencies should conduct a comprehensive inventory of pesticides offered for sale by the marketers of agrochemicals. There should be massive <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>programme,</b> and well-coordinated association for all the marketers of agrochemicals.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the assistance was to strengthen the plant quarantine capabilities to a fully operational level. A total of five consultants were utilized in plant quarantine; plant pathology; entomology and legislation. The needs of the plant quarantine service were assessed; the technical and legal aspects of the legislation were reviewed; a two week training course was provided and three study tours for senior officers were undertaken. The project provided inspection and treatment equipment for the new plant quarantine laboratory and offices at points of entry. In addition, a draft list of quarantine pests was drafted and pest surveys were carried out. Furthermore, a <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>programme</b> in plant quarantine was initiated. As {{a result of these}} activities, the plant quarantine service of Malta has been significantly upgraded. However, in order to ensure continual benefits from the assistance received, the recommendations of the project must be implemented without delay. Particular emphasis should be placed on the enactment of the draft Plant Quarantine Act and Regulations, the establishment of the proposed Plant Protection Board, and the creation of the position of Plant Quarantine Officer in the Plant Health Division to direct the plant quarantine service. In addition, pest surveys should be regularly conducted and staff training maintained. Facilities, especially the shed in Marsa, need to be renovated...|$|E
40|$|In Sri Lanka, {{majority}} of MV network runs through vegetation, hilly and polluted areas etc. Hence, {{it has been}} vulnerable to many faults caused by wayleaves, insulator flash over due to lightning, switching operations and the effect produced by pollution in the insulators etc. The insulator failure due to saline pollution in particular {{is a problem that}} increases failure significantly. The priority 33 kV feeder, Ratmalana Feeder - 9 which feeds power from Ratmalana GSS to Angulana PSS and Moratuwa PSS causes flashover of insulators frequently. While analyzing the outage details in the Ratmalana Feeder - 9, it has been noted that the most of the tripping are due to insulator flashover and wayleaves. During the monsoon period, the tripping rate is very high. The routing maintenance including washing of insulators in this line is being done once a year during the monsoon period. In this case study four possible solutions were discussed to overcome this problem. The solutions are composed of introducing UG cable, LYNX line, CC line and increased frequency of maintenance. Analyzing the economic parameters, implementation of UG cable is not a viable solution. The other three solutions are viable and increasing of maintenance frequency is the most viable. The implementation of LYNX line as an alternative route is practically a difficult task to maintain safety clearance to buildings and other lines as per CEB safety standards. Replacing existing conductor by CC is a better approach in this specific case. RUBY SAX CC is newly introduced CC which is equivalent to LYNX conductor manufactured by locally. In this case study, most viable solution is increasing of maintenance frequency. To minimize the trippings, it is recommended that maintenance to be done periodically and efficiently with skilled field staff and proper maintenance schedule especially during monsoon period. Secondly, vegetation management system should be efficiently adopted. Finally, the <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>programme</b> is to be implemented on vegetation management along the RF – 9. Therefore, introduction of efficient and effective maintenance programme periodically with increased frequency is the most viable solution which could be recommended by the findings of this study...|$|E

40|$|A {{protracted}} bloom of Karenia mikimotoi {{was present}} in summer 2005 along the northern half of the western Irish coastline. The onset of this bloom was identified in late May / early June. This event subsequently dissipated over the month of July and was succeeded by a bloom {{of the same species}} in the southwest in late July. The bloom was very intense and resulted in discolouration of seawater and foaming in coastal embayments. Major mortalities of benthic and pelagic marine organisms were observed and a complete decimation of marine faunal communities was reported and observed in several locations. Deaths of echinoderms, polychaetes and bivalve molluscs were observed in County Donegal and Mayo, while farmed shellfish and hatchery raised juvenile bivalve spat suffered significant mortalities along the Galway and Mayo coasts. Reports of dead fish and crustacea were received from Donegal, Galway, West Cork and Kerry. Karenia mikimotoi {{is one of the most}} common red tide causative dinoflagellates known in the Northeast Atlantic region, and is also common in the waters around Japan. Blooms of this species often reach concentrations of over several million cells per litre and these densities are often associated with marine fauna mortalities. Although cytotoxic polyethers have been extracted from cultures of the species, the exact mechanism of the toxic effect and resultant devastating damages yet remains unclear. It is known in the literature under several different names as the taxonomy and genetics have been studied. It is now known that previously reported names including Gyrodinium aureolum, G. cf. aureolum, G. nagasakiense and G. mikimotoi are synonymous with the current name given to the organism. The visible effects following the mortalities included noticeable quantities of dead heart urchins (Echinocardium cordata L.) and lugworms (Arenicola marina L.) deposited on beaches. Several species of wild fish were also found dead. The bloom coincided with a period of fine weather and tourists visiting the seaside were concerned about the safety of swimming in waters that were obviously harmful to marine organisms on this scale. A <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>programme</b> was mounted by the Marine Institute with several radio broadcasts, press releases and a website provided to give up to date pronouncements on the event. While there have been several instances of Karenia mikimotoi blooms reported in Ireland over the past 30 years, this scale of mortalities associated with the 2005 bloom were not previously observed. Recording the scale of this event was facilitated by satellite imagery while direct counts of the cells in seawater by the Marine Institute monitoring programme gave very useful information regarding the size and intensity of this event. The mortalities of marine organisms were documented from reports made by various observers and by Marine Institute field surveys. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|A little axe can {{cut down}} a big tree´ goes a well known Jamaican saying. It aptly {{describes}} the historical processes that have slowly eroded the island´s forest cover. Once called ´the land {{of wood and}} water´ by its original Taino inhabitants, Jamaica´s landscape underwent a massive change after the arrival of European settlers, who felled much of the forest for agricultural production. Even forest lands on hillsides and mountain slopes were cleared for growing crops. The forestry authorities are now grappling {{with the consequences of}} centuries of improper land use, including major environmental problems such as soil erosion, destruction of wildlife, and reduced river flows. Better land management is urgently needed to prevent further damage to the island´s forest resources. The Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agriculture has recognized that, in order to raise awareness of the need for sustainable forest management, it will have to fight the battle on two fronts - within the government and among ordinary Jamaicans, farmers in particular. Thus, the Trees for Tomorrow (TFT) project was launched which is turning foresters into geographic information system (GIS) experts and video camera-wielding extension officers. The TFT project, sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the government of Jamaica, is the Forestry Department´s most important effort to win {{the hearts and minds of}} Jamaicans. Initiated in 1992, one of its main concerns is to gather accurate and reliable data on the extent of forest cover and the exact location of forest boundaries, and how these have changed over time, in order to support national and local forestry plans. One of the project´s major achievements has been the creation of a GIS database that includes an inventory of forest lands and aerial photographs of the entire island. With this database, Forestry Department members can analyze land use patterns and identify areas that are under serious environmental threat. These areas may then be nominated for inclusion on the list of protected national reserves. The GIS also contains survey data on existing forest reserve boundaries, and the extent of encroachment, recorded by staff using Global Positioning System (GPS) devices. The TFT members´ surveying efforts have proven remarkably effective. Based on their GIS analyses the government strengthened its commitment to keep aside a significant proportion of the island as forest reserves. The island´s forest reserves occupy more than 111, 000 hectares, or over 10 % of the area of the island. Using TFT survey data, the Forestry Department is in the process of establishing a detailed forest protection system and a plan for patrolling these reserves. Forest Awareness Campaign Another component of the TFT project is the Forest Awareness Campaign, which was launched in 1998. The campaign aims to gain public support for the sustainable management of forests and watersheds, through exhibitions, information centres at agricultural shows, a website and educational broadcasts on national TV. As part of this initiative, the Department´s foresters and wardens have received training in a variety of extension techniques. Equipped with video cameras, overhead projectors and an array of informative posters, calendars and brochures, they now give talks at community meetings and organize training and work days for farmers. During these events, they provide farmers with free tree seedlings and technical advice on, for example, farm woodlots, agroforestry systems and soil conservation. A parallel schools programme aims at delivering forest protection and management messages to children of all ages. Their talks are enlivened by a series of educational videos. One example is the ´Forest Watch´ series, which features, in a news programme format, interviews with ´forest heroes´ - ordinary people who are doing a good job in the forestry sector. So far, these heroes have included a hill farmer who discusses soil conservation; the coordinator of an NGO who is developing a bamboo craft centre; and a landowner who has set aside part of his land as a sustainable pine plantation. The interest of local communities in the Forest Awareness Campaign´s agenda has led to the formation of three local forest management committees which provide the Forestry Department with feedback on its management of the forest reserves. Another measure of the success of the <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>programme</b> has been the positive response of the private sector to the Forestry Department´s appeal to join in the effort to restore and protect the island´s forests. The Trees for Tomorrow project has made a significant contribution to sustainable forest management in Jamaica. It has also helped the Forestry Department to improve its performance, capacity and credibility. Its innovative application of ICTs and environmental awareness raising techniques will benefit the country for years to come. mailto:slatham@forestry. gov. jm Susie Latham is an agriculture economist and TFT project member.

40|$|Disaster {{occurrence}} {{around the}} world {{has in the past}} few decades increased at an alarming rate necessitating an urgent need for mitigation strategies. As a result, research has indicated the usefulness of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in disaster risk management. Furthermore, ICT generally plays a critical role in all aspects of disaster risk management such as: early warning prediction; informing and circulating information relating to disasters to communities especially those at risk as promptly as possible and providing communication structures immediately after a disaster occurrence. As part of its planning and precautionary measures in responding to disasters, the City of Cape Town Disaster Risk Management Centre (CoCTDRMC) implements <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>programmes</b> across the city. The most acclaimed is an annual <b>awareness</b> <b>programme</b> especially for high school learners selected from various schools across the city. The learner participants are expected to act as change agents in their communities. In 2012, learners from twelve different schools across the city benefited from this programme. They were expected to educate families, friends, schoolmates and communities generally on the topical issues surrounding disaster risk management. This study uses a case study approach. Since the target audience of the programme is the youth, there is need to shift towards utilising ICT. The aim of this paper is to look at how eLearning as an ICT tool can be integrated in the implementation of <b>Public</b> <b>Awareness</b> Education <b>Programme</b> (PAEP), so as to target broader audience and create an increased capacity building across the City of Cape Town (CoCT). The examination considers providing tools that are accessible, dependable, resilient and flexible among the residents so as to reach the grassroots levels where communities are mostly affected. The paper considers a combination of tools so as to support behavioural change. Some of the research findings are that, the 2012 programme was very beneficial and successful. Henceforth there is need to target a broader audience, and although the CoCTDRMC does make use of some relevant ICTs, there is need for additional and upgraded technological resources. Also pertinent is the fact that eLearning can play a major role in making sure that a broader audience is reached if applied effectively. The findings of the research are of relevance to the CoCTDRMC and other municipalities across South Africa. The Centre for Innovative Educational and Communication Technologies (CIECT) at the University of the Western Cape can also use these findings to develop and implement an eLearning course for both employees of CoCTDRMC and other interested community members. This will guide them on how eLearning can assist in fostering a successful implementation of PAEP across the city. Web of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{critical}} that vector control pesticides are used for their acceptable purpose without causing adverse effects on health and the environment. This paper provides a global overview of {{the current status of}} pesticides management in the practice of vector control. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to WHO member states and completed either by the director of the vector-borne disease control programme or by the national manager for vector control. In all, 113 countries responded to the questionnaire (80 % response rate), representing 94 % of the total population of the countries targeted. Results: Major gaps were evident in countries in pesticide procurement practices, training on vector control decision making, certification and quality control of pesticide application, monitoring of worker safety, <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>programmes,</b> and safe disposal of pesticide-related waste. Nevertheless, basic conditions of policy and coordination have been established in many countries through which the management of vector control pesticides could potentially be improved. Most countries responded that they have adopted relevant recommendations by the WHO. Conclusions: Given the deficiencies identified in this first global survey on public health pesticide management and the recent rise in pesticide use for malaria control, the effectiveness and safety of pesticide use are being compromised. This highlights the urgent need for countries to strengthen their capacity on pesticide management and evidence-based decision making within the context of an integrated vector management approach...|$|R
