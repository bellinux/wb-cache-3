5|$|Research {{motivated}} by adhesive polyphenolic proteins in mussels {{led to the}} discovery in 2007 that {{a wide variety of}} materials, if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic pH, will become coated with a layer of <b>polymerized</b> dopamine, often referred to as polydopamine. This <b>polymerized</b> dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of melanin. Synthesis usually involves reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water. The structure of polydopamine is unknown.|$|E

When an interior slice of Betts's <b>polymerized</b> head is examined, the agents discover that his frontal lobe displayed signs of pervasive cancer. Mulder has Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) subject the slice to a Kirlian photography test; the final image shows corona discharge that takes the appearance of human shoulders.|$|E

50|$|Not all cyclic {{monomers}} containing an heteroatom undergo CROP. Ring size influences {{whether the}} cyclic monomer <b>polymerize</b> through this mechanism. For example, 4, 6 and 7-membered rings of cyclic esters <b>polymerize</b> through CROP. When considering the ring {{size of the}} monomer, the reactivity toward polymerization is dictated by the ability to release the ring strain. Therefore, cyclic monomers with small or lacking ring strain will not <b>polymerize.</b>|$|R

Propylene {{was first}} <b>polymerized</b> to a crystalline isotactic polymer by Giulio Natta {{as well as}} by the German chemist Karl Rehn in March 1954.

25|$|Generally it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the kMTs fiber (the bundle of microtubules bound to the kinetochore) is originated by the capture of MTs <b>polymerized</b> at the centrosomes and spindle poles in mammalian cultured cells. However, MTs directly <b>polymerized</b> at kinetochores might also contribute significantly. The {{manner in which the}} centromeric region or kinetochore initiates the formation of kMTs and the frequency at which this happens are important questions, because this mechanism may contribute not only to the initial formation of kMTs, but also {{to the way in which}} kinetochores correct defective anchoring of MTs and regulate the movement along kMTs.|$|E
50|$|Amino acids {{are natural}} {{monomers}} that <b>polymerize</b> at ribosomes to form proteins. Nucleotides, monomers {{found in the}} cell nucleus, <b>polymerize</b> to form nucleic acids - DNA and RNA. Glucose monomers can <b>polymerize</b> to form starches, glycogen or cellulose; xylose monomers can polymerise to form xylan. In all these cases and is thus not pliable, a hydrogen atom and a hydroxyl (-OH) group are lost to form H2O, and an oxygen atom links each monomer unit. Due {{to the formation of}} water as one of the products, these reactions are known as dehydration.|$|R
5000|$|Profilin binds to monomeric actin thereby occupying an actin-actin contact site; in effect, profilin sequesters actin {{from the}} pool of polymerizable actin monomers. However, profilin also catalyzes the {{exchange}} of actin-bound ADP to ATP thereby converting poorly <b>polymerizing</b> ADP-actin monomers into readily <b>polymerizing</b> ATP-actin monomers. On top of that, profilin has a higher affinity for ATP- than for ADP-actin monomers. Thus {{in a mixture of}} actin, profilin, and nucleotides (ADP and ATP), actin will <b>polymerize</b> to a certain extent, which may be estimated by the law of mass action.|$|R

25|$|Viscosity {{is a key}} melt {{property}} in understanding the behaviour of magmas. More silica-rich melts are typically more <b>polymerized,</b> with more linkage of silica tetrahedra, and so are more viscous. Dissolution of water drastically reduces melt viscosity.

40|$|While {{many types}} of enzymes have an actin fold, the ability to <b>polymerize</b> have always been {{thought to be a}} {{defining}} feature of cytoskeletal actins. Here, I have identified in vivo conditions that cause the yeast glucokinase, Glk 1 p, to form filaments. This polymerization is highly regulated and readily reversible. It has been argued that phosphotransferases evolutionarily predate actin-fold proteins, such as cytoskeletal actins that do not transfer a phosphate to a substrate. Therefore, the discovery that the actin-fold phosphotransferase, Glk 1 p, can <b>polymerize</b> argues that cytoskeletal actins evolved from metabolic enzymes that <b>polymerize</b> to form filament...|$|R
25|$|In {{somatic cell}} nucleus however we cannot observe any actin {{filaments}} using this technique. The DNase I inhibition assay, {{so far the}} only test which allows the quantification of the <b>polymerized</b> actin directly in biological samples, have revealed that endogenous nuclear actin occurs indeed mainly in a monomeric form.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random copolymer, and block copolymer. The {{comonomer}} is typically used with ethylene. Ethylene-propylene rubber or EPDM added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low temperature impact strength. Randomly <b>polymerized</b> ethylene monomer added to polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point {{and makes the}} polymer more transparent.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in the monomer table, many simple {{monomers}} {{are readily}} <b>polymerized</b> by this method, but most must be smaller ionizable species because they have to be able to go into the plasma state. Though monomers with multiple bonds polymerize readily, it is not a necessary requirement, as ethane, silicones and many others polymerize also.|$|E

40|$|Actin is {{abundant}} in the nucleus {{and it is clear}} that nuclear actin has important functions. However, mystery surrounds the absence of classical actin filaments in the nucleus. To address this question, we investigated how <b>polymerizing</b> nuclear actin into persistent nuclear actin filaments affected transcription by RNA polymerase II. Nuclear filaments impaired nuclear actin dynamics by <b>polymerizing</b> and sequestering nuclear actin. <b>Polymerizing</b> actin into stable nuclear filaments disrupted the interaction of actin with RNA polymerase II and correlated with impaired RNA polymerase II localization, dynamics, gene recruitment, and reduced global transcription and cell proliferation. <b>Polymerizing</b> and crosslinking nuclear actin in vitro similarly disrupted the actin-RNA-polymerase-II interaction and inhibited transcription. These data rationalize the general absence of stable actin filaments in mammalian somatic nuclei. They also suggest a dynamic pool of nuclear actin is required for the proper localization and activity of RNA polymerase II...|$|R
40|$|Cubic lattice {{models of}} dimerizing and <b>polymerizing</b> fluids {{have been studied}} within Wertheim's Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) matrix {{formalism}} to assess the adsorption behavior of such fluids at impenetrable, interacting walls. The OZ matrix formalism is relatively easy-to-handle for these cubic lattice models, due {{to the absence of}} liquid-like packing effects. The calculated concentration profiles have been compared to NVT-Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation of the <b>polymerizing</b> fluid employed a biased cluster move, based on the configurational bias scheme of Siepmann and Frenkel. The dimerizing fluid profiles are in nearly quantitative agreement with the simulation results, even for a fully associated, i. e., dimeric fluid. This is in contrast with the <b>polymerizing</b> fluid profiles that show important deviations from the simulation results, especially near interacting walls. It is therefore concluded that better approximations are needed in solving Wertheim's OZ matrix for the <b>polymerizing</b> fluid. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Historical uses of {{hydrogen}} chloride in the 20th century include hydrochlorinations of alkynes in producing the chlorinated monomers chloroprene and vinyl chloride, which are subsequently <b>polymerized</b> to make polychloroprene (Neoprene) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), respectively.
