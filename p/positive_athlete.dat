This article explores how athletes' bodies are regulated in practice, building on examinations of body surveillance in other contexts. Over 40 interactions occurring during body monitoring are analysed. Athletes, pre-emptively or following an explicit request, accounted for their body regulatory behaviours, also working to produce <b>positive</b> <b>athlete</b> identities. Failing to produce an account of improvement was interactionally problematic, making visible athletes' accountability to the institute to regulate their bodies.

The experiment reported here examined the memory of members of a girls high school tennis team who were primed with student or athlete identities and positive or negative emotions within each identity. The effects of identity and emotional priming were measured in the number of words recalled from each of four categories (positive student, negative student, <b>positive</b> <b>athlete,</b> negative athlete). Consistent with the hypothesis, an interaction between the identity prime and corresponding identity words remembered was narrowly found.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games, the lead author engaged in systematic reflection {{in an attempt to}} implement coaching behaviours and create practice environments that promoted athlete development (psycho-social and physical performance).

This project sought to examine coach-athlete interactions. Of particular interest were coach and athlete responses regarding the implementation of autonomy supportive coaching behaviours in a high context. Autonomy supportive coaching behaviours have previously been strongly associated with <b>positive</b> <b>athlete</b> psycho-social and performance outcomes, however, a paucity of research has examined its implementation in high-performance contexts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a concise {{resource}} for coaches, coach educators, and coaching scientists by reviewing three common approaches to coaching: the mastery approach to coaching; autonomy-supportive coaching; and the transformational leadership approach to coaching. The theoretical foundations, purpose, evidence base, specified behaviours, and translation into coaching and coach education of each approach are reviewed. Despite diverse theoretical foundations and variations in purpose, there is some overlap in the coaching behaviours prescribed by each approach. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support the use of the three approaches in coach education and this is detrimental to effective and evidence-based coach education. Efforts to integrate theoretical foundations are promising, and a comprehensive prescription of coaching behaviours based on an integration of the three approaches is possible. This approach can potentially lead to cumulative effects on <b>positive</b> <b>athlete</b> outcomes. Future research should elucidate the common and unique contributions of these approaches to athletes 2 ̆ 7 outcomes, and whether they differ by age, sex, type of sport, or competition level...|$|E

40|$|Using the {{theoretical}} framework of Self-Determination Theory (Deci, 1975; Deci, & Ryan, 1985, 2000; Ryan, & Deci, 2002) and Cognitive Evaluation Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 1991, 2000) {{it was hypothesized}} that a specific coach behavior, the provision of training plans in advance to athletes, could positively impact athlete intrinsic and self-determined motivation as well as other <b>positive</b> <b>athlete</b> attributes such as sport satisfaction, goal setting, vitality, and better preparation and planning for training. A mixed methodology approach was employed as both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained. The qualitative component involved the use of structured interviewing to understand better how individual sport athletes (N = 13) perceive their coaches in relation to their communication of training plans. For the quantitative components, a daily diary methodology was used with the goal of investigating how track athletes (N = 11) working with the same coach would perceive either receiving no training plan information over time as well as receiving detailed training plan information over two-week periods. Finally a correlational study (N = 130) using athletes from fourteen sports was undertaken to more clearly determine the links between coach communication of training plans, athlete perceptions of coach behavior, athlete self-determined motivation, and goal orientation. The qualitative component of the study revealed that athletes current motivation, the coaching tradition in a sport, and the development stage of an athlete's career all play a large role in the communication of training plans between a coach and athlete. The analyses of the daily diary study suggested some positive consequences may be associated with advance communication of training plans such as better athlete preparation and planning for training as well higher moods and motivation at practice. Regression results from the correlational study provide some clear links between advance communication of training plans, coach clarity of communication, and coach interpersonal behaviors related to athlete needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy. In turn coach interpersonal behaviors are highly related to athlete self-determination and other positive consequences such as a mastery goal-orientation and high vitality and sport satisfaction. These finding are discussed in terms of how they relate to self-determination theory, and more specifically Deci and Ryan's cognitive evaluation theory (1980, 2000).

40|$|Background: The {{goals of}} {{participation}} youth sports are {{primarily concerned with}} the facilitation of positive youth development as opposed to outright success. Consequently, there are strong theoretical and empirical links between sports coaching and athlete development. Transformational leadership behaviours, in particular, have been theoretically linked to positive developmental outcomes within a youth sport context, while the coach-athlete relationship is a key tool used by coaches who aim to teach life skills to young athletes. Outright team success {{has also been shown}} to correlate with important developmental variables such as a mastery climate and athlete perception of youth sports coaches. Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the relationship between coach transformational leadership behaviours, the perceived quality of the coach-athlete relationship, team success, and the positive developmental experiences of adolescent soccer players. Method: Cross-sectional data were taken from 455 adolescent athletes aged between 11 and 18 years. Each participant was competing in a local soccer competition that is classified as a participation sport. Thus, the theoretical focus is on developmental and skill gains. Each participant completed the Differentiated Transformational Leadership Inventory for Youth Sport, the Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire, and the Youth Experience Survey for Sport. Team success was measured by the total number of competition points accumulated during the season. Findings: The results show that coach transformational leadership behaviour and the coach-athlete relationship have a moderate positive correlation with developmental experiences. Team success has no relationship with overall developmental experiences. The best predictor of developmental experiences is a combination of coach transformational leadership behaviour and the quality of the coach-athlete relationship. The most influential leadership behaviours are individual consideration, intellectual stimulation, and appropriate role modelling. Discussion: Transformational leadership and the quality of the coach-athlete relationship may work synergistically to influence <b>positive</b> <b>athlete</b> outcomes within youth sports. Importantly, coaches who practise within the youth sport context are able to facilitate positive developmental outcomes from both team success and team failure by taking advantage of naturally occurring teachable moments. The best way to take advantage of these may be to engage in intellectual stimulation, individual consideration, and positive role modelling, in addition to facilitating positive, developmentally appropriate coach-athlete relationships. Future coach education programmes should incorporate relevant interpersonal and intrapersonal skills that allow youth sports coaches to engage in these behaviours. Longitudinal work is needed in order to make causal inferences between transformational leadership behaviour, the quality of the coach-athlete relationship, and positive youth development through sports...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{describe}} relationships between spirituality, Christianity and sport in history and present. In the first part the author underlines ritual origins of games and sports in pre-Christian cultures, especially ancient Greece and Rome. Revolutionary Christianity separated physical competition from religious ritual. In Christian author´s (Paul, Tertullian, Basil, John Chrysostom, John Cassian and John Climacus) games rating there is an obvious ambiguity They criticized an idolatric origin and connection with cults. Attributes typical for ancient athlete, self-discipline and perseverance, they remained <b>positive.</b> <b>Athletes</b> will and willingness to overcome obstacles gave some of the Fathers of the Church as an example for spiritual struggle, the term "athlete of Christ" had a strong significance in this context. The historical part contains Thomas´s Aquinas valuation of sport {{in the form of}} games. In discussion focused on the assessment of the sinful nature of games Aquinas submitted to the rule of reason. One of the key issues in contemporary theology of sport is introduced on the difference between the theological concepts of contemporary authors Rev Dr Lincoln Harvey and Rev Dr Robert Ellis. Harvey's theory, based on a systematic basis, based on the classical axioms of Christian doctrine. Sport is construed as a "liturgy of our contingency", set in the autonomous space that God lovingly gives his creatures. The consequence of this theory is the denial of the transcendent dimension of sport. Ellis´s theory is based on empirical research conducted among athletes. His attention is focused on efforts to achieve the best possible performance by referring to Irenaeus of Lyon, Maslow and others interpreted as a reflection of God's self-transcendence necessary for the creation of man. Sport according to Ellis in contemporary society fullfil some of the functions previously belonging to organized forms of religion. The final section deals with altered states of consciousness in sports and their relationship to the mystique. The author begins by describing his own experiences that are then interpreted from five points of view (philosophical, theological, phenomenological, transpersonal and skeptical). On this basis, the author formulates his own interpretation of the connection between sport and mysticism, whose findings help to deepen the above discussion and also can help with looking for a solution...|$|R

This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan&rsquo;s syndrome. A policy of early cascade-screening of all first-degree relatives of patients with these disorders will therefore detect a substantial number of individuals at risk. A strictly regulated system with preparticipation screening of all athletes following a protocol pioneered in Italy, including school-age children, can also detect cases caused by sporadic new mutations and has been shown to reduce excess mortality among athletes substantially. Recommendations for screening procedure are reviewed. It is concluded that ECG screening ought to be part of preparticipation screening, but using criteria that do not cause too many false <b>positives</b> among <b>athletes.</b> One such suggested protocol will show positive in approximately 5 % of screened individuals, among whom many will be screened for these diseases. On this point {{further research is needed to}} define what kind of false-positive and false-negative rate these new criteria result in. A less formal system based on cascade-screening of relatives, education of coaches about suspicious symptoms, and preparticipation questionnaires used by athletic clubs, has been associated over time with a sizeable reduction in sudden cardiac deaths among Swedish athletes, and thus appears to be worth implementing even for junior athletes not recommended for formal preparticipation screening. It is strongly argued that in families with autosomal dominant disorders the first screening of children should be carried out no later than 6 to 7 years of age.
