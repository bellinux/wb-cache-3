The latter three dungeons in both games will hold a more powerful version of an item received earlier in the game. Both the sword's offensive power and the shield's defensive abilities can be upgraded twice, once through passwords and again through side quests. If Link swings an enhanced sword at full health, a sword-shaped beam will escape from the sword as a ranged attack. The number of bombs and Mystical Seeds that can be held can also be increased through the same ways as the shield and sword. Roc's Feather and the Power Bracelet are special cases, as, while the two are in both games, the former can only be upgraded in Oracle of Seasons while the latter only in Oracle of Ages.|$|E

Renaming <b>previous</b> <b>items</b> results in facilitation while naming pictures semantically related to <b>previous</b> <b>items</b> causes interference. A computational model (Oppenheim, Dell, & Schwartz, 2010) proposes that both facilitation and interference are the result of using naming events as “learning experiences” to ensure future accuracy. The model successfully simulates naming data from different semantic interference paradigms by implementing a learning mechanism that creates interference and a boosting mechanism that resolves interference. This study tested this model’s assumptions that semantic interference effects in naming are created by learning and resolved by boosting. Findings revealed no relationship between individual performance across semantic interference tasks, and measured learning and boosting abilities did not predict performance. These results suggest that learning and boosting mechanisms do not fully characterize the processes underlying semantic interference when naming...|$|R

50|$|Many {{researchers}} {{tried to}} explain this phenomenon through free recall tests. Coluccia, Gamboz, and Brandimonte (2011) explain free recall as participants try to remember information without any prompting. In some experiments in the late 20th century, {{it was noted that}} participants who knew {{that they were going to}} be tested on a list presented to them would rehearse items. Meaning, as items were presented, the participants would repeat those items to themselves and as new items were presented, the participants would continue to rehearse <b>previous</b> <b>items</b> along with the newer items. It was demonstrated that the primacy effect had a greater influence on recall when there was more time between presentation of items so that participants would have a greater chance to rehearse <b>previous</b> (prime) <b>items.</b>|$|R

That is, f&minus;1(&minus;∞,c) is a Stein filling of Xc.|$|E
5000|$|A {{formula is}} said to be satisfiable in a certain model if there are {{assignments}} to its free variables that render it true; it is valid if every assignment to its free variables makes it true. Satisfiability and validity are dual because the invalid formulas are precisely those whose negations are satisfiable, and the unsatisfiable formulas are those whose negations are valid. This {{can be viewed as a}} special case of the <b>previous</b> <b>item,</b> with the quantifiers ranging over interpretations.|$|E

Digit span refers to the proposed number of pieces of information (5-9) that can be held in short-term memory. This is {{also referred to as}} the magic number seven - plus or minus two.

50|$|The Dm {{effect has}} been shown to be {{sensitive}} to how participants are asked to display their memory for <b>previous</b> <b>items.</b> In a 1988 paper by Paller, McCarthy and Wood, a greater Dm effect was observed for items that were freely recalled with no external cues, compared to items that were presented and the subject was asked if he or she recognizes the item as old. This is suggestive of the Dm effect being larger for stronger representations, as recall is generally more difficult than recognition.|$|R
5000|$|An {{observer}} {{subscribes to}} an observable sequence. The sequence then sends the items to the observer {{one at a}} time, usually by calling the provided callback function. The observer handles each one before processing the next one. If many events come in asynchronously, they must be stored in a queue or dropped. In ReactiveX, an observer will never be called with an item out of order or (in a multi-threaded context) called before the callback has returned for the <b>previous</b> <b>item.</b> Asynchronous calls are still asynchronous and may be handled by returning an observable.|$|E

30|$|Since we do {{not know}} the number of target items to be tracked (new items may be added to the {{shopping}} cart or some <b>previous</b> <b>items</b> are discard by customers at any time, and we also do not know the number of customers), clustering algorithms, such as k-means [12], in which the number of clusters must be known as a priori, thus leading to this kind of clustering algorithm that can not be applied.

One may come across old or ultra-low-budget ATX cases which feature a PSU mount in the top.

You will then have the address for D and you can continue traversing the list. The same pattern applies in the other direction. i.e. addr(D) = link(C) ⊕ addr(B) where link(C) = addr(B)⊕addr(D) so [...] addr(D) = addr(B)⊕addr(D) ⊕ addr(B) [...] addr(D) = addr(B)⊕addr(B) ⊕ addr(D) [...] since [...] X⊕X = 0 [...] => addr(D) = 0 ⊕ addr(D) since X⊕0 = x => addr(D) = addr(D) The XOR operation cancels addr(B) appearing twice in the equation and all we are left with is the addr(D).|$|E

50|$|Many {{items from}} Blue Peter history have become {{embedded}} in British popular culture, especially moments when {{things have gone}} wrong, such as the much-repeated clip of Lulu the elephant (from a 1969 edition) who urinated and defecated on the studio floor, appeared to tread on the foot of presenter John Noakes and then proceeded to attempt an exit, dragging her keeper along behind her. Although it is often assumed to have been broadcast live, the edition featuring Lulu {{was one of the}} rare occasions when the programme was pre-recorded, due to the non-availability of a studio on the normal transmission day.
