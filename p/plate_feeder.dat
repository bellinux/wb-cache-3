40|$|The {{profitability}} of abalone farms is {{heavily influenced by}} their production per unit of grow-out space. With farms having physically expanded to the maximum, and with increasing production costs, {{one of the most}} realistic ways for farms to increase their production is through optimizing stocking densities. The effect of stocking density on Haliotis midae performance is undocumented and optimal stocking densities for this species have not been determined. Experiments were conducted under farm conditions to investigate the effects of four different stocking densities (16 %, 20 %, 22 % and 24 % of available surface area) on growth, production and health of three different size classes of abalone (15 - 35 g, 45 - 65 g, and 70 - 90 g start weight). Each treatment was replicated four times and trials ran over a period of eight months with measurements being made at four month intervals. Abalone behaviour was observed during the trials in the experimental tanks. Weight gain per abalone decreased with an increase in density for all tested size classes (5. 04 ± 0. 18 to 2. 38 ± 0. 17; 5. 35 ± 0. 21 to 4. 62 ± 0. 29; 7. 97 ± 0. 37 to 6. 53 ± 0. 28 g. abalone- 1. month- 1 for the 15 - 35, 45 - 65 and 70 - 90 g classes respectively, with an increased density of 16 to 24 %). Individual weight gain of 15 - 35 g abalone was similar at stocking densities of 16 % and 20 % while weight gain of 45 - 65 g and 70 - 90 g abalone decreased when density was increased above 16 %. Biomass gain (kg. basket- 1. month- 1) was not affected by stocking density in the 15 - 35 g and 45 - 65 g size classes (1. 29 ± 0. 02 and 0. 97 ± 0. 02 kg. basket- 1. month- 1 respectively). However, the biomass gained by baskets stocked with 70 - 90 g abalone increased with stocking density (1. 08 ± 0. 02 to 1. 33 ± 0. 02 kg. basket- 1. month- 1) with an increased density of 16 to 24 %) and did not appear to plateau within the tested density range (16 to 24 %). Food conversion ratio did not differ significantly between densities across all size classes. Stocking density did not {{have a significant effect on}} abalone condition factor or health indices. The proportion of abalone above the level of the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> increased with density (7. 26 ± 1. 33 to 16. 44 ± 1. 33 with an increased density of 16 to 24 %). As a proportion of abalone situated in the area of the basket, the same proportions were situated on the walls above the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> and on the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> itself irrespective of stocking density (p > 0. 05). Higher proportions of animals had restricted access to feed at higher stocking densities (p = 0. 03). The amount of formulated feed available on the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> did not differ between stocking densities throughout the night (p = 0. 19). Individual abalone spent more time above the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> at higher stocking densities (p 0. 05) but abalone stocked at 16 % spent a greater percentage of time above the <b>feeder</b> <b>plate</b> on the feeding surface (83. 99 ± 6. 26 %) than on the basket walls (16. 01 ± 6. 26 %). Stocking density did not affect the positioning of abalone within a basket during the day or at night. Different size H. midae are affected differently by increases in stocking density in terms of growth performance. Findings from this research may be implemented into farm management strategies to best suit production goals, whether in terms of biomass production or individual weight gain. The fundamental mechanisms resulting in reduced growth at higher densities are not well understood, however results from behaviour observations suggest that competition for preferred attachment space and feed availability are contributing to decreased growth rates. With knowledge of abalone behaviour at different densities, innovative tank designs may be established in order to counter the reduction in growth at higher densities...|$|R

The cells in culture retain all ES cell features including pluripotency to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers and germ-line transmission after extended culture. Furthermore, they show a higher proliferative ability, lower dependency on LIF, and higher transfection efficiency than colonyforming conditions.

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC) {{have the ability}} to support and {{maintain}} hematopoiesis in vitro. However, mechanisms implicated in this support are not fully characterized. In the present study, the role of stromal-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) /CXCR 4 axis in the interactions between MSC and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) was studied. Human bone marrow MSC were <b>plated</b> as <b>feeder</b> layers in Dexter-type long-term cultures (LTC) with human cord blood CD 34 (+) HSPC. Cultures were supplemented weekly with neutralizing antibodies against CXCR 4 or SDF- 1 for 5 wk. LTC-initiating cell (IC) activity was strongly dependent on the SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 axis, as both antibodies significantly decreased secondary colony-forming cell production. To assess the effect of SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 axis on progenitor cell proliferation, LTC-IC killing assays were carried out: in LTC of CD 34 (+) cells in contact with MSC, treatment with anti-CXCR 4 antibody significantly reduced the number of cycling progenitors. These results indicate that the SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 axis promotes HSPC proliferation in contact with MSC. Interestingly, when HSPC were separated from MSC by a semipermeable membrane, LTC-IC activity became CXCR 4 independent. Multiplex analysis of MSC-conditioned medium revealed that in addition to SDF- 1, MSC produced stimulatory and inhibitory factors, such as interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 11, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor as well as monocyte-chemoattractant protein- 1. Altogether, human MSC support hematopoiesis in Dexter-type cultures through the activation of the SDF- 1 /CXCR 4 axis. Our data further suggest that SDF- 1 stimulates retention of HSPC in MSC niches which expose them to stimulatory and inhibitory factors in a paracrine manner. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Moreover, they could efficiently be recovered from low cell density cultures in limiting dilutions when <b>plated</b> on a <b>feeder</b> layer of heterologous EBV B cells.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} olfactory epithelium (OE) supports continual neurogenesis throughout life, {{suggesting that}} a neuronal stem cell exists in this system. In tissue culture, however, {{the capacity of the}} OE for neurogenesis ceases after a few days. In an attempt to identify conditions that support the survival of neuronal stem cells, a population of neuronal progenitors was isolated from embryonic mouse OE and cultured in defined serum-free medium. The vast majority of cells rapidly gave rise to neurons, which died shortly thereafter. However, when purified progenitors were co-cultured with cells derived from the stroma underlying the OE, a small subpopulation (0. 07 - 0. 1 %) gave rise to proliferative colonies. A morphologically identifiable subset of these colonies generated new neurons as late as 7 days in vitro. Interestingly, development of these neuronal colonies was specifically inhibited when purified progenitors were <b>plated</b> onto stromal <b>feeder</b> cells {{in the presence of a}} large excess of differentiated OE neurons. These results indicate that a rare cell type, with the potential to undergo prolonged neurogenesis, can be isolated from mammalian OE and that stroma-derived factors are important in supporting neurogenesis by this cell. The data further suggest that differentiated neurons provide a signal that feeds back to inhibit production of new neurons by their own progenitors...|$|R

Preference was assessed by examining birds' behavioral activities, such as eating, standing and lying around the equipments, and meal duration as function of the environmental variables. Data on the behavioral activities and meal size were collected in a broiler commercial farm using a portable video camera, and the direct footages were analyzed. The time spent in each activity, feeding bout duration and time spent near the trough were statistically analyzed using the test of means and medians.

We set out to develop a method of differentiating ES cells into mesodermal cells at high efficiency without first having to induce embryoid body formation. ES cells were <b>plated</b> on a <b>feeder</b> layer of PA 6 cells, which have membrane-associated stromalderived inducing activity (SDIA), the molecular basis of which is currently unknown. Stimulation of ES/PA 6 co-cultures with Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP 4) both favoured self-renewal of ES cells and induced differentiation into a Desmin and Nestin double positive cell population. Combined stimulation with BMP 4 and all-trans Retinoic Acid (RA) inhibited selfrenewal and resulted in 90 % of cells expressing Desmin and Nestin. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis confirmed that the cells were of mesodermal origin and expressed markers of mesenchymal and smooth muscle cells. BMP 4 activation of a MAD-homolog (Smad) -dependent reporter in undifferentiated ES cells was attenuated by co-stimulation with RA and co-culture with PA 6 cells.

In the current work we developed iPS-like cells from lung cells of COPD patients and controls. METHODS:Lentiviral particles for Oct 3 / 4, Sox 2, c-Myc and Klf 4 were utilized to generate iPS-like cells from lung fibroblasts of three COPD and three non-COPD subjects. Cells were infected with lentiviral particles at MOI of 5 and transferred to six well <b>plate</b> containing <b>feeder</b> layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts 48 hours after transfection. To enhance the generation of iPS-like rock inhibitor Y 27632 was used after seven days of infection and 100 ng b-fgf was used in the media for the last seven days of the reprogramming protocol. After enriching for colonies, iPS-like cells were moved to <b>feeder</b> independent <b>plates</b> using mTESR 1 ® media and BD matrigel®. Alkaline phosphatase immunecytochemistry and real time PCR for undifferentiated markers Oct 3 / 4 and Sox 2 and were carried out to demonstrate the self-renewal and pluripotency capacity of the generated iPS-like cells. iPS-like cells were then used to prepare embryoid bodies (EBs) and the ability of these EBs to re-differentiate towards fibroblasts was assessed then iPS-like cells-derived fibroblasts from both groups were tested functionally by gel contraction and chemotaxis. RESULTS:iPS-like cells were successfully generated from both COPD and control adult lung fibroblasts. Morphology of iPS-like cells generated COPD and non-COPD lung fibroblasts was similar to the control iPSCs obtained from university of Wisconsin. Generated iPS-like cells expressed high levels of alkaline phosphatase and high levels of Oct 3 / 4 and Sox 2 were also detected by real time PCR. The iPS-like cells formed EBs in culture and differentiated into fibroblasts in three-dimension collagen gels. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that fibroblasts cultured from the lungs of patients with COPD and controls can be induced to form iPS-like cells. The resulting "stem cells" can be used to induce differentiation and a fibroblast-like phenotype can be restored.

The basic tasks {{in a factory}} are manufacturing the parts, and combining them into the desired product. In automating these tasks, we want to use robot manipulators that require little or no human intervention. We explore devices that deliver parts in a uniform orientation to robots. Such a device is called a partfeeder. Part feeders are used to improve the efficiency in an industrial assembly line: robots to which the parts are fed in a uniform orientation can easily process these parts without having to sense their initial orientations. In practice, the problem of part feeding is usually solved using trial-and-error approaches which are time consuming and error prone. We show how to systematically design part feeders using techniques from computational geometry. We consider four different feeders. The first feeder consists of a sequence of fences which are mounted across a conveyor belt. The fences brush the part as it travels down the belt thus reorienting it. The second feeder is a pulling finger which applies a sequence of pull operations that reorients flat parts with elevated edges. The third feeder deals with three-dimensional parts. It is a sequence of (tilted) plates with fences which reorients a three-dimensional polyhedral part as it travels down the <b>plates.</b> The fourth <b>feeder</b> in this thesis is the vibratory bowl feeder. This thesis gives insight into the geometrical nature of part feeding problems.

Given that Conform competes economically with conventional extrusion and is also reported {{to be a more}} energy efficient process, it is surprising that the use of Conform is not more widespread in today's increasingly environmentally conscious and high-production focussed world. One explanation for this is likely to be {{due to the fact that}} there is still limited knowledge of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the workpiece during extrusion. Furthermore, for the aluminium industry, there are still issues remaining regarding the production of flash and the quality of the extrudate in terms of mechanical properties. This study provides the reader with the findings of the research and experimental work undertaken by the author, his co-workers and fellow specialists, in the field of aluminium extrusion including Conform. The experimental work includes both laboratory experiments performed with a direct extrusion press and an experimental machine set up to replicate the Conform process. The experimental work is also simulated using finite element modelling techniques. The results from these analyses are then validated by comparing industrial and experimental data. The finite element analyses are enhanced by using parallel processing technology and user sub-routines.

40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) can offer an unlimited cell source for cellular transplantation, but the currently used culture conditions contain animal-derived products that bear a risk of transmitting animal pathogens and causing a rejection when cells are transplanted. In addition, the laborious production of feeders needed for hESC culture and the difficult mechanical passaging of hESCs make the large-scale production of hESCs difficult. The first {{aim of this study}} was to optimize culture conditions for hESCs towards animal-free conditions by testing totally animal-free serum replacements (SR- 3 and X-Vivo 20) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Other aims of the study were to find an easier way for hESC passaging and to test the possibility of growing hESCs without feeder cells using biomaterials. The differentiation stage of the hESC colonies was determined during the testing by morphology and later confirmed with immunochemistry using markers specific for undifferentiated hESCs (AP, Oct- 4 and Nanog) and for differentiated hESCs (SSEA- 1). The hESCs grown with the SR- 3 and X-Vivo 20 were all differentiated where as some of the hESCs grown with the test bFGF were undifferentiated. However, the amount of these cells was very low. The hESCs passaged with animal-free enzyme Tryple were mostly undifferentiated and the amount of these cells was similar with control. In addition, the cells had normal 46,XX karyotype after 31 passages. The embryoid bodies (EBs) differentiated from these hESCs expressed genes and proteins common to the three embryonic germ layers based on the reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunochemistry analysis, showing the pluripotency of the cells. The tested biomaterials allowed the attachment of hESCs in the presence of conditioned medium, but the undifferentiated growth of hESCs could not be determined. However, the cells <b>plated</b> back on <b>feeders</b> after one passage on biomaterials, were mostly differentiated. The tested SR- 3, X-Vivo 20 and bFGF as well as the biomaterials were not able to maintain the undifferentiated growth of hESCs better than the control conditions, but the Tryple passaging method supported the growth of hESCs well. Although it was not faster way than mechanical passaging, it makes the passaging of thin hESC colonies easier and the colonies could be split into smaller pieces than with mechanical passaging, resulting in faster expanded growth of hESCs.

40|$|The {{differentiation}} of {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) into functional hepatocytes provides a powerful in vitro model system for analysing the molecular mechanisms involved in liver development. Moreover, a well-characterized renewable source of hepatocytes differentiated from human ES cells {{could be used for}} in vitro assays of drug metabolism and toxicology. The mechanisms underlying the molecular embryological events leading to fetal liver development has been studied by genetic analysis in rodents and explants studies in the model organisms such as the chick embryo. Nowadays the pluripotent characteristics of human ES cells provide great promise for the study of early development in man. Especially because protocols leading to {{differentiation of}} human ES cells into cells possessing morphologic and molecular features typical for hepatocytes are available. Genetic studies in the model organisms have unveiled the major inducers of hepatogenesis such as FGF 4, BMP 2, HGF, oncostatin M and dexamethasone. Currently the biggest challenge is to gain insight into target genes and associated signaling pathways regulated by extracellular ligands, which are normally sequentially supplemented into in vitro differentiation protocols. This knowledge will in turn enhance our understanding of the dynamic developmental events at the transcript and proteome level. This study was aimed at elucidating mechanisms of in vitro hepatogenesis, which mimics the in vivo process. In order to performed time-resolved analysis of the process of hepatogenesis, I used a reproducible in vitro system (two different protocols) and analysed the transcriptomes of the differentiating human ES cells in a step-wise manner (definitive endoderm induction, early hepatic cells, hepatic maturation) throughout the entire process. This in vitro analysis has revealed a broad spectrum of molecular cascades involving cell surface receptors, transcriptional regulators and associated signaling pathways that might be driving hepatogenesis in vivo. In addition, these experiments revealed that at the transcriptional level human ES cells-derived hepatocyte-like cells have some similarity to fetal liver, but in some aspects present an individual, exclusive transcription pattern. In summary, the results suggest that an in vitro system for hepatic differentiation is a potent tool for analyzing molecular pathways involved at each stage of this process. However, further effort is required to obtain more mature cells, and the knowledge gained from the transcript analysis might aid in achieving this goal.
