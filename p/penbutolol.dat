5000|$|<b>Penbutolol</b> {{is able to}} bind to both beta-1 {{adrenergic}} receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors (the two subtypes), {{thus making}} it a non-selective β blocker. <b>Penbutolol</b> is a sympathomimetic drug with properties allowing it {{to act as a}} partial agonist at β adrenergic receptors.|$|E
5000|$|... bPenbutolol (Levatol, Levatolol, Lobeta, Paginol, Hostabloc, Betapressin) is a {{medication}} {{in the class}} of beta blockers, used in the treatment of high blood pressure. <b>Penbutolol</b> is able to bind to both beta-1 adrenergic receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors (the two subtypes), thus making it a non-selective β blocker. <b>Penbutolol</b> is a sympathomimetic drug with properties allowing it to act as a partial agonist at β adrenergic receptors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Penbutolol</b> {{has a low}} {{frequency}} of side effects. These side effects include dizziness, light headedness, and nausea.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Penbutolol</b> acts on the β1 {{adrenergic}} receptors in {{both the}} heart and the kidney. When β1 receptors are activated by a catecholamine, they stimulate a coupled G protein which activates adenylyl to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP ultimately alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases heart rate. <b>Penbutolol</b> blocks this and decreases heart rate, which lowers blood pressure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Penbutolol</b> is used {{to treat}} mild to {{moderate}} high blood pressure. [...] Like other beta blockers {{it is not a}} first line treatment for this indication.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability of}} <b>penbutolol</b> {{to act as}} a partial agonist proves useful in the {{prevention}} of bradycardia as a result of decreasing the heart rate excessively. [...] <b>Penbutolol</b> binding β1 adrenergic receptors also alters kidney functions. Under normal physiological conditions, the enzyme renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which will then be converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland, causing a decrease in electrolyte and water retention, ultimately increasing water excretion and decreasing blood volume and pressure.|$|E

After a wash-out period of three weeks, a group of 8 hypertensive patients (5 women and 3 men, 27 to 41 years old) underwent automatic BP and HR monitoring, and blood sampling for 24 hours in a hospital room before and after 4 weeks of treatment with <b>penbutolol</b> (40 -mg tablet once a day at 9 a. m.). In basal conditions, a statistically significant mean circadian rhythm was demonstrated for HR, diastolic BP, PRA, PA, and PC. Systolic and diastolic BP were lowered by <b>penbutolol,</b> with only a minor decrease of HR. The treatment eliminated also the mean circadian rhythm of BP and HR. <b>Penbutolol</b> induced both a remarkable reduction of PRA with disappearance of the related circadian rhythm and {{a significant decrease in}} PA levels with maintenance of their circadian rhythmicity. The circadian secretory patterns of PC were similar before and after therapy. In conclusion, long-term treatment with <b>penbutolol</b> appears not only to set BP, PRA and PA values to lower levels, but also to decrease the within-day variation of BP, HR, and PRA.

Following four logarithmetically cumulative i. v. boluses (0. 5 - 4 mg dosage range) {{there was a}} log linear increase in plasma <b>penbutolol</b> concentration; the levels achieved (51 +/- 8 to 219 +/- 19 ng/ml) were in the therapeutic range (12 to 250 ng/ml). <b>Penbutolol</b> resulted in a linear decrease in heart rate (maximum delta HR - 4 beats/min; P less than 0. 01); {{there was a small}} increase in pulmonary artery occluded pressure which reached its maximum at the lower doses (maximum delta PAOP + 1 mm Hg; P less than 0. 01). The resting cardiac output, blood pressure and calculated systemic vascular resistance were unchanged. During 4 min steady-state supine bicycle exercise there was attenuation of exercise cardiac output (delta C.

40|$|Atrial and {{ventricular}} chronotropic {{effects of}} the individual stereoisomers of propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol and <b>penbutolol</b> were studied in conscious dogs with chronic atrio-ventricular (A-V) block. Ventricular beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity was assessed for all drugs against isoprenaline under the same experimental conditions. At low doses, the stereoisomers of propranolol and <b>penbutolol</b> decreased atrial rate, whereas those of pindolol and metoprolol produced an increase. At higher doses, all drugs increased atrial rate. All drugs decreased ventricular rate dose-dependently except (+) -pindolol. Relative ventricular beta-blocking potencies of the (-) -isomers of propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol and <b>penbutolol</b> were respectively 38, 21, greater than 43 and 31 times {{higher than those of}} their corresponding (+) -isomers.

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{for improving the}} treatment of depressive illness is augmentation of antidepressants with a 5 -HT 1 (1 A) autoreceptor antagonist. However, trials using the 5 -HT 1 (1 A) /beta-blocker pindolol are proving inconsistent. We report how positron emission tomography (PET) and in vitro autoradiography can inform trials of antidepressant augmentation. We show that in healthy volunteers, in vivo, pindolol (n = 10) and <b>penbutolol</b> (n = 4), but not tertatolol (n = 4) occupy the human 5 -HT(1 A) receptors, at clinical doses. Pindolol, {{as well as the}} beta-blockers <b>penbutolol</b> and tertatolol, has high affinity for human 5 -HT(1 A) receptors in post-mortem brain slices (n = 4). Pindolol shows preference for 5 -HT(1 A) autoreceptors versus the post-synaptic receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Our data reveal that pindolol doses used in antidepressant trials so far are suboptimal for significant occupancy at the 5 -HT(1 A) autoreceptor. <b>Penbutolol</b> or higher doses of pindolol are candidates for testing as antidepressant augmenting regimes in future clinical trials...|$|E

Although several radioligands labeled with 11 C or 18 F have been {{synthesized}} for imaging purposes with positron emission tomography (PET), so far no optimal ligands are available to image cardiac beta-adrenoceptors using single photon emission tomography (SPECT). In the present study, we characterized four new synthesized analogues of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 4 -(3 -t-butylamino- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) -benzimidazol- 2 -one (CGP 12177) and one analogue of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist <b>penbutolol.</b> Using classical in vitro displacement studies with left ventricular tissue of New Zealand White rabbits and [125 I]iodocyanopindolol as a radioligand, binding affinity to the receptor was determined. From the four analogues, only (2 'S, 2 "E) - [4 -(3 '-(1 ", 1 "-dimethyl- 3 "-Iodo- 2 " propenylamino) - 2 '-hydroxypropoxy) ]-benzimidazol- 2 -one proved to have a high affinity, with Ki = 1. 25 +/- 0. 09 nM, n = 3. The other analogues showed relatively low affinity, with Ki-values > 1 nM. The analogue of <b>penbutolol</b> ((S) -(-) -[1 -(2 -Iodophenoxy) ]- 3 '-(tert-butylamino) - 2 '-propanol) also showed a Ki value of 0. 64 +/- 0. 26 nM, n = 3. Subsequently, (2 'S, 2 "E) -[4 -(3 '-(1 ", 1 "-dimethyl- 3 "-Iodo- 2 " propenylamino) - 2 '-hydroxypropoxy) ]-benzimidazol- 2 -one and (S) -(-) -[1 -(2 -Iodophenoxy) ]- 3 '-(tert-butylamino) - 2 '-propanol were radioactively labeled with 123 I to study their biodistribution in New Zealand White rabbits and to determine specific binding. Significant uptake was observed in both lungs and left ventricles. However, both compounds showed high nonspecific binding in vivo because uptake of the radioligand could not be inhibited by preinjection of different (selective- and nonselective-adrenoceptor antagonists and hydrophilic and lipophilic antagonists) antagonists. In conclusion, although two analogues showed reasonable affinity in vitro for the receptor, their binding in vivo proved to be largely nonspecific, suggesting that these two compounds are unsuitable for imaging purposes. However, because marked differences in affinity for the receptor were observed with only little structural changes between compounds, the present results offer future perspectives for the synthesis of a more specific radioligan...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin(1 A) (5 -HT(1 A)) receptors {{have been}} implicated in the {{pathophysiology}} and treatment of anxiety and depression and are a target for novel drug development.

Occupancy by pindolol, <b>penbutolol,</b> buspirone, EMD 68843, and S 15535 was compared to test-retest data from 10 healthy volunteers. All drugs, apart from buspirone, displayed occupancy at the 5 -HT(1 A) receptor site. Pindolol demonstrated a preferential occupancy at the autoreceptor compared to the postsynaptic receptor over a plasma range of about 10 - 20 ng/mL. Differential occupancy may be an important component of novel drug action.

We analyzed here the characteristics of the interplay of compounds of basic nature by (1) H HRMAS NMR, which provide relevant descriptors for products with pharmaceutical properties, with chromatographic phases for Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography. Eight grafted silica phases were selected, differing to enhance specific structural properties (monomeric and polymeric grafts, endcapping or not, carbon content, alkyl with polar embedded group or alkyl bonded chain, chemical nature of end capping, native silica). These materials were put in interaction with five basic molecules, previously chosen as probes for the evaluation of efficient base deactivated liquid stationary phases using five theoretical molecular descriptors to cover a large scale of molecular volume, polar surface area, LogP, hydrogen-bond donor capacity and finally hydrogen-bond acceptor capacity.
