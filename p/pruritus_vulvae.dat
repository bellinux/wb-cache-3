40|$|An open {{clinical}} trial {{was conducted in}} twenty six women suffering from vaginitis and cervicitis. After confirming the clinical and microbiological diagnosis, all the females were given V-Gel, which was recommended to be applied topically on the vagina and cervix, twice daily for 15 days. The soreness of cervix, <b>pruritus,</b> inflammation of <b>vulva,</b> vaginal discharge was significantly reduced within two weeks of drug treatment. Foul odour of the vaginal discharge disappeared significantly. Majority of patients showed microbiological cure after treatment with V-Gel. Eighty three per cent of patients had partial relief within one week and 60 % patients had complete relief at two weeks. Thus, V-Gel {{was found to be}} clinically effective formulation for the treatment of vaginitis and cervicitis. Key words: Vaginitis; cervicitis; V-Gel; vaginal infection...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Trichomoniasis (infection with Trichomonas vaginalis) is {{the second}} cause of {{vaginitis}} after bacterial infections and the most prevalent non virel sexually transmitted disease. Considering {{the differences in the}} prevalence of infection in other countries and the lack of any study of frequency of infection in Isfahan in the last 20 years in this survey the frequency of infection with T. vaginalis in women attending to health care centers and the relationship between infection and demoghraphic factors and clinical signs was studied. &# 13; Methods: The diagnosis of Trichomoniasis was made by wet mount examination and culture of vaginal discharge in 470 women attending to three health care centers in Isfahan. The relationship between the results obtained and clinical signs and demographics factors determined by questionnaires, interviews, and physical examinations was investigated. &# 13; Results: From 470 women, in 7 (1. 49 percent) and 9 (1. 92 percent) cases indentified T. vaginalis in wet mount and culture respectively. Statistical methods showed no significant relationship between Trichomoniasis and age, Use of specific contraceptive method, and vaginal pH (for those with no clinical signs) (P > 0. 05). However, a statistically significant relationship was observed between Trichomoniasis and <b>pruritus,</b> irritation of <b>vulva,</b> frothy discharge, vaginitis and vaginal pH (in women with clinical signs). (P< 0. 05). &# 13; Discussion: A comparison between {{the results of the present}} study and the previous ones showed a significant decrease in the frequency of T. vaginalis in Isfahan. This dicrease may be due to some changes in the social behaviors and more comitment to the Islamic principles. It seems that there is no direct relationship between Trichomoniasis and age but pH changes may be one of the factors involved in Trichomoniasis...|$|R
50|$|Pinworms cannot {{damage the}} skin, {{and they do}} not {{normally}} migrate through tissues. However, in women they may move onto the vulva and into the vagina, from there moving to the external orifice of the uterus, and onwards to the uterine cavity, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and peritoneal cavity. This can cause vulvovaginitis, i.e. an inflammation of the vulva and vagina. This causes vaginal discharge and <b>pruritus</b> <b>vulvae,</b> i.e., itchiness of the vulva. The pinworms can also enter the urethra, and presumably, they carry intestinal bacteria with them. According to Gutierrez (2000), a statistically significant correlation between pinworm infection and urinary tract infections has been shown; however, Burkhart & Burkhart (2005) maintain that the incidence of pinworms as a cause of urinary tract infections remains unknown. Incidentally, one report indicated that 36% of young girls with a urinary tract infection also had pinworms. Dysuria (i.e., painful urination) has been associated with pinworm infection.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} triamcinolone cream {{in the treatment of}} non-specific <b>pruritus</b> <b>vulvae.</b> METHODS: A total of 50 patients, aged between 8 and 55 years, with non-specific <b>pruritus</b> <b>vulvae</b> were consecutively included in a double-blind randomized controlled trial by their general practitioner in 25 general practices in the Netherlands. Analysis was by "intention to treat". An infectious cause was excluded by a vaginal and cervical swab. After randomization, 27 patients were treated with triamcinolone cream and 23 patients with a placebo cream. The effectiveness was assessed by: change in the severity of itch visual analogue scale (VAS) score; the percentage of patients with complete recovery; and changes in general health according to COOP/WONCA charts. RESULTS: The mean decrease in severity of itch was 2. 08 points in the triamcinolone group compared to 3. 26 points in the placebo group. Forty-two per cent {{of the women in the}} triamcinolone group completely recovered versus 35 % in the placebo group. There was no difference in general health perception between the two groups. After 12 weeks, more than 80 % in both groups reported recurrent vulval itch. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in effectiveness were found between the two groups, because both treatments were ineffective. We can conclude that triamcinolone cream is therefore not the treatment of first choice for non-specific <b>pruritus</b> <b>vulvae...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Vulval intraepithelial {{neoplasia}} is a {{skin disorder}} affecting the vulva that, if left untreated, can become cancerous. Currently, the standard treatment {{for patients with}} vulval intraepithelial neoplasia is surgery, but this approach does not guarantee cure and can be disfiguring, causing physical and psychological problems, particularly in women of reproductive age. We aimed to assess the activity, safety, and feasibility of two topical treatments—cidofovir and imiquimod—as an alternative to surgery in female patients with vulval intraepithelial neoplasia. Methods: We recruited female patients (age 16 years or older) from 32 centres to an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial. Eligibility criteria were biopsy-proven vulval intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 {{and at least one}} lesion that could be measured accurately. We randomly allocated patients to topical treatment with either 1 % cidofovir (supplied as a gel in a 10 g tube, to last 6 weeks) or 5 % imiquimod (one 250 mg sachet for every application), to be self-applied three times a week for a maximum of 24 weeks. Randomisation (1 : 1) was done by stratified minimisation via a central computerised system, with stratification by hospital, disease focality, and presentation stage. The primary endpoint was a histologically confirmed complete response at the post-treatment assessment visit 6 weeks after the end of treatment (a maximum of 30 weeks after treatment started). Analysis of the primary endpoint was by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes were toxic effects (to assess safety) and adherence to treatment (to assess feasibility). We present results after all patients had reached the primary endpoint assessment point at 6 weeks; 2 -year follow-up of complete responders continues. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN 34420460. Findings: Between Oct 21, 2009, and Jan 11, 2013, 180 participants were enrolled to the study; 89 patients were randomly allocated cidofovir and 91 were assigned imiquimod. At the post-treatment assessment visit, a complete response had been achieved by 41 (46 %; 90 % CI 37 · 0 – 55 · 3) patients allocated cidofovir and by 42 (46 %; 37 · 2 – 55 · 3) patients assigned imiquimod. After 6 weeks of treatment, 156 (87 %) patients (78 in each group) had adhered to the treatment regimen. Five patients in the cidofovir group and seven in the imiquimod group either withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the first 6 -week safety assessment. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 31 (37 %) of 84 patients allocated cidofovir and 39 (46 %) of 84 patients assigned imiquimod; the most frequent grade 3 and 4 events were pain in the <b>vulva,</b> <b>pruritus,</b> fatigue, and headache. Interpretation: Cidofovir and imiquimod were active, safe, and feasible for treatment of vulval intraepithelial neoplasia and warrant further investigation in a phase 3 setting. Both drugs are effective alternatives to surgery for female patients with vulval intraepithelial neoplasia after exclusion of occult invasive disease...|$|R

40|$|A vulval {{colposcopy}} clinic {{was established}} in the sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic of St Mary's Hospital, London, to investigate patients with chronic symptoms (mean duration 3 1 / 2 years). Fifty patients {{with a mean age of}} 33 were studied for 12 months, and a specific diagnosis was established for many of them. Forty complained of <b>pruritus</b> <b>vulvae,</b> 33 of dyspareunia, and 30 of vulvodynia. One or more macroscopic abnormality was seen in 29 of the women, the most common being erythema, papules, plaques, and fissures. Colposcopic abnormalities, however, were identified in 45 of the women, the most common being acetowhite epithelium in a flat, papillary, or cobblestone pattern. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 33 of the patients, and all had abnormal histological features. Those of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection were the most common, and were found in 27 specimens; evidence of vulval intraepithelial neoplasia was seen in seven and that of dermatoses in 10. Further work is required, however, before concluding that HPV was necessarily responsible for the chronic symptoms...|$|E
40|$|IN his {{classical}} {{description of}} {{disease of the}} mammary areola, Sir James Paget (1874) referred briefly to a similar condition affecting the glans penis and subsequently followed by a cancer in {{the substance of the}} organ. This reference has been the main justification for attaching the name extramammary Paget's disease to certain skin conditions occurring {{in other parts of the}} body. The naked eye and microscopic appearances of the mammary and extramammary lesions bear certain similarities. Their aetiology and pathogenesis remains highly controversial and it is not clear whether the two diseases bear any relation to each other despite a similarity in name. In this paper we describe a patient who presented with extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva, and who later developed a most unusual bladder tumour. CASE REPORT Miss N.

40|$|Thesis (M. Med.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1998. BACKGROUND White vulva! skin lesions {{may be due}} {{to various}} conditions, {{including}} benign and non-benign causes. The dilemma faced by the clinician with such a patient is the aetiology of the lesion, as well as the approach to management. AIM To establish the aetiology of white vulva! skin lesions in patients attending the gynaecology clinic and to evaluate the role of Collin's test and vulvoscopy. SETTING R. K. Khan Hospital, which is a secondary level hospital in Durban, KwaZulu Natal. METHOD Sixty-two patients with white vulva! skin lesions whom consented to the study were recruited. The investigations consisted of Pap smear, colposcopy of the vulva [Vulvoscopy], perineum and where appropriate, vaginoscopy and colposcopy; Collin's test and biopsy of all abnormal areas detected by these tests. RESULTS <b>Pruritus</b> <b>vulvae</b> was the commonest presenting symptom [70 % 1. No vulvoscopic abnormalities were detected in 97 % of patients, whilst 3 % had acetowhite areas indicative of Human papilloma virus infection. Collin's test was positive in 40 % of patients, although, histologically these areas were benign. All patients in the study had benign lesions on histology. CONCLUSION All patients in this study had benign causes of white vulval skin lesions. However, this cannot lead us to conclude that there is no role for doing Vulvoscopy and Collin's test, as premalignant and malignant lesions should be detected by these tests had they been present...|$|E
