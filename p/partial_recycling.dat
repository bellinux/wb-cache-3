50|$|Zero Waste is a goal, a process, {{a way of}} {{thinking}} that profoundly changes our approach to resources and production. Zero Waste is not about recycling and diversion from landfills but about restructuring production and distribution systems to prevent waste from being manufactured in the first place. The materials that are still required in these re-designed, resource-efficient systems will be reused many times as the products that incorporate them are reused. Deconstruction can be described as construction in reverse. It involves carefully taking apart a building to maximize the reuse of materials, thereby reducing waste and conserving resources. Deconstruction can capture materials and some components from the millions of buildings that are existing and that were poorly designed for high level reuse {{but it is not a}} favored approach from a Zero Waste point of view. Zero Waste favors the design of buildings as assemblages of high level components, not their creation from rough materials such as lumber, cement or plaster. The details are not worked out yet but to the extent that entire rooms, entire walls, roofs or floors or entire utility systems can be pre-built and installed as completed components, that will be the goal of Zero Waste design. Until buildings are built as components capable of later dismantling, deconstruction is a stop-gap process that the United States can use to minimize the waste of building materials. For now, the largest parts that we are able to save tend to be architectural elements, windows, doors, and metals, many of which are being saved and resold by reuse yards such as Urban Ore in Berkeley, California. The main parts that still need to be crushed are wood flooring, brick walls, and structural timbers. The demolition of traditional buildings has been long done by wrecking ball or bulldozer. Social and political artifacts, such as demolition contractor licenses and required permits that can only be satisfied by destruction and discard (with <b>partial</b> <b>recycling</b> of rubble and steel), render the destruction and disposal costs cheaper than deconstruction. Approximately seventy pounds of the waste is generated for about every square foot of the residential building demolition. It is arguable that this is artificial economics, based on the cultural preference for wastefulness and that Zero Waste designs of dismantlable components will ultimately be the cheapest as well as the most conservative way to reuse buildings. Further discussions of this topic may be found on the ZWI website.|$|E

Prior fMRI evidence showed that in literates a left-hemispheric visual region increases its activation to written strings relative to illiterates and reduces its response to faces. Increasing literacy also leads to a stronger right-hemispheric lateralization for faces. Here, we evaluated whether this reorganization of the brain's face system has behavioral consequences for the processing of non-linguistic visual stimuli. Three groups of adult illiterates, ex-illiterates and literates were tested with the sequential composite face paradigm that evaluates the automaticity with which faces are processed as wholes. Illiterates were consistently more holistic than participants with reading experience in dealing with faces. A second experiment replicated this effect with both faces and houses. Brain reorganization induced by literacy seems to reduce the influence of automatic holistic processing of faces and houses by enabling {{the use of a}} more analytic and flexible processing strategy, at least when holistic processing is detrimental to the task. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The wide variety of tectonic regimes in which these processes are known to be important is reflected in the choice of case studies.

Magnesium aluminate exhibits superior activity compared to zinc and cobalt-based aluminates, reaching full conversion {{and up to}} 81 [*]% yield of the 1 : 1 aldol product.

Therefore, reducing the demand for water is a strategic objective of water authorities in the UAE. The concentration of the UAE population in multi-story buildings in urban areas makes residential water conservation, including greywater recycling, a highly attractive option for reducing water demand and wastewater generation. However, the unique composition of the UAE population poses challenge to adopting water conservation policies that are suitable for the UAE national and expatriate sectors of the population. Furthermore, the current water recycling policies and legal framework do not encourage greywater recycling for internal use in residential buildings.

The study confirmed the significant potential for reducing the water demand and the benefits that the Melbourne population and water authorities can gain through adopting simple water conservation practices and greywater recycling in multi-story buildings.

40|$|AbstractABCG 2, a {{metabolite}} and xenobiotic transporter {{located at}} the plasma membrane (predominantly in barrier tissues and progenitor cells), undergoes a direct progressive endocytosis process from plasma membrane to intracellular compartments upon binding of 5 D 3 monoclonal antibody. This antibody is specific to an external epitope on the protein molecule and locks it in a discrete conformation within its activity cycle, presumably providing a structural trigger for the observed internalization phenomenon. Using routine and novel assays, we show that ABCG 2 is endocytosed by a mixed mechanism: partially via a rapid, clathrin-dependent pathway and partially in a cholesterol-dependent, caveolin-independent manner. While the internalization process is entirely dynamin-dependent and converges initially at the early endosome, subsequent intracellular fate of ABCG 2 is again twofold: endocytosis leads to only partial lysosomal degradation, while a significant fraction of the protein is retained in a post-endosomal compartment {{with the possibility of}} at least <b>partial</b> <b>recycling</b> back to the cell surface.

40|$|Coffee {{roasting}} is {{a highly}} energy intensive process {{with much of the}} energy being lost in intermittent cycles as discharged heat from the stack. In this work, combined heat and power (CHP) systems based on micro gas-turbines (MGT) are investigated for providing heat to the roasting process. Much of the heat released in a coffee roaster is from the afterburner that heats up the flue gases to high temperatures in order to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other pollutants. An interesting solution for utilizing waste heat is assessed through energy and material balances of a rotating drum coffee roasting with <b>partial</b> hot gas <b>recycling.</b> A cost assessment methodology is adopted to compare the profitability of three proposed system configurations integrated into the process. The case study of a major coffee torrefaction plant with 500 kg/h production capacity is assumed to carry out the thermo-economic assessment, under the Italian energy framework. The CHP options under investigation are: (i) regenerative topping MGT coupled to the existing modulating gas burner to generate hot air for the roasting process; (ii) intermittent waste-heat recovery from the hot flue-gases through an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine coupled to a thermal storage buffer; and (iii) non-regenerative topping MGT with direct recovery of turbine outlet air for the roasting process by means of an afterburner that modulates the heat demand of the roasting process. The results show that the profitability of these investments is highly influenced by the natural gas/electricity cost ratio, by the coffee torrefaction production capacity and by the intermittency level of discharged heat. The MGT appears as a more profitable option than waste-heat recovery via the ORC engine due to the intermittency of the heat source and the relatively high electricity/heat cost ratio...|$|R
40|$|The Si isotopic {{composition}} of Earth's mantle {{is thought to}} be homogeneous (δ 30 Si=- 0. 29 ± 0. 08 ‰, 2 s. d.) and not greatly affected by <b>partial</b> melting and <b>recycling.</b> Previous analyses of evolved igneous material indicate that such rocks are isotopically heavy relative to the mantle. To understand this variation, it is necessary to investigate the degree of Si isotopic fractionation that takes place during magmatic differentiation. Here we report Si {{isotopic composition}}s of lavas from Hekla volcano, Iceland, which has formed in a region devoid of old, geochemically diverse crust. We show that Si isotopic composition varies linearly as a function of silica content, with more differentiated rocks possessing heavier isotopic compositions. Data for samples from the Afar Rift Zone, as well as various igneous USGS standards are collinear with the Hekla trend, providing evidence of a fundamental relationship between magmatic differentiation and Si isotopes. The effect of fractionation has been tested by studying cumulates from the Skaergaard Complex, which show that olivine and pyroxene are isotopically light, and plagioclase heavy, relative to the Si isotopic composition of the Earth's mantle. Therefore, Si isotopes can be utilised to model the competing effects of mafic and felsic mineral fractionation in evolving silicate liquids and cumulates. At an average SiO 2 content of ∼ 60 wt. %, the predicted δ 30 Si value of the continental crust that should result from magmatic fractionation alone is - 0. 23 ± 0. 05 ‰ (2 s. e.), barely heavier than the mantle. This is, at most, a maximum estimate, as this {{does not take into account}} weathered material whose formation drives the products toward lighter δ 30 Si values. Mass balance calculations suggest that removal of continental crust of this composition from the upper mantle will not affect the Si isotopic composition of the mantle. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Hot mix asphalt {{recycling}} {{has become}} common practice {{all over the}} world since the 1970 s because of the crisis in oil prices. In the Netherlands, hot recycling has advanced {{to such an extent that}} in most of the mixtures more than 50 % of reclaimed asphalt (RA) is allowed. These mixtures with such a high RA content are produced in a batch plant to which a parallel drum is attached. In this drum RA is pre-heated to approximately 130 °C. Since 2007 another hot mix recycling techniques became available in which RA is mixed in cold and moist condition in contrary to conventional methods. It is a so called double barrel drum mixer. In this method virgin aggregates are superheated in the inner drum and mixed with cool and moist RA and fines and virgin bitumen in the outer drum. In both cases, double drum and partial heating methods, the virgin aggregates have to be pre-heated to higher temperatures than with mixtures without RA in order to achieve a mixing temperature of around 170 °C. Dependent on RA amount, moisture, pre-heating, etc. in the batch plant the virgin aggregates have to be pre-heated to around 300 ° C and in the double barrel drum to around 500 °C. These high temperatures have led to concerns about the quality of the produced mixtures. Since 2008, a new Dutch specification system for asphalt mixtures is in place in line with the European standards (EN 13108 series). The new regulation gives contractors freedom to select their own material such as bitumen grade and the amount of recycling; however, in return it makes them responsible for the quality of the mixture. The mixture should fulfill the requirement of fundamental performance characteristics of the mixtures such as resistance to fatigue and permanent deformation. In this research two major questions have been investigated. One of the questions is whether these high temperatures have a negative effect on the bituminous binder, while the other important question is whether the RA binder will blend totally with the virgin binder that is added. The focus of this research was on four objectives. The first objective was to develop a laboratory mixing method to simulate the real recycling process in the field. The second objective was to assess the effect of the double barrel drum on the mixture quality in comparison with conventional batch plant. Third, it was aimed to measure the blending degree between two binders. And finally, to increase the understanding of the mechanism behind blending RA binders with virgin bitumen, with focus on their micro structure. To cover all research topics, this dissertation is organized in two parts in which the first part is devoted to laboratory and field mixture evaluation while the second part is presenting the exploratory research on the fundamental aspects of blending. Research in part 1 is conducted in two phases, laboratory simulation and field experimentation. The conventional <b>partial</b> warming <b>recycling</b> method (PW) the upgraded double drum mixing method (UPG) were simulated in the lab and the quality of mixtures were compared with the standard mixing method (SM) in the lab at different RA content and different moisture content. This research showed that higher percentages of RA results in higher stiffness and lower fatigue life. However in the UPG method with 4 % moisture and 60 % RA, the mixture became remarkably lower in stiffness and durable against fatigue. This might be because of the lack of blending or the effect of foaming of bitumen. It was concluded that the UPG method could not effectively be simulated in the lab. In the next experimental phase of the study, three identical mixtures were produced with 50 % RA and 4. 3 % bitumen. One mixture was produced in a batch plant (BB) while the second one was mixed using a double drum mixer by the same contractor (A). The third mixture was produced in the laboratory (L) using a lab pugmill mixer. The comparison between three mixtures shows that mixture L has a higher stiffness than A and BB. Mixture BB has as slightly higher stiffness than A. Furthermore, mixture A has the lowest stiffness which is most probably due to the system of cold and moist RA feeding into the double drum system. Besides the 4 PB fatigue and stiffness test, monotonic uniaxial tension (UT) and compression (UC) tests were performed to be used in material modeling and to determine a fatigue endurance limit. The limit value of the stress ratio parameter (Rlimit) was determined which is useful in the determination of the endurance limit in a three-dimensional state. It shows that different mixing methods lead to different endurance limits. It turns out that the plant produced mixture has a higher endurance limit than the laboratory mixture. In this research an infrared thermography method was used in every material preparation stage. The temperature homogeneity of the mixtures in the lab and in the field was investigated. It proved to be a useful method in visualizing the temperature exchange during mixing and compaction. In Part 2, the effect of superheating aggregates is studied by simulating RA and real aggregates with glass beads and artificial aged binder. The stage extraction method was evaluated in this research with respect to size and shape of aggregates. The blending and diffusion mechanism between old and new bitumen is studied at the microstructure level by means of Nano indention and Nano-CT scanning. The morphology of different types of bitumen was detectable by these techniques; however the blending zone couldn’t be characterized. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Nature utilizes carbon dioxide as starting material for storing sun energy in plant hydrocarbons. A similar approach, storing energy from renewable sources in chemical bonds with CO 2 as starting material, may lead to <b>partial</b> <b>recycling</b> of CO 2 created by human industrial activities. Unfortunately, currently available routes for the transformation of CO 2 involve high temperatures and are often not selective.

The system discussed is a modified recirculating living machine in which recycling and recovery of water is accomplished. The {{primary purpose of the}} design is to treat the black and gray water waste streams from the FMARS habitat. However, biomass is also produced by the system that shows potential for the provision of other life support functions. The system is designed to recycle for reuse all wash water and toilet waste from the FMARS habitat. Options are presented for both full recycling to potable use and for <b>partial</b> <b>recycling</b> to non-potable use. The design comprises a sequential system of treatment unit processes, beginning with an anaerobic digester, followed by a trickling filter, constructed wetland, and then a disinfection and purification step. It is intended that the system will attach via appropriate plumbing to the exterior of the FMARS structure; hence the system is designed to be modular and transportable. The system could be located in either a greenhouse or a closed structure with artificial lighting, depending upon energy budget considerations. A scaled design is presented as a possible floor plan with quantitative sizing of unit process components based on a hypothetical crew number and loading rate. While the focus of the analysis is on a design for wastewater treatment and reuse, discussion is provided on ways of expanding the system to provide additional life support functions desirable for actual Mars habitation...|$|E
30|$|The {{mammalian}} {{gastrointestinal tract}} is host to a diverse microbial ecosystem {{that helps to}} shape host immunity and metabolism, as well as support epithelial barrier function. Several lines of evidence suggest that degradation of Cr and creatinine by gut microbiota may impact host physiology and pathology. In contrast to the non-enzymatic conversion of PCr and Cr to creatinine that occurs in vertebrates, {{a growing number of}} microorganisms have been shown to express specific enzymes such as creatinine deaminase and creatine amidinohydrolase that mediate creatinine and Cr breakdown. In several Bacillus, Clostridia and Escherichia strains, creatinine is degraded solely to 1 -methylhydantoin and ammonia via creatinine deaminase, while in some Pseudomonas, Brevibacterium and anaerobic Clostridia species, 1 -methylhydantoin can be degraded further to sarcosine and glycine [19]. Studies in uremic patients with highly elevated serum creatinine indicate that diffusion of creatinine into the gut lumen can induce microbial creatinine amidohydrolase, creatinine deaminase and Cr amidinohydrolase activity, resulting in creatinine metabolism and <b>partial</b> <b>recycling</b> of Cr [54, 55]. Interestingly, gut microbial taxonomic profiling in a mouse model of senescence recently revealed luminal Cr degradation as a prominent, overrepresented bacterial-encoded signature in older frail mice [56]. This finding is particularly intriguing in light of clinical studies that show Cr supplementation in the elderly promotes muscle strength and hypertrophy [57], and protects against age-related progressive muscle wasting (sarcopenia) [58]. Whether the dysbiosis that is characteristic of IBD can alter Cr metabolism in the gut has yet to be elucidated, but may define an important and previously overlooked axis of host-microbial crosstalk in intestinal inflammation.|$|E
40|$|GEOTHERMAL ENERGY CHALLENGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This {{feasibility}} study investigates whether a geothermal district heating system, which accesses Hot Sedimentary Aquifer (HSA) resources underlying a brownfield site at Guardbridge in northeast Fife, {{can be developed}} in a cost-effective manner. This project’s scope is to assess the available geological information and estimate the hot saline aquifer heat supply, calculate the current heat demand at the Guardbridge site, Guardbridge village, and the nearby towns of Leuchars and Balmullo, and to incorporate future Guardbridge development plans (provided by the University of St Andrews) and anticipated growth in housing stock (from Fife Council) to estimate future heat demand. The capital, maintenance and repair costs for the geothermal well and designed district heating network are used to develop economic models {{for a number of}} district heat network scenarios. A key aspect of this study is an evaluation of the opportunities to cost effectively de-risk deep geothermal exploration in Central Scotland, and to outline the potential for developing geological heat storage systems. The study identifies the key legislative and environmental issues, risks and uncertainties associated with any exploration and production, involves stakeholder engagement, and makes recommendations for a Phase 2 stage for geothermal heat development at Guardbridge. Two of the key outputs from this {{feasibility study}} will be an economic model and business case based on different heat demand options, and an optimised model of well design based on different exploration strategies. Both are transferable to similar operations at other geothermal sites. The key objectives are therefore to: (a) design a geothermal well that will be drilled in Phase 2 of the project, and secure valuable information on Fife regional sub-surface geology and geothermal properties of the primary aquifer, (b) explore how advanced drilling techniques, such as directional drilling, can be deployed to improve geothermal recovery, (c) demonstrate how a geothermal system can integrate with an existing biomass heating installation to optimise both schemes and provide a district heat network for on-site industries and the local community, (d) evaluate the potential for storage of seasonal heat energy in the subsurface (a first in Scotland), and (e) assess the relative merits of water treatment and on-site recycling, reinjection or disposal to sea. A regional geological model was constructed using available data from the British Geological Survey, published data and academic theses. The sub-surface geology was interpreted from surface geology and extrapolating the local behaviour of geological structures into the Guardbridge area. Modelling the geology involved defining the orientation and width of a natural fault zone, which could be a significant influence on the behaviour of the Hot Sedimentary Aquifers. The rock units of interest in this study are the Upper Devonian Scone Sandstone, Glenvale Sandstone, Knox Pulpit and Kinnesswood formations, and the latter two units are previously identified as having the highest potential to be highly productive aquifers. The presence of a major fault near the Guardbridge site means that the target aquifers are at very different depths {{on either side of the}} fault. The report therefore investigates and evaluates three well options to target the different aquifers at the varying depths on either side of the fault. Hydrogeological modelling was conducted using FEFLOW® to evaluate the behaviour of the fault on fluid flow rates, and to predict the necessary conductivities to produce reasonable, economic and sustainable rates of fluid extraction. Although not an accurate model of the Guardbridge site, and limited by a significant lack of data constraining the important parameters, the flow simulations suggest that fracture permeability in the aquifers and underlying rocks is needed to sustain the flows recommended by this study, and re-injection would be required if a producing well was to be sustainable over many decades. Regionally developed rock quality predictors have been used to estimate the permeability and temperature of the target aquifer intervals in the three selected well options at, or near, Guardbridge. Oil field well simulation tools have been used to estimate water flow rates, temperature profiles, and circulating rates from different geological models of the wells. Two of the wells, GB- 1 and ES- 1, are not expected to penetrate enough high permeability sandstone to support the minimum water flow rates of 5 l/s and so are ruled out as viable aquifer producers. GB- 2 is a deviated well that penetrates the Kinnesswood and Knox Pulpit formations, the best quality regional aquifers, in a zone where the fault may enhance the permeability even more, and has potential to supply 5 to 20 l/s of water at a surface temperature of 25 oC (± 2 oC). Such a well will be produced using an electric submersible pump which will require 20 - 40 kw of power to deliver 15 l/s of flow (although the volumetric rate will vary with the rock quality). GB- 2 is taken forward and drilling designs are provided with three outcomes: 1) a dry hole scenario; 2) a 5 l/s scenario; and, 3) a 15 l/s scenario. The vertical wells have been modelled as heat pump circulating wells, and therefore would not produce any aquifer water at the surface. Only deeper wells, up to 2500 m, have the potential to give surface temperature increase of 5 oC at reasonable circulation rates (e. g. 8 l/s). A deep GB- 1 well as a heat pump could be taken forward in Phase 2 as an alternative heat source. The proposed GB- 2 deviated well can be drilled across the fault from the Guardbridge site to a depth of 1200 m. A casing string set will isolate the shallow geology and a slotted liner used to prevent hole collapse of the target intervals. Such a well will require a 100 tonne conventional drilling rig and well control, logging and coring tools will assess the aquifer quality. In the most likely case, the drilling phase will take 24 days, including rig mobilisation and demobilisation. If coring and logging demonstrate that the well will not flow adequately, then the well will be suspended. Low cost options have been investigated that would allow exploratory wells to be drilled and this could result in the recovery of regionally significant data on the performance of the aquifers at depth, although none of the boreholes could be completed to production stage due the drilling technology employed. The drilling scenarios investigated do not include a re-injection well, in order to create an economically viable district heating network project, even though very preliminary hydrogeological modelling demonstrates that re-injection is required if the geothermal well is to be sustainable over 30 + years. Alternative management of produced water investigated in this report are: water disposal-tosea and partial-full water recycling and re-use on site. The first option could have environmental consequences on the adjacent Eden Estuary, which is part of the Tay River and Eden Estuary Special Protection Area, and these potential impacts would need formal assessment by a competent authority (Fife Council and SNH) as part of a Habitat Regulations Appraisal, and an Environmental Impact Assessment is most likely required. The second option reduces the environmental impacts on the estuary, but has additional CAPEX and OPEX costs which are estimated. The opportunity to be innovative about <b>partial</b> water <b>recycling</b> and resale should be investigated in Phase 2. The heat demand is based on preliminary district heating network layouts at different scales, based on the demand analysis. Demand has been assessed at Guardbridge and the nearby towns of Leuchars and Balmullo, using the Scotland Heat Map and future development data provided by the University of St Andrews and the Fife Development Plan. These various options provide an indication of the potential annual and peak heating demands that can then be compared against the geothermal heating potential, and an economic modelling tool was developed to analyse the performance of the overall system, including key performance indicators to evaluate the financial viability. This analysis leads to a preliminary network design and an economic model of the potential scheme. The District Heating Opportunity Assessment Tool (DHOAT) designed for the Danish Energy Agency analyses the Heat Map data and preliminary network designs and provides peak and annual demands and key performance indicators, namely total heat demand and indicative CAPEX, OPEX, REPEX and heat sales. All input parameters are modelled with an uncertainty of ± 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{dopamine}} transporter (DAT) mediates reuptake of released dopamine and is {{the target}} for psychostimulants, such as cocaine and amphetamine. DAT undergoes marked constitutive endocytosis, but {{little is known about}} the fate and sorting of the endocytosed transporter. To study DAT sorting in cells lines, we fused the one-transmembrane segment protein Tac to DAT, thereby generating a transporter (TacDAT) with an extracellular antibody epitope suited for trafficking studies. TacDAT was functional and endocytosed constitutively in HEK 293 cells. According to an ELISA-based assay, TacDAT intracellular accumulation was increased by the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin and by monensin, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation and recycling. Monensin also reduced TacDAT surface expression consistent with <b>partial</b> <b>recycling.</b> In both HEK 293 cells and in the dopaminergic cell line 1 Rb 3 An 27, constitutively internalized TacDAT displayed primary co-localization with the late endosomal marker Rab 7, less co-localization with the “short loop” recycling marker Rab 4, and little co-localization with the marker of “long loop” recycling endosomes, Rab 11. Removal by mutation of N-terminal ubiquitination sites did not affect this sorting pattern. The sorting pattern was distinct from a bona fide recycling membrane protein, the β 2 -adrenergic receptor, that co-localized primarily with Rab 11 and Rab 4. Constitutively internalized wild type DAT probed with the fluorescently tagged cocaine analogue JHC 1 - 64, exhibited the same co-localization pattern as TacDAT in 1 Rb 3 An 27 cells and in cultured midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We conclude that DAT is constitutively internalized and sorted in a ubiquitination-independent manner to late endosomes/lysosomes and in part to a Rab 4 positive short loop recycling pathway...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe 15 N/ 14 N {{signature}} of animal proteins is now {{commonly used to}} understand their physiology and quantify the flows of nutrient in trophic webs. These studies assume that animals are predictably 15 N-enriched relative to their food, but the isotopic mechanism which accounts for this enrichment remains unknown. We developed a box model of the nitrogen isotope cycle in mammals in order to predict the 15 N/ 14 N ratios of body reservoirs {{as a function of}} time, N intake and body mass. Results of modeling show that a combination of kinetic isotope fractionation during the N transfer between amines and equilibrium fractionation related to the reversible conversion of N-amine into ammonia is required to account for the well-established ≈ 4 ‰ 15 N-enrichment of body proteins relative to the diet. This isotopic enrichment observed in proteins is due to the <b>partial</b> <b>recycling</b> of 15 N-enriched urea and the urinary excretion of a fraction of the strongly 15 N-depleted ammonia reservoir. For a given body mass and diet δ 15 N, the isotopic compositions are mainly controlled by the N intake. Increase of the urea turnover combined with a decrease of the N intake lead to calculate a δ 15 N increase of the proteins, in agreement with the observed increase of collagen δ 15 N of herbivorous animals with aridity. We further show that the low δ 15 N collagen values of cave bears cannot be attributed to the dormancy periods as it is commonly thought, but inversely to the hyperphagia behavior. This model highlights the need for experimental investigations performed with large mammals in order to improve our understanding of natural variations of δ 15 N collagen...|$|E
