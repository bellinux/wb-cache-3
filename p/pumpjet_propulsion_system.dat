2500|$|As a {{refinement}} {{of the preceding}} Swiftsure-class, {{the design of the}} Trafalgar-class bears some similarity, including its internal layout and the Rolls-Royce PWR1 Core 3. However some improvements over the Swiftsure class include its reduced acoustic signature, thanks to the hull being covered in anechoic tiles which are designed to absorb sound rather than reflect it, making the boats quieter and more difficult to detect with active sonar. A <b>pumpjet</b> <b>propulsion</b> <b>system</b> is also used from boat 2 onward, rather than a conventional propeller. The Trafalgar-class are [...] long, have a beam of , a draught of [...] and a dived displacement of 5,300 tonnes. Each boat has a complement of 130. Like all Royal Navy submarines, the Trafalgar class have strengthened fins and retractable hydroplanes, allowing them to surface through thick ice.|$|E
