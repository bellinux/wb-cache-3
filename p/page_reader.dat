40|$|We {{present an}} {{automatic}} method for constructing high-performance preclassification decision trees for OCR. Good preclassifiers must prune {{the set of}} alternative classes to a small number without erroneously pruning the correct class. We build the decision tree using greedy entropy minimization, using pseudo-randomly generated training samples derived from a model of imaging defects, and then "populate" the tree with many more samples to drive down the error rate. We describe a refinement of the method of [BM 94] that approaches the user-specified accuracy more closely and thus allows higher pruning. The essential technical device is a leaf-selection rule based on the Good-Turing Theorem [Good 53]. Such a preclassifier, constructed for a panEuropean polyfont classifier, attains a 1 % error rate and a 3. 8 pruning factor, in tests on synthetic images. On real pages printed in ten European languages, the preclassifier sped up the <b>page</b> <b>reader</b> {{by a factor of}} 2. 2, with no measurable increase in [...] ...|$|E
