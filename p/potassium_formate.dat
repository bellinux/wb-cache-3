50|$|Saturated {{sodium formate}} {{solutions}} (as well as mixtures of other alkali metal <b>formates</b> such as <b>potassium</b> and cesium <b>formate)</b> {{are used as}} important drilling and stabilizing aids in gas and oil exploration because of their relatively high density. By mixing the corresponding saturated alkali metal formate solutions any densities between 1,0 and 2,3 g/cm3 can be set. The saturated solutions are biocidal and long-term stable against microbial degradation. Diluted, on the other hand, they are fast and completely biodegradable. As alkali metal formates as drilling aids make it unnecessary to add solid fillers to increase the density (such as barytes) and the formate solutions can be recovered and recycled at the drilling site, formates represent an important advance in exploration technology.|$|R
5000|$|The {{high density}} of the caesium formate brine (up to 2.3 g·cm−3, or 19.2 pounds per gallon), coupled with the {{relatively}} benign nature of most caesium compounds, reduces the requirement for toxic high-density suspended solids in the drilling fluid—a significant technological, engineering and environmental advantage. Unlike the components of many other heavy liquids, caesium formate is relatively environment-friendly. Caesium formate brine can be blended with <b>potassium</b> and sodium <b>formates</b> to decrease the {{density of the}} fluids to that of water (1.0 g·cm−3, or 8.3 pounds per gallon). Furthermore, it is biodegradable and may be recycled, which is important in view of its high cost (about $4,000 per barrel in 2001). Alkali formates are safe to handle and do not damage the producing formation or downhole metals as corrosive alternative, high-density brines (such as zinc bromide [...] solutions) sometimes do; they also require less cleanup and reduce disposal costs.|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} gas {{production}} technique {{was used to}} screen different organic acids (formic, propionic, lactic, citric, and fumaric acid), organic salts (calcium <b>formate,</b> <b>potassium</b> sorbate, and sodium benzoate), and inorganic phosphoric acid {{for their ability to}} modulate microbial fermentation in the digestive tract of piglets. For the incubation, 40 ml of culture medium (53 % buffer, 45 % frozen ileal digesta, and 2 % fresh faeces) was dispensed in vessels containing 5 ml of buffer, 0. 5 g of feed, and 20 ìl of liquid or 20 mg of solid acidifiers. Gas production was measured every 15 min during the 24 h incubation at 39 °C, and a Gompertz bacterial growth model was applied to the gas production data. Formic acid was the only acid that reduced the maximum rate of gas production (ìm) compared to that in the control treatment (P 0. 05). When investigating formic-acid-based mixtures that contained 15 % of potassium sorbate and/or sodium benzoate, the estimated parameters for the Gompertz growth model did not differ from those for treatments with plain formic acid (P > 0. 05). However, concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, and n-butyric acid were reduced by all the mixtures (P 0. 05). In conclusion, organic acids and salts were found to differ in their ability to modulate microbial fermentation in the digestive tract of piglets. Mixing formic acid with potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate changed fermentation patterns, and the possibility to use them to enhance the antimicrobial effect of formic acid should be investigated further in vivo. ...|$|R

40|$|Eight {{different}} poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) /salt aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS's) {{were characterized}} at 23 °C. PEGs with different molecular weights (1500 and 8000) were combined with different salts (sodium or <b>potassium</b> citrates and <b>formates)</b> {{to study the}} effect of each ATPS constituent in the phase diagram. The binodal curve and several tie-lines were determined for each system using common analytical techniques described in the literature for ATPS's (cloud point method, conductivity, and gravimetric analysis after lyophilization). According to the results, {{it was found that}} each ATPS constituent produced a particular effect in the phase diagram. For the salts, changes in the anion produced larger variations in the heterogeneous region size than changes of the cation. Thus, the effect of salt type seems to be largely dependent on the anion, which makes the dominant contribution. The ability to form ATPS's is connected with the Gibbs energy of hydration, ΔG hyd, of the anions: more negative ΔG hyd values facilitate ATPS formation. Changes in the PEG molecular weight affected also the phase diagram: the size of the heterogeneous region increases with the increase in the polymer molecular weight.

40|$|Sodium <b>formate,</b> <b>potassium</b> acetate and {{a mixture}} of calcium and {{magnesium}} acetate (CMA) have all been identified as effective de-icing agents. In this project an attempt {{has been made to}} elucidate potentially deleterious effects of these substances on the durability of reinforced concrete. Aspects involving the corrosion behaviour of embedded steel along with the chemical and physical degradation of the cementitious matrix were studied. Ionic diffusion characteristics of deicer/pore solution systems in hardened cement paste were also studied since rates of ingress of deleterious agents into cement paste are commonly diffusion-controlled. It was found that all the compounds tested were generally non-corrosive to embedded steel, however, in a small number of cases potassium acetate did cause corrosion. Potassium acetate was also found to cause cracking in concrete and cement paste samples. CMA appeared to degrade hydrated cement paste although this was apparently less of a problem when commercial grade CMA was used in place of the reagent grade chemical. This was thought to be due to the insoluble material present in the commercial formulation forming a physical barrier between the concrete and the de-icing solution. With the test regimes used sodium formate was not seen to have any deleterious effect on the integrity of reinforced concrete. As a means of restoring the corrosion protective character of chloride-contaminated concrete the process of electrochemical chloride removal has been previously developed. Potential side-effects of this method and the effect of external electrolyte composition on chloride removal efficiency were investigated. It was seen that the composition of the external electrolyte has a significant effect on the amount of chloride removed. It was also found that, due to alterations to the composition of the C 3 A hydration reaction products, it was possible to remove bound chloride as well as that in the pore solution. The use of an external electrolyte containing lithium ions was also tried as a means of preventing cathodically-induced alkali-silica reaction in concretes containing potentially reactive aggregates. The results obtained were inconclusive and further practical development of this approach is needed...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} air pollutants and meteorology in Chicago, Illinois during summers 2010, 2011, and 2012. Sixty-six collection days of air pollutant and meteorological data were completed at the Loyola University Chicago sampling station atop Mertz Hall. Trace gases, nitrogen oxides and ozone, {{as well as the}} water-soluble fraction of aerosol material were the air pollutants of focus in this study. Data analysis showed that chloride, nitrate, sulfate, and oxalate were the most frequently quantified water-soluble ions in aerosol samples, followed by acetate, <b>formate,</b> <b>potassium,</b> phosphate, calcium, and magnesium ions. Ionic ratios showed that stationary sources, vehicular emissions, and secondary production contributed to ions 2 ̆ 7 presence in the local atmosphere, however, each summer had a different combination of sources. Each summer had a different dominant wind direction profile, which contributed to the variability in ion and trace gas concentrations in the local atmosphere, as well as temperature, wind speed, and humidity variability. Collection days were classified based on wind direction to define non-lake breeze, lake breeze, and variable days. The onset of a lake breeze varied from 0900 to 1245 local time (LT) and onset time was significantly affected by both morning wind speed and temperature. The majority of air pollutants were not significantly affected (Student t test) by the onset of lake breeze circulation. However, ozone, sulfate, nitrate, and chloride concentrations were significantly different (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) on lake breeze days compared to non-lake breeze days. Summer 2010 - 2012 data was compared to summer 2002 - 2004 data collected at the same location. Nitrogen oxides and sulfate concentrations decreased, however, ozone and many water-soluble ions increased in concentration since the earlier study. Identifying point sources of air pollution and calculating backward air parcel trajectories proved valuable in understanding pollution variability. Additionally, canonical correlation analysis and principal component analysis were independently applied to sets of air pollutant and meteorological data from summers 2002 - 2004 and 2010 - 2012. Both methods uncovered multivariate relationships between pollutant-pollutant and pollutant-meteorological variables. With this information, {{a better understanding of the}} complex nature of pollutants and their dependence on meteorology was achieved...|$|R

50|$|The high {{freezing}} point depression e.g. {{in comparison to the}} still frequently used urea (which is effective but problematic due to eutrophication) effectively prevents the re-icing, even at temperatures below −15 °C. The thawing effect of the solid sodium formate can even be increased by moistening with aqueous <b>potassium</b> <b>formate</b> or potassium acetate solutions. The degradability of sodium formate is particularly advantageous with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 211 mg O2/g compared with the de-icing agents sodium acetate (740 mg O2/g) and urea with (> 2,000 mg O2/g).|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of freezing-point depression has many practical uses. The radiator fluid {{in an automobile}} {{is a mixture of}} water and ethylene glycol. As a result of freezing-point depression, radiators do not freeze in winter (unless it is extremely cold, e.g. -30 to -40 C). Road salting takes advantage of this effect to lower the freezing point of the ice it is placed on. Lowering the freezing point allows the street ice to melt at lower temperatures, preventing the accumulation of dangerous, slippery ice. Commonly used sodium chloride can depress the freezing point of water to about -21 C. If the road surface temperature is lower NaCl becomes ineffective and other salts are used, such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or a mixture of many. These salts are somewhat aggressive to metals, especially iron, so in airports safer media such as sodium formate, <b>potassium</b> <b>formate,</b> sodium acetate, potassium acetate are used instead.|$|E
5000|$|Water-based mud (WBM): Most basic {{water-based}} mud systems {{begin with}} water, then clays and other chemicals {{are incorporated into}} the water to create a homogeneous blend resembling something between chocolate milk and a malt (depending on viscosity).

40|$|The {{environmental}} concerns {{have led to}} the urge of the usage of non-conventional energy resources like solar, wind, thermal, geothermal etc. which provide enormous source of energy without causing any further diminution of the environment. Instead of the conventional HVAC systems that cause colossal environmental perils, usage of liquid desiccants in coming in vogue whereby reducing ecological threats. Moreover, solar assisted systems provide further impulse to such systems.

Its application as a thermodynamic inhibitor is of large interest due to its properties, especially for shut-in wells as the salt is considered very heavy and has a large solubility in water. The distribution of the salts sodium chloride (NaCl) and <b>potassium</b> <b>formate</b> (HCOOK) in a two-meter vertical pipe was investigated to simulate a shut-in well or riser. The salt solutions {{were added to the}} top of the distilled water filled pipe. Pycnometers were used to measure the brine densities at different heights in the pipe. Higher densities corresponded with more salt. The hypothesis about the heavy HCOOK salt accumulating at the bottom of the pipe was not confirmed, when it was found that both salts became almost homogeneously dispersed in the pipe after short time for all brine concentrations investigated. It means that the salt would inhibit the whole water phase and not only the lower or upper part, as the conventional hydrate inhibitors in the petroleum industry are known to do. <b>Potassium</b> <b>formate</b> s quick distribution to a homogeneous mix could improve flow assurance in production wells. It is an advantage for producing wells to have a homogeneous salt distribution, because the whole water phase gets protected against hydrates.

40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} direct reductive amination of {{aldehydes}} and ketones, including α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, has been developed, which requires <b>potassium</b> <b>formate</b> as reductant and palladium acetate as catalyst. Suitable amines include both {{primary and secondary}} aliphatic and aromatic amines. Key words: reductive amination, <b>potassium</b> <b>formate,</b> palladium acetate, one-pot reaction The direct reductive amination of carbonyl compounds 1 is a useful organic transformation for preparing primary, secondary and tertiary amines. The carbonyl compound initially reacts with ammonia or amine to form an imine, which then undergoes reduction in presence of hydrogen or hydride ion (Scheme 1). The term ‘direct reductive am-ination ’ is used to describe a reaction in which a mixture of the carbonyl compound and the amine is treated with suitable reducing agent in a one-pot operation. 1 b Several reductive systems are known to effect {{the reduction of the}} C–N double bond of the imine. The Borch reduction, 2 one of the early methods, involves sodium cyanoborohydride, [NaBH 3 CN], as the reductant.

40|$|De-icing {{chemicals}} are {{spread on the}} runways to prevent the formation of ice and snow. Formerly used urea, which causes environmental concerns, {{has been replaced by}} mainly <b>potassium</b> <b>formate</b> and potassium acetate based de-icing chemicals. Also betaine based products, developed in Finland, are used as de-icers. The introduction of these new alkali metal based de-icers was followed by an increase in the occurrence of corrosion in different parts of aircrafts, such as cadmium-plated steel parts. The aim of this thesis was to study the corrosive effect of several new de-icing chemicals on cadmium coat-ings and to compare results obtained using various test methods. 	This thesis consists of theoretical and experimental parts. In the literature review, the corrosion mechanisms of cadmium are presented, the de-icing chemicals as a corrosive environment are evaluated, and different corrosion tests for examining the in-fluence of de-icing chemicals on cadmium coatings are described. In the experimental part, the results from different corrosion tests are compared and the corrosive effect of de-icers is researched. Also the effect of de-icing chemical concentration and the cad-mium coating quality on corrosion are examined. The chemicals used in the tests were commercial <b>potassium</b> <b>formate</b> and acetate, pure <b>potassium</b> <b>formate</b> and acetate as well as betaine based commercial de-icing chemical. In this thesis, four different test pro-grams were used, from which two are immersion tests and two cyclic exposure tests, in which the specimens are in turns immersed in the de-icing chemical and in turns in en-vironmental exposure in a heating chamber. The specimens contained four different types of cadmium coatings deposited in three different coating plants. The corrosive ef-fect of each de-icer on cadmium coatings were evaluated after the corrosion tests by weight change measurements and scanning electron microscope. 	According to the results, potassium formates were more corrosive than potassium acetates based on the higher measured weight losses. Betaine based Betafrost B did not cause significant weight changes, thus being the least corrosive of the studied chemicals. In the one month long cyclic exposure test, Boeing 2004, corrosion inhibitors included in commercial <b>potassium</b> <b>formate</b> and commercial potassium acetate decreased the corrosion rate of cadmium, whereas according to the two weeks long cyclic exposure test, AMS G- 12 (2009), the corrosion inhibitors did not decrease the corrosion rate. Undiluted chemicals caused significantly more corrosion on the cadmium coatings than chemicals diluted to 50 % and 25 % by their weight. According to the one month long cyclic exposure test, dull finished specimens lost less weight than bright finished, but otherwise the quality of the cadmium coatings did not influence substantially the results. 	Immersion tests did not produce very reliable results because of the large devia-tions caused by the small weight changes. One day long standardized immersion test ASTM F 1111 was insufficient for evaluating the corrosive effect of de-icers on cad-mium coatings, and {{there is a need to}} develop a new better standard test procedure.
