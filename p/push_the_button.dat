The winning bid was $26,000, placed by a consortium of eight demolition contractors who currently undertake demolitions in the Christchurch Central City (D Construction, Dormer Construction, Jurgens Demolition, March Construction, Pro Tranz Contracting, Clampet Developments, Shilton and Brown Demolition, and Ward's Demolition). They gave {{the right to choose}} a person to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> to the Child Cancer Foundation, who nominated a six-year-old boy from Queenstown.|$|E
25|$|Some {{while after}} this, the Doctor was {{captured}} by Marnal, {{one of the few}} surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of K9 (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the Matrix within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As The Gallifrey Chronicles ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{announcement}} was made that the implosion had been approved, {{it was reported that}} the demolition contractors considered putting the right to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> for the implosion up for auction, with the proceeds going to charity. [...] "I've seen them go for $6,000" [...] is how one of the company representatives was quoted, but the issue of liability needed to be worked through. The auction was set up on the internet auction website Trade Me and went live on Tuesday, 24 July, at 11am. It was set up with a $1 reserve (meaning that theoretically, the right to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> could have been sold for just $1). The auction was hugely popular and within one hour, bidding had reached $6,000. Bidding reached $30,000, but some bids were considered illegitimate and Trade Me staff removed them, and in other cases, bidders themselves requested to be removed.|$|E

500|$|Sugababes {{performed}} [...] "Ugly" [...] at the V Festival in 2006 {{as part of}} a set list, {{which included}} Hole in the Head, Red Dress and <b>Push</b> <b>the</b> <b>Button.</b> Reviewers from The Sun said that the Sugababes [...] "proved both that pop can work at festivals and that losing Mutya has not caused them to miss a beat". In 2008, they performed the song at the same event in the JJB Champion Arena, {{as part of a}} set list which included <b>Push</b> <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> and About You Now. The performance received positive reviews, with a reviewer from MTV UK calling it [...] "a highlight of our festival in the JJB Arena". In August 2007, former group member Mutya Buena, who left the band shortly following the single's release, performed the song at the V Festival in Chelmsford; before playing it, she stated: [...] "This song is one I sang with my previous group... It's called 'Ugly'". On 18 September 2007, Sugababes performed an acoustic version of [...] "Ugly" [...] at the Indig02 as part of a set list, which included such songs as [...] "Freak Like Me", [...] "Round Round", [...] "In the Middle", [...] "Red Dress" [...] and [...] "Too Lost In You".

500|$|... "The Boxer" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by English electronic music duo The Chemical Brothers for their fifth studio album <b>Push</b> <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> (2005). It served as the album's third single in the United Kingdom and Europe, released by Virgin Records and Freestyle Dust, and as the second single in the United States via Astralwerks. The song is a psychedelic pop track which features The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess on vocals and as a co-writer. This is the second collaboration of Burgess and the duo, following [...] "Life is Sweet", which was released ten years earlier. Both performed the track together at the BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms in 2007.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{consists of}} various computer beats and electronic effects. The song contains an ascending bridge {{incorporated into the}} chorus, which consists of the lines: [...] "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> {{and let me know}} / Before I get the wrong idea and go." [...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons to the sound of pop group ABBA.|$|E

500|$|The {{right to}} <b>push</b> <b>the</b> <b>button</b> for the {{implosion}} {{was put up}} for auction on Trade Me, and became that website's third most viewed auction. The winning bid of [...] was made by a consortium of demolition contractors, who allowed the Child Cancer Foundation to nominate a six-year-old boy from Queenstown to trigger the event. The implosion, which was carefully monitored to assess the suitability of this demolition method for potential future applications, went without any problems and it is anticipated that this will have {{paved the way for}} many more implosions in New Zealand in general, and in Christchurch in particular. But as of 2016, only one further implosion has been carried out.|$|E
500|$|When The Chemical Brothers {{started to}} write music again after {{finishing}} the album Come with Us (2002), [...] "The Boxer" [...] {{was one of}} the earliest tracks that they wrote for their next album, <b>Push</b> <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> (2005). The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess, who had collaborated on the duo's debut album track [...] "Life Is Sweet" [...] ten years earlier, contributed the vocals to this song. According to the group, out of all collaborators, Burgess still remained a close friend to them. [...] "If he's in London, we would probably have a drink together, three of us, or, you know, when we're in LA, he will come to our gig," [...] they shared.|$|E

After this success, the established electronic group, The Chemical Brothers, soon collaborated with Okereke for [...] "Believe", a track on their <b>Push</b> <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> album. An album of remixes of tracks from Silent Alarm had also been released {{at the end of}} August 2005 in the UK. This remix album, entitled Silent Alarm Remixed, retained the album's original track list and includes remixes from the likes of Ladytron, M83, Death from Above 1979, Four Tet, and Mogwai.|$|E
