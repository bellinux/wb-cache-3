40|$|Project Knowledge Management {{and more}} {{specifically}} how organisations capture experiences gained in projects, is a critical topic in order {{to compete in the}} knowledge economy. Little attention has been given the catchphrase lessons learned practices as a research area. The purpose of the thesis is therefore to analyse the framework for the <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> phase through a Knowledge Management perspective. The purpose is also to evaluate how new knowledge, captured by <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> documents, can be identified and measured. To fulfil the purpose, the <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> phase and <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> documents within the project model Practical Project Steering are studied. Through a document study, the framework that the project model gives, and the <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> documents is analysed. The <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> documents are also examined regarding the experiences they capture. This is done by developing an instrument for identifying and measuring new knowledge. Through the study, it can be established that the <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> phase provides for a link between Knowledge Management and Project Management. It has an important contribution to Knowledge Management since it mitigates the risk of not transferring knowledge to the organisational memory. The use of predefined knowledge domains supports structure, and systemisation in the production of the documents, {{as well as in the}} compilation and dissemination of useful knowledge. New knowledge within the <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> phase can be identified and measured by dividing the documents into isolated pieces of information and using developed criteria to identify, and thereby quantify new knowledge. The instrument is highly reliable since it is ensured that the division of information does not result in any decontextualisation, and since the criteria used are very stable, and still acknowledge the dynamics of knowledge as well as the knowledge context. By using the measurements on empirical data, problems that are important to acknowledge are identified. There is an uneven distribution of knowledge types acquired by the <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> documents, regardless of their importance; resulting in loss of important knowledge. The difficulty to formalise important knowledge, results in failing to transfer knowledge to an external organisational memory. The difficulty to distribute knowledge sufficiently, results in re-invention of the wheel, and the same mistakes being made twice or more...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate IT projects within the Swedish public sector. Furthermore we have looked at the <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> in IT <b>projects.</b> The problem that occurs in this topic is that the projects can run overtime or over budget. In this research we used interviews to conduct the data collection. We have collected data from two public sector organizations – Jönköpings kommun and Domstolsverket, both of these orginzations have a dedicated IT department. Through the methods, theoretical framework and analysis we found many different activities and theories on how to handle <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> in IT.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} has evolved rapidly {{over the last}} 30 years to fonn {{an integral part of}} business and political agendas (Smith, 1993). Although the overarching definition of sustainability is understood to represent the long-term maintenance of social, environmental and economic systems (Gudmundsson et aL, 1996; Hughes et aL, 2005), many aspects of sustainable development are far from having integrity in terms of political and business agendas {{due to the lack of}} viable accounting techniques. This study was designed to assess the methods of evaluating the sustainable development achievements of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) project at the Centre for Waste Management (CWM), based at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK. The research was developed as a result of the author completing the CWM ERDF <b>project</b> <b>closure</b> report; the <b>report</b> identified a lack of collaboration between the project's achievements in the area of sustainable development and the ERDF targets. The report illustrated that the quantitative measures, results and cross-cutting theme targets of the ERDF were insufficient at demonstrating the actual benefits of project assistance. Whilst the monetary unit is the most universally recognised component of measurement (Bateman et aL, 2003) and is used extensively in the evaluation of ERDF programmes. The calculation of increased and safeguarded jobs and sales were perceived to be extremely subjective by project managers and beneficiary small and medium-sized enterprises (SME 5) alike. Initial proposals advocated the creation of specific sustainable development measures, however extensive research demonstrated that weak sustainability was present in the cuntnt ERDF targets and further project measures would only serve to dissuade SME participation. The economic, environmental and social benefits of the project were obscured due to an absence of fixed calculation methods and no long term project evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{operated}} two Class II surface impoundments that stored wastewater {{that was}} discharged {{from a number}} of buildings located on the Site 300 Facility (Site 300). The wastewater was the by-product of explosives processing. Reduction in the volume of water discharged from these buildings {{over the past several years}} significantly reduced the wastewater storage needs. In addition, the impoundments were constructed in 1984, and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane liners were nearing the end of their service life. The purpose of this project was to clean close the surface impoundments and provide new wastewater storage using above ground storage tanks at six locations. The tanks were installed and put into service prior to closure of the impoundments.

40|$|The moderating {{effect of}} the need for closure in the {{relationship}} between job insecurity, job performance and mental health was investigated. The need for closure refers to a motivated need for certainty, intolerance of ambiguity and preference for predictability. It was argued that the need for closure may function as a psychological moderator in dealing with job insecurity. Participants comprised 287 workers, who were administered a self-reported questionnaire. Results confirmed the negative relationship between job insecurity, performance and mental health. The need for closure was positively related to job performance and unrelated to mental health. More interestingly, the need for closure exhibited multifaceted patterns of interactions with the different components of job insecurity. Higher need for closure revealed a buffering effect in conditions of higher quantitative job insecurity. In this case, individuals high (vs low) in the need for <b>closure</b> <b>reported</b> better job performance and mental health. Conversely, when qualitative job insecurity was higher, individuals high (vs low) in the need for <b>closure</b> <b>reported</b> an impaired job performance and mental health...|$|R
