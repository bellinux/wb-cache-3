40|$|Background: Participation in a {{clinical}} trial is believed to benefit patients but {{little is known about}} the post-trial effects on routine hospital-based care. Objectives: To describe (1) hospital-based, pressure ulcer care-processes after patients were discharged from a pressure ulcer prevention, cluster randomised controlled trial; and (2) to investigate if the trial intervention had any impact on subsequent hospital-based care. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 133 trial participants who developed a pressure ulcer during the clinical trial. We compared outcomes and care processes between participants who received the pressure ulcer prevention intervention and those in the usual care, control group. We also compared care processes according to the pressure ulcer stage. Results: A repositioning schedule was reported for 19 (14. 3 %) patients; 33 (24. 8 %) had a dressing applied to the pressure ulcer; 17 (12. 8) patients were assessed by a wound care team; and 20 (15. 0 %) were seen by an occupational therapist. Patients in the trial’s intervention group were more likely to have the presence of a pressure ulcer documented in their chart (odds ratio (OR) 8. 18, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 3. 64 – 18. 36); to be referred to an occupational therapist OR 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 07; 0. 54); to receive a <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>device</b> OR 0. 31 (95 % CI 0. 14; 0. 69); or a pressure relieving mattress OR 0. 44 (95 % CI 0. 20; 0. 96). Participants with Stage 2 or unstageable ulcers were more likely than others to have dressings applied to their wounds (p = < 0. 001) and to be referred to an occupational therapist for protective devices (p = 0. 022). Conclusion: Participants in the intervention group of {{a clinical}} trial were more likely to receive additional post trial care and improved documentation compared with those in the control group but documentation of pressure ulcer status and care is poor.

40|$|Background Pressure ulcer {{is one of}} {{many health}} {{problems}} in the healthcare system. Pressure ulcer prolongs the suffering of patients and the cost of treating them is high. In 2006, in the USA almost US$ 11 billion was spent on hospitalizations in which the patient was dignosed with pressure ulcer as primary or secondary causes, excluding neonatal and maternal conditions. This reflects an increase of nearly 80 % since 1993. Most pressure ulcers are potentially preventable; early and proper intervention to high risk groups can decrease the incidence of newly developed pressure ulcer and its consequence impacts. Moreover, pressure ulcer is a key performance index for assessing the quality of hospital service and patient safety. Maintaining a low incidence and prevalence of the pressure ulcer leads to both reduced health expenditure and patient’s suffering from wound pain. Aims and objectives The paper aims to study the current literature of pressure relieving devices application and its effectiveness to risk group. There are lots of pressure relieving devices in the market and here to assess its effectiveness to the risk group in hospital. Methods The electronic search was done through searching of electronic database, PubMed, MEDLINE ProQest; and hand search through Google Scholar and other online resources. Search strategies and criteria for inclusion and exclusion had been applied. The key words were used in retrieving studies through databases: (pressure ulcer OR decubitus ulcer) AND(prevention) AND (pressure relieving OR repositioning OR mattress OR cushion OR overlay OR re-distributing) Results There were twelve English articles for reviewing finally. Those articles were grouped into three <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>device</b> categories; they are cushion, re-positioning and mattresses for the review. In Defloor 2005, it found an obvious reduction in newly developed pressure ulcer if it combines 4 -hourly turning with pressure reliefing mattress; only 3 % of participants had newly developed pressure ulcer. Furthermore, the frequect turning may not reduce the pressure ulcer development in lower risk group. The proper intervention of pressure relieving and tailor to individuals are essential. Conclusions It demonstrated the effectiveness of pressure relieving devices to patient at risk, but the present of significant differences is not consistent. It is essential to ensure the utilization of the pressure relieving support surfaces function with right skill to the right person in order to maximize patient’s benefit during hospitalization. Further clinical trial is preferable. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the incident of 19 th September caused a high pressure build-up inside the cryostat insulation vacuum which the existing overpressure devices could not contain. As a result, high longitudinal forces acting on the insulation vacuum barriers developed and broke the floor and the floor fixations of the SSS with vacuum barriers. The consequent large longitudinal displacements of the SSS damaged chains of adjacent dipole cryo-magnets. Estimates of the helium mass flow and the pressure build- up experienced in the incident are presented together with the pressure build-up for an even more hazardous event, the Maximum Credible Incident (MCI). The strategy of limiting the maximum pressure by the installation of addition <b>pressure</b> <b>relieve</b> <b>devices</b> is presented and discussed.

40|$|Efraim Jaul Skilled Geriatric Nursing Department, Herzog Memorial Hospital, Affiliated to the Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel Abstract: The {{occurrence}} of pressure ulcers (PUs) is common and poses serious {{problems for the}} frail elderly, with implications for functional disability and reduced quality of life. PUs are preventable in a majority of cases. The increase in PU occurrence, however, appears regardless of higher awareness in prevention and improvement through utilization of <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>devices.</b> Multiple changes in the elderly body systems occur over time including aging, multiple chronic conditions, and functional impairment, potentially culminating in the final pathways of geriatric syndrome, unless awareness {{to the development of}} PUs is reversible and prevented. The assumption is that the development of PUs is based on multifactorial causes (extrinsic and intrinsic factors); thus, the optimal management for elderly patients requires a comprehensive approach in all medical settings (community, hospital, and at the long term care [LTC] level). Comprehensiveness signifies looking beyond the wounds, assisting the patient through both local (wound) and systemic (medical condition) treatment, using a strategy of prevention and supporting quality of life. Within the multidisciplinary involvement team approach, each professional discipline contributes its own task in coordination with other disciplines to address PU prevention, assessment, and treatment. The entire medical staff and the multidisciplinary team work together and communicate frequently in order to prevent, halt at an early stage, and provide healing in a timely fashion. Limiting the formation of PUs is facilitated through early identification, treating contributing causes, eliminating all unnecessary medications, instituting supportive interventions which include the family. Understanding the relationship between the formation of PUs and the vulnerability of the elderly patient is key to the optimal approach for the prevention and management of PUs.

Results Systematic review identified 467 potentially relevant articles, retrieved 70 for screening and included 1 in a narrative synthesis. No recommendations for practice could be made. Cohort study recruited 140 people with 183 heel ulcers. 77 (42 %) ulcers healed, 88 (48 %) did not heal due to death, 5 (3 %) were on limbs subsequently amputated, 11 (6 %) were unhealed at 18 months, 2 (1 %) were lost to follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models identified 12 significant (p≤ 0. 2) variables affecting time to healing in the univariate analysis. Eight entered the multivariate model: 2 reached significance (p≤ 0. 1) : severe (cf superficial) ulcers and the presence of (cf the absence) peripheral vascular disease (PVD) reduced the chance of healing. Ulcer area did not change in a uniform manner. Treatments e. g. support surfaces and dressings were inconsistently used. Many patients experienced non-pressure ulcer related infections during the study. Conclusion It is not known if support surfaces aid heel PU healing. The severity of the PU and the presence of PVD are independent prognostic factors for healing. Further work is needed to explore prognostic factors which change over time.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of computational methods for vapour liquid equilibrium (VLE) and volumetric properties. The VLE in this thesis can be divided into the low- and medium-pressure VLE with an experimental part and into the high-pressure VLE with a modelling and simulation part. The volumetric properties in this thesis deal with the extension of the model for compressed liquid densities. At low-pressure VLE, the emphasis was on the optimisation of model parameters. Two apparatus were built, a circulation still and an automated total pressure apparatus for the vapour liquid equilibrium measurements. The measurements were correlated with activity coefficient models for the liquid phase and with equations of state for the vapour phase. A program for correlating the vapour liquid equilibrium was developed. The measurements and VLE models optimised were needed in developing gasoline additives to replace methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE). At near-critical VLE, the emphasis was on the robustness of the VLE and simulation routines. There was a need for a simulator to find out the dynamics of several vessels and buffer tanks when vessels were in a runaway condition, exposed to fire and imbalance of flows, or all of these events simultaneously. In addition, the operation point near the VLE critical point was of special interest. A dynamic simulator where the vapour and liquid phases were assumed to be in equilibrium was developed. The <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>devices</b> were assumed to be the only devices to control the flow of material. The effect of the pipe network {{was not included in the}} simulator. The temperature range of the model for the compressed liquid density of mixture was extended. The rigorous bubble point pressure and the critical point computed from the cubic equation of state were more consistent with the experimental data than the pseudo-bubble point and pseudo critical point of the original model. The application range of the model was extended at the expense of accuracy, but the extended model was better than a cubic equation of state. reviewe...|$|R

Concordance with <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> movements is poor amongst this population, and one potential alternative to improve this would be to integrate <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> movements into everyday functional activities. Objectives. To investigate both the current <b>pressure</b> <b>relieving</b> behaviours of SCI individuals during computer use and the application of an ergonomically adapted computer-based activity to reduce interface pressure. Design. Observational and repeated measures design. Setting. Regional Spinal Cord Injury Unit. Participants. Fourteen subjects diagnosed with SCI (12 male, 2 female). Intervention.
