Moreover, Jadaliyya is the place where writing of a kind that we associate with the best of anthropology--in the moment, grounded in theory, capturing historical transformation through engagement in events as they unfold--has been published. It seems to provide solutions to many <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been engaged with in anthropology -- the production of knowledge in and about the region, particularly in this time of the massive uprisings … Jadaliyya has been the place where some of the best “ethnographic” writing about the region in this time of incredible transformation and change is to be found.|$|E

2500|$|Waters {{voted against}} the Iraq War Resolution, the 2002 {{resolution}} that funded and granted Congressional approval to possible military action against the regime of Saddam Hussein. [...] She has remained a consistent critic of the subsequent war and has supported an immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq. [...] Waters asserted in 2007 that President George W. Bush was trying to [...] "set [...] up" [...] by continually requesting funds for an [...] "occupation" [...] that is [...] "draining" [...] the country of capital, soldier's lives, and other resources. [...] In particular, she argued that the very economic resources being [...] "wasted" [...] in Iraq were those that might provide universal health care or fully fund President Bush's own [...] "No Child Left Behind" [...] education bill. [...] Additionally, Waters, representing a congressional district whose median income falls far below the national average, argued that patriotism alone had not been the sole driving force for those U.S. service personnel serving in Iraq. [...] Rather, [...] "many of them needed jobs, they needed resources, they needed money, so they're there". [...] In a subsequent floor speech, Waters told her colleagues that Congress, lacking the votes to override the [...] "inevitable Bush veto on any Iraq-related legislation," [...] needed to [...] "better [...] the administration's false rhetoric about the Iraq war" [...] and [...] "educate our constituents [...] {{the connection between the}} problems in Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran with the <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> created in Iraq". [...] A few months prior to these speeches Waters became a cosponsor of the House resolution to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney for making allegedly [...] "false statements" [...] about the war.|$|E
