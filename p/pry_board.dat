60|$|This {{gave me a}} new idea. Why {{not escape}} through the floor? To <b>pry</b> up another <b>board</b> would perhaps be easier than to force the door.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used as}} a lever {{either to}} force apart two objects or to remove nails. Crowbars are {{commonly}} used to open nailed wooden crates, remove nails, or <b>pry</b> apart <b>boards.</b> Crowbars can be used as any of the three lever classes but the curved end is usually used as a first-class lever, and the flat end as a second class lever. In mining, crowbars are used to break and remove rock, but not as much in modern mining.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was under}} the centre of White's dormitory," [...] said King. [...] "There are double floor-boards there to deaden noise. No boy, even in my own house, could {{possibly}} have <b>pried</b> up the <b>boards</b> without leaving some trace--and Rabbits-Eggs was phenomenally drunk that other night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Donald was {{not only}} deeply {{impressed}} by such an exhibition of art; he was highly gratified at being pictured, and full of wonder that the boy could do such a thing; [...] "wi' a wee pencil an' a bit o' board!" [...] He turned the box {{this way and that}} to admire the sketch, and finally arose and brought a hatchet, with which he carefully <b>pried</b> the <b>board</b> away from the box. Then he carried his treasure to a cupboard, where he hid it safely behind a row of tall bottles.|$|R
5000|$|Another type of {{claw hammer}} is the framing hammer. This is an {{oversized}} claw hammer used in framing carpentry. The larger and heavier head can decrease {{the number of}} blows required to fully insert the nail. Framing hammers commonly have a [...] "checkered" [...] face, which reduces skip-off of the head if the blow is not precisely struck on the nail. The slight indentations left on the wood by the checkered face are considered unimportant in rough carpentry. Framing hammers also have a much straighter claw than regular claw hammers, as the claw is designed more for <b>prying</b> nailed <b>boards</b> apart, rather than removing nails (though its claw {{can also be used}} in that capacity).|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 {{the archdiocese}} was one the nation's first diocese to {{establish}} a Priests' Senate.

On October 4, 1979, Pope John Paul II made his historic visit to Iowa with Archbishop Byrne serving as his official host {{in his role as}} [...] "Primate of Iowa."

60|$|Kiki got {{a chisel}} and <b>pried</b> up the <b>board,</b> but found nothing under it. He {{was just about}} to replace the board when it slipped from his hand and turned over, and he saw {{something}} written on the underside of it. The light was rather dim, so he took the board to the window and examined it, and found that the writing described exactly how to pronounce the magic word Pyrzqxgl, which would transform anyone into anything instantly, and back again when the word was repeated.|$|R
50|$|The film concludes {{the next}} day, with the {{survivors}} rigging up a radio receiver and listening for {{news of the}} attacks. To their surprise, the radio broadcast doesn't mention the attacks, indicating that the outside world is oblivious to what has happened. Hansen <b>pries</b> off the <b>boards</b> {{from one of the}} lodge's windows, and discovers that the entire building is encased in a giant web cocoon. In the final scene, the camera pulls back to reveal the entire town of Camp Verde encased in cocoons as well.|$|R

Then it occurred to a detective to open the door and serve the subpoena. He sent for a kinetoscope and did so.|$|R
