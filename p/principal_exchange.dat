5000|$|In 1482, the Portuguese {{came to the}} {{continent}} for increased trade. They built the Castle of Elmina, the first European settlement on the Gold Coast. From here they acquired slaves and gold in trade for European goods, such as metal knives, beads, mirrors, rum, and guns. News of the successful trading spread quickly, and eventually British, Dutch, Danish, Prussian and Swedish traders arrived as well. The European traders built several forts along the coastline. The Gold Coast had long been {{a name for the}} region used by Europeans because of the large gold resources found in the area. The slave trade was the <b>principal</b> <b>exchange</b> and major part of the economy for many years. In this period, European nations began to explore and colonize the Americas. Soon the Portuguese and Spanish began to export African slaves to the Caribbean, and North and South America. The Dutch and British also entered the slave trade, at first supplying markets in the Caribbean and on the Caribbean coast of South America.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of {{mechanism}} design in a principal-multiagent setting with private information, where communication involves costly delay. The need to make production decisions within a time deadline prevents agents from communicating their entire private information to the principal, rendering revelation mechanisms infeasible. The mechanism design problem is formulated in a setting where production decisions are preceded by a multi-stage communication phase where agents and the <b>principal</b> <b>exchange</b> information. We examine trade-offs between centralization and decentralization of three components of the mechanism: contracting, communication and production decisions. Decentralization of contracting cannot dominate centralized contracting, but in some contexts can achieve equivalent profits for the principal. If cost hazard rates are linear, decentralization of production decisions and of communication strictly dominate centralization. These results apply even if communication is prone to exogenous errors or noise...|$|E
40|$|Transbranchial ammonia {{gradients}} {{and blood}} acid-base status {{have been examined}} in rainbow trout acclimated to fresh water (FW), 33 % sea water (33 %SW) and sea water (SW) and exposed to 1. 0 mmoi r 1 total ammonia (TAmm) at pH 7. 9 for 24 h. At all three salinities trout maintained large negative (inwardly directed) NH 3 and NH 4 + gradients throughout the exposure, presumably by active excretion of NF£ 4 + to counteract the passive inward diffusion of ammonia. Analysis of blood non-respiratory acid-base status (AH^) revealed an acid load in FW trout and a base load in SW trout following 24 h of exposure. This indicates that active NH 4 + /H + exchange predominates in FW whereas NH 4 +/Na+ is the <b>principal</b> <b>exchange</b> utilised in SW under these experimental conditions. The plasma TAmm load incurred during ammonia exposure increased with salinity. Compared to FW trout, plasma TAmm values were 34 and 73 % higher in the 33 %SW and SW trout, respectively, after 24 h. This cannot be explained by differences in the prevailing transbranchial PNH 3 gradient because ambient PWH 3 was substantially lower at the higher salinities (due to higher pK ' and solubilit...|$|E
40|$|In {{studies of}} gas {{exchange}} between the lung and the pulmonary circulation it is gen-erally {{assumed that the}} <b>principal</b> <b>exchange</b> {{takes place at the}} level of the pulmonary cap-illaries. The work presented here shows that some gaseous exchange can occur as well be-tween the lung and vessels of macroscopic size. Hydrogen gas when administered to a subject by inhalation can be detected in the pulmonary artery wedge position within two seconds after the inhalation of hydrogen. Methods The technique used in this study was originally described by Clark 1 and subsequently used by others. 2 " 7 The method consists of inserting a bare platinum electrode into the vascular system on the end of a standard catheter. The appearance of hydrogen gas at the electrode is signaled by the development of a potential between the plati-num electrode and a silver electrode placed on the subject's skin. The response time is practically instantaneous as illustrated in figure 1. Catheters were wedged in the pulmonary artery of 34 patients. Successful wedging of the cathe-ter was determined by the inability to advance the catheter further, by a pressure level and contour that was consistent with the wedge, and by a good "spring " on withdrawing the catheter.

40|$|Abstract From a cognitivist perspective, I {{defend the}} utility of the implied author for the {{interpretation}} of fictional texts that support more than one intentional read-ing. David Herman (2008) provides a foil in his opposition to the implied author as object- like source and his promotion of the reading of intentionality as it appears in a distributed field of cues. This understanding of intentionality, he argues, is embedded in our “folk psychology ” and is triggered when any configuration of marks is apprehended as artifactual. I argue that the intentionality of an originating cause is equally an element of our folk psychology and inseparable from the value placed on the particularity of artistic achievement. My defense of the implied author is unorthodox in that it applies to fictional texts that are susceptible to multiple intentional interpretations. To make this case, I switch my cognitivist perspective from the reader reading to the writer writing, drawing on commentary by authors regarding the autonomy of their characters and the work of Marjorie Taylor on “imaginary friends. ” I argue that the free, unpredictable element of fictional world creation is matched by a freedom of fiction to accommodate competing intentional interpretations. The <b>principal</b> <b>exchange</b> value of my hypothesis for the sciences of cognition lies in the questions it raises regarding the complexity of reader response. In their otherwise immensely useful overview, Tom Kindt and Hans-Harald Müller (2006 : 154 – 55) reject a cognitive approach to the concept My thanks to Mark Bruhn, Tony Jackson, and Ellen Spolsky for their insightful comments on an early version of this article; to David Herman for his on a later draft; and, as always, to the indefatigably helpful Meir Sternberg...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of Queensland’s shallow-water {{echinoderm}} fauna {{reveals that}} approximately 44 per cent. of the 267 species recorded {{are confined to}} Queensland mainland waters and approximately 35 per cent, to Barrier Reef waters; the remainder are common to both environments. Marked faunistic attenuation with increasing latitude is exhibited by echinoderms occurring on the mainland north of lat. 25 °S. and also by those found on the Great Barrier Reef. In both cases there are few substitutions. South of lat. 25 °S. Peronian species occur, but an apparently isolated population of tropical species {{is found in the}} Moreton Bay-Caloundra area. Queensland mainland echinoderms have strong affinities with those of the East Indies. The <b>principal</b> <b>exchange</b> route utilized by mainland species common to both areas seems to be via Torres Strait and the Arafura Sea. The Coral Sea appears to present a barrier to the spread of mainland species to the West Pacific area. On the other hand Barrier Reef echinoderms have strong ties with those of the latter region. Gene flow between populations of species common to the Barrier Reef and the West Pacific area probably occurs by way of the Coral Sea {{as a result of the}} transport of the pelagic larval stages of West Pacific populations by the Pacific south equatorial current. A dearth of coral structures immediately to the west of Torres Strait seems to have prevented the spread of Barrier Reef species to northern Australian waters. However, a few reef echinoderms appear to have entered north-western Australian waters from the East Indies, probably by way of atolls and reef platforms found on the Sahul and Rowley Shelfs. The echinoderm fauna of north-western Australia contains a large number of endemic species but has marked affinities with those of East Indian and Queensland mainland waters. The origin of the echinoderm fauna of tropical Australia is discussed in the light of palaeogeographic and zoogeographic findings. It is concluded that the present fauna of the area is derived predominantly from recent East Indian and West Pacific stocks. Also it is postulated that barriers between echinoderm populations present in tropical Australian waters were set up during the Pleistocene falls of sea-level and that this has resulted in the formation of closely allied sympatric and allopatric species. Available evidence indicates that the Solanderian Province should be restricted to the Great Barrier Reef area and, since Torres Strait does not present a barrier to the dispersal of echinoderms typically found in habitats in which terrigenous sediments predominate, the fauna of Queensland mainland waters and that of the Dampierian Province are grouped together tentatively in a single Tropical Australian Province...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Non-repudiation is a {{security}} service concerned with preventing a denial {{by one of}} the principals involved in a communication of having participated in {{all or part of the}} communication. <b>Principals</b> <b>exchange</b> evidence information, which proves their participation in the communication. The evidence is digitally signed, making it non-forgeable and undeniable. In this paper, a non-repudiation communication protocol with mandatory proof of receipt is formally analysed. The verification technique used in the analysis applies a modal logic of knowledge and belief to prove the correctness of the protocol. This involves a process of deductive reasoning, where the desired protocol goals are deduced by applying a set of axioms, theorems and inference rules to the assumptions and message exchanges of the protocol. If the protocol is shown to fulfil its goals it can be deemed to be correct and secure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Securing {{communication}} in large scale distributed systems {{is an open}} problem. When multiple <b>principals</b> <b>exchange</b> sensitive informa-tion over a network, security and privacy issues arise immediately. For instance, in an online auction system we may want {{to ensure that no}} bidder knows the bids of any other bidder before the auction is closed. Such systems are typically interactive/reactive and communication is mostly asynchronous, lossy or unordered. Language-based security pro-vides language mechanisms for enforcing end-to-end security. However, with few exceptions, previous research has mainly focused on relational or synchronous models, which are generally not suitable for distributed systems. This paper proposes a general knowledge-based account of possibilistic security from a language perspective and shows how existing trace-based conditions fit in. A syntactic characterization of these conditions, given by an epistemic temporal logic, shows that existing model checking tools can be used to enforce security...|$|R
