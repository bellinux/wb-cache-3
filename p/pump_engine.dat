25|$|Main Street, U.S.A. is {{reminiscent}} of the Victorian period of America with the train station, town square, movie theater, city hall, firehouse complete with a steam-powered <b>pump</b> <b>engine,</b> emporium, shops, arcades, double-decker bus, horse-drawn streetcar, jitneys and other bits of memorabilia. Main Street is also home to the Disney Art Gallery and the Opera House which showcases Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, a show featuring an Audio-Animatronic version of the president. There are many specialty stores on Main Street including: a candy store, jewelry and watch shop, a silhouette station, a store that sells Disney collectible items created by various artists, and a hat shop where you have the option of creating your own ear hat along with a personalized embroidery. At the far end of Main Street, U.S.A. is Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Partners statue, and the Central Plaza (also known as the Hub), which is a portal to most of the themed lands: the entrance to Fantasyland is by way of a drawbridge across a moat and through the castle. Adventureland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland are arrayed {{on both sides of the}} castle. Several lands are not directly connected to the Central Plaza—namely, New Orleans Square, Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown.|$|E

2500|$|The {{department}} then {{bought a}} two-cylinder chemical engine in 1908, {{adding to the}} hook and ladder and two hose carts the department already had. The city also installed a steel water reservoir that year to improve water pressure. [...] A nozzle belonging {{to one of the}} first pieces of equipment owned by the department was later uncovered during an excavation in 1911. The nozzle had been part of a <b>pump</b> <b>engine</b> originally used by the Sacramento Fire Department and later used by the Portland Fire Bureau and the City of Albany. One of the early fires was in January 1912 when the Commercial Hotel at Second and Washington burned, with two fatalities. The city built a new city hall in 1914 on Second Avenue, and the department moved into the building.|$|E

Still, a full understanding of the engineering qualities of fibreglass-reinforced plastic was still several years off and the suspension attachment points were regularly observed to pull out of the fibreglass structure.

(Popular mythology says that cars left the factory with a variety of engines, but this is incorrect.) The FWE engine, derived from a water <b>pump</b> <b>engine</b> usually found bolted to a fire truck, was used by Lucas Electric for electrical component life testing in the presence of intense vibration.|$|E
2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid <b>pump.</b> <b>Engine</b> oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{cues from}} Brabham's Formula One special, and through {{evolution}} of the Formula Three curved tube chassis design, Maddock produced a new Formula Two design for 1956: the Cooper T41. He developed this the subsequent year into the Mark II, or Cooper T43, model. Where the 1956 car had been developed for Climax's FWB, this 1957 car was intended for Climax's new FPF four-cylinder engine. While the FWB was a development of a <b>pump</b> <b>engine</b> adapted for automobile use, the FPF was a bespoke, dry sumped racing design. Even in [...] Formula Two form Maddock's lightweight cars could produce strong performances against more powerful machinery, but the true potential of the design was shown when Rob Walker Racing decided to build a T43 with an enlarged 1964 cc FPF engine – and the works entered it for the 1957 Monaco Grand Prix. Driver Jack Brabham unfortunately managed to write the chassis off in practice, but the engine was transferred to another T43 present for the Formula Two race and Brabham managed to qualify 13th for the 16 car race. In the race itself Brabham climbed as high as third place, behind the Maserati 250F of Juan Manuel Fangio and the Vanwall of Tony Brooks, before the little car's fuel pump failed on its 100th lap. Determined to finish Brabham pushed the car from the tunnel, the full distance of the Monaco marina, to the finish line. He was sixth, only one place out of the points, but better was to come.|$|E
