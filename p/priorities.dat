40|$|<b>Priority</b> {{queueing}} {{systems are}} oftentimes {{set up so}} that arriving customers are placed into one of N distinct <b>priority</b> classes. Moreover, to determine the order of service, each customer (upon arriving to the system) is assigned a <b>priority</b> level that is unique to the class to which it belongs. In static <b>priority</b> queues, the <b>priority</b> level of a class-k (k= 1, 2, [...] .,N) customer {{is assumed to be}} constant with respect to time. This simple prioritization structure is easy to implement in practice, and as such, various types of static <b>priority</b> queues have been analyzed and subsequently applied to real-life queueing systems. However, the assumption of constant <b>priority</b> levels for the customers may not always be appropriate. Furthermore, static <b>priority</b> queues can often display poor system performance as their design does not provide systems managers the means to balance the classical trade-off inherent in all <b>priority</b> queues, that is: reducing wait times of higher <b>priority</b> customers consequently increases the wait times for those of lower <b>priority.</b> An alternative to static <b>priority</b> queues are accumulating <b>priority</b> queues, where the <b>priority</b> level of a class-k customer is assumed to accumulate linearly at rate b_k> 0 throughout the class-k customer's time in the system. The main benefit of accumulating <b>priority</b> queues is the ability, through the specification of the accumulating <b>priority</b> rates {b_k}_k= 1 ^N, to control the waiting times of each class. In the past, due to the complex nature of the accumulating prioritization structure, the control of waiting times in accumulating <b>priority</b> queues was limited [...] - being administered only through their first moments. Nowadays, with the advent of a very useful tool called the maximal <b>priority</b> process, it is possible to characterize the waiting time distributions of several types of accumulating <b>priority</b> queues. In this thesis, we incorporate the concept of accumulating <b>priority</b> to several previously analyzed static <b>priority</b> queues, and use the maximal <b>priority</b> process to establish the corresponding steady-state waiting time distributions. In addition, since static <b>priority</b> queues may be captured from accumulating <b>priority</b> queues, useful comparisons between the considered accumulating <b>priority</b> queues and their static <b>priority</b> counterparts are made throughout this thesis. Thus, in the end, this thesis results in a set of extensive analyses on these highly flexible accumulating <b>priority</b> queueing models that provide a better understanding of their overall behaviour, as well as exemplify their many advantages over their static <b>priority</b> equivalents...|$|R
