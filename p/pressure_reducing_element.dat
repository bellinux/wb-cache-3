In {{order to make}} FCEV reach a farther travel distance, greater demands are put on its <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system. In this paper, a two-step high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system for FCEV is proposed. The system {{is made up of}} two parts, a new high multi-stage <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> valve (HMSPRV) and a multi-stage muffler. As a new system, its feasibility has to be verified. Since the valve opening condition has a great effect on hydrogen flow, pressure reduction and energy consumption, different valve opening conditions are taken as the research point. The flow field analysis of the new HMSPRV is conducted on three aspects: pressure field, velocity field and energy consumption. It can be found that both the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> and velocity increasing gradients mainly reflect at those throttling components for all valve openings. For energy consumption, in the comprehensive study of flow vortexes and turbulent dissipation rate, it can be found that the larger of the valve opening, the larger of energy consumption. Then, a thermo-fluid-solid coupling analysis is conducted on the new HMSPRV, and it is concluded that the new system meets strength requirement. Furthermore, as the second step of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system, the flow and pressure fields of multi-stage muffler are investigated. The five-stage muffler is exactly designed to complete the whole <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> process. This study can provide technological support for achieving pressure regulation in the hydrogen transport system of FCEV when facing complex conditions, and it can also benefit the further research work on energy saving and multi-stage flow of <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> devices...|$|R

But the energy lose due to the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> process is considerably huge {{when there is a}} high pressure difference. Aiming at this issue, firstly, the mechanism and quantification method of the energy loss in the throttling reducing process is analyzed based on pneumatic power theory. Then, a power recovery type (PRT) pressure reducer which can output shaft power during the reducing operation is proposed. The basic mechanical structure and the working principle of the PRT reducer are described. For evaluating the feasibility of the design, a thermodynamic model of the PRT reducer is established. And under specific parameter settings, simulations on the PRT reducer’s power output characteristics and the pressure regulating ability are carried out. On this basis, the principle structure of an energy recycling high pressure pneumatic system is proposed.

40|$|Natural gas is {{transferred}} in high pressure by piping system from refiners to city gate stations. For public consumption the gas <b>pressure</b> is <b>reduced</b> in gas <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> stations. The <b>pressure</b> is <b>reduced</b> in regulators {{and leads to}} a sudden drop of temperature and consequently the formation of gas hydrates. Preventing hydrate formation, natural gas is heated by passing through water bath gas heaters. In this study, the thermodynamic efficiencies of water bath gas heaters were conducted. The effect of air-fuel ratio and the flow rate of the fuel on the efficiency of this instrument were studied. Also, the variations of efficiencies versus flame temperature have been considered and the optimum points in each state were obtained. From these comparisons, {{it can be concluded}} that, first law efficiency is suitable meanwhile second law efficiency is very low. The main reason of low second law efficiency is that high availability generation by fuel causes low enhancement in the availability of natural gas, passed through heaters. Also, one dimensional simulation has been employed to compute temperature distribution numerically in whole of a gas <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> station with water bath gas heaters and with shell and tube heaters (inline heaters). Comparison between these two stations show that the gas <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> station with inline heaters is more appropriate than the one with water bath gas heaters. Finally, water bath gas heaters and inline heaters have been studied economically by utilizing energy flow optimization model, EFOM. It is shown that the inline heaters have less cost of heat generation and they are more economical...|$|R
