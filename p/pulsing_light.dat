40|$|A {{method for}} {{microfluidic}} flow control based upon polymer hydrogel valves with rapid and reversible actuation properties is described. The platform allows for contactless optical flow control based upon <b>pulsing</b> <b>light,</b> {{resulting in a}} forced oscillating and control over the valve through photo-isomerisation of a spiropyran derivative, co-polymerised within an N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) hydrogel. Application of pulsed light (450 nm) to the valves allows the valves {{to be held at}} an intermediate position for extended periods of time. Varying the extent of pulsing of the light source enables the flow rate to be regulated within a microfluidic flow rate range of 0 – 27 μL/min. Due to the pulsed light, a small period change in the flow rate is observed that corresponds to the pulse sequence as a corresponding oscillation in the hydrogel valves...|$|E

While previous research has shown <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> to be effective at reducing various microorganisms {{on a variety of}} substrates, a better understanding of inactivation kinetics, pairing <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> with other antimicrobial treatments, and the cellular effect of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> treatment will provide better insight into potential opportunities for future use of this technology. Inactivation of Listeria innocua in liquid suspensions and on the surface of stainless steel showed pronounced tailing. The utilization of the Weibull model accurately predicted inactivation in clear liquids but overestimated Pulsed Light‟s effectiveness on stainless steel surfaces where complex surface properties as well as inoculum size were of significant influence. The combination of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> with the antimicrobial nisin was able to reach reductions of 4 to 5 log CFU/sausage of Listeria on the surface of sausages, extending storage from 8 day for individual treatments to 28 to 48 days suggesting that <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> in combination with additional antimicrobials can effectively reduce surface contamination of ready-to-eat foods. To evaluate the potential for repeated <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> exposure to lead to changes in growth and resistance behavior of survivors, L. monocytogenes, L. innocua, and E. coli were exposed to both low (1. 1 J/cm 2) and high (10. 1 J/cm 2) levels of <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Light</b> and survivors were recovered and subsequently treated for 10 cycles of exposure and recovery. Isolates of all three organisms did not show changes in growth kinetics or resistance after multiple exposures when compared to untreated cells at either low or high fluence levels.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for centuries that light (photoperiod) is {{possibly}} the major environmental stimuli affecting bird behavior and physiology. The length of the light period stimulates the breeding cycle, migration, fat deposition, and molt in most species of birds. Therefore, it is only natural that one would think of using light as a means of bird control. In fact, light has already been used as a bird control; flood-light traps have been used to trap blackbirds (Meanley 1971); Meanley states that 2000 -W search lights have been used to alleviate depredation by ducks in rice fields. <b>Pulsing</b> <b>light</b> is already used on aircraft, aircraft hangers and high towers as a means of detourinq birds (Schaefer, 1968).

40|$|Binaural beats are an {{auditory}} {{phenomenon that}} has been suggested to alter physiological and cognitive processes including vigilance and brainwave entrainment. Some personality traits measured by the NEO Five Factor Model {{have been found to}} alter entrainment using <b>pulsing</b> <b>light</b> stimuli, but as yet no studies have examined if this occurs using steady state presentation of binaural beats for a relatively short presentation of two minutes. This study aimed to examine if binaural beat stimulation altered vigilance or cortical frequencies and if personality traits were involved. Thirty-one participants were played binaural beat stimuli designed to elicit a response at either the Theta (7 Hz) or Beta (16 Hz) frequency bands while undertaking a zero-back vigilance task. EEG was recorded from a high-density electrode cap. No significant differences were found in vigilance or cortical frequency power during binaural beat stimulation compared to a white noise control period. Furthermore, no significant relationships were detected between the above and the Big Five personality traits. This suggests a short presentation of steady state binaural beats are not sufficient to alter vigilance or entrain cortical frequencies at the two bands examined and that certain personality traits were not more susceptible than others...|$|E

Arrhenius plots of fluorescence change vs temperature yielded a straight line with no breaks that would have indicated a membrane lipid phase change. We measured the fluorescence changes at high and low excitation intcniitites and monitored fluorescence at 690 and 735 nm. The low temperature in-duced fluorescence increase and the ratio of 690 to 735 nm fluorescence were generally greater at lower light intensities.

It as a collaborative process involving artist and designer Peter Thiedeke and cellist Linda Hawyg. Installed in the heritage listed Spring Hill Baths, built in 1886, the installation aimed to open up a discussion about what our world could feel like, and inspire people to help shape it for the better in a playful and future thinking way when thinking about water. It asked how urban and rural communities could evolve with their fragile environments, and with ongoing water shortages or increases in water that disruption brings. It sought to counter an emerging perspective where the future is no longer something we shape through positive insights or choices, but rather something confined to narrow perspectives or threats. Set {{against the backdrop of the}} water the virtual darkness of the site was punctuated by delicate projections of <b>pulsing</b> <b>light</b> set at eye height across the back of the Baths aimed to encourage disruption, imagination and wonder about water.

40|$|Subconscious {{vision is}} a recent focus of the vision science community, {{brought on by the}} {{discovery}} of a previously unknown photoreceptor in the retina dedicated to driving non-image-forming responses, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). In addition to accepting inputs from rod and cone photoreceptors, ipRGCs contain their own photopigment, melanopsin, and are considered true photoreceptors. ipRGCs drive various non-image-forming photoresponses, including circadian photoentrainment, melatonin suppression, and pupil constriction. In order to understand more about ipRGC function in humans, we studied its sensitivity to light stimuli in the evening and day. First, we measured the sensitivity threshold of melatonin suppression at night. Using a protocol that enhances data precision, we have found the threshold for human melatonin suppression to be two orders of magnitude lower than previously reported. This finding has far-reaching implications since there is mounting evidence that nocturnal activation of the circadian system can be harmful. Paradoxically, ipRGCs are understimulated during the day. Optimizing daytime non-image-forming photostimulation has health benefits, such as increased alertness, faster reaction times, better sleep quality, and treatment of depression. In order to enhance ipRGC excitation, we aimed to circumvent adaptation (i. e. desensitization) of the photoresponse by using flickering instead of steady light. We find that properly timed flickering light enhances pupillary light reflex significantly when compared to steady light with 9 -fold more energy density. Employing our findings, a new form of LED light is proposed to enhance subconscious visual responses at a typical indoor illuminance level. Using the silent substitution technique, a melanopsin-selective flicker is introduced into the light. A linear optimization algorithm is used to maximize the contrast of the subconscious, melanopsin-based response function while keeping conscious, cone-driven responses to the <b>pulsing</b> <b>light</b> fixed. Additional boundary conditions utilizing test color samples as an environmental mimic are introduced to limit the amount of perceived color change in a simulated environment. Two examples of lights are given to illustrate potential applications for general illumination and therapeutic purposes. For the lighting and electronics industry, we hope our study of subconscious-stimulative thresholds at night will better inform their design guidelines for health conscious products...|$|E

Patients with visible dermatological ailments are particularly susceptible to reduction in the general quality of life. Among the dermatological diseases, acne causes considerable reduction in the quality of life and changes in self-perception that lead to the worsening of a patient’s mental condition, including depression and suicidal thoughts. As a result, difficulties in contact with loved ones, as well as social and professional problems are observed, which show that acne is not a somatic problem alone. To a large extent, it becomes a part of psychodermatology, becoming an important topic of public health in social medicine practice. Pharmacological treatment of acne is a challenge for a dermatologist and often requires the necessity of cooperating with a cosmetologist. Cosmetological treatments are aimed at improving the condition of the skin and reduction or subsiding of acne skin changes. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the influence of selected cosmetological treatments on the general quality of life of patients with acne. Materials and methods: The study group consisted of 101 women aged 19 – 29  years (x̅  = 22. 5  years, SD = 2. 3  years). All subjects were diagnosed with acne vulgaris of the face. In the study group, the acne changes occurred over the course of 3 – 15  years (x̅ = 8. 1  years, SD = 2. 7  years). Selected cosmetological treatments (intensive <b>pulsing</b> <b>light,</b> alpha-hydroxy acids, cavitation peeling, needle-free mesotherapy, diamond microdermabrasion and sonophoresis) were performed in series in the number depending on the particular patient’s chosen treatment, after excluding contraindications. General quality of life of the patients was estimated using the Skindex- 29 and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires, before and after the cosmetological treatment. Results: Statistical analysis of the data obtained from the Skindex- 29 questionnaire in areas (emotions, symptoms and physical functioning) and DLQI questionnaire in areas (daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relations and treatment) showed great improvement in the general quality of life after applying a series of cosmetological treatments. The results are statistically relevant at P< 0. 0001. Conclusion: The cosmetological treatment significantly improved the general quality of life of patients with acne vulgaris and their skin condition, which was evaluated by the Hellgren–Vincent scale. It was proven that therapy performed in cosmetological clinics may become an integral part of or complete dermatological treatment.

40|$|The {{installation}} is entered via a dark tunnel, {{marked by}} gently glowing lines {{of light and}} a pool of soft <b>pulsing</b> <b>light</b> on the wall, set at eye height - which marks {{the first of two}} viewports. Peering into the first reveals a glowing, delicate life-like entity, apparently swimming in fluid motion, glowing mysteriously within an inky darkness. This entity continually swirls, unfolds, streams and circulates, changing direction, then pausing, next accelerating, sometimes glowing brightly, but most often on the edge of visual perception, then fading away, soon returning elsewhere. And all the time, in the background, a rich, subsonic-infused sound track ominously evokes sensations of deep, dark, sub-aqua environments. Moving further down the tunnel, the viewer next encounters a second aperture into this world, this time only faintly visible, which now reveals a very different, much more chaotic series of indistinct, ambiguous images of the same form. Whilst this perplexing form is reminiscent of a deep ocean creature appearing through the porthole of a submarine, caught in a nature documentor’s lens, its seductive form is clearly also synthetic. Furthermore a dissonant mechanical sound periodically causes the ‘entity’ to entirely disappear – only to unexpectedly return at quite different locations. The work was informed by rich conversations around marine ecology and ecological ethics, interspersed by guided snorkeling sessions at Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS), Chowder Bay, Sydney harbor led by Head of UTS Life Sciences, marine biologist Prof. William Gladstone and Emeritus Professor and marine biologist, Anthony Larkum, facilitated and curated by Lisa Roberts from the Living Data program. Constructed from fibre optics, lighting and wiring, floating within a large unseen tank of water, Deep Ecology’s sophisticated illusion is propelled by unseen water jets, lighting controllers and robotics. The glowing ‘entity’ is never viewed directly, but either through mirrors and image diffusion structures or via semi transparent cloths – front on, under or just above the waterline. In these ways each very different viewing port, and the entire, engulfing experience of virtual darkness punctuated by faint diaphanous light encourage disorientation, mystery, intrigue and wonder. Deep Ecology premiered in the solo exhibition Over Many Horizons at UTS Gallery, Sydney, Australia in 2016, posing open questions around the profoundly blurred ecological distinctions of the natural and the synthetic. Just as one series of natural species and conceptions slip into extinction, what else must take their place? As biodiverse worlds descend into permanent darkness, are we inviting the 'extinction of human experience' in our unquestioning rush towards synthetic, lonely futures? Deep Ecology therefore seeks to embody both the risks of species extinction and the need to empower sustainable lifestyles that work with and for sustaining futures. Deep Ecology is therefore both an experiential artwork designed for galleries and festivals and a framing device for ‘Re-Futuring practices...|$|E
