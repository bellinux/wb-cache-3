30|$|Generally, the ISO 7730 {{thermal comfort}} model [18] {{establishes}} the analytical determination {{and interpretation of}} human’s thermal comfort degree by two indices: predicted mean vote (PMV) and <b>predicted</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissatisfied</b> (PPD). PMV predicts the mean value of votes of {{a large group of}} people on the ISO thermal sensation scale. Based on the PMV value, PPD predicts the percentage of a large group of people likely to feel discomfort. Details of the ISO 7730 model can be found in [11, 18].|$|E
40|$|Most heating, {{ventilation}} and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) control systems are considered as temperature control problems. In this work, the predicted mean vote (PMV) is used to control the indoor temperature of a space by setting it {{at a point where}} the PMV index becomes zero and the <b>predicted</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> persons <b>dissatisfied</b> (PPD) achieves a maximum threshold of 5 %. This is achieved {{through the use of a}} fuzzy logic controller that takes into account a range of human comfort criteria in the formulation of the control action that should be applied to the heating system to bring the space to comfort conditions. The resulting controller is free of the set up and tuning problems that hinder conventional HVAC controllers. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy makes it possible to maximize the indoor thermal comfort and, correspondingly, a reduction in energy use of 20 % was obtained for a typical 7 -day winter period when compared with conventional control...|$|R
40|$|Algorithms to {{describe}} the manual control of window blinds and electric light-ing, in response to comfort stimuli, were incorporated into a building thermal model. By comparison with fixed control schedules, this paper examines the impact of manual control on model predictions of thermal comfort and build-ing energy consumption. For a typical, south-facing office in Toronto, the ther-mal comfort of an occupant close to the window was substantially improved by the provision of window blinds. Compared to an office with no blinds, mean PPD (<b>predicted</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> occupants <b>dissatisfied</b> with the thermal environment) was lowered from 22 to 13 %, and overheated hours were reduced by over 200 per year. However, when the lighting was also manually controlled, the blinds imposed an energy penalty. Though reduced solar gain lowered cooling energy by 7 %, heating energy increased by 17 %, and reduced daylight increased lighting energy by 6 6 %. The implications of these results on the modelling of occupied buildings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made on maximising passive solar heating loads through the careful selection of glazing, orientation and internal mass within building spaces. Control of space heating in buildings of this type has become a complex problem. Additionally, and in common with most building control applications, {{there is a need to}} develop control solutions that permit simple and transparent set up and commissioning procedures. This work concerns the development and testing of an adaptive control method for space heating in buildings with significant solar input. A simulation model of a building space to assess the performance of different control strategies is developed. A lumped parameter model based on an optimisation technique has been proposed and validated. It is shown that this model gives an improvement over existing low order modelling methods. A detailed model of a hot water heating system and related control devices is developed and evaluated for the specific purpose of control simulation. A PI-based fuzzy logic controller is developed in which the error and change of error between the internal air temperature and the user set point temperature is used as the controller input. A conventional PD controller is also considered for comparison. The parameters of the controllers are set to values that result in the best performance under likely disturbances and changes in setpoint. In a further development of the fuzzy logic controller, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) is used to control the indoor temperature of a space by setting it at a point where the PMV index becomes zero and the <b>predicted</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> persons <b>dissatisfied</b> (PPD) achieves a maximum threshold of 5 %. The controller then adjusts the air temperature set point in order to satisfy the required comfort level given the prevailing values of other comfort variables contributing to the comfort sensation. The resulting controller is free of the set up and tuning problems that hinder conventional HVAC controllers. The need to develop an adaptive capability in the fuzzy logic controller to account for lagging influence of solar heat gain is established and a new adaptive controller has therefore been proposed. The development of a "quasi-adaptive" fuzzy logic controller is developed in two steps. A feedforward neural network is used to predict the internal air temperature, in which a singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm is used to remove the highly correlated data from the inputs of the neural network to reduce the network structure. The fuzzy controller is then modified to have two inputs: the first input being the error between the setpoint temperature and the internal air temperature and the second the predicted future internal air temperature. When compared with a conventional method of control the proposed controller is shown to give good tracking of the setpoint temperature, reduced energy consumption and improved thermal comfort for the occupants by reducing solar overheating. The proposed controller is tested in real time using a test cell equipped with an oil- filled electric radiator, temperature and solar sensors. Experimental results confirm earlier findings arrived at by simulations, in that the proposed controller achieves superior tracking and reduces afternoon solar overheating, when compared with a conventional method of control...|$|R

Before doing so, a set of preliminary experiments on the human responses to draughts at elevated temperatures was performed and is reported in this paper.

40|$|To {{combine all}} {{benefits}} of the rational approach to the thermal comfort assessment {{with the need to}} take into account some individual adaptation in non-air conditioned environments, in 2002 Fanger proposed the use of an expectancy factor.

The reliability of PMV to predict the thermal sensation in non-air conditioned environments has been criticized in the past.
