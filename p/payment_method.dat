Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers can fill out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the <b>payment</b> <b>method.</b> If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E

40|$|The {{e-commerce}} in Sweden {{has increased}} {{each year for}} the past several years, but still just over half of all the consumers feels worry about payment security. This could be the reason why over half of the consumers just shopped about one time on the Internet during the whole year of 2009. Another reason could be that the many consumers have a lack of trust to the different <b>payment</b> <b>methods</b> that are available during payment on the Internet, because they might don't possess enough knowledge regarding the <b>payment</b> <b>methods</b> and their security. If the consumers were to gain more knowledge about the <b>payment</b> <b>methods</b> and their security, it may lead to that the they would feel more comfortable when shopping online, and do it more frequently.

40|$|This article reviews {{policies}} on physician <b>payment</b> <b>methods</b> that Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries have implemented to promote an efficient deployment of physicians. Countries' experiences show that payment by fee-for-service, capitation and salary influences physician activity levels and productivity. However, {{the impact of}} these simple <b>payment</b> <b>methods</b> is complex and may be diluted by clinical, demographic, ethical and organisational factors. Policies that have attempted to curb health expenditure by controlling fee levels have sometimes been eroded by physicians increasing the volume of service supply, or providing services that attract higher fees. Flexible blended <b>payment</b> <b>methods</b> based on the combination of a fixed component, through either capitation or salary, and a variable component, through fee-for-service, may produce a desirable mix of incentives.

500|$|In 1929, Smythe decided, in {{the midst}} of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. The Arena Gardens seated 8,000 and the Maple Leafs were {{regularly}} filling it with 9,000 customers. Smythe knew it would take over a million dollars to construct and he got backing from the Sun Life insurance company for half a million. [...] He found a site owned by the T. Eaton Co. department store chain on Carlton Street, a site Smythe selected because it was on the street car line. Smythe gave up the coaching position to concentrate on the arena project. The building started construction on June 1, 1931, and was ready on November 12, 1931, after five months. As part of a corporate reorganization, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. was founded that year to own both the team and the arena. To pay for the building construction, the construction workers were paid with Maple Leaf Gardens stock instead of 20% of their pay.

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{reparation}} payments by Germany, France occupied the Ruhr in 1923 to enforce payments, causing an international crisis that resulted in the implementation of the Dawes Plan in 1924. This plan outlined a new <b>payment</b> <b>method</b> and raised international loans to help Germany to meet her reparation commitments. Despite this, by 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the Young Plan that established the German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks (...) and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were suspended for a year and in 1932 during the Lausanne Conference they were cancelled altogether. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid less than 21 billion marks in reparations.|$|E

2500|$|According to PayPal, {{it protects}} sellers {{in a limited}} fashion via the Seller Protection Policy. In general the Seller Protection Policy is {{intended}} to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer. PayPal states the Seller Protection Policy is [...] "designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non-receipt of any merchandise". The policy includes a list of [...] "Exclusions" [...] which itself includes [...] "Intangible goods", [...] "Claims for receipt of goods 'not as described and [...] "Total reversals over the annual limit". There are also other restrictions {{in terms of the}} sale itself, the <b>payment</b> <b>method</b> and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect). The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation (e.g., Sale of Goods Act) and in addition it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions.|$|E
