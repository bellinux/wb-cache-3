40|$|Investigations {{involving}} four cultivation treatments {{were conducted}} at the Utah State University Greenville Experimental Farm {{to determine the effect}} of these treatments on yields of beans and sweet corn. The effects of the different treatments on soil water content, soil temperature, and weed control in beans and corn were investigated. The effect of cultivation on the degree of root rot infection and the effect of different planting dates were also investigated in the bean study. The <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> (ridged just before the plants emerge) produced a 48 percent greater bean yield and a 40 percent greater corn yield than the control treatment (no cultivation). The planting-ridge treatment (ridged at planting time) produced 21 percent greater bean yield than the control treatment. The post-emergence treatment (cultivated after the plants emerged) yielded 10 percent more beans and 20 percent more corn than the control treatment. The second and third planting dates produced 16 and 42 percent, respectively, greater bean yields than the first planting date. The <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> had a higher soil water content and soil temperature than the other methods in both the beans and corn. The <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> had 50 percent less root rot infection than the control treatment. The planting-ridge treatment had 30 percent less root infection than the control and the post-emergence root infection was 17 percent less than the control. The root rot infection {{in the second and third}} plantings was 15 and 32 percent, respectively, less than the first planting. The order of best weed control was: pre-emergence, planting-ridge, and post-emergence. The <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> produced the most favorable results in all aspects of the study...|$|E
40|$|Wider {{adaptation}} of 2, 4 -D (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) had become possible through its {{use as a}} <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment.</b> <b>Pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> is the application of an herbicide {{to the surface of}} the soil after a crop is planted, but before it has emerged. Higher rates of application per acre are usually required than for foliage spray. Plants are most subject to injury during the germination period. Some advantages of pre-emergence are that smaller amounts of 2, 4 -D per plant are required to kill weeds when they are germinating than at later stages of development. Thus, <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> will control both broad-leaved and grass species in large seeded crops. Certain crop seeds planted at a greater depth than where weed seeds normally germinate are not greatly affected by the herbicide and may be more resistant to 2, 4 -D than weed seedlings. 2, 4 -D leaves a toxic residue in the soil for a relatively short period of time when applied to warm, moist soil at recommended rates. Since it has a lethal effect when in contact with certain germinating seeds during the period which it persists in the soil, pre-emergence treatments may prove an effective measure of weed control. The purpose of this study on germination and seedling development of crop seeds was to determine possible differences due to formulations, differences in tolerance between crops and crop varieties, and the different amounts of 2, 4 -D required to give comparative effects in a germinator in the greenhouse and in field plots...|$|E
40|$|Weed control {{efficacy}} of three herbicides recently registered {{for use in}} the South African Sugar Industry is discussed and the phytotoxic effects on sugarcane are presented. Destun, with or without atrazine, is a safe <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> which is useful for the control of Cyperus esculentus, grasses and broadleaf weeds, while some activity on Cyperus rotundus has also been recorded. Dual + atrazine is likewise a safe preemergence treatment, similar in effect to alachlor + atrazine for the control of grasses, broadleaf weeds and, under favourable conditions, Cyperus esculentus. Velpar alone or in combination with diuron, is a very effective herbicide for the pre- or postemergence control of Cyperus esculentus, grasses and broadleaf weeds, having a long residual effect. It is more effective than the currently recommended herbicides for the post-emergence control of Panicum maximum. Velpar treatments may affect cane yields but are generally less severe than the standard postemergence herbicide treatments. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of weed-crop {{interactions}} {{is needed}} {{for the development of}} integrated weed management systems. A field study was conducted to evaluate an existing model to predict corn yield loss as a function of different time of weed emergence and removal. The treatments were consisted of two different periods of weed interference at different stages of corn development using a randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and 3 replications. The data sets were analysed by a Gompertz nonlinear function. The results of this trial approved that model was robust enough to predict yield loss caused by a mixed weed infestation with a single set of parameters. In term of critical period of weed control, outcomes of the model showed that on the basis of 5 % acceptable yield loss this period was 21 - 98 days after sowing and with 10 % acceptable yield loss this period was 44 - 76 days after sowing. It reveals that corn is able to tolerate early weed competition. Therefore, weed control management strategies can be postponed till 21 or 44 days after sowing on the basis of 5 and 10 % acceptable yield loss, respectively. For that reason, <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatments</b> are unnecessary. However, it is necessary to protect corn from weeds {{for a long time to}} prevent high yield loss...|$|R
40|$|Ronstar and Barricade {{herbicides}} {{were applied}} to bermudagrass prior to overseeding with perennial ryegrass. For the initial establishment of fall overseeded bermudagrass with perennial ryegrass, Barricade and Ronstar both showed decrease in establishment at thirty days after overseeding (October 26) {{when compared to the}} controls. Reductions in turfgrass density after overseeding were realized by all <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatments</b> in the mid to late fall, depending on the specific treatment. Ronstar applied in one application at 2. 0 lbs AI/A noticeably reduced visual density at 30 and 65 days after overseeding, regardless of the application timing (6 vs. 8 weeks) before overseeding. Reductions in turfgrass quality paralleled the reduction in density. Barricade applied at 0. 75 lbs AI/A at 6 WBOS showed decreased quality at 30 and 65 days after overseeding. This same treatment caused a noticeable decrease in overall plot density at thirty days after overseeding. At 65 days after overseeding (November 30), quality was not quite fully acceptable (quality mean = 5. 8), but acceptable density was achieved (mean density = 6. 3). Poa annua (PA) established itself quickly. By November 30 (65 days after overseeding) overseeded- untreated control plots had between 67 %- 77 % Poa annua present. The maximum rate of PA control for Ronstar in March was 74 % (showing 15 % Poa plot cover) and 61 % in April (34 % Poa plot cover). This occurred for the 2. 0 lb AI/A at 8 WBOS treatment, which was similar to the same rate applied 6 WBOS. Split sequence applications (pre and post) of Ronstar produced low PA control (28 %- 50 %) over the season as measured, when compared to single applications which achieved the same 2 lbs AI/A rate. The greatest amount of PA control was achieved by Barricade applied at 0. 75 lb AI/A at 6 WAOS (86 %- 94 % control). No treatment achieved 95 % control of PA on a season long basis. Poa pressure at the test site was uniform and heavy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{exogenous}} micro-organisms in the rhizosphere of {{crop plants}} for plant growth enhancement requires a careful study of factors affecting their performance. We studied {{the effect of}} pre-and post-emergence herbicides on nodulation, N-accumulation and yield of soybean inoculated with exotic Rhizobium strains in a Dystric Leptosol. The treatments comprising a control with no herbicide <b>treatment,</b> a <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>treatment</b> and a combination of preand post-emergence herbicide treatment were {{set out in the}} field using a randomized complete block design. The results show that both post-emergence and a combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicide treatments applied at 3 weeks after planting reduced nodulation, shoot dry weight, N-accumulation in the biomass and seed yield. Pre-emergence herbicide application reduced weed density and sparingly affected nodule dry weight, N-accumulation and seed yield. The results of the work suggest that selection and timing of herbicide application in soybean plots affect weed competition, nodulation, N-accumulation and overall performance of the crop in the field...|$|R
40|$|Glutathione-responsive {{carboxymethyl}} chitosan nanoparticles cross-linked with disulfide bonds {{were developed}} for controlled release of herbicides. The nanoparticles were synthesized by self-assembly of amphiphilic carboxymethyl chitosan derivative (CMCS-MUA) {{in aqueous solution}} and subsequently producing disulfide cross-linking bonds by ultrasonic treatment. TEM showed that the nanoparticles had a spherical core-shell configuration with a size of about 250 nm. Assessment of stability of the nanoparticles (considering mean diameter, polydispersity, and Zeta potential) was conducted {{over a period of}} three months, and the nanoparticles were found to be stable in solution.

40|$|In {{field trials}} in was investigated, if {{the use of}} the in Germany new active {{ingredient}} imazamox enlarge the possibilities of post emergence weed control in soybeans. Furthermore new herbicide strategies were tested on efficacy and selectivity in soybeans. The use of imazamox was very selective and showed a relative broad spectrum of controlled weed species. However, efficacy of imazamox must be supported by a <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment</b> and in most cases by a tank mix partner. For example cleavers (Galium aparine) can not be controlled by imazamox. Tankmixtures of imazamox and bentazon indicated an antagonism. Efficacy to some weed species was reduced compared to solo application. The low dose concept – three applications of low doses at cotyledon stage of weeds led to some success. However, these strategies must be further investigated, before they can be recommended to commercial farming practice. All herbicide strategies tested showed some surviving weed species. This indicates that choice of herbicides, dose rates and application strategies must be done very careful and site specific...|$|E
40|$|Flame weeding is {{actually}} a well known and used physical treatment according {{to the increase in}} concerns about the effects of herbicides on {{human health and the environment}} and in the light of the new European laws. Flaming historically, was used at first as a <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment,</b> both prior to planting and before crop emergence. Alternatively, flaming can be used also selectively after crop emergence or planting in tolerant species. Although inter-row weeds can be effectively controlled through mechanical cultivation, weeds that grow in the row are more difficult to control as, in some cases, cultivation is both ineffective and causes unacceptable levels of crop damage. This work aims to describe the specific machine for mechanical-thermal weed control which is being realized by the University of Pisa within the RHEA project. This machine is able to perform mechanical and thermal treatments at the same time in order to remove weeds mechanically from the inter-row space and perform in-row selective and precision flaming. The project is still on-going and the machine has not been fully realized and tested yet, thus no data is available at the moment...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the environmental effect of three different systems of managing a continuous crop of maize, the residues of the active ingredients of herbicides (terbuthylazine, metolachlor and dicamba) in the soil and grain were investigated in an experiment begun in 1990 and still in course. The three cultivation systems were characterized by different chemical and mechanical inputs and corresponded to three diverse approaches to chemical weed control: the “conventional” system (terbuthylazine + metolachlor in pre-emergence), the “reduced input” system (nicosulfuron + dicamba in post-emergence), and the “strip-cultivation” system (terbuthylazine + metolachlor in pre-emergence, but restricted to a strip centred on the maize row). Soil sampling was carried out on the 26 th March (2 days before the soil was tilled), the 30 th June (45 days after <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>treatment)</b> and on the 17 th November; grain analysis was carried out at harvest. The results show that at no point was any herbicide residue found on the grains of maize. On the other hand, in the soil, the residue concentrations observed depended on the cultivation system used (active ingredient, soil tillage, fertilization rate, ect). The greatest ecotoxic risks were however associated with the conventional system, while there seemed no cause for worry from an environmental point of view with {{the adoption of the}} reduced-input system...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} northern Greece in 2003 and 2004 to evaluate effects of tillage regimes (moldboard plowing, chisel plowing, and rotary tilling), cropping sequences(continuous cotton, cotton-sugar beet rotation,and continuous tobacco) and herbicide treatments with inter-row hand hoeing on weed population densities. Total weed densities were not affected by tillage treatment except that of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli), which increased only in moldboard plowing treated plots during 2003. Redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) densities were reduced in continuous cotton, while purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus), E. crus-galli, S. nigrum, and johnsongras(Sorghum halepense) densities were reduced in tobacco. A. retroflexus and S. nigrum were effectively controlled by all herbicide treatments with inter-row hand hoeing,whereas E. crus-galli was effectively reduced by herbicides applied to cotton and tobacco. S. halepense density reduction {{was a result of}} herbicide applied to tobacco with inter-row hand hoeing. Yield of all crops was higher under moldboard plowing and herbicide <b>treatments.</b> Pre-sowing and <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>treatments</b> in cotton and pre-transplant in tobacco integrated with inter-row cultivation resulted in efficient control of annual weed species and good crop yields. These observations are of practical relevance to crop selection by farmers in order to maintain weed populations at economically acceptable densities through the integration of various planting dates, sustainable herbicide use and inter-row cultivation; tools of great importance in integrated weed management systems.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 2007 and 2008 near Oakes, North Dakota (ND), USA, to evaluate if strip tillage could be incorporated into a production system of seeded onion (Allium cepa) to eliminate the standard use of a barley (Hordeum vulgare) companion crop with conventional, full width tillage, yet support common early-season weed control programs. A split-factor design was used with tillage (conventional and strip tillage) as the main plot and herbicide treatments (bromoxynil, DCPA, oxyfluorfen, and pendimethalin) as sub-plots. Neither tillage nor herbicide treatments affected onion stand counts. Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album) densities were lower in strip tillage compared to conventional tillage up to {{three weeks after the}} post-emergence applied herbicides. In general, micro-rate post-emergence herbicide treatments provided greater early-season broadleaf weed control than <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>treatments.</b> Onion yield and grade did not differ among herbicide treatments because the mid-season herbicide application provided sufficient control/suppression of the early-season weed escapes that these initial weed escapes did not impact onion yield or bulb diameter. In 2007, onion in the strip tillage treatment were larger in diameter resulting in greater total and marketable yields compared to conventional tillage. Marketable onion yield was 82. 1 Mg ha− 1 in strip tillage and 64. 9 Mg ha− 1 in conventional tillage. Results indicate that strip tillage use in direct-seeded onion production was beneficial, especially when growing conditions were conducive to higher yields and that the use of strip tillage in onion may provide an alternative to using a companion crop as it did not interfere with either early-season weed management system...|$|R

40|$|Foram estudados os efeitos das variações nos métodos de aplicação dos herbicidas Diuron e Trifluralin na cultura algodoeira, para verificar sua eficiência no combate às ervas daninhas. O tratamento Trifluralin aplicado em pré-plantio incorporado, provocou {{excelente}} combate às ervas daninhas gramíneas, porém irrisória redução da população das dicotiledôneas. A aplicação de Trifluralin em pré-plantio incorporado e a de Diuron em pré-emergência, aumentaram consideravelmente a área de contrôle nos dois grupos de ervas más. O tratamento Diuron aplicado em pré-emergência foi bastante efetivo no combate às ervas de "fôlhas largas", enquanto que no combate às gramineas não foi tão eficiente. O incorporação do Diuron, aplicado em pré-plantio, não aumentou a eficiência do produto químico. A redução da dose de Diuron em pré-plantio incorporado ou em pré-emergência não proporcionou combate adequado às ervas más. 1 - An {{experiment to}} study the various modalities of {{the application of the}} herbicides diuron and trifluralin in cotton plantings was carried out in purple latosol soil, Chapadão series. The two herbicides were applied in various doses and at different times. The most common weeds in the trial area were capim pé-de-galinha (goosegrass), capim carrapicho (sandbur), capim colchão (crabgrass), beldroega (purslane), carraplcho de carneiro, and poaia. 2 - The effectiveness of diuron (1. 60 kg/ha), applied pre-planting, was not increased by incorporation into the soil. The control of weeds was efficient, but the yield was inferior to that of plots without incorporation. Of the weeds that survived the treatment, a predominance of grass species was noted. Some of the cotton leaves turned yellow in plots that received this herbicide, but this chlorosis was temporary and the plants regained their normal color within a few weeks. The tolerance of cotton for the treatments {{did not appear to be}} affected by the method of application of the herbicides. The method of incorporation in pre-planting was not found to be more advantageous than the <b>pre-emergence</b> <b>treatment.</b> 3 - A reduction in the dosage of diuron (0. 80 kg/ha) in pre-pianting, with subsequent incorporation into the soil, did not give adequate control of annual weeds. 4 - The application of trifluralin (1 kg/ha), incorporated in pre-planting, gave excellent control of grass weeds, but the dicotyledonous species were little affected. 5 - A combination of diuron (0. 80 kg/ha) and trifluralin (0. 5 kg/ha) appears to be practical. The application of trifluralin in pre-planting, incorporated into the soil, and of diuron in pre-emergence, increased considerably the area of control of both groups of weeds. This practice, using two herbicides, offers the following advantages; a) greater variety of weeds controlled; b) a lessening of the opportunity for chlorosis to appear in the cotton by the use of a smaller dosage of diuron; c) a reduced residual effect for the subsequent crops; d) the band application of two products and reduction in cost of applied material; e) the possibility of cultivating between rows without loss of efficiency of the incorporated product. 6 - The treatment with diuron (1. 60 kg/ha) applied in pre-emergence was sufficiently effective in the control of broad leaf weeds, while control of grass species was less so. Slight symptoms of phytotoxicity were noted, but these were not sufficient to affect the yield and with further development of the crop they disappeared. The yield from herbicide-treated plots was greater than that from check plots which received manual hoeing...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, soybean acreage has {{increased}} significantly in western Canada. One {{of the challenges}} associated with growing soybean in western Canada is the control of volunteer glyphosate resistant (GR) canola, as the majority of soybean cultivars are also glyphosate resistant. The objectives of this thesis were (1) to determine the most effective combination of pre- and post-emergence herbicides to control volunteer GR canola in GR soybean; and (2) to determine the optimal soybean seeding rate and seeding date for soybean in western Canada to compete with volunteer canola, while still being economically feasible for producers. Experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at three sites in Saskatchewan and one site in Manitoba. In the herbicide study, treatments consisted of combinations of one of three different <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicide <b>treatments</b> (2, 4 -D, tribenuron and saflufenacil) and five different post-emergence treatments (bentazon, imazamox+bentazon, cloransulam, thifensulfuron and fomesafen), {{as well as a}} glyphosate-only check. Treatments containing 2, 4 -D pre-emergence, thifensulfuron post-emergence or fomesafen post-emergence caused crop injury, while the remaining treatment combinations provided excellent volunteer canola control and low crop injury, with similar soybean yield results. The optimal combinations were tribenuron+imazamox+bentazon and saflufenacil+imazamox+ bentazon, as they contain the most herbicide groups, and therefore should be most effective at delaying herbicide resistance. In the cultural control study, soybean was seeded at five different seeding rates (targeted 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 plants m- 2) at three seeding dates (targeted mid-May, late May and early June).

Due to the heterogeneous nature of farmers' resource base, the farms were grouped into three farm types: high (Type 1), medium (Type 2) and poorly resourced farmers (Type 3). The hand hoe weeded treatments had 49 percent higher total weed densities in CT relative to CONV, and was statistically similar to the glyphosate <b>treatment.</b> The mixed <b>pre-emergence</b> herbicides reduced the diversity indices by 69 and 70 percent {{when compared to the}} hand hoe weeded treatment under CT in cotton and maize, respectively. The effectiveness of all pre-emergence herbicides were not influenced by tillage but were affected by farmers resource endowments with pronounced effect in Farm Type 1. Maximum plant heights of 85 and 238 cm were recorded for mixed pre-emergence herbicides under CT for cotton and maize, respectively. Minimum plant heights of 75 and 217 cm were recorded for the respective hand hoe weeded treatments. The hand hoe weeded treatments resulted in average cotton lint yield of 1497 and 2018 kg ha− 1 for maize.

In this {{production system}}, imidazolinone herbicides are used. These herbicides {{belong to the}} same mode of action (HRAC group B) as the active ingredient triflusulfuron-methyl in the herbicide Debut®. Therefore, a reduced efficacy of this active ingredient for the control of Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape is expected.
