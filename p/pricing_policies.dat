The IMF warned that the global markets faces a risk of a major setback, including an economic downturn in the United States, falling home prices, further surge in oil prices, interest rate rises to contain inflationary pressures, which the IMF said in its twice a year report on global financial stability.|$|E

500|$|Other recent {{application}} of congestion <b>pricing</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the urban}} transportation context is to adopt an innovative tolling for a particular limited purpose.

This scheme is known as high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT) lanes, and it has been introduced mainly in the United States and Canada. The first practical implementations was California's private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 in San Diego. There has been controversy over this concept, and HOT schemes have been called [...] "Lexus" [...] lanes, as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk to the rich. According to the Texas A Transportation Institute, by 2012 there were in the United States 722 corridor-miles of HOV lanes, 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes and 163 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes under construction.|$|E
