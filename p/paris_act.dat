40|$|The {{standards}} of copyright protection {{promoted by the}} Berne Convention are highly problematic for developing countries because these countries need to ensure a wide dissemination of works for teaching, scholarship, and research purposes. In order to accommodate these needs and to promote accession to this Convention, the 1971 <b>Paris</b> <b>Act</b> of the Berne Convention, included an Appendix that allowed developing countries to issue compulsory licenses for translating and/or reproducing foreign works into languages of general use in their territories. Unfortunately, the Appendix has not met the needs of developing countries, which, instead, have relied on idiosyncratic solutions. Additionally, the instrument does not provide solutions for other needs, {{such as those of}} linguistic and cultural minorities, and it is arguable whether the Appendix applies online. Section one of this paper provides background information on the needs of developing countries and shows how the Appendix of the Berne Convention tried to meet them. Section two analyzes the main limitations of the mechanism of compulsory licensing adopted by the Appendix. Although, the mere fact that the Appendix does not comply with its very purpose should be enough to warrant a new instrument, section three discusses two additional reasons in favor of adopting a new instrument {{to meet the needs of}} developing countries. In particular, this section focuses on general welfare and the economic benefits for authors and right holders. Finally, section four outlines the issues that should be included in a new instrument that effectively meets development needs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCairo-Paris: The Urban Imaginary of the SelfByMona A. Selim El-SherifDoctor of Philosophy in Near Eastern StudiesProfessor Margaret Larkin, Chair My {{dissertation}} Cairo- Paris: {{the urban}} imaginary of the Self, examines expressions of Egyptian modernity {{through the use}} of the urban experience as a paradigm for it. The dissertation uses the three different genres of the essay, the novel, and film, in order to examine expressions of Egyptian modernity in its urban context. The dissertation is divided into two distinctive parts; part one examines representations of nineteenth century urban culture by focusing on the city imaginary in the works of two major Egyptian intellectuals, while part two examines expressions of urban culture in two recent film productions that focus on Cairo and Paris as terrains for the experience of modernity. Part one traces the emergence of the theme of al- tamaddun; urbanity, in the canon of Arabic literature and explains how it bound modern literary writing to modern citizenship. In analyzing the legacy of the nineteenth century literary expressions of al- tamaddun I aim to explain to the reader a multi- layered, multi-vocal reading of the nineteenth century texts focusing on the intricate relationship between these literary texts and the urban space which inspired them. Both Cairo and Paris appear as real and imaginary terrains around which new cultural aesthetics for modernity were weaved. To analyze expressions of urban culture of the nineteenth century I focus on the two genres of the essay and the novel I explain how urban factors such as circulation of commodities and texts, encounters, and the new culture of time and space which resulted from industrial modernity found expression in the literary works of nineteenth- century Egyptian authors. Whereas the canon of urban literature has been focused on familiar figures such as the flâneur, the gambler, and the blasé, such urban types are too Eurocentric in their connotations and occlude essential qualities of the global nature of nineteenth century Paris which became the Mecca of modernity for modernizers from different parts of the world. In the context of Arabic literature the figure of the sheikh emerges as a central narrator of the global space of nineteenth- century Paris. By making use of Benjamin's methodological use of the figures of urban culture, I use the figure of the sheikh to elucidate the most salient cultural themes that resulted from Muhammad Ali's modernization program, which contributed to the Arab cultural renaissance known as al- nahd&# 61481;a. Part one concludes by showing how the urban narratives of the modernizing sheikh raised a number of themes that bound discourses of Egyptian modernity to the rhetoric of citizenship in a new urban landscape that is predicated on a new sense of time and space that resulted from the use of technology. The use of technology in media productions has led to significant cultural changes. Whereas in the nineteenth century essays, and novels appeared to be revolutionary media through which modernizers have explicated the experience of modernity, {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century film was introduced to Egypt only to become the most popular artistic form of expression. It was film that came to play a central role in articulating the aesthetics of the experience of modernity as it was conceived by the Egyptian modernizers. In part two, I examine the role of Egyptian cinema in performing the intellectual flânerie that began in the nineteenth century and how the recent depictions of Cairo and <b>Paris</b> <b>act</b> as commentaries on the nahd&# 61481;a discourse of al-tamaddun...|$|E

40|$|The Berne Convention 1971 <b>Paris</b> <b>Act</b> {{covered the}} right of {{communication}} to the public incompletely and imperfectly through a tangle of occasionally redundant or self-contradictory provisions on 2 ̆ 2 public performance; 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 communication to the public, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 public communication, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 broadcasting, 2 ̆ 2 {{and other forms of}} transmission. Worse, the scope of rights depended {{on the nature of the}} work, with musical and dramatic works receiving the broadest protection, and images the least; literary works, especially those adapted into cinematographic works, lying somewhere in between. The 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty rationalized and synthesized protection by establishing full coverage of the communication right for all protected works of authorship. The WCT also introduced a new designation, the 2 ̆ 2 right of making available to the public. 2 ̆ 2 This right corresponds to much communication of works over the Internet, whose users 2 ̆ 2 access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them 2 ̆ 2 (WCT art. 8). As the drafters of the WCT (and its companion 2 ̆ 2 Internet treaty 2 ̆ 2 the WIPO Performers 2 ̆ 7 and Phonograms Treaty, arts. 10 and 14) sought to modernize the Berne Convention to address new exploitations by means of new technologies, one might infer that the 2 ̆ 2 right of making available 2 ̆ 2 is something new and different, not previously within the Berne Convention minimum rights protected. Whether the 2 ̆ 2 right of making available 2 ̆ 2 is a reaffirmation or an enlargement, its actual scope remains to be ascertained. This Essay will explore the meaning of 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 in the WCT and 2 ̆ 2 communication to the public 2 ̆ 2 in the Berne Convention by applying these concepts to several of the principal forms of communication over the Internet. How, for example, should one analyze communications to and from websites, or peer-to-peer exchanges, or email, under the Berne Convention? What, if anything, do the WIPO Treaties add to the analysis? Some of the WIPO Treaties 2 ̆ 7 provisions may fairly be deemed to reaffirm the scope of rights already present in the Berne Convention, while others clearly add new protections to the range of minimum rights. The WIPO Treaties have significantly expanded the subject matter coverage of the Berne Convention’s communication to the public right, filling in the kinds of blank spots that this Essay’s analysis exposes. The WIPO Treaties have also eliminated the disparate treatment of wired and wireless transmissions. The core concept of 2 ̆ 2 making available, 2 ̆ 2 however, can fairly be called neither a reaffirmation nor a novelty, for it resolves an ambiguity as to whether the old communication to the public rights accommodated or excluded 2 ̆ 2 pull technologies. 2 ̆ 2 This Essay has concluded that if Berne did not mandate the inclusion of recipient-initiated transmissions, neither did it preclude them. The right may have been incipient, but there was sufficient uncertainty to leave room for Member State interpretation. As a result, it is appropriate to mark the 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 right as a clarification. The text of article 8 of the WCT lends further support to this view of the communication to the public right because it encompasses the 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 right within the general exclusive right of communication to the public. As for the scope of the 2 ̆ 2 making available 2 ̆ 2 right, not all forms of communication of works over the Internet come within its reach. Moreover, some of the excluded (or at best ambiguously covered) communications may be economically significant. This suggests that, despite the aim of the WIPO Treaties 2 ̆ 7 enactors to assure 2 ̆ 2 effective and uniform 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 protection of the rights of authors, 2 ̆ 2 technology may continue to outstrip the ingenuity of the drafters of multilateral instruments...|$|E
