50|$|The {{technique}} {{involves the}} intrusion of a non-wetting liquid (often mercury) at high pressure into a material {{through the use of}} a <b>porosimeter.</b> The pore size can be determined based on the external pressure needed to force the liquid into a pore against the opposing force of the liquid's surface tension.|$|E
50|$|A mercury <b>porosimeter</b> is an {{instrument}} that allows the total volume of a powder to be determined, {{as well as the}} volume of pores of different sizes: A known mass of powder is submerged in mercury. At ambient pressure, the mercury does not invade the interparticle spaces or the pores of the sample. At increasing pressure, the mercury invades smaller and smaller pores, with the relationship between pore diameter and pressure being known. A continuous trace of pressure versus volume can then be generated, which allows for a complete characterization of the sample's porosity.|$|E
30|$|Pores (pore {{diameter}} and pore volume) of CNT agglomerates were measured by mercury <b>porosimeter</b> (Quantachrome PoreMaster 60). The relationship between applied pressure P and the pore diameter into which mercury intrudes D is {{expressed by the}} Washburn equation: D[*]=[*](−[*] 4 γcosθ)/P where γ is the surface tension of Hg (0.48  N m− 1) and θ is the contact angle between mercury and the pore wall (140 °) [20]. By monitoring intruded mercury volume against applied pressure, pore size and volume distribution can be obtained based on the Washburn equation. Buckypapers (50 – 100  mg) were {{cut into small pieces}} approximately 5  mm 2 to load into a <b>porosimeter</b> cell. Regarding SWNT forest and aligned, highly packed SWNTs, small pieces approximately 5  mm 2 were also loaded into a <b>porosimeter</b> cell of 4  mL by volume.|$|E

The EP technique is unique {{in its ability to}} measure porosity of very thin films down to 10nm, its reproducibility and speed of measurement. Compared to traditional <b>porosimeters,</b> Ellipsometer <b>porosimeters</b> are well suited to very thin film pore size and pore size distribution measurement.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project were to develop methodologies for (i) prediction and measurement {{of the magnitude of}} pressure which develops within pores of saturated porous materials upon freezing, (ii) determination of pore structure (pore size distribution) of porous materials; (iii) prediction and measurement of the rate with which pore ice grows; and (iv) prediction of frost susceptibility of porous materials with varying pore structures. As with all research endeavors solution of one problem leads to another one and this project was no exception. Emergence of new problems and the measures taken as the work progressed were discussed in progress reports submitted to the board. This final report will discuss only the conclusive finds and suggest measures to be taken for future investigations. The theory discussed in the proposal is not repeated in this report for the sake of brevity. However, the paper published as part of this project containing the theory is attached as Appendix I for the reader interested in the theory.

40|$|International audienceThe Horvath-Kawazoe (HK) {{model that}} allows {{computing}} the filling pressure of micropores is traditionally used in gas <b>porosimeters</b> {{to assess the}} pore size distribution of microporous materials because of its simplicity, {{even if it is}} known to overestimate the pore sizes. In this study, we propose a new thermodynamic model that is able to link the filling pressure of a slit micropore to its pore size and that describes both primary and secondary filling, which is not feasible with the original HK model. The principal novelty of the pore filling model presented in this work, in comparison to its HK predecessors, is the inclusion of both pore width and pressure in the estimation of the adsorbate density in the pore. Moreover, the model is based on a simplified schematization of the adsorbed fluid that is considered as a combination of dense homogeneous fluid layers parallel to the pore walls and interacting between them and with the solid. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations have been used to obtain the information concerning the number and density of fluid layers as a function of both pore width and pressure. Even if the method we propose is more general, this thermodynamic model is used in this work to compute, as a first example, the filling pressure of argon and nitrogen at 77. K in graphitic slit-like micropores and an excellent agreement is found with non local density functional theory results. Hence, the model is applied to compute, as a first test case, the pore size distribution of a carbon molecular sieve...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determining}} the pore structure of porous materials has been developed. The methodology combines relationships correlating the volume of unfrozen pore solution to electrical conductance, the pore solution freezing temperature to pore radii, and the electrical conductivity of the pore solution to temperature. These relationships are used with measurements of the electrical conductance and temperature to obtain pore size distributions of saturated porous materials subjected to a cycle of capillary freezing and melting;Based on this methodology, a conductometric phase transition <b>porosimeter</b> was constructed. The pore size distribution of porous Vycor glass was measured using this <b>porosimeter.</b> The modal neck and body radii measured by this method are 28 and 55 angstroms, respectively. The modal neck and body radii of the same Vycor sample as determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry are 30 and 85 angstroms and by dilatometric phase transition porosimetry, 27 and 49 angstroms, respectively. Modal neck sizes determined by all three methods are comparable. Modal body sizes determined by the two phase transition methods are also comparable. The modal body size determined by mercury porosimetry is significantly larger and this difference is due to problems associated with mercury porosimetry. These problems {{are discussed in the}} dissertation;Two of the most significant advantages the conductometric phase transition <b>porosimeter</b> has over currently available commercial porosimeters are the minimal sample preparation which results in less disturbance of pore structure and the ability to determine pore size distributions of large samples, much larger than other porosimeters can handle, thus minimizing sampling error. To illustrate these advantages, pore size distributions obtained from testing 4 -inch diameter by 4 -inch high portland cement mortar and concrete cylinders are presented. A comparative pore size distribution as determined by mercury porosimetry is also presented for portland cement mortar;The appendix of this dissertation contains a user 2 ̆ 7 s manual for the conductometric phase transition <b>porosimeter.</b> This manual contains instructions for operation of the <b>porosimeter,</b> <b>porosimeter</b> circuitry schematics, computer program descriptions, and computer program listing...|$|E
