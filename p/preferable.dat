5|$|Local subsoil {{of almost}} any {{composition}} can be used, although an adobe mix would be <b>preferable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sachs {{proposed}} that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is <b>preferable,</b> however, {{due to its}} limited subjectivity. Beyond 1400, one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{provisions}} of the Hague Convention, industrial firms in the Netherlands, France and Belgium were put to work producing war materiel for the occupying German military. Officials viewed this option as being <b>preferable</b> to their citizens being deported to the Reich as forced labour.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Norman nobility {{gathered}} at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring Theobald king, probably following {{the news that}} Stephen was gathering support in England. The Normans argued that the count, as the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the duchy, and was certainly <b>preferable</b> to Matilda.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Geneva Conference {{began in the}} fall of 1958, Eisenhower faced renewed {{domestic}} opposition to a comprehensive test ban as Senator Albert Gore Sr. argued in a widely circulated letter that a partial ban would <b>preferable</b> due to Soviet opposition to strong verification measures.|$|E
5|$|Since 2002, the American National Archives stores {{important}} national documents {{such as the}} Declaration of Independence and the Constitution within argon-filled {{cases to}} inhibit their degradation. Argon is <b>preferable</b> to the helium {{that had been used}} in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most containers and must be regularly replaced.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{contains}} organic material, {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, {{it is very difficult to}} get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It is <b>preferable</b> to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be <b>preferable,</b> especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being <b>preferable</b> over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
5|$|The camera's {{resolution}} is two-and-a-half {{times higher than}} the handheld's screens. However, their {{resolution is}} considerably lower than contemporaneous digital cameras and mobile phones. This was done to help keep their price reasonable and to maintain a <b>preferable</b> response time for viewing photos in quick session, particularity since numerous applications will use them.|$|E
5|$|There is significant, {{at times}} acrimonious, debate {{regarding}} which English {{translation of the}} Tao Te Ching is <b>preferable,</b> and which particular translation methodology is best. The Tao Te Ching is not thematically ordered. However, the main themes of the text are repeatedly expressed using variant formulations, often with only a slight difference.|$|E
5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality {{are less likely to}} be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is <b>preferable.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Nixon won re-election, {{inflation}} was returning. He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular {{with the public}} and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as <b>preferable</b> to the price board bureaucracy. The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E
5|$|Back in the penthouse, Susan, {{her bags}} packed, {{acknowledges}} {{to her brother}} that she attempted suicide, considering death <b>preferable</b> to living with him. She walks out on him, saying that she will go to Dallas and tells Hunsecker that she pities rather than hates him. A mortified J.J. looks at his sister from his apartment, as she walks out into the daylight.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{across the}} world from the conflict, the Australian colonies were {{affected}} by the American Civil War both economically and by immigration. The Australian cotton crop became more important to England, which had lost its American sources, and it served as a supply base for Confederate blockade runners. Immigrants from Europe seeking a better life also found Australia <b>preferable</b> to war-torn North America.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the <b>preferable</b> {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is <b>preferable</b> to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley {{opened a}} probe into the {{finances}} of six televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Creflo Dollar Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, Bishop Eddie Long Ministries, Joyce Meyer Ministries, and Paula White Ministries. In January 2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating {{that he believed}} self-regulation by religious organizations was <b>preferable</b> to government action. Only the ministries led by Meyer and Hinn cooperated with Grassley's investigation.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild {{taste with}} a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There {{are a number of}} other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are <b>preferable</b> to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet taste that turns bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E
5|$|The DDL project's {{problems}} harmed the Australian shipbuilding industry. The {{cancellation of}} both the DDLs and another project to develop an Australian fast combat support ship design led to a perception that technical risks needed to be minimised when selecting new warships, and it was <b>preferable</b> to rely on proven foreign designs. Australian industry was also left with a bad impression as companies {{involved in the project}} had devoted considerable resources to preparing tenders for the DDL.|$|E
5|$|The feature {{extraction}} using speeded up robust features (SURF) is {{also able to}} perform the inspection of certain elements having two possible states, such as pitot probes or static ports being covered or not covered. A pairing is performed between images of the element to be inspected in different states and that present on the scene. For these simple items to be inspected, an analysis during navigation is possible and <b>preferable</b> due to its time saving.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} enthalpy {{change can be}} determined by calorimetry or by using the van 't Hoff equation, though the calorimetric method is <b>preferable.</b> When both the {{standard enthalpy}} change and acid dissociation constant have been determined, the standard entropy change is easily calculated from the equation above. In the following table, the entropy terms are calculated from the experimental values of pKa and ΔH. The data were critically selected and refer to 25°C and zero ionic strength, in water.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Ćorović noted that, in {{comparison}} with Dušan, who had also left a considerably extended state, Tvrtko was not an overly ambitious conqueror so much as he was an able statesman. Tvrtko, he wrote, used force when necessary but otherwise took care to appear to Serbians as the legitimate heir {{rather than as a}} foreign subjugator and to the Croatians as the <b>preferable</b> ruler. Emphasizing his patience and diplomacy, Ćorović calls Tvrtko a man capable of making the most out of his opportunities.|$|E
5|$|After {{screening}} at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 20, 2007, Boogeyman 2 {{was released}} direct-to-video in the United States on January 8, 2008; {{it was later}} released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered {{it to be a}} general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was <b>preferable</b> to monsters in other contemporary creature features, including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, Boogeyman 3, the following year.|$|E
5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism, Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal rights as <b>preferable</b> to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be <b>preferable,</b> Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Both B.s. var.collina and var.spinulosa are {{commonly}} seen in nurseries; {{given that the}} varieties can hybridise, attempting to find a local provenance form from a local community nursery, Bushcare or Australian Plants Society group is <b>preferable</b> environmentally if they are intended for planting in gardens near bushland where native populations occur. There are some dwarf forms available for the city gardener – 'Stumpy Gold' {{is a form of}} variety collina originally from the Central Coast, while 'Birthday Candles', 'Coastal Cushion' and 'Golden Cascade' are forms of variety spinulosa from the South Coast of New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the news}} that Stephen was {{gathering}} support in England, the Norman nobility had gathered at Le Neubourg to discuss declaring his elder brother Theobald king. The Normans argued that the count, as the eldest grandson of William the Conqueror, had the most valid claim over the kingdom and the Duchy, and was certainly <b>preferable</b> to Matilda. Their discussions were interrupted by the sudden news from England that Stephen's coronation was to occur the next day. Theobald's support immediately ebbed away, as the barons were not prepared to support the division of England and Normandy by opposing Stephen.|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is <b>preferable</b> {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was <b>preferable</b> to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E
5|$|On {{water-based}} pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce {{friction and}} increase {{the speed at which}} the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are <b>preferable</b> for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile third-generation or 3G pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is <b>preferable</b> to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by solving a 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E
5|$|Rice is the {{foundation}} of every meal, and is often eaten with fish broth, greens, beans or squash. Manioc and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more <b>preferable</b> foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders and although they are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates generosity, and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. The sacrifice of zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to life events like marriage, death and birth.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is <b>preferable</b> due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Fort Sumter, {{which began}} the Civil War, {{occurred}} days later, before the border states convention could be held. Magoffin called a special legislative session on May 6, and the legislature authorized {{creation of a}} six-man commission to decide the state's course in the war. Breckinridge, Magoffin, and Richard Hawes were the states' rights delegates to the conference, while Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and Samuel S. Nicholas represented the Unionist position. The delegates were only able {{to agree on a}} policy of armed neutrality, which Breckinridge believed impractical and ultimately untenable, but <b>preferable</b> to more drastic actions. In special elections held June 20, 1861, Unionists won 9 of Kentucky's 10 House seats, and in the August 5 state elections, Unionists gained majorities in both houses of the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Tidus' dialogue, monologues {{and songs}} were {{included}} on the Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection and feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus CDs. Although he does not fully understand {{that he is not}} the fayth dream, Tidus feels that disappearing would be <b>preferable</b> to making Yuna cry again. The novel Final Fantasy X-2.5 ~Eien no Daishou~, set after Final Fantasy X-2, explores Tidus and Yuna's visit to Besaid Island 1,000 years before. The HD remastered version of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, adds an audio drama (Final Fantasy X: Will) in which Tidus is a new blitzball star who appears to be concealing an injury. After Yuna breaks up with him, Tidus helps her on a quest to defeat a reborn Sin. Tidus' disappearance between Final Fantasy X and its sequel will be explained in the game, Mobius Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and timber castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and earthwork sites, which meant it was <b>preferable</b> to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork castles {{were by no means}} useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E
