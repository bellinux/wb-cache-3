A role for phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) in neurite outgrowth from goldfish retinal explants has been examined by means of wortmannin (WT), a selective inhibitor of the enzyme. The presence of PI 3 K in retinal extracts was determined by means of immunoprecipitation as well as by an in vitro assay system for catalytic activity. The relative amount of the p 85 subunit of PI 3 K detected by western blot in the retina following optic nerve crush was unchanged.

Heat inactivation of enzymes prior to matrix disruption resulted in higher vitamin C values mainly in L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) form, while lack of enzyme inactivation resulted in high vitamin C losses resulting from conversion of L-AA to dehydroascorbic acid. Various treatments and their sequence of application influenced vitamin C stability as follows: (i) <b>crushing</b> <b>prior</b> to blanching reduced vitamin C stability and (ii) {{in the absence}} of heating, acidification increased vitamin C stability (iii) blanching <b>prior</b> to <b>crushing</b> resulted in higher vitamin C retention, with HTST blanching retaining more vitamin C than LTLT blanching.

In this study, broccoli {{was used as}} a case study. Regarding the folate poly-gamma-glutamate profile, endogenous folate poly-gamma-glutamates in broccoli florets were found predominantly as hepta- and hexa-gamma-glutamates. Crushing raw broccoli, acidification and LTLT blanching enhanced folate deconjugation resulting in monoglutamate, di- and tri-gamma-glutamates. Compared to other treatments, HTST blanching preformed <b>prior</b> to <b>crushing</b> resulted in the highest concentration of long chain poly-gamma-glutamates. Regarding folate poly-gamma-glutamates stability, acidification combined with LTLT blanching decreased folate stability whereas HTST blanching combined with different sequences of blanching and crushing did not affect folate poly-gamma-glutamates stability.

With the aim of increasing thiol precursor concentrations, {{a study of the}} effects of storing machine-harvested Sauvignon blanc grapes <b>prior</b> to <b>crushing</b> and pressing was undertaken on a commercial scale. 3 -Mercaptohexan- 1 -ol (3 -MH) precursors, 2 -S-glutathionylcaftaric acid (grape reaction product, GRP), glutathione (GSH) and a number of C 6 compounds were assessed at several time points during the experiment. The concentration of the cysteine precursor to 3 -MH doubled within 8 h and tripled after 30 h while the GSH and cysteinylglycine precursors increased in concentration roughly 1. 5 times. (E) - 2 -Hexenal and GSH levels decreased as thiol precursors, GRP and C 6 alcohols increased during storage.

50|$|Carbonic {{maceration}} is a winemaking technique, {{often associated}} with the French wine region of Beaujolais, in which whole grapes are fermented in a carbon dioxide rich environment <b>prior</b> to <b>crushing.</b> Conventional alcoholic fermentation involves crushing the grapes to free the juice and pulp from the skin with yeast serving to convert sugar into ethanol. Carbonic maceration ferments most of the juice while it is still inside the grape, although grapes {{at the bottom of}} the vessel are crushed by gravity and undergo conventional fermentation. The resulting wine is fruity with very low tannins. It is ready to drink quickly but lacks the structure for long-term aging. In the most extreme case, such as with Beaujolais nouveau, the period between picking and bottling can be less than six weeks.|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} {{carbonic}} maceration occurs naturally in a partial state without deliberate intervention and {{has occurred in}} some form throughout history. If grapes are stored in a closed container, {{the force of gravity}} will crush the grapes on the bottom, releasing grape juice. Ambient yeasts present on the grape skins will interact with the sugars in the grape juice to start conventional ethanol fermentation. Carbon dioxide is released as a by product and, being denser than oxygen, will push out the oxygen through any permeable surface (such as slight gaps between wood planks) creating a mostly anaerobic environment for the uncrushed grape clusters to go through carbonic maceration. Some of the earliest documented studies on the process were conducted by the French scientist Louis Pasteur who noted in 1872 that grapes contained in an oxygen rich environment <b>prior</b> to <b>crushing</b> and fermentation produced wines of different flavors than grapes produced in a carbon dioxide rich environment. This was because the fermentation process had already started within the individual grape clusters prior to the introduction of yeasts during conventional fermentation.|$|R

While stems can help with this cap management, they also provide an additional source of tannins that may be extracted into the wine.

The length of maceration, whether or not the wine stays in contact with its skin throughout the entire fermentation period, as well as the temperature that the wine is kept at throughout that fermentation will have an influence on the extraction of the color, tannins and phenols.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether EGCG would attenuate neuronal expression of NADPH-d/nNOS in the motor neurons of the lower brainstem following peripheral nerve crush. Thus, young adult rats were treated with EGCG (10, 25, or 50 mg/kg, i. p.) 30 min <b>prior</b> to <b>crushing</b> their hypoglossal and vagus nerves for 30 seconds (left side, at the cervical level). The treatment (pre-crush doses of EGCG) was continued from day 1 to day 6, and the animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, 14 and 28. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) immunohistochemistry were used to assess neuronal NADPH-d/nNOS expression in the hypoglossal nucleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Results In rats treated with high dosages of EGCG (25 or 50 mg/kg), NADPH-d/nNOS reactivity and cell death of the motor neurons were significantly decreased. Conclusions The present evidence indicated that EGCG can reduce NADPH-d/nNOS reactivity and thus may enhance motor neuron survival time following peripheral nerve injury. </p...|$|R

The aim of this research was exploring the influence of climatic factors on grapes compositive variables under the assumptions that the other factors were constant. The grape analysis was made considering the grapes taken by a centralised winery located in north-east of Italy in a region called Friuli Venezia Giulia from 1990 to 1993.

The results have been treated by some exploratory data analysis techniques such as fuzzygrams, linear regression (ordinary least squares) and robust regression (least absolute value), searching any relationships among bioclimatic indexes and composition variables (Babo degrees and total titratable acidity). There were no significant relationships between temperature (and relative indexes) and composition variables, but there were relationships between cumulative rain (and relative indexes like Ribcreau-Gayon index) and total titratable acidity.

Rising energy costs, emergent environmental concerns, and fitness for use of sunflower derived products {{have led to a}} growing interest in the dehulling of sunflower seeds <b>prior</b> to <b>crushing,</b> and burning of hulls in biomass boilers to yield process steam on site. This was made possible by prominent technological improvements in boiler technology. The torsional chamber technology exhibits good performances in full combustion of sunflower hulls, allowing for a high efficiency, a great flexibility, and a limited emission of pollutants. Yet, fumes may still have to be post-treated to ensure compliance with stringent restrictions in dust emissions. Being a robust and versatile technology, the torsional chamber is able to cope with a feedstock quality varying to a certain extent. The general design of a crushing plant fitted with a dehulling unit is impacted dramatically and becomes very sensitive to variations in hullability of the incoming seeds. Hull content and size of the seeds are correlated positively to hullability; moisture, density and oil content being correlated negatively. Hullability is affected mostly by environmental effects, cultivars being responsible for it to a lesser extent. Thus, hullability is impacted by upstream practices in plant breeding, field, and grain elevator management. Success in an efficient hulling strategy not only depends on the use of relevant technologies on processing plants, but also relies on knowledge of the seed and meal customer needs, as well as on concerted actions at various levels along the sunflower chain...|$|R

At Aram Dorsum the particle size and fluvial sedimentary features will be interesting. Hydrated perchlorates and sulphates are ideal targets possibly at every landing sites because of OH retention, especially if they are mixed with smectites, thus could point to even ancient wet periods. Extensive use of information from the infrared wall scanning will be complemented for geological context by orbital and rover imaging of nearby outcrops. Information from the context is especially useful to infer the possible action of past H 2 O. Separation of the ice and liquid water effects will be supported by cation abundance and sedimentary context. Shape of grains also helps here, and composition of transported grains points to the weathering potential of the environment in general.

Under the same conditions, we observed rapid loss of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) anthracene at air-water interfaces, but no loss was observed at air-ice interfaces.

In groups II, III and IV, the left sciatic nerve was exposed and compressed for 60 seconds with a jeweler's forceps. In Group I (n = 10), the sciatic nerve was explored but not crushed. In all groups of rats, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in samples of sciatic nerve tissue. Results Compared to Group I, Group II had significantly decreased tissue SOD and CAT activities and elevated MDA levels indicating crush injury (p 0. 05). Conclusion A-LA administered before crush injury of the sciatic nerve showed significant protective effects against crush injury by decreasing the oxidative stress. A-LA should be considered in the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries, but further studies are needed to explain the mechanism of its neuroprotective effects. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{report a}} series of cases of {{ulceration}} of the oral mucosa linked to direct contact with ferrous sulfate in elderly patients. CASE SUMMARY: The first case report concerns the occurrence of widespread oral ulceration in an 87 -year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. The ulceration extended {{from the side of}} the tongue to the floor of the mouth. No clear explanation was found and various local treatments were ineffective. Once it was realized that the ferrous sulfate tablets (given as an iron supplement) were <b>crushed</b> <b>prior</b> to administration (due to the patient's deglutition disorder), withdrawal of this treatment led to rapid resolution of the ulceration. Nine other cases of oral ulcerations associated with ferrous sulfate were identified in the French National Pharmacovigilance Database. All but one of the patients were over 80 years of age and the youngest patient (a 54 -year-old) had dysphagia associated with facial paralysis. DISCUSSION: Only two other reports of oral ulceration due to ferrous sulfate have been published to date. Mucosal toxicity of ferrous sulfate (which is probably related to oxidative stress) has previously been reported for the hypopharynx, the esophageal lumen, and (after inhalation of a tablet) the tracheobronchial tree. CONCLUSION: The mucosal toxicity of ferrous sulfate must be taken into account when deglutition disorders are present (as in elderly patients) and appropriate pharmaceutical formulations (such as syrups) should be administered to at-risk patients. The use of iron salts other than ferrous sulfate could be considered...|$|R
