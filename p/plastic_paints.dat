25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s China had {{numerous}} specialized national corporations handling import and export transactions {{in such areas}} as arts and crafts, textiles, natural produce and animal byproducts, foodstuffs of various kinds, chemicals, light industrial products, metals and minerals technology, industrial machinery and equipment, petrochemical and petroleum products, scientific instruments, aerospace technology and services, ships, and weapons. Although nominally supervised by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade each of these corporations was responsible for its own profits and losses. Included among these enterprises, for example, was the Great Wall Industrial Corporation, which imported and exported transportation vehicles, satellites and other products associated with aerospace programs, mechanical equipment, electrical products, hardware and tools, medical apparatus, and chemicals. China Northern Industrial Corporation, subordinate to the Ministry of Ordnance Industry, used military production facilities to manufacture civilian products for export. The business activities of China Northern Industrial Corporation included the sale of heavy machinery, hardware and tools, and heavy-duty vehicles; light chemical industry products, such as <b>plastic,</b> <b>paints,</b> and coatings; and high-precision machinery and optical and optical-electronic equipment. Other corporations offered a variety of professional consulting services. One of these, the China International Economic Consultants Corporation, provided economic and legal expertise on investment and other economic activities.|$|E
5000|$|One modern {{example is}} climate stability. [...] Classic {{examples}} of common goods are water and air. Water and air can be polluted: water flows can be tapped beyond sustainability, and air {{is often used}} in combustion, whether by motor vehicles, smokers, factories, wood fires. In the production process these resources and others are changed into finished products such as food, shoes, toys, furniture, cars, houses and televisions. Another example of a private exploitation treated as a renewable resource and commonly cited have been trees or timber at critical stages (used for wood and paper), oil (used for <b>plastic,</b> <b>paints,</b> foam, fabric, and often burned to create energy), mined metals (used to create machines, tools, nails, cans, coins), and crops (to become cotton and many kinds of foods). Fish stocks in international waters are also cited often. In this later example (avoiding any issues of the natural rights of the fish), while legal excluded from fishing may not apply, when fish are withdrawn from the water without any limits being imposed, living stocks of fish {{are likely to be}} depleted for any later fishermen. To describe situations in which economic users withdraw resources to secure short-term gains without regard for the long-term consequences, the term tragedy of the commons was coined. For example, forest exploitation leads to barren lands, and overfishing leads to a reduction of overall fish stocks, both of which eventually result in diminishing yields to be withdrawn periodically.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of damage to}} building materials has been estimated for the 21 st century, with a particular focus on aluminum, zinc, copper, <b>plastic,</b> <b>paint,</b> and rubber in urban areas. We set idealized air pollution and climates to represent London and Prague across the period 1950 - 2100. Environmental parameters were used to estimate future recession, corrosion, and loss of properties through published damage or dose-response functions. The 21 st century seems to provide a less aggressive environment for stone and metals than recent times. Improvements in air quality are the most relevant drivers for this amelioration. Changes in climate predicted for the 21 st century do not alter this picture. On the other hand, polymeric materials, <b>plastic,</b> <b>paint,</b> and rubber might show slightly increased rates of degradation, to some extent the result of enhanced oxidant concentrations, but also the possibility of contributions from more solar radiation...|$|R

Malonyl CoA reductase from C. aurantiacus and R. castenholzii was cloned and expressed in E. coli and R. rubrum respectively. This enzyme converts malonyl-CoA (a central metabolic intermediate) to 3 -HP. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed recombinant E. coli and R. rubrum produced 3 HP in low levels. The quantity of 3 -HP produced is not economical for commercial production so further studies were conducted to increase 3 HP production...|$|R
