Five four-inch drain valves are located in the north and south loadout pits (NLOP and SLOP), the weasel pit, the technical viewing pit, and the discharge chute pit. The sumps containing the valves are filled with concrete which covers the drain valve body. Visual observations indicate that only the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the twelve-inch drain valve and that much less of the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the five four-inch drain valves. It was recognized, however, that damage of the drain valve bonnet or stem during a seismic initiating event could provide a potential K Basin water leak path. The objectives of this analysis are to: (1) evaluate the likelihood of damaging the three twelve-inch drain valves located along the north wall of the main basin and the five four-inch drain valves located in the pits from a seismic initiating event, and (2) determine the likelihood of exceeding a specific consequence (initial leak rate) from a damaged valve. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where each variable is modeled using available information and engineering judgement. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution (probability density function). Uncertainty exists because of the inherent randomness associated with the distribution of values that a variable may assume, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge concerning a variable. Engineering judgement and technical information are used to develop the variable probability density functions, but the bounds of the probability density function are based on physical limitations. The uncertainty, described by probability distributions, is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve'') ...|$|E

In 1990, cracking was reported in the core shroud of a non-U. S. BWR. The cracks were located in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a circumferential core shroud weld. Subsequent inspections in U. S.

One of the applications of SiC is as a very thin layer in the TRi-ISOtropic (TRISO) coated fuel particles for high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs). This SiC layer, produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is designed to withstand the pressures of fission and transmutation product gases in a high temperature, radiation environment. Various researchers have demonstrated that macroscopic properties can be affected by changes {{in the distribution of}} grain boundary plane orientations and misorientations [1 - 3]. Additionally, various researchers have attributed the release behavior of Ag through the SiC layer as a grain boundary diffusion phenomenon [4 - 6]; further highlighting the importance of understanding the actual grain characteristics of the SiC layer. Both historic HTGR fission product release studies and recent experiments at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) [7] have shown that the release of Ag- 110 m is strongly temperature dependent.

40|$|Some of the unirradiated High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) control {{elements}} discharged {{during the late}} 1990 s were observed to have cladding damage [...] local swelling or blistering. The cladding damage {{was limited to the}} tantalum/europium interface of the element and is thought to result from interaction of hydrogen and europium to form a compound of lower density than europium oxide, thus leading to a ''blistering'' of the control plate cladding. Reducing the tantalum loading in the control plates should help preclude this phenomena. The impact of the change to the control plates on the operation of the reactor was assessed. Regarding nominal, steady-state reactor operation, the impact of the change in the power distribution in the core due to reduced tantalum content was calculated and found to be insignificant. The magnitude and impact of the change in differential control element worth was calculated, and the differential worths of reduced tantalum elements vs the current elements from equivalent-burnup critical configurations were determined to be unchanged within the accuracy of the computational method and relevant experimental measurements. The location of the critical {{control elements}} symmetric positions for reduced tantalum elements was found to be 1 / 3 in. less withdrawn relative to existing control elements regardless of the value of fuel cycle burnup (time in the fuel cycle).

40|$|Pressing {{demands of}} {{economic}} competitiveness, {{the need for}} large-scale deployment, minimizing the need of human intervention, and experience from the past events and incidents at operating reactors have guided the evolution and innovations in reactor technologies. Indian innovative reactor ‘AHWR’ is a pressure-tube type natural circulation based boiling water reactor {{that is designed to}} meet such requirements, which essentially reflect the needs of next generation reactors. The reactor employs various passive features to prevent and mitigate accidental conditions, like a slightly negative void reactivity coefficient, passive poison injection to scram the reactor in event of failure of the wired shutdown systems, a large elevated pool of water as a heat sink inside the containment, passive decay heat removal based on natural circulation and passive valves, passive ECC injection, etc. It is designed to meet the fundamental safety requirements of safe shutdown, safe decay heat removal and confinement of activity with no impact in public domain, and hence, no need for emergency planning under all conceivable scenarios. This paper examines the role of the various passive safety systems in prevention and mitigation of severe plant conditions that may arise in event of multiple failures. For the purpose of demonstration of the effectiveness of its passive features, postulated scenarios on the lines of three major severe accidents in the history of nuclear power reactors are considered, namely; the Three Mile Island (TMI), Chernobyl and Fukushima <b>accidents.</b> Severe plant <b>conditions</b> along the lines of these scenarios are postulated to the extent conceivable in the reactor under consideration and analyzed using best estimate system thermal-hydraulics code RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 2.

The reactor also provides other irradiation services such as radioisotope production. The ATR and its support facilities are located at the Test Reactor Area of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). An audit conducted by the Department of Energy&# 39;s Office of Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance (DOE OA) raised concerns that design conditions at the ATR were not adequately analyzed in the safety analysis and that legacy design basis management practices had the potential to further impact safe operation of the facility. 1 The concerns identified by the audit team, and issues raised during additional reviews performed by ATR safety analysts, were evaluated through the unreviewed safety question process resulting in shutdown of the ATR for more than three months while these concerns were resolved. Past management of the ATR safety basis, relative to facility design basis management and change control, led to concerns that discrepancies in the safety basis may have developed. Although not required by DOE orders or regulations, not performing design basis verification in conjunction with development of the 10 CFR 830 Subpart B upgraded safety basis allowed these potential weaknesses to be carried forward. Configuration management and a clear definition of the existing facility design basis have a direct relation to developing and maintaining a high quality safety basis which properly identifies and mitigates all hazards and <b>postulated</b> <b>accident</b> <b>conditions.</b> These relations and the impact of past safety basis management practices have been reviewed in order to identify lessons learned from the safety basis upgrade process and appropriate actions to resolve possible concerns with respect to the current ATR safety basis.

40|$|Because of {{delays in}} closing {{the back end}} of the fuel cycle in the U. S., {{there is a need to}} extend dry inert storage of spent fuel beyond its {{originally}} anticipated 20 -year duration. Many of the methodologies developed to support initial licensing for 20 -year storage should be able to support the longer storage periods envisioned. This paper evaluates the applicability of existing information and methodologies to support dry storage up to 100 years. The thrust of the analysis is the potential behavior of the spent fuel. In the USA, the criteria for dry storage of LWR spent fuel are delineated in 10 CFR 72 [1]. The criteria fall into four general categories: maintain subcriticality, prevent the release of radioactive material above acceptable limits, ensure that radiation rates and doses do not exceed acceptable levels, and maintain retrievability of the stored radioactive material. These criteria need to be considered for normal, off-normal, and <b>postulated</b> <b>accident</b> <b>conditions.</b> The initial safety analysis report submitted for licensing evaluated the fuel's ability to meet the requirements for 20 years. It is not the intent to repeat these calculations, but to look at expected behavior over the additional 80 years, during which the temperatures and radiation fields are lower. During the first 20 years, the properties of the components may change because of elevated temperatures, presence of moisture, effects of radiation, etc. During normal storage in an inert atmosphere, there is potential for the cladding mechanical properties to change due to annealing or interaction with cask materials. The emissivity of the cladding could also change due to storage conditions. If there is air leakage into the cask, additional degradation could occur through oxidation in breached rods, which could lead to additional fission gas release and enlargement of cladding breaches. Air in-leakage could also affect cover gas conductivity, cladding oxidation, emissivity changes, and excessive creep and mechanical property changes. <b>Postulated</b> <b>accident</b> scenarios would be the same for 20 -year or 100 -year storage, because they are mostly governed by operational or outside events, and not by the cask or fuel. Analyses of accident scenarios during extended dry storage could be impacted by fuel and cask changes that would result from the extended period of storage. Overall, the results of this work indicate that, based on fuel behavior, spent fuel at burnups below {approximately} 45 GWd/MTU can be dry stored for 100 years. Long-term storage of higher burnup fuel or fuels with newer cladding will require the determination of temperature limits based on evaluation of stress-driven degradation mechanisms of the cladding...|$|R

This work is expected to contribute to LMFBR safety analysis in two ways. First, it will provide a capability for obtaining more dependable information concerning the effects of subassembly voiding incoherence in LMFBR's of current design. Second, it will provide the calculational tools needed to develop new designs with features that could inhibit radial void growth and thus, enhance the reactor safety. Two codes are being developed in parallel. The first will use a two fluid (6 equation) model which is more difficult to develop but has the potential for providing a code with the utmost in flexibility and physical consistency for use in the long term. The other will use a "mixture" (< 6 equation) model which is less general but may be more amenable to interpretation and use of experimental data and therefore, easier to develop for use in the near term. To assure that the models developed are not design dependent, geometries and transient conditions typical of both foreign and U. S. designs are being considered. In addition to the code development, a study is being conducted which is aimed at obtaining a basic understanding of flow oscillations observed in low power, low flow sodium boiling experiments conducted at ORNL using the THORS test facility.

The NGNP is assumed to be a modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), either a gas-turbine modular helium reactor (GTMHR) version [a prismatic-core modular reactor (PMR) ] or a pebble-bed modular reactor (PBMR) version [a pebble bed reactor (PBR) ] design, with either a direct- or indirect-cycle gas turbine (Brayton cycle) system for electric power production, and an indirect-cycle component for hydrogen production. NGNP design options with a high-pressure steam generator (Rankine cycle) in the primary loop are not considered in this PIRT. This graphite PIRT was conducted in parallel with four other NRC PIRT activities, taking advantage of the relationships and overlaps in subject matter.

Two phenomena were ranked with medium importance and low knowledge, and a further 14 were ranked medium importance and medium knowledge rank. The last 12 phenomena were ranked with low importance and high knowledge rank (or similar combinations suggesting they have low priority). The ranking/scoring rationale for the reported graphite phenomena is discussed. Much has been learned about the behavior of graphite in reactor environments in the 60 -plus years since the first graphite rectors went into service. The extensive list of references in the Bibliography is plainly testament to this fact. Our current knowledge base is well developed. Although data are lacking for the specific grades being considered for Generation IV (Gen IV) concepts, such as the NGNP, it is fully expected that the behavior of these graphites will conform to the recognized trends for near isotropic nuclear graphite. Thus, much of the data needed is confirmatory in nature. Theories that can explain graphite behavior have been postulated and, in many cases, shown to represent experimental data well. However, these theories need to be tested against data for the new graphites and extended to higher neutron doses and temperatures pertinent to the new Gen IV reactor concepts. It is anticipated that current and planned future graphite irradiation experiments will provide the data needed to validate many of the currently accepted models, as well as providing the needed data for design confirmation...|$|R
40|$|VOCALIST (validation of constraint-based {{methodology}} in structural integrity) was {{a shared}} cost action project co-financed by DG Research of the European Commission under the Fifth Framework of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). The motivation for VOCALIST {{was based on}} the understanding that the pattern of crack-tip stresses and strains causing plastic flow and fracture in components is different to that in test specimens. This gives rise to the so-called constraint effect. Crack-tip constraint in components is generally lower than in test specimens. Effective toughness is correspondingly higher. The fracture toughness measured on test specimens is thus likely to underestimate that exhibited by cracks in components. The purpose of VOCALIST was to develop validated models of the constraint effect and associated best practice advice, with the objective of aiding improvements in defect assessment methodology for predicting safety margins and making component lifetime management decisions. The main focus in VOCALIST was an assessment of constraint effects on the cleavage fracture toughness of ferritic steels used in the fabrication of nuclear reactor pressure vessels, because of relevance to the development of improved safety assessments for plant under <b>postulated</b> <b>accident</b> <b>conditions.</b> This paper provides a detailed summary of the main results and conclusions from VOCALIST and points out their contribution to advances in constraint-based methodology for structural integrity assessment. In particular, the output from VOCALIST has improved confidence in the use of KJ − Tstress and KJ − Q approaches to assessments of cleavage fracture where the effects of in-plane constraint are dominant. Cleavage fracture models based on the Weibull stress, W, {{have been shown to be}} reliable, although current best practice advice suggests that W should be computed in terms of hydrostatic stress (as distinct from maximum principal stress) for problems involving out-of-plane loading. Correspondingly, the results suggest that the hydrostatic parameter, QH, is the appropriate one with which to characterize crack-tip constraint in analysing such problems. The materials characterization test results generated as part of VOCALIST have provided added confidence in the use of sub-size specimens to determine the Master Curve reference temperature, T 0, for as-received and degraded ferritic RPV materials. The usefulness of correlating the Master Curve reference temperature, T 0, with the constraint parameter, Q, has been demonstrated; however, the trend curves derived require further development and validation before they can be used in fracture analyses. The output from VOCALIST has contributed in providing the validation of methodology necessary to underpin the diffusion of constraint-based fracture mechanics arguments in RPV safety cases, with potential applications including WWER as well asWestern-style LWR reactor types.

40|$|The Boosted Fast Flux Loop (BFFL) {{project was}} {{initiated}} to determine basic feasibility of designing, constructing, and installing {{in a host}} irradiation facility, an experimental vehicle that can replicate with reasonable fidelity the fast-flux test environment needed for fuels and materials irradiation testing for advanced reactor concepts. Originally called the Gas Test Loop (GTL) project, the activity included (1) determination of requirements that must be met for the GTL to be responsive to potential users, (2) a survey of nuclear facilities that may successfully host the GTL, (3) conceptualizing designs for hardware that can support the needed environments for neutron flux intensity and energy spectrum, atmosphere, flow, etc. needed by the experimenters, and (4) examining other aspects of such a system, such as waste generation and disposal, environmental concerns, needs for additional infrastructure, and requirements for interfacing with the host facility. A revised project plan included requesting an interim decision, termed CD- 1 A, that had objectives of' establishing {{the site for the}} project at the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), deferring the CD 1 application, and authorizing a research program that would resolve the most pressing technical questions regarding GTL feasibility, including issues relating to the use of booster fuel in the ATR. Major research tasks were (1) hydraulic testing to establish flow conditions through the booster fuel, (2) mini-plate irradiation tests and post-irradiation examination to alleviate concerns over corrosion at the high heat fluxes planned, (3) development and demonstration of booster fuel fabrication techniques, and (4) a review {{of the impact of the}} GTL on the ATR safety basis. A revised cooling concept for the apparatus was conceptualized, which resulted in renaming the project to the BFFL. Before the subsequent CD- 1 approval request could be made, a decision was made in April 2006 that further funding for the project would be suspended. Remaining funds have been used to prepare and irradiate mini-plates of the proposed booster fuel. The current baseline design is for a set of three test positions inside an in-pile tube with a thermal neutron absorber and heat sink made of aluminum mixed with hafnium. Operating the ATR at power levels needed to achieve the required fast flux will result in an estimated increase in ATR fuel consumption between 15 and 20 % above present rates and a reduction in the time between fuel replacements.

40|$|As {{part of the}} APT project, it was {{necessary}} to quantify the release of tungsten from the APT spallation target during <b>postulated</b> <b>accident</b> <b>conditions</b> in order to develop accident source terms for accident consequence characterization. Experiments with tungsten rods at high temperatures in a flowing steam environment characteristic of <b>postulated</b> <b>accidents</b> revealed that considerable vaporization of the tungsten occurred as a result of reactions with the steam and that the aerosols which formed were readily transported away from the tungsten surfaces, thus exposing fresh tungsten to react with more steam. The resulting tungsten release fractions and source terms were undesirable and it was decided to clad the tungsten target with Inconel 718 in order to protect it from contact with steam during an accident and mitigate the accident source term and the consequences. As part of the material selection criteria, experiments were conducted with Inconel 718 at high temperatures to evaluate the rate of oxidation of the proposed clad material over as wide a temperature range as possible, as well as to determine the high-temperature failure limit of the material. Samples of Inconel 718 were inserted into a preheated furnace at temperatures ranging from 973 K to 1620 K and oxidized in air for varying periods of time. After oxidizing in air at a constant temperature for the prescribed time and then being allowed to cool, the samples would be reweighed to determine their weight gain due to the uptake of oxygen. From these weight gain measurements, it was possible to identify three regimes of oxidation for Inconel 718 : a low-temperature regime in which the samples became passivated after the initial oxidation, an intermediate-temperature regime in which the rate of oxidation was limited by diffusion and exhibited a constant parabolic rate dependence, and a high-temperature regime in which material deformation and damage accompanied an accelerated oxidation rate above the parabolic regime. At temperatures below 1173 K, the rate of oxidation of the Inconel 718 surface was found to decrease markedly with time; the parabolic oxidation rate coefficient was not a constant but decreased with time. This was taken to indicate that the oxide film on the surface was having a passivating effect on oxygen transport through the oxide to the underlying metal. For temperatures in the range 1173 K to 1573 K, the time-dependent rate of oxidation as determined once again by weight-gain measurements was found to display the classical parabolic rate behavior, indicating that the rate of transport of reactants through the oxide was controlled by diffusion through the growing oxide layer. Parabolic rate coefficients were determined by least-squares analysis of time-dependent mass-gain data at 1173 K, 1273 K, 1373 K, 1473 K and 1573 K. At temperatures above 1540 K, post test examination of the oxidized samples revealed that the Inconel 718 began to lose strength and to deform. At 1540 K, samples which were suspended from their ends during testing began to demonstrate axial curvature as they lost strength and bowed under their own weight. As the temperatures of the tests were increased, rivulets were seen to appear on the surfaces of the test specimens; damage became severe at 1560 K. Although melting was never observed in any of these tests even up to. 1620 K, it was concluded from these data that the Inconel 718 clad should not be expected to protect the underlying tungsten at temperatures above 1540 K...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The QUENCH {{experimental}} programme at FZ Karlsruhe investigates phenomena {{associated with}} reflood of a degrading core under <b>postulated</b> severe <b>accident</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{in the early}} phase where the geometry is still mainly rod-like. The latest large-scale bundle test, QUENCH- 13, {{is the first in}} this programme to include a silver/indium/cadmium (SIC) control rod of prototypic PWR design. The effects of the presence of the control rod on early-phase degradation and on reflood behaviour are examined under integral conditions, while the opportunity is taken to measure, in realistic geometry, release of SIC aerosols following control rod rupture. These materials can affect the chemistry of fission products in the reactor circuit, and hence the radioactive source term to the environment in the event of containment failure. In particular, the sharp release of cadmium on control rod failure, which can involve some tens of percent of the inventory, is ill-defined experimentally. Pre-test calculations were performed to determine the test boundary conditions, such as the electrical power history to the bundle, the coolant flow, and the reflood timing and rate. The aim was to stabilise the bundle at maximum temperature of 1250 K, then ramped at about 0. 25 K/s to give the best chance to measure the control rod aerosol release under controlled conditions, then to reflood, without provoking an oxidation excursion, at maximum bundle temperature of 1800 - 1850 K. A further aim was to check thermal conditions in the offgas pipe, where the aerosol instrumentation was situated. The calculational support was organised through the Source Term area of the EU 6 th Framewor...|$|R
40|$|Under <b>postulated</b> severe <b>accident</b> <b>conditions</b> in {{a nuclear}} reactor most of the {{radioactivity}} would be released from the damaged core to the containment in form of aerosols and chemical vapours and gases. However the radio-toxicity of released materials (source term) depends on both the released mass and on their chemical form. This paper presents {{the analysis of the}} severe accident initiated by a Medium Break on the cold leg combined with the total loss of electric power supply (Station Black Out) using the severe accident integral code ASTEC. As reference reactor a 3 -loop 1000 MWe PWR type at the end of equilibrium fuel cycle has been used. A detailed description of the reactor model is given together with the sensitivity analyses performed in terms of break location and accumulator availability. The study shows that break location has an impact on the carrier gas temperature and in turn on the chemical speciation of the fission products. Fission-product retention is influenced by the different flow pathways that are established in the circuit. The accumulator availability extends the duration of the core degradation process affecting the total production of hydrogen and the cumulated released mass of fission products. In agreement with the ASTEC equilibrium chemistry model, the Molybdenum/Caesium molar ratio has the most influence on the fraction of Iodine which can reach the containment in the gaseous or highly volatile form. Due to the surplus of Caesium, the predicted dominant Iodine species to the containment are Caesium Iodide and its dimmer. A 3 - 4 % of Iodine which reaches the break also exists in gaseous and highly volatile metal-iodides species. JRC. F. 5 -Nuclear Reactor Safety Assessmen...|$|R
