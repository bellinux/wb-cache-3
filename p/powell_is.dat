25|$|In early 2000, Helena lets Lucky (now Young) go and {{it becomes}} clear he has been brainwashed. Helena uses the Ice Princess diamond to make Lucky act violently and erases Lucky's {{memories}} of love for Elizabeth. Elizabeth fakes her death to help Nikolas (then Stephen Martines, credited as Coltin Scott) gain Helena's trust, and Lucky's visions of her and their love help him break Helena's control. They reunite, but {{he is unable to}} regain his feelings and in December 2001, Elizabeth stops their wedding when she realizes the truth. They struggle to start over, and Elizabeth breaks up with Lucky after she finds him kissing her sister Sarah Webber (then Sarah Laine). In August 2002, Lucky and Nikolas try to cover up the death of Laura's stepfather Rick Webber (Chris Robinson) when they think Luke killed him. When Laura is told she killed Rick, she has a mental breakdown and has to be committed. Luke acts self-destructively and Nikolas takes control of Laura's treatment, causing tension between Luke and Lucky (now Vaughan). When Lucky's girlfriend Summer Halloway (Brittney <b>Powell)</b> <b>is</b> pushed off a cliff, he joins the police academy to help find evidence. Luke is unhappy that Lucky has become a cop, causing various rifts between them. In February 2004, Lucky almost dies during a fire at the Port Charles Hotel. When Nikolas (reprised by Christopher) is presumed dead in April, Lucky comforts Emily (now Natalia Livingston) and develops romantic feelings she does not return. Lucky is suspended for helping Nikolas when he presumably kills Helena. Lucky finds Helena, who shoots him, putting him into a coma. Luke unplugs his ventilator, causing him to breathe on his own. Meanwhile, Lucky and Elizabeth reconnect. Their financial struggles prompt Elizabeth to become a surrogate mother for Courtney (Alicia Leigh Willis) and Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), upsetting Lucky, but Elizabeth miscarries in September 2005. They marry in October, and raises Liz's son Cameron as his own. Lucky almost dies in a train crash on the way to their honeymoon, and again during an encephalitis outbreak in February 2006. In April, he has a serious back injury while trying to save Elizabeth from Manny Ruiz (Robert LaSardo). Overcome by his injury, financial trouble and guilt over the death of his partner Jesse Beaudry (Matt Marraccini), Lucky becomes addicted to painkillers and has an affair with Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). Elizabeth walks in on them, and sleeps with Jason Morgan, becoming pregnant. She lets Lucky believe he is the father to avoid him relapsing. Maxie fakes a pregnancy in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Lucky. Elizabeth divorces Lucky, but they remarry after he completes rehab. In May 2007, Elizabeth gives birth to Jacob Spencer. Her relationship with Jason makes Lucky jealous, and their marriage struggles. Lucky starts dating Jason's ex-girlfriend Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) as they divorce. In November 2007, Lucky discovers the truth about Jake, but agrees to the secret to protect him from Jason's dangerous lifestyle. Lucky and Sam break up.|$|E

500|$|The first Europeans who {{happened}} upon Lees Ferry {{were members of}} the 18th-century Dominguez-Escalante Expedition, an attempt to find an overland route through the Southwest between Spanish settlements in present-day New Mexico and California, and in the process, to convert as many Southwestern Native Americans as possible to Christianity. In late 1776, the party ran out of supplies in what is now southern Utah and having decided to turn back towards Santa Fe, {{had to find a way}} to cross the Colorado River. Their Native American guides told them of two regional fords of the river, one at the site of Lees Ferry and the other at Glen Canyon. When the explorers arrived at Lees Ferry in October, they found the river too wide and deep and had no choice but to head for the second ford more than [...] upstream. Almost two weeks later they successfully crossed the river, and made it back to Santa Fe on January 2, 1777.

500|$|Like serials {{throughout}} history, {{soap operas}} use the unstable {{identity as a}} literary device, which {{is evidenced by the}} genre's use of mistaken identities, evil twins, and characters that suffer from multiple personality disorder and whom come back from the dead. [...] Identity is used in the rape storyline as well. [...] Before the rape, Todd was crude yet still human, but afterwards, he became a dehumanized embodiment of rage, demonstrated by Todd's bizarre and dangerous behavior after his conviction. Powell Lord, whose name is full of the same kind of symbolism Dickens used when choosing his characters' names and who initially urges his friends to let Marty go yet ultimately gives into peer pressure, is a [...] "relative 'good character as compared to Todd's absolute evil' identity". In Hayward's opinion, [...] "The show also departs from the rape paradigm not only by insisting on the essential 'goodness' of Powell Lord... but even more startlingly by redeeming the evil Todd". [...] Initially, [...] "the increasingly guilt-ridden" [...] <b>Powell</b> <b>is</b> the only rapist who has a conscience. [...] He attempts to convince Todd and Zach to confess their crime, and comes close to confessing to his lawyer. [...] Hayward calls Powell, like Todd, [...] "redeemed", but unlike Todd, was so guilt-ridden that he attempted suicide, was forgiven by Marty, and received a much lighter jail sentence than Zach or Todd.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith <b>Powell)</b> <b>is</b> {{upset that}} Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{cross-dressing}} on TGS {{because it is}} demeaning to African-Americans. After a bit of objection, Toofer convinces Tracy to stop, handing the female character over to Josh Girard (Lonny Ross). Once Josh's character is successful, Tracy is upset with Toofer. Liz convinces Toofer to work with Tracy. As they work together, Tracy gets upset with Toofer's supposed lack of blackness, and endearingly calls Toofer a racial slur. The next morning, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), Liz, Toofer, and Tracy {{sit down for a}} meeting about Tracy's vocabulary from the previous night. Tracy and Jack point out that the African-American community has adopted the word to deprive it of its meaning. In trying to reach out to Tracy, Toofer says the word again but because of his perceived cultural whiteness, everyone, including Tracy, is offended in a way they weren't when Tracy used the term. Tracy and Toofer attend sensitivity training, start arguing, and in the process develop a new sketch for TGS. When show starts running short on time, Liz offers Tracy the option to either air the sketch or one from the Star Jones cooking show, Tracy chooses the latter. Toofer is initially upset, but agrees with Tracy's decision when he finds the sketch funny.|$|E

500|$|Todd survives {{and hides}} at Llanfair, where he befriends two children, C. J. and Sarah Roberts. He is arrested when he jealously confronts new couple Rebecca and Powell. His prison van gets into an {{accident}} with another vehicle, and he rescues Marty, C. J. and Jessica (Erin Torpey) from the car. This {{results in an}} early parole for Todd, but he continues to seek counseling. He is later accused of rape by several women. Marty reluctantly provides him with an alibi {{for one of the}} attacks. A deranged Powell, believing Todd is in his head, is later revealed as the serial rapist and kidnaps Rebecca. When Todd confronts him, making it so that Rebecca can escape, he kidnaps Todd and makes Todd feel the way Marty felt when they raped her. Todd proceeds to overpower Powell. After <b>Powell</b> <b>is</b> caught and arrested, Todd apologizes to Marty for all the pain he caused her, recognizing that he [...] "was a monster." [...] He begins falling in love with Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) after meeting her in a bar. In December 1994, Peter Manning dies and Todd learns he is adopted. Conman David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) discovers Todd's biological parents, Victor Lord and Irene Manning. With help from Todd's scheming biological sister, Tina, David claims to be the lost Lord heir, but Todd's true parentage is ultimately revealed, leaving Todd $27.8 million richer. He purchases a tabloid paper from Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser) and relaunches it as The Sun, a direct rival to his new-found family's newspaper The Banner. In 1995, Blair tricks Todd into marriage by faking a pregnancy. She later learns that she really is pregnant, but, after being mugged, she miscarries. Todd discovers she initially lied about her pregnancy and has the marriage annulled. When Blair becomes pregnant again, they remarry in November 1995. Although they are happy, Blair dislikes Todd's consistent concern for Marty. He goes to Ireland to give Marty a flight back to Llanview. Her friend, Patrick Thornhart (Thorsten Kaye), is being hunted by Irish terrorists. Todd poses as Patrick, is shot, and presumed dead. Blair blames Marty. Todd returns to Llanview in 1996, to find Blair in bed with Patrick. His sister, Victoria [...] "Viki" [...] Lord (Erika Slezak), introduces him to his daughter, Starr (Kristen Alderson). Todd eventually resumes his life with Blair. They have many difficulties in their marriage, and Starr being diagnosed with aplastic anemia strains the marriage further.|$|E
