25|$|Pepper loses {{flavour and aroma}} through evaporation, so {{airtight}} storage helps {{preserve its}} spiciness longer. Pepper can also lose flavour when exposed to light, which can transform piperine into nearly tasteless isochavicine. Once ground, pepper's aromatics can evaporate quickly; most culinary sources recommend grinding whole peppercorns immediately before use for this reason. Handheld <b>pepper</b> <b>mills</b> or grinders, which mechanically grind or crush whole peppercorns, are used for this, sometimes instead of pepper shakers that dispense pre-ground <b>pepper.</b> Spice <b>mills</b> such as <b>pepper</b> <b>mills</b> were found in European kitchens {{as early as the}} 14th century, but the mortar and pestle used earlier for crushing pepper have remained a popular method for centuries as well.|$|R

The state highway heads northeast along the height of land between Upper Machodoc Creek {{to the south and}} <b>Pepper</b> <b>Mill</b> Creek to the north. After passing through Weedonville, SR 206 leaves the short ridge and crosses <b>Pepper</b> <b>Mill</b> Creek to reach Berthaville, where the highway intersects SR 218 (Caledon Road). The two highways run concurrently east to Owens, where SR 218 turns south as Windsor Drive. SR 206 has an oblique intersection with U.S. Route 301 (James Madison Parkway) then crosses Williams Creek into Dahlgren.

5000|$|A {{new series}} of Trigger Happy TV was made for the US market in 2003, for Comedy Central. It {{retained}} the original format but almost all sketches were performed by a cast including Jessica Makinson (13 episodes), Travis Draft (4 episodes), Jerry Minor (4 episodes) and Brett Reylander (3 episodes). A total of 13 episodes were made and broadcast on Comedy Central in the US, comprising the one series. Recurring sketches included a waitress with a large <b>pepper</b> <b>mill</b> appearing in incongruous places such as a park and offering {{members of the public}} fresh ground pepper, and a cheerleader whose inappropriate cheers featured topics such as skin cancer. The series was subsequently broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK, under the title [...] "Trigger Happy TV USA." [...] Though Joly did cameo sporadically on the show (he appeared {{to a greater or lesser}} extent in 4 episodes), he was very unhappy with the programme and called it [...] "Trigger Happy by numbers".

Values for CF 4, CF 3 Cl, CF 2 Cl 2, CFCl 3, CHF 3, SF 6 and NF 3 in fluorites, granites, basalts and other igneous and metamorphic rocks are reported.

40|$|Phase {{transitions}} in manipulation tasks often occur when contacts between objects are made or broken. A switch of the phase {{can result in}} the robot’s actions suddenly influencing different aspects of its environment. Therefore, the boundaries between phases often correspond to constraints or subgoals of the manipulation task. In this paper, we investigate how the phases of manipulation tasks {{can be learned from}} data. The task is modeled as an autoregressive hidden Markov model, wherein the hidden phase transitions depend on the observed states. The model is learned from data using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We demonstrate the proposed method on both a pushing task and a <b>pepper</b> <b>mill</b> turning task. The proposed approach was compared to a standard autoregressive hidden Markov model. The experiments show that the learned models can accurately predict the {{transitions in}} phases during the manipulation tasks...|$|E
40|$|When I was {{registering}} for {{my wedding}} (many, many years ago), I hesitated registering for {{the salt and}} pepper shaker. Although I knew I would use the pepper shaker, I was not so sure about the salt shaker. I never salt at the table and the only time I use salt in my cooking is when I bake. (Salt not only adds flavor but it also stalls the chemical process in baked goods.) Well meaning friends and family members reminded me that if I were ever to entertain, I would need to have them available to offer to my guests. After much consultation, I reluctantly added {{the salt and pepper}} shaker to my registry. I have them still, in their original box. I never took them out and never found the need to use them. In all my years of entertaining, no one ever asked me for the salt shaker. However, eventually I did splurge and buy a wonderful <b>pepper</b> <b>mill.</b> That way, my guests could enjoy the food I prepared accented with freshly ground peppercorn. So what is the fuss about salt? Salt has had a long history with mankind. Salt has been the cause of war and been traded for its weight in gold. Salt was and still is used as a preservative for foods which allowed people to survive harsh winters and periods when food was scarce. The significance of salt is woven throughout our history as well a...|$|E

The restaurant was also criticized by the newspaper for being too noisy for conversation, and providing bland hamburgers, salads, and breakfast. By 2008, however, Old Ebbitt Grill had improved. Post food critic Tom Sietsema continued to laud the friendly service. He also praised the Breakfast Club, a deep-fried ham, French toast, and bacon breakfast sandwich; he appreciated small touches such as coat hooks near booths and <b>pepper</b> <b>mills</b> on tables; and found the staff's honesty about menu choices refreshing.|$|R
5000|$|The area {{in which}} Lone Oak now sits was {{originally}} {{the site of a}} community called <b>Pepper's</b> <b>Mill</b> that was formed in 1875. in 1900, The name of the town was changed to [...] "Lone Oak" [...] so the community could obtain a post office.

50|$|Salt, <b>pepper,</b> {{and spice}} <b>mills,</b> {{essentially}} the same as coffee mills, usually do not have a handle, the entire top rotating instead. While this is less convenient, only a few turns are required to grind enough. The ground product falls directly onto the food being seasoned; the mill has no container. A few designs have abrasive surfaces which do not rotate; each squeeze of the handles moves one flat plate past another, then the plates are restored to their original position by a spring. Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone burr grinder, intended to be discarded when empty.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} {{he made a}} living drawing portraits and making reliefs. He also produced jewellery, hunting knives, ceramic works, glass and graphic design {{in the form of}} monograms, town arms and the like. At the end of the 1940s his production also included cutlery in silver and steel for different companies, amongst others the silvery cutlery set Champagne (1947 for Mogensen) and kitchen utensils in steel for Raadvad, including the little shark fin can opener from 1950. His breakthrough as an industrial designer came in 1953-54, where he fashioned the cutlery set Fjord, the first cutlery set that combined stainless steel with handles of teak. Around the same time he designed a saucepan in cast iron for De Forenede Jernstoeberier A/S (United Iron Foundries). The pan was marketed under the name Anker-Line and was awarded the gold medal at the Triennale in Milan in 1954. In the same year, Quistgaard also received The Lunning Prize. 1954 was also the year American businessman Ted Nierenberg visited Europe, on the lookout for talented design which could be launched in the USA. After having seen the cutlery set Fjord at the Danish Museum of Art and Design in Copenhagen, he sought out the designer, and their meeting led to the foundation of the American company Dansk Designs with Quistgaard as chief designer.Already towards the end of 1954, Fjord was introduced in New York, followed the year after by the colourful saucepan range Kobenstyle. Quistgaards designs were a big success from {{the beginning}} in the USA and were quickly followed by a series of tableware and kitchenware designs: cutlery in silver and handcrafted steel; jugs and saucepans in steel, copper and cast iron; crockery in stoneware; glass; trays, bowls, <b>pepper</b> <b>mills</b> and other objects in staved teak and exotic wood sorts, as well as candlesticks in brass, silver and cast iron.Quistgaard was hugely productive and for Danish Designs alone fashioned more than 4000 products.It is a production which spans a large range of materials and utility items, and which is created from a philosophy that utility items for the kitchen and the table should function together harmoniously. To set the table and arrange with Quistgaards designs became {{from the end of the}} 1950s and during the 1960s identical with [...] "modern living" [...] and Scandinavian style.
