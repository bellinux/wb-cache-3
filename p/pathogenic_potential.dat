Accumulating evidence suggests that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are as an important sink and source of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Virulence genes (encoding virulence factors) are good indicators for bacterial <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potentials.</b> To achieve a comprehensive understanding of bacterial <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potentials</b> and antibiotic resistance in WWTPs, bacterial virulence genes and ARGs in 19 WWTPs covering a majority of latitudinal zones of China were surveyed by using GeoChip 4. 2. A total of 1610 genes covering 13 virulence factors and 1903 genes belonging to 11 ARG families were detected respectively. The bacterial virulence genes exhibited significant spatial distribution patterns of a latitudinal biodiversity gradient and a distance-decay relationship across China. Moreover, virulence genes tended to coexist with ARGs as shown by their strongly positive associations. In addition, key environmental factors shaping the overall virulence gene structure were identified. This study profiles the occurrence, composition and distribution of virulence genes and ARGs in current WWTPs in China, and uncovers spatial patterns and important environmental variables shaping their structure, which may {{provide the basis for}} further studies of bacterial virulence factors and antibiotic resistance in WWTPs...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in the desmin gene {{have been}} {{recognized}} {{as a cause of}} desminopathy, a familial or sporadic disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness, often associated with cardiomyopathy or respiratory insufficiency. Distinctive histopathologic features include aberrant intracytoplasmic accumulation of desmin (DES). We present here comparative phenotypic, molecular, and functional characteristics of four novel and three previously reported, but not fully characterized, desmin mutations localized in desmin alpha-helical domain. The results indicate that the c. 638 C>T (p. A 213 V), c. 1178 A>T (p. N 393 I), and to some extent the c. 1078 G>C (p. A 360 P) mutations exhibit <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potentials</b> only if combined with other mutations in desmin or other genes and should therefore be considered conditionally pathogenic.

5000|$|Members of {{the genus}} Chrysosporium have weak <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potential,</b> with human and animal {{infection}} reported {{for only a few}} taxa. Experimental studies have shown inoculation of this fungus on guinea pig skin to produce erythematous scaling lesions which disappear after 3-5 weeks; however, no apparent invasion of the hair shaft occurs. In white mice, after inoculation, granulomas with necrotic centers can be observed, although conidia of the fungus appear to remain intact. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is one of several soil organisms that is occasionally isolated from skin and nails. Isolation of this species from clinical specimens is generally from human onychomycoses, the mycotic superficial invasion of keratinized tissue of the nail plate. In practice, C. keratinophilum is interpreted to be an infrequent contaminant of keratinaceous clinical specimens, such as hair, skin and nails, with no clinical significance. A pathogenic role for C. keratinophilum is unlikely; however, its ability to remain viable for weeks on skin may suggest <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potential.</b> However, a critical component in limiting its <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potential</b> is its inability to grow at 37 °C, which is the human body temperature discouraging the possibility for this fungi to be infectious to humans.The first report of onychomycosis caused by C. keratinophilum [...] in animals was reported by Pin and his colleagues. The seven Bennett's wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus) they observed had swollen, abnormal claws from which Chrysosporium keratinophilum [...] was repeatedly identified in culture, suggesting that the fungus may factor in disease. In another experimental study, C. keratinophilum showed <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potential</b> in the white mouse, remaining viable in the peritoneal cavity for up to two months. It is possible that C. keratinophilum can cause more generalized infections in a weakened mammalian host.|$|E

Although the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie this entity remain unknown, the fact that epilepsy can affect cardiac function is not surprising.

In the present study, 20 epilepsy patients with personal or family history of heart rhythm disturbance/cardiac arrhythmias/sudden death were sequenced using a custom re-sequencing panel.

We screened 54 ARVC probands for mutations in desmocollin- 2 (DSC 2), the only desmocollin isoform expressed in cardiac tissue. Methods Mutation screening was performed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. To evaluate the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>potentials</b> of the DSC 2 mutations detected in patients affected with ARVC, full-length wild-type and mutated cDNAs were cloned in eukaryotic expression vectors to obtain a fusion protein with green fluorescence protein (GFP); constructs were transfected in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and in HL- 1 cells. Results We identified two heterozygous mutations (c. 304 G>A (p. E 102 K) and c. 1034 T>C (p. I 345 T)) in two probands and in four family members. The two mutations p. E 102 K and p.
