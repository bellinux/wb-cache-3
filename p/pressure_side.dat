As an example, sections of the suction and <b>pressure</b> <b>sides</b> of a high temperature, high pressure turbine vane are analyzed to show {{the effects of a}} thermal barrier coating.

25|$|Drawbacks may be {{that the}} high heat of {{compression}} of helium results in the compressor overheating (especially in tropical climates) and that the hot trimix entering the analyzer on the high <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> can affect the reliability of the analysis.. DIY versions of the continuous blend units can be made for as little as $200 (excluding analyzers).|$|E
25|$|A second method called 'continuous blending' is now gaining favor. Oxygen, helium and air are blended on {{the intake}} {{side of a}} compressor. The oxygen and helium are fed into the air stream using flow meters, so as to achieve the rough mix. The low {{pressure}} mixture is analyzed for oxygen content and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly. On the high <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the compressor a regulator is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed (preferably for both helium and oxygen) so that the fine adjustment to the intake gas flows can be made.|$|E

40|$|The {{detailed}} unsteady {{pressure field}} produced on the rotor blades of an axial-flow fan by interaction with downstream struts was investigated. The experimental arrangement {{was similar to}} that found in the fan casings of turbofan aircraft engines. Acoustically significant pressure fluctuations were measured on both thy suction and <b>pressure</b> <b>sides</b> of the rotor blades for several positions of the downstream struts. The level of the observed interaction decreased with increased spacing of the struts behind the rotor. An inviscid flow analysis for the disturbance level is compared with trends of the measured results...|$|R

Pressure on the oar {{often results in}} a highly viscous (more solid) thixotropic mud on the high <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the blade, and low viscosity (very fluid) thixotropic mud on the low <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the oar blade. Flow from the high <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> of the oar blade is non-Newtonian.

30|$|Similar to our {{discussion}} in “Modeling critical condition of the cloud trading market from FNSSA_CRB’s point of view” section, to extract the parameters those affect the bargaining position of the CRPs, three sources of market pressure are recognized as follow: 1) <b>pressure</b> from provider <b>side</b> of the market (i.e., trading opponents), 2) <b>pressure</b> from customer <b>side</b> of the market (i.e., competitors), and 3) pressure from local condition of the CRP.|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model to}} solve compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the flow through stator and rotor blades of a turbine is developed. The flow domains for the stator and rotor blades are coupled by the Chimera method that makes grid generation easy and enhances accuracy because {{the area of}} the grid that have high turning of grid lines or high skewness can be eliminated from the computational domain after the grids are generated. The results of flow computations show various important features of unsteady flows including the acoustic waves interacting with boundary layers, Karman vortex shedding from the trailing edge of the stator blades, pulsating incoming flow to a rotor blade from passing stator blades, and flow separation from both suction and <b>pressure</b> <b>sides</b> of the rotor blades...|$|R
40|$|Experimental <b>side</b> and bade <b>pressure</b> {{distributions}} over {{a series}} of conical boattails without and with jet flow from the base are presented at a Mach number of 1. 91. For the case of no jet flow the methods of characteristics and linearized theory are shown to overpredict the <b>side</b> <b>pressure</b> drag. A semi-empirical theory is presented to predict the effect of boattail angle on base pressure. With the boattail extending to a sharp edge at the nozzle exit, the over-pressure jet is shown to decrease the <b>side</b> <b>pressure</b> drag. Presence of an annular base may eliminate {{the effect of the}} jet on the <b>side</b> <b>pressure</b> drag, but the jet effect on the base pressure drag may greatly increase or decrease the total boattail drag...|$|R

50|$|Membrane gas {{separation}} - Gas {{is forced}} through a semi-permeable membrane by a pressure difference. Some of the constituent gases {{pass through the}} membrane more easily than the others, and the output from the low <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> is enriched with the gases which pass through more easily. Gases which are slower {{to pass through the}} membrane accumulate on the high <b>pressure</b> <b>side</b> and are continuously discharged to retain a steady concentration. The process may be repeated in several stages to increase concentrations.|$|E
5000|$|Teeth are {{constantly}} subject to both {{horizontal and vertical}} occlusal forces. With the center of rotation of the tooth acting as a fulcrum, the surface of bone adjacent to the <b>pressured</b> <b>side</b> of the tooth will undergo resorption and disappear, while the surface of bone adjacent to the tensioned side of the tooth will undergo apposition and increase in volume. [...] When the amount of root remaining in the bone is so short that the entire surface of bone adjacent to the root surface is constantly under compression or tension (with no middle section acting as a stabilizer for the fulcrum), the prognosis for the tooth is deemed highly unfavorable. This is usually the outcome associated with untreated secondary occlusal trauma.|$|R

50|$|One local weather {{phenomenon}} is the Coromuel Wind, {{which is a}} steady breeze that blows consistently during late afternoons in El Centenario.

The wind then blows from the high <b>pressure</b> <b>side,</b> over the El Centenario area, to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>side.</b> Unlike most other parts of the Baja peninsula, there are no high mountains to block this air movement between {{the two sides of the}} peninsula.|$|E

40|$|The current note {{refers to}} the {{comparison}} between a NACA 2510 airfoil with adiabatic walls and the same airfoil with heated patches. Both suction and <b>pressure</b> <b>sides</b> {{were divided into two}} regions covering the leading edge (L. E.) and trailing edge (T. E.). A RANS method sensitivity test has been performed in the preliminary stage while for the extended 3 D cases a DES-SST approach was used. Results indicate that surface temperature distribution influences the aerodynamics of the airfoil, in particular the viscous drag component but also the lift of the airfoil. Moreover, the influence depends not only on the surface temperature but also on the positioning of the heated surfaces, particularly in the case of pressure lift and drag. Further work will be needed to optimize the temperature distribution for airfoil with higher camber...|$|R
50|$|The pump creates {{negative}} pressure {{to draw the}} fuel through the lines. However, the low pressure between the pump and the fuel tank, in combination with heat from the engine and/or hot weather, can cause the fuel to vaporize in the supply line. This results in fuel starvation as the fuel pump, designed to pump liquid, not vapor, is unable to suck more fuel to the engine, causing the engine to stall. This condition is different from vapor lock, where high engine heat on the <b>pressured</b> <b>side</b> of the pump (between the pump and the carburetor) boils the fuel in the lines, also starving the engine of enough fuel to run. Mechanical automotive fuel pumps generally do not generate much more than 10-15 psi, {{which is more than}} enough for most carburetors.|$|R
