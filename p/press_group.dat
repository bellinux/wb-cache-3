25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, cycling was in a poor state in Belgium. Velodromes were closing and national championships on the road or track were no longer organised. The one major Belgian race, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, was in the French-speaking South. As the gloom increased, Odile Defraye became the first Belgian winner of the Tour de France in 1912. He was a 20-year old Fleming and, although he rode for Alcyon, a French team, he symbolized a potential rise for Belgian cycling. Defraye's victory inspired August De Maeght, mayor of Halle and director of the <b>press</b> <b>group</b> Société Belge d'Imprimerie, to publish a Dutch-language sports magazine called Sportwereld.|$|E

Durack (1983) by the High Court of Australia, and Secretary for Justice v. Oriental <b>Press</b> <b>Group</b> Ltd. (1998) by the Court of First Instance of Hong Kong.

25|$|De Valera’s {{preoccupation with}} {{his part in}} history, and his need to explain and justify it, are {{reflected}} in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish <b>Press</b> <b>group,</b> was to rectify {{what he saw as}} the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.|$|E

40|$|Background: Robust {{statistical}} designing, sound statistical analysis, {{and standardized}} presentation {{are important to}} enhance the quality and transparency of biomedical research. This systematic review was conducted to summarize the statistical reporting requirements introduced by biomedical research journals with an impact factor of 10 or above so that researchers are able to give statistical issues′ serious considerations {{not only at the}} stage of data analysis but also at the stage of methodological design. Methods: Detailed statistical instructions for authors were downloaded from the homepage of each of the included journals or obtained from the editors directly via email. Then, we described the types and numbers of statistical guidelines introduced by different <b>press</b> <b>groups.</b> Items of statistical reporting guideline as well as particular requirements were summarized in frequency, which were grouped into design, method of analysis, and presentation, respectively. Finally, updated statistical guidelines and particular requirements for improvement were summed up. Results: Totally, 21 of 23 <b>press</b> <b>groups</b> introduced at least one statistical guideline. More than half of <b>press</b> <b>groups</b> can update their statistical instruction for authors gradually relative to issues of new statistical reporting guidelines. In addition, 16 <b>press</b> <b>groups,</b> covering 44 journals, address particular statistical requirements. The most of the particular requirements focused on the performance of statistical analysis and transparency in statistical reporting, including "address issues relevant to research design, including participant flow diagram, eligibility criteria, and sample size estimation," and "statistical methods and the reasons. " Conclusions: Statistical requirements for authors are becoming increasingly perfected. Statistical requirements for authors remind researchers that they should make sufficient consideration not only in regards to statistical methods during the research design, but also standardized statistical reporting, which would be beneficial in providing stronger evidence and making a greater critical appraisal of evidence more accessible...|$|R
