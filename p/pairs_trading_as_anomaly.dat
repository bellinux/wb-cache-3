40|$|Ours is the fi?rst {{paper to}} {{highlight}} <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> <b>as</b> the main price-correcting {{mechanism by which}} arbitrage can maintain stock-ADR parity. We show that arbitraging stock-ADR pairs extracts small per-trade pro?fits which accumulate to a substantial aggregate return. The observed strong tendency of pricing disequilibria to mean-revert, along with the two-way convertibility between stocks and ADRs, mean that arbitrageurs face minimal risks toward price divergence. They do, however, face uncertainty about the duration of individual trades. The magnitude of this uncertainty relates directly to the profi?t target arbitrageurs set after a long/short position is established. This fact can explain why some disequilibria go unexploited. Overall, our work provides evidence against automatically e?fficient prices, and supports the view that mispricings incentivize arbitrageurs to enforce market efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} is to further {{investigate}} <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy on the U. S. equity markets and the possible explanations for the strategy profits. The main contribution {{of the study}} to the existing literature is to provide a thorough empirical study of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits and to examine the unexplored link between <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profit and short-term return reversals. In addition, this thesis studies <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits in different market conditions and the exposure of the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits to known market risk factors. The data used in the empirical study comprises of daily stock market return data for the S&P 500 equity index constituents from December 1967 to December 2009. The data set is extracted from Center for Research in Security Price (CRSP) database, consisting of observations for 10824 days and 1331 unique S&P 500 constituents. The main findings of the thesis show that the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy yields markedly higher risk adjusted returns compared to the S&P 500 benchmark index, which are comparable in size to the earlier studies on the topic. According to the return analysis, the strategy on average yields small but positive returns for majority of the periods, but the returns are at least to some extent driven by small number of high return periods. I also find that <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits persist over time, contrary to earlier studies, and profits to be dependent on the overall market conditions. Although the returns show some time variation, the returns persist also to this day. The <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits are highly exposed to funding liquidity risk as well as overall equity market volatility, which imply that arbitrageurs are constrained to enforce relative pricing discrepancies. The exposure the overall market conditions might prove trading according to the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy difficult in practice. The main finding and largest contribution to the previous literature is that <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits are independent of short-term reversals and therefore independent of liquidity provision. The profits from <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> are statistically highly significant and are not explained by the relevant factors included in the factor model. I find <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits to have a statistically significant negative correlation with market excess return and Fama/French Small Minus Big factor and positively correlated with medium-term momentum profits.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{usefulness}} of a hedge fund <b>trading</b> strategy known <b>as</b> “pairs <b>trading</b> ” applied to energy futures markets. The profit of a simplified <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy is modeled by using a mean-reverting process of the futures price spread. According to the com-parative statics of the model, the strong mean-reversion and high volatility of the spread give rise to the high expected return from trading.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Previous {{literature}} has documented statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> with stocks yielding positive abnormal returns. This phenomenon violates the weak {{form of the}} efficient market hypothesis and cannot be explained by known risk factors. An emerging field in <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> studies focused on information flow has provided interesting results on the relation of statistical trading and information events, but {{without being able to}} explain the abnormal returns. This thesis aims to elaborate this relation by studying analyst recommendations which {{have been shown to be}} related to both stock price movements and information events, but have not been previously studied in connection to statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading.</b> DATA I study a daily return data of all U. S. utility sector stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges during years 2000 to 2010. Of this sample I form 20 stock pairs every 6 months for statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading.</b> I match the 20 pairs with newly issued analyst recommendations during trading. The full data consists of approximately 150 stocks forming on average 6 602 potential pairs every 6 months, and 3 126 matched analyst recommendations. RESULTS My results support previous findings that statistical <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> yields positive abnormal returns, though smaller in recent years, and that relative analyst recommendations hold valuable information to investors. However, I find that stock prices do not evidence post-recommendations drift in pairs after being issued divergent recommendations. Divergent recommendations are a signal of a statistical stock pair breaking up. The spread may move to the direction recommendations indicate or irrationally to the opposite direction and hence the direction of the spread between a pair cannot be inferred from recommendations. Pairs breaking up causes negative return to <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> and thus the aggregate abnormal positive return to <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> is driven by pairs that are not issued divergent recommendations...|$|R

30|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that a <b>pairs</b> <b>trade</b> {{is essentially a}} mean-reverting strategy. That is traders bet that prices will revert to a long-run mean.
