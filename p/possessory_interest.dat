500|$|The Fourth Amendment proscribes {{unreasonable}} {{seizure of}} any person, person's home (including its curtilage) or personal property without a warrant.

2500|$|They {{filed suit}} in the Southern District, alleging that the maximized media {{exposure}} of their perp walk violated their Fourth Amendment rights {{even though it had}} not been staged as Lauro's had.

[...] In fact, she wrote, [...] "laintiffs have not identified any <b>possessory</b> <b>interest</b> they had in not being videotaped, and this ourt can think of none."

2500|$|Property law governs {{ownership}} and possession. Real property, sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership {{of land and}} things attached to it. Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is {{a right to a}} specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's <b>possessory</b> <b>interest</b> was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.|$|E

As a result, various courts devised three approaches to determine ownership of <b>possessory</b> <b>interests</b> in property.

In Ulster, and in an embryo degree elsewhere, this was what in a varying and irregular way actually had come about. Agrarian customs developed that undoubtedly belong to a backward social system, but they sprang from the necessities of the case. The essence of such customs in Ulster was first, a fair rent to be fixed not by competition, but by valuation, and exclusive of tenant’s improvements; second, the right of the tenant to transfer to somebody else his goodwill, or whatever else we may call his right of occupancy in the holding.|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} the {{concrete}} analysis of Trespass is dictated by current struggles over the conditions of land possession in the conjuncture. Whilst only a Marxist approach is capable of accounting for {{the complexity of the}} totality of Trespass and related law, the principal general theories of law and the State are prevented from doing justice to this task by their common rationalist conception of the abstract/concrete relation and their consequent inability to satisfactorily ground concrete socio-legal analysis. The proper understanding of Marx's method of investigation in Capital, however, can provide the basis for such analysis, through the specification of a concrete-abstract- concrete methodological trajectory which respects the specificity of the particular object of study. The point of departure for the analysis of Trespass is its simplest and most irreducible expression in concrete social practice: The equal right to exclude the world from interference with the possession of land. The concrete particular is analyzed through scientific Abstraction, which further accompanies the movement from simple to ever more complex aspects of the object until the concrete totality of law securing relations of ownership, possession and separation is explained in its complex form and function. Finally the broadest Concrete Totality of Trespass and related law is revealed in the full context of its political and socio-economic determinations in the conjuncture: The fundamental pre-condition of the transformation of Trespass in the 1970 's is the crisis of capital accumulation, as mediated through domestic and industrial crises and the phenomena of squatting and factory occupations which have threatened existing relations of possession and the institutions of exclusive property right. Law is ultimately revealed as a terrain of struggle that has enabled the greater possessors to resolve the legal and socio-economic crisis to their own advantage at the expense of lesser <b>possessory</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tis smallish {{volume in}} an {{expanding}} field shows the craftsman 2 ̆ 7 s touch within its chosen purpose. It follows tie traditional division of Property as originally fashioned by John C.

I had the honor of reviewing {{the first edition of}} Bigelow more years ago than I like to remember [(1920) 29 Yale L.

For the present volume takes the subject much as the older books plotted it out [...] with some few eliminations of topics, such as public rights and the traditional historical introduction to land law [...] and brings it down to date in ways which Gray would have found fitting and proper. Here are the new decisions, the recent and pending Restatements, much of the new law review material. The work is therefore up to the minute, and yet it is a boon to teachers and curriculum fashioners in that it is briefer than other books on what we always called 2 ̆ 2 Property II. 2 ̆ 2 For Personal Property, that conglomeration of leftovers from Sales and Torts, was Property I, and the topics of conveyances, tiles, estates, and future interests came later, with their own appropriate Roman numbers.

5000|$|When {{presented}} {{with oil and}} gas cases, early common law jurists were somewhat reluctant to recognize a corporeal <b>possessory</b> <b>interest</b> in substances they considered to be fugacious or “wild and migratory,” and therefore subject to loss by drainage. Among U.S. states, two different theories of ownership {{of oil and gas}} arose. Some states, such as Texas, have adopted the “ownership-in-place” theory for oil and gas that a landowner owns a corporeal <b>possessory</b> <b>interest</b> (similar to a fee simple) in the substances beneath his land, but his ownership is a determinable fee subject to the rule of capture. [...] Other states, like Oklahoma, have adopted the “exclusive-right-to-take” theory that a landowner does not own the substances that underlie his land, but merely retains the exclusive right to capture the substances, a non-corporeal interest. The difference between the two theories is primarily of import in determining remedies.|$|E

50|$|Mancini {{also turned}} on the defendant's {{authority}} to exclude others from the searched space, a question which took on more importance in later cases. In a case with similar circumstances to Mancusi, the Ninth Circuit decided the case differently due to a negative answer to that question. A sweep of an Oregon produce factory by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents looking for illegal aliens was upheld since those detained not only lacked a <b>possessory</b> <b>interest</b> in the property and worked in a large shared space without any space set aside for their individual use, they could not keep anyone out of the building.|$|E

The Court resolved the issue by holding that in cases where mere possession of the property in question was the offense alleged, defendants need not have to admit to such ownership to challenge the admissibility of such evidence, and that they only had to demonstrate they were legitimately on the premises where the search occurred.|$|E
