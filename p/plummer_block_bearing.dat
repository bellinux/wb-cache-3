40|$|AbstractConstruction {{of low-income}} housing {{projects}} is a replicated process and {{is associated with}} uncertainties that arise from the unavailability of resources. Government agencies and/or contractors have to select a construction system that meets low-income housing projects constraints including project conditions, technical, financial and time constraints. This research presents a framework, using computer simulation, which aids government authorities and contractors in the planning of low-income housing projects. The proposed framework estimates the time and cost required {{for the construction of}} low-income housing using pre-cast hollow core with hollow <b>blocks</b> <b>bearing</b> walls. Five main components constitute the proposed framework: a network builder module, a construction alternative selection module, a simulation module, an optimization module and a reporting module. An optimization module utilizing a genetic algorithm enables the defining of different options and ranges of parameters associated with low-income housing projects that influence the duration and total cost of the pre-cast hollow core with hollow <b>blocks</b> <b>bearing</b> walls method. A computer prototype, named LIHouse_Sim, was developed in MS Visual Basic 6. 0 as proof of concept for the proposed framework. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the use of the developed framework and to illustrate its essential features...|$|R
