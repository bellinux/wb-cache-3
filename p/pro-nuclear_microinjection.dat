Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) regulates the production of reactive oxygen species in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To promote the study of the role of UCP 2 in vascular diseases, a transgenic mouse model expressing human UCP 2 (hUCP 2) in vascular SMCs was established. We constructed a plasmid carrying the 2. 3 kb rabbit smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter and the hUCP 2 gene. We used this plasmid to produce transgenic mice by <b>pro-nuclear</b> <b>microinjection.</b> Six offspring were identi-fied as founder mice that were used to establish a transgenic mouse lineage. The transgenic mice showed a significant increase in hUCP mRNA expression in the aorta. Moreover, hUCP 2 overexpression inhibited the production of superoxide and increased the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). In this study, we established a hUCP 2 transgenic mouse model, which will enable further studies on the role of UCP 2 in vascular dysfunction and remodeling...|$|E

Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp 4) -Bmp receptor 1 A signaling in b cells has recently {{been reported to be}} required for insulin production and secretion. In addition, Bmp 4 blocks the differentiation and promotes the expansion of endocrine progenitor cells. Bmp 4 therefore regulates the maintenance of homeostasis in the pancreas. In this study, we constructed a reporter plasmid carrying 7 -kb enhancer and promoter region of the Bmp 4 gene upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. We used this construct to produce transgenic mice by <b>pro-nuclear</b> <b>microinjection,</b> for subsequent in vivo monitoring of Bmp 4 expression. The bioluminescent signal was detected mainly in the pancreas in three independent lines of transgenic mice. Furthermore, the bioluminescent signal was enhanced in association with the autophagy response to 24 -h fasting. These results suggest that pancreatic expression of Bmp 4 is involved in responding to the physiological environment, including through autophagy. These mouse models represent useful tools for toxicological screening, and for investigating the mechanisms responsible for pancreatic Bmp 4 functions in vivo, with relevance to improving our understanding of pancreatic diseases...|$|E
