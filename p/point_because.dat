To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any <b>point.</b> <b>Because</b> there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E

However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any <b>point</b> <b>because</b> the British had left it undefended.|$|E
5|$|He {{may already}} have been a Doctor of Civil Law by that <b>point,</b> <b>because</b> in the {{following}} year, on 22 November 1350, he is found as such acting as the Regent of Orléans presenting a candidate for licence. Having studied civil law for the highest qualification available, de Coventre moved on to canon law. By 28 March 1351, he possessed a Bachelorate in Decrees (canon law). This was perhaps why on 16 April 1353, he obtained from Pope Innocent VI another grace for himself. Precisely when he obtained his doctorate is unclear, but he was D. U. J. (doctor utriusque juris), Doctor of Both Laws, by 4 September 1359.|$|E

5|$|Callaway {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by UPN's cancellation of Mercy <b>Point</b> <b>because</b> of their strong support of the show. He felt {{the decision was made}} {{in part because of the}} show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, {{and that there}} was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical <b>point,</b> <b>because</b> the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Rameses is {{voiced by}} Sayed Badreya and an {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. Shortly after Drake is knocked out by Rameses, he {{is taken to}} a shipyard where he is tied to a chair. Rameses demands Drake to tell him where Atlantis of the Sands is located. When Drake tells Rameses that he honestly did not know, Rameses walks out and threatens to interrogate Sully. After Drake manages to break free and defeat all of the guards, he climbs onto Rameses' cruise ship. From there he finds a decoy of Sully and realizes that he was never there to begin with. Rameses tells him that he lied - he is after all a pirate. Drake then shoots him, critically wounding him. After Drake makes {{his way into the}} ball room (the ship turned onto its side at this <b>point</b> <b>because</b> it was sinking), Rameses shoots the glass window and causes the rest of the ship to flood, dying in the process. Drake however survives by drifting to shore on a piece of flotsam.|$|E

5|$|That {{was good}} for {{first place in the}} AFC Central and a trip to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1972. The Browns began their playoff run against the Oakland Raiders on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The game started slowly: each team scored only a {{touchdown}} in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra <b>point</b> <b>because</b> of a bad snap. In the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12–7 on a pair of Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14–12. The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 on the clock, Cleveland had a final shot to win the game. Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland drove down to Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds on the clock.|$|E
5|$|Fighting the Veleti {{from the}} {{beginning}} of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany. The alliance was natural at this <b>point,</b> <b>because</b> the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when Wichmann, this time leading forces of the Volinians, was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law Boleslaus, had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his Italian policies. This new status allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent bishopric. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older. The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with Margrave Hodo that followed in the Battle of Cedynia of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of Pomerania. Wolin however remained autonomous and pagan. Kołobrzeg, where a strong gord was built around 985, was probably the actual center of Piast power in Pomerania. Before, a Scandinavian colony in Bardy-Świelubie near Kołobrzeg functioned as the center of this area. The western part of Mieszko controlled Pomerania (the region referred to by Polish historians as Western Pomerania, roughly within the current Polish borders, as opposed to Gdańsk Pomerania or Pomerelia), which became independent of Poland during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005, when Poland was ruled by Mieszko's son Bolesław.|$|E
