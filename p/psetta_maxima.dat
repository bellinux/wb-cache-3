In this paper the correspondence between the known sequences for turbot <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> (formerly Scophthalmus maximus) and those obtained from TV-I cells from juvenile <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> was searched by PCR by analysing the Nramp (Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein) gene, which is known to occur in several tissues of turbot and in a turbot embrional cell line. The obtained results showed an high degree of homology of the amplified fragment of TV-I cell line with the Nramp coding region of Teleosts, and a high degree of probability of the occurrence of mRNA belonging to Psetta maxima; so it could be excluded at a greater extent a contamination by genetic material of other organisms and the occurrence of information coming from Teleosts in TV-I cells was confirmed...|$|E

In {{order to}} {{understand}} the pollution status of mercury in fish and shellfish products from the Jiaozhou Bay and its health mercury risk for the population, a total of 86 samples for 13 kinds of seafood products from Shuangbu, Hongdao, Yinghai and Huangdao in Jiaozhou Bay were collected from April to May 2009. The mercury content in samples was determined by the method of cold atomic absorption method used F 732 -V mercury detector. The result of this experiment showed that the range of mercury contents in the collected fish and shellfish samples were 0. 0044 - 0. 4895 mg/kg. The mercury content in <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> had the highest value in all fish samples collected, and Clinocardium californiense had the highest mercury content in shellfish samples gathered.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of oxygen availability and consumption {{is one of}} the prerequisites for the development of aquatic systems (Brown et al., (1984), since low levels of available oxygen impose limitations on aquatic poikilotherms (Fernandez and Rantin, 1989).

Turbot (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima)</b> is a flatfish that has been cultured for many years in commercial aquaculture. Since this species is usually cultured at high densities, up to 40 Kg m- 2 (Martinez-Tapia and Fernandez Pato, 1991), the effects of lower dissolved oxygen concentrations are an important factor for the optimization of commercial scale aquaculture.

These results suggest that populations that colonize relatively variable habitats, like the Baltic, face problems. Any adaptations to local conditions that may build up during stable periods may quickly become eroded when conditions change and/or when populations become admixed.

30|$|The {{most obvious}} effects were {{shown by the}} histopathological investigations. Here, fish from both sites, up- and {{downstream}} of the SSB, revealed strong reactions or severe health impairments in the examined tissues. The observed effects represent cellular reactions, which {{can be caused by}} a great variety of chemical stressors (e.g., heavy metals, organic compounds, salts) and may consequently result in a strong impairment or even loss of function in the affected organs [21]. The gills of the examined fish revealed hyperplasia and hypertrophy of epithelial cells, epithelial liftings, fusion of secondary lamellae, and sporadically occurring necrosis in cells of the secondary lamellae. The observed reactions may result in a reduction of oxygen uptake into the organism and thus negatively affect its metabolism. Santos et al. [9] observed similar reactions in the gills of juvenile Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus) after a chronic exposure to naphthalene. Barja-Fernández et al. [56] exposed turbot (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima)</b> to BDE- 47 in the lower µg/L range and observed fusions of the secondary lamellae as well as hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the epithelial cells. Shao et al. [57] exposed rainbow trout gill cells (RTgill-W 1) to BDE- 47 and observed a loss of the cell viability in this cell type. In liver, we observed vacuolizations, a depletion of the glycogen content, an increased number of melanomacrophages, a disintegrated structure of hepatocytes, cellular hypertrophy, and irregularly shaped nuclei. These reactions indicate an increased metabolic rate, which in turn can be an indicator of the metabolic degradation of harmful substances like, for example, PBDEs and PAHs. The livers of turbot (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima)</b> showed similar reactions (irregular morphology of hepatocytes, cellular and nuclear hypertrophy) after exposure to BDE- 47 as demonstrated in the work of Barja-Fernández et al. [56]. A comparison of our results with the literature shows that the analyzed substances like PAHs and PBDEs probably contributed to the pathologic alterations in the investigated fish tissues. However, a clear link between the observed effects and the analyzed substances cannot be established, since the chemical analyses focused on substances which mainly represent priority substances. The presented chemical data only give an overview on the general status of pollution in the investigated Argen River section. It can be assumed that, in addition, other unidentified pollutants acted as additional stressors and contributed to the observed effects.|$|E

Feeding regimens were {{twice a day}} (TD), every other day (EOD), and 2 -day intervals (TDI). Fish were kept in seawater (18 ppt) at 5 - 7. 5 ¡C from January 21 to March 23, 2004. Feed conversion rate (FCR) and the protein efficiency ratios (PER) were within the ranges of 1. 12 - 1. 14 and 2. 26 - 2. 29, respectively. While the maximum relative growth rate (RGR), weight gain, and specific growth rate (SGR) were recorded in the TD group, they were lower in the EOD and TDI groups. Both the SGR and RGR increased as feeding frequency increased. The feeding frequency influenced the chemical composition of the fish. Lipid and protein content of the fish increased in the TD group.

On histopathological examination, bacterial invasion was common in all the tissues studied but the most prominent pathological changes were observed in gut, spleen and kidney after 7 day with features of necrosis. The immunohistochemical findings support the widespread localization of the bacteria after the i. p. injection since the P. anguilliseptica was detected in spleen from day 1 post injection, in liver, kidney and gut from day 4, in muscle from day 7 and in brain from day 9.

In addition, triploid fish are sterile and production of triploids in fish species that are marketed after reaching sexual maturity {{may be of}} economic interest. In the present study, the effects of triploidy on the activity of several components of the innate immune system of turbot (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> L) were determined. Triploid turbot had bigger cells (erythrocytes and neutrophils) {{but the number of}} blood erythrocytes, leucocytes and thrombocytes was lower than in diploid fish. The differential cell count was similar in both types of fish. The respiratory burst and the phagocytic activities were higher in neutrophils of triploid turbot. However, because the number of neutrophils was higher in diploids, the total respiratory burst activity and the phagocytosis per microliter of blood was similar in both types of fish. No differences were found in serum complement, lysozyme or bactericidal activities. The results indicate that the activities of the humoral components of the innate immune system tested are similar in diploid and triploid fish and that the lower leucocyte number found in triploids is compensated for by higher cell activity.

40|$|International audienceIn mammals, {{growth hormone}} (GH) {{is under a}} dual {{hypothalamic}} control exerted by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (SRIH). We investigated GH release in a pleuronectiform teleost, the turbot (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima),</b> using a serum-free primary culture of dispersed pituitary cells. Cells released GH for up to 12 days in culture, indicating that turbot somatotropes do not require releasing hormone for their regulation. SRIH dose-dependently inhibited GH release up to a maximal inhibitory effect of 95 %. None of the potential stimulators tested induced any change in basal GH release. Also, neither forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, nor phorbol ester (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, were able to modify GH release, suggesting that spontaneous basal release already represents the maximal secretory capacity of turbot somatotropes. In contrast, forskolin and TPA were able to increase GH release {{in the presence of}} SRIH. In this condition (coincubation with SRIH), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) stimulated GH release, whereas none of the other neuropeptides tested (GHRHs; sea bream or salmon or chicken II GnRHs; TRH; CRH) had any significant effect. These data indicate that inhibitory control by SRIH may be the basic control of GH production in teleosts and lower vertebrates, while PACAP may represent the ancestral growth hormone-releasing factor in teleosts, a role taken over in higher vertebrates by GHRH...|$|E
40|$|Suppression {{subtractive}} hybridization {{was used}} to investigate the response of turbot, <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> (L.), to Vibrio harveyi, by using a cDNA library constructed from artificially infected turbot kidney and spleen mRNA. Forty-nine expressed sequence tags were obtained. Several immune system genes were identified, including a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ia gene and a heat shock protein 70 gene. Some signalling molecules were also present in the cDNA libraries, including src-family tyrosine kinase SCK, sgk- 1 serine-threonine protein kinase and amyloid precursor-like protein 2. The full length of MHC class Ia cDNA was cloned from turbot cDNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of turbot MHC class Ia has been submitted to GenBank with accession number EF 032639. The turbot MHC class Ia cDNA has an open reading frame encoding 354 amino acids, and the deduced amino acid sequence of turbot MHC class Ia has 68 %, 54 %, 51 %, 52 %, 57 %, 33 %, 29 % and 29 % identities to those of olive flounder, medaka, rainbow trout, Atlantic cod, tiger puffer, chicken, mouse and human, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed for the MHC class Ia gene, and {{it was revealed that}} the expression level of the MHC class Ia gene in V. harveyi-challenged turbot increased to fourfold that of the controls...|$|E
40|$|The genomes of {{male and}} female turbot, <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> (Linnaeus, 1758), were {{screened}} for sex-specific sequences by comparative random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assays performed on pooled samples. As turbot females grow much faster than males, there is an increasing interest in differentiating between the sexes, and such markers would enable the sexing of individuals even at early stages of development. Four sex-associated DNA markers, with molecular sexing efficiencies ranging from 77 to 90 %, were identified and further characterized. Two markers were identified from pooled female samples, one from pooled male samples (both sets collected from the wild), whereas a fourth marker was found in the female pool of farm-bred siblings. Parallel application of the three markers isolated from wild-caught individuals yielded a combined molecular sexing efficiency of 90 % in males and 83. 3 % in females. While the three markers isolated from the wild should be useful to predict the sex in natural turbot populations, the fourth marker showed sex-association limited only to the family where it was isolated from. Nonetheless, it can be used for molecular sexing of brooders originating from the target family and potentially their offspring as well. The application of such molecular sex markers with limited scope is a potential strategy in aquaculture for those species for which no universal sex marker is available...|$|E
40|$|Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious fish viral {{diseases}} for cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), although VHS virus (VHSV) seems to be ubiquitous among marine fishes. In the present study, VHSV isolation was performed with free-living and cultured turbot (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima)</b> in the Trabzon coastal area of the Black Sea to evaluate participation of VHSV in mass mortalities of seed-produced turbot larvae. VHSV was detected in 14 of 66 free-living spawners (positive ratio, 21. 2 %), 1 of 65 free-living immature fish (1. 5 %) and 7 of 40 cultured brood stock (17. 5 %), respectively. Based on a partial glycoprotein gene nucleotide sequence, Turkish VHSV isolates were classified into the class I-e of genotype I and were the most closely related to the GE- 1. 2 isolate (> 98 % identity), which was found > 20 years ago in Georgia. Thus, it was revealed that Turkish VHSV isolates were not introduced from European countries, it could be an indigenous type of VHSV distributing in the Black Sea environment. In pathogenicity tests, the Turkish isolates did not induce mortality in turbot larvae and rainbow trout fingerlings. Mass mortalities at a rate of approximately 90 % occurred in turbot larvae produced by experimental seeding, although VHSV was not detected in any dead fish. Thus, it was concluded that mass mortality in the seed-produced turbot larvae was not caused by VHSV infection...|$|E
40|$|Preventing disease {{outbreaks}} in cultured turbot <b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> L. caused by Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida (ASS) requires {{a better understanding}} of how this pathogen colonizes its host. Distribution of 1 virulent and 2 avirulent ASS strains in turbot tissues was investigated during early and late stages of infection following an immersion challenge. To track bacteria within the turbot, the ASS strains were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Both virulent and avirulent strains colonized the epidermal mucus, gills, and intestine within the first 12 h post challenge, suggesting that these sites may serve as points of entry into turbot. Although the avirulent strains colonized these initial sites in the turbot tissues, they were rarely found in the internal organs and were cleared from the host 4 d post challenge. In contrast, the virulent ASS strain was found in the liver and kidney as early as 12 h post challenge and was found in the muscle tissue at very late stages of infection. The virulent strain persisted in all tested host tissues until death occurred 7 d post challenge, suggesting that ASS must colonize and survive within the turbot tissues for an infection to result in death of the fish. Comparisons of the distribution profiles of both virulent and avirulent strains during early and late stages of an infection in turbot has provided important information on the route and persistence of an ASS infection in this host...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are {{characterized}} by high lipophilicity and persistence in the environment and will therefore bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain. PCBs were determined in muscle tissue of four fish species: goby (Neogobius melanostomus), horse mackerel (Trachurus Mediterraneus ponticus), shad (Alosa pontica pontica) and turbot (<b>Psetta</b> <b>maxima</b> maeotica). Samples were collected from Bulgarian Black Sea coast during 2007 – 2011. The PCBs were analyzed {{in order to examine}} the time trends of PCB concentrations in fish from Black Sea. The six individual PCBs congeners were determined by capillary gas chromatography system with mass spectrometry detection. PCBs were found in all fish species at concentrations ranging between 2. 32 ng/g ww (wet weight) and 32. 87 ng/g ww in goby and shad, respectively. PCB profiles {{have been found to be}} similar in all the fish species tested. The most abundant PCB congeners in fish species were hexa- and heptachlorinated PCBs 138, 153 and 180. PCB 153 was the dominant congener in all fish studied and were found in the range from 0. 95 ng/g ww (horse mackerel 2011) to 11. 67 ng/g ww (shad 2010). The sum of six indicator PCBs in all fish species did not exceed the European maximum limit of 75 ng/g ww. The levels of PCBs in fish from Bulgarian Black Sea coast were found lower than in fish species from other seas – the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E
