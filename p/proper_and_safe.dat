60|$|DEAR MR. GATTS,--It {{is indeed}} a high {{compliment}} which you offer me in naming an association after me and in proposing the setting apart of a Mark Twain day at the great St. Louis fair, but such compliments are not proper for the living; they are <b>proper</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> for the dead only. I value the impulse which moves you to tender me these honors. I value it as highly as any one can, and am grateful for it, but I should stand {{in a sort of}} terror of the honors themselves. So long as we remain alive we are not safe from doing things which, however righteously and honorably intended, can wreck our repute and extinguish our friendships.|$|E

To be faced with a pneumothorax following an intubation could be surprising for a non-suspecting anaesthesiologist and it can have important implications especially in neurosurgical cases where a tight control of intracranial pressure is warranted.

50|$|As {{the slope}} angles increase, the {{climbing}} ski-tourer will make switchbacks, using kick turns to change direction, typically {{resulting in a}} line that climbs at a moderate angle of 20-30 degrees. Skin tracks {{can be seen as}} zig-zags heading up a snowy mountain. Ski-tourers try to maintain the up-tracks in avalanche-safe zones as they head up the mountain, staying out from under dangerous cornices or slide paths. Setting a <b>proper</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> skin track requires a great deal of skill and avalanche knowledge as the tourer spends most of their time climbing. Traveling quickly up potential avalanche terrain is important for safety as well. Thus physical fitness is a crucial element of safe mountain travel.|$|E
40|$|The main magnet of the {{upcoming}} superconducting cyclotron at this Centre consists of two superconducting coils. Two current-controlled power supplies are used to energize the magnet coils.

Since it is not practicable to operate these power supplies from their local panels, supervisory software with an easy-to-use Man-Machine Interface (MMI) has been developed so that the power supplies may be operated and monitored from a remotely located control console.

40|$|The {{potential}} of cell therapy is promising in nerve regeneration, but {{is limited by}} ethical considerations about the <b>proper</b> <b>and</b> technically <b>safe</b> source of stem cells. We report the successful differentiation of human EnSCs (endometrial stem cells) as {{a rich source of}} renewable <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> progenitors into high-efficiency cholinergic neurons. The extracellular signals of NGF (nerve growth factor) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) could induce cholinergic neuron differentiation. ChAT (choline acetyltransferase), MAP 2 (microtubule associated protein 2) and NF-l (neurofilament L) increased after administration of bFGF and NGF to the EnSC cultures. trkC and FGFR 2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2), which belong to the NGF and bFGF receptors respectively, were determined in populations of EnSCs. NGF, bFGF and their combination differentially influenced human EnSCs high efficiency differentiation. By inducing cholinergic neurons from EnSCs in a chemically defined medium, we could produce human neural cells without resorting to primary culture of neurons. This in vitro method provides an unlimited source of human neural cells and facilitates clinical applications of EnSCs for neurological diseases.

Occupational therapy may be necessary following an injury or illness in order to regain skills and to receive support during any physical or cognitive changes. [...] Occupational therapy will focus on activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, grooming. Occupational therapy also assists with instrumental activities of daily living which include home and financial management, rest and sleep, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation. Occupational therapists work to allow the person to safely and comfortably reintegrate into society by practicing public dining, transferring to different surfaces (chairs, beds, couches etc), and will assess the need for any home modifications or safety equipment to ensure a <b>proper</b> <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> transition. When a cognitive and/or perceptual deficit is presented, therapists will work with the person by teaching strategies to maximize memory, sequencing and attention span length.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, an {{investigation}} of cholera transmission was being conducted in Deptford. Around 90 people died {{within a few days}} in that town, where the water was known to be clean, and there had been no previous outbreaks of cholera. Snow was informed that the water had recently turned impure. Residents were forced to let the water run for a while before using it, in order to let the sudsy, sewer-like water run until it was clear. Snow, finding that the water the residents were using was not different from the usual water from their pump, determined that the outbreak must be caused by a leak in the pipes that allowed surrounding sewage and its contaminants to seep in to the water supply.

40|$|SummaryHow the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) folding machinery coordinates general and specialized chaperones during protein translation and folding remains an important unanswered question. Here, we show two structural domains in MESD, a specialized chaperone for LRP 5 / 6, carry out dual functions. The chaperone domain forms a complex with the immature receptor, maintaining the β-propeller (BP) domain in an interaction competent state for epidermal growth factor-repeat binding. This promotes proper folding of the BP domain, causing a binding switch from the chaperone domain to the escort domain. The escort complex ensures LRP 5 / 6 safe-trafficking from the ER to the Golgi by preventing premature ligand-binding. Inside the Golgi, the BP domain may contain a histidine switch, regulating MESD dissociation and retrieval. Together, we generate a plausible cell biology {{picture of the}} MESD/LRP 5 / 6 pathway, suggesting {{that it is the}} specialized chaperones, MESD, that serves as the folding template to drive <b>proper</b> folding <b>and</b> <b>safe</b> trafficking of large multidomain proteins LRP 5 / 6...|$|R
50|$|Williams {{immediately}} introduced wide {{changes in}} the mining methods at Kimberley.

Walking about was exceedingly dangerous and unpleasant, and there was a never-ending worry that the workings might collapse, with serious consequences for the lives of the workers and the financial success of the operation.

Instead of haphazardly hoisting the ore from a large number of points, he arranged the mine so that all the ground could be concentrated at one point, and hoisted from one well-equipped level by a large winder.

We also collected demographic, socioeconomic, environmental and personal hygiene information using a pre-tested questionnaire. Sixty-nine of the children was positive for microsporidia: 72. 5 % and 27. 5 % were low (1 +) and moderate (2 +) excretions of microsporidia spores, respectively.
