50|$|Reheat {{cracking}} {{is a type}} of cracking {{that occurs}} in HSLA steels, particularly chromium, molybdenum and vanadium steels, during <b>postheating.</b> The phenomenon has also been observed in austenitic stainless steels. It is caused by the poor creep ductility of the heat affected zone. Any existing defects or notches aggravate crack formation. Things that help prevent reheat cracking include heat treating first with a low temperature soak and then with a rapid heating to high temperatures, grinding or peening the weld toes, and using a two layer welding technique to refine the HAZ grain structure.|$|E

There are two methods for obtaining proper joint properties. The first method is to decrease the peak temperature to below A 1, and the other method to decrease the cooling rate to less than the lower critical cooling rate.

50|$|Arc strike {{cracking}} {{occurs when}} the arc is struck but the spot is not welded. This occurs because the spot is heated above the material's upper critical temperature and then essentially quenched. This forms martensite, which is brittle and may lead to higher chances of micro-cracks. Usually the arc is struck in the weld groove so this type of crack does not occur, but if the arc is struck outside of the weld groove then it must be welded over to prevent the cracking. If {{this is not an}} option then the arc spot can be <b>postheated,</b> that is, the area is heated with an oxy-acetylene torch, and then allowed to cool slowly.|$|R

Butt welds were prepared by friction welding 12. 7 -mm-diam U- 700 bars and TD-Ni bars. Specimens for elevated temperature tensile and stress rupture testing were machined after a postweld heat treatment. Friction welding of U- 700 shows great potential because the welds {{were found to be}} as strong as the parent metal in stress rupture and tensile tests at 760 and 980 C. In addition, the weld line was not detectable by metallographic examination after <b>postheating.</b> Friction welds in TD-Ni or between U- 700 and TD-Ni were extremely weak at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of stainless ultra-high strength steels with ferritic-martensitic and martensitic microstructure into sheet metal manufacturing depends on proper welding processes for these steel grades. The chromium and carbon content {{as well as}} the lack of appropriate process information for thermal joining of these steel grades in press hardened condition with UTS of up to 2. 000 MPa at 15 % fracture strain classifies the weldability of these materials as limited. Efficient heat control and minimum heat input enable the welding of ferritic-martensitic and martensitic stainless steels by laser beam. This paper presents the results of strength evaluations of laser welded joints for the steel grades 1. 4003, 1. 4021, and 1. 4034 in similar and dissimilar combinations with already established steels.

An experimental study on the identification and quantification of cracking in <b>postheated</b> concrete was conducted to provide {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms of damages to concrete after exposure to high temperatures. In addition to the quantification of the residual compressive and tensile strengths of concrete after high temperature exposure, both macroscale and microscopic cracks were observed and measured. The crack patterns in different concretes, including concrete made with different water to binder (w/b) ratios and PFA dosages, were classified. Also examined was the cracking in the corresponding hardened cement pastes (hcp's) prepared without adding aggregates. The relation of cracking with deterioration of the durability properties of concrete, with respect to the chloride diffusion test results, was discussed. Crack density, a quantitative term, which had been introduced to study the microcrack properties in concrete, was adopted for measuring the severity of cracking.

40|$|Material {{variations}} {{and process}} modifications {{have been studied}} to determine their effects on the acceptable range of resistance spot welding conditions for galvanized steel sheet. The material variations studied include zinc coating integrity, structure, composition, thickness, roughness, oil, and the amount and type of Fe-Zn intermetallics. Process modifications studied include upsloping and downsloping of the weld current, preheat current, <b>postheat</b> current, electrode tip geometry, and applied force. It was found that hot-dipped galvanized materials with coatings which have a very thin Fe-Zn alloy layer have {{a wider range of}} acceptable welding conditions than the commercial galvannealed products, which have a fully alloyed Fe-Zn coating. The decreased lobe width of the galvannealed material is due to the discontinuous Fe-Zn coating structure and morphology. Small variations in the thickness of the coatings studied have no significant effect on the welding current range. Surface roughness of the coating has no effect on lobe width. Ups loping and downs loping of the weld current increase the welding range of hot-dipped products when using truncated cone electrodes, whereas sloped current has no advantage for galvannealed or uncoated materials.

40|$|In {{response}} to unfavourable environmental conditions, {{a number of}} bacterial species are shown to enter a viable but nonculturable (VNC) state. This phenomenon {{has led to the}} recognition of the inherent limitations of the standard microbiological cultural method and has resulted in the development of novel techniques to determine microbial viability. In this study, emphasis was placed on the analysis of viability by molecular amplification of the human and animal enteric bacterium, Campylobacter jejuni, which {{has been one of the}} paradigm organisms for the study of the VNC response. This gastrointestinal organism is of particular interest due to its high incidence in New Zealand and its ability to cause diarrhoeal infections in persons who consume contaminated poultry or untreated water. Due to the medical significance of the pathogen, it is essential to establish whether the VNC state is indeed living and, as such, may have a role in the contamination or infection cycle. In this thesis, the relationship between the detection of mRNA and cellular viability in C. jejuni was investigated in cultures aerobically incubated below the bacterium's optimum growth temperature. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) methods were developed for detecting mRNA from the lpxA, dnaJ, hupB, and ciaB genes and rRNA from the 23 S rDNA gene. Total RNA from C. jejuni was isolated and, following DNase treatment, the RNA was amplified by both PCR and RT-PCR with primers specific for each gene. The levels of expression differed markedly with respect to prolonged incubation time, but the results indicated that coccoid cell forms of Campylobacter retain structural integrity and a degree of protein synthesis for up to two weeks under the experimental conditions of this study. This research demonstrated that either the IpxA or dnaJ genes may provide suitable targets for development of a specific method for detection of viable C. jejuni based on RT -PCR amplification. The usefulness of the IpxA mRNA species as a viability determinant was validated in an artificially killed C. jejuni culture. Following a twenty minute heat treatment at 65 °C, the IpxA-specific amplification product could be detected in the culture for 96 h <b>postheating.</b> In contrast, aerobic plate counts (once an indication of viability) demonstrated loss of culturability within five minutes of heat-shock induction. These results further demonstrate that nonculturability and non-viability are not synonymous. Thus, this study supports the usefulness of RT-PCR amplification of mRNA as a sensitive method for specific detection of viable bacteria and indicates this method may prove beneficial in the detection of C. jejuni in clinical and environmental samples...|$|E
40|$|Objective. Our {{goal was}} to test the {{hypothesis}} of a significant positive correlation between skin water and heat-induced hyperemic blood flow. Background. Skin water is important to skin physiology and is affected by multiple clinical conditions. We reasoned that localized heat-induced-vasodilation increases capillary filtration causing increased skin water. Methods. Skin water was assessed by stratum corneum (SC) capacitance and tissue dielectric constant measurements (TDC) on the forearm of 30 healthy subjects before and after localized skin heating to 40 degrees celsius for 12 minutes. Skin water 73 loss was determined by transepidermal-water-loss (TEWL). Hyperemia was assessed with laser-Doppler methods. Results. Immediate post-heat peak blood flow increased from 2. 6 ± 1. 4 to 25. 1 ± 8. 5 units and a significant increase (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) in all skin water parameters. Male pre-and-post heating TDC values were significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) than female values. <b>Postheat</b> skin water parameters declined but remained above baseline (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) for at least 15 minutes. Post-heating SC and TEWL were positively correlated but the blood flow hyperemia was uncorrelated with any skin water parameter. Conclusion. Although all skin water parameters increased, there was no demonstrable relationship to the hyperemia. We thus reject our initial hypothesis and conclude that processes associated with altering skin water parameters are not importantly dependent on heat-induced vasodilation in healthy young adults. However, the role of vascular components in this process in aged persons and persons with compromised circulations should not be ruled out. These possibilities represent areas needing further investigation that will be aided by using the present data for reference comparisons. Grants. N/...|$|R
40|$|Contamination {{routes of}} Listeria monocytogenes were {{examined}} in a chilled food processing plant that produced ready-to-eat and ready-to-reheat meals during an 8 -year period by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. A total of 319 L. monocytogenes isolates were recovered from raw materials (n= 18), the environment (n= 77), equipment (n= 193), and products (n= 31), and 18 different AFLP types were identified, five of which were repeatedly found to be persistent types. The three compartments (I to III) of the plant showed markedly different contamination statuses. Compartment I, which produced cooked meals, was heavily contaminated with three persistent AFLP types. AFLP type A 1 dominated, and it comprised 93 % of the isolates of the compartment. Compartment II, which produced uncooked chilled food, was contaminated with four persistent and five nonpersistent AFLP types. The equipment of compartment III, which produced cooked ready-to-reheat meals, was free of contamination. In compartments that produced cooked meals, the cleaning routines, product types, and lack of compartmentalization seemed to predispose production lines to persistent contamination. The most contaminated lines harbored L. monocytogenes in coolers, conveyors, and packing machines. Good compartmentalization limited the flow of L. monocytogenes into the <b>postheat</b> -treatment area and prevented the undesired movement of equipment and personnel, thus protecting the production lines from contamination. In compartment II, grated cheese was shown to cause product contamination. Therefore, special attention should be paid to continuous quality control of raw ingredients when uncooked ready-to-eat foods are produced. In compartment II, reconstruction of the production line resulted in reduced prevalence rates of L. monocytogenes and elimination of two persistent AFLP types.

All four pretreatments led to comparable levels of thermotolerance and also induced resistance to arsenite-, ethanol-, and diamide-induced toxicity (clonogenic ability). Stress-induced expression of the major heat shock proteins (hsp 27, hsc 70 ((p 73)), hsp 70 ((p 72)), and hsp 90) was generally highest in H-TT cells and lowest in A-TT cells. Interestingly, the four types of TT cells showed distinct differences in certain aspects of resistance against thermal protein damage. Thermal protein denaturation and aggregation determined in isolated cellular membrane fractions {{was found to be}} attenuated when they were isolated from H-TT and A-TT cells but not when isolated from E-TT and D-TT cells. The heat resistance in the proteins of the membrane fraction corresponded with elevated levels of hsp 70 (p 72) associated with the isolated membrane fractions. In the nuclear fraction, only marginal (not significant) attenuation of the formation of protein aggregates (as determined by TX- 100 (in) solubility) was observed. However, the <b>postheat</b> recovery from heat-induced protein aggregation in the nucleus was faster in H-TT, E-TT, and D-TT cells, but not in A-TT cells. Despite the fact that elevated levels of hsp 27, hsp 70 ((p 73)), and hsp 70 ((p 72)) were found in the TX- 100 insoluble nuclear fraction derived from all TT cells, no correlation was found with the degree of resistance in terms of the accelerated recovery from nuclear protein aggregation. The only correlation between accelerated recovery from nuclear protein aggregates was that with total cellular levels of hsp 27. The data indicate that heat-induced loss of clonogenic ability may be a multitarget rather than a single target event. A threshold of damage may exist in cells after exposure to heat; multiple sets of proteins in (different compartments of) the cell need to be damaged before this threshold is exceeded and the cell dies. As a consequence, stabilization of only one of these sets of proteins is already sufficient to render cells thermotolerant at the clonogenic level. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
