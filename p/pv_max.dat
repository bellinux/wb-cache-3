40|$|Background Portal {{hypertension}} is a {{major risk}} factor for hepatic failure or bleeding in patients who have undergone hepatectomy, but it cannot be measured indirectly. We attempted to evaluate the intraoperative ultrasonography parameters that correlate with portal pressure (PP) in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Methods We examined 30 patients in whom PP was directly measured during surgery. The background liver conditions included chronic viral liver disease in seven patients, chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis in four patients, fatty liver in one patient, hepatolithiasis in one patient, obstructive jaundice in one patient, and a normal liver in 16 patients. A multivariate logistic analysis and linear regression analysis were conducted to develop a predictive formula for PP. Results The mean PP was 10. 4 ± 4. 1 mm Hg. The PP tended to be increased in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. A univariate analysis identified the association of the six following parameters with PP: the platelet count and the maximum (max), minimum (min), endo-diastolic, peak-systolic, and mean velocity in the portal vein (PV) flow. Using multiple linear regression analysis, the predictive formula using the <b>PV</b> <b>max</b> and min was as follows: Y (estimated PP) = 18. 235 − 0. 120 × (<b>PV</b> <b>max.</b> [m/s]) − 0. 364 × (PV min). The calculated PP (10. 44 ± 2. 61 mm Hg) was nearly {{the same as the}} actual PP (10. 43 ± 4. 07 mm Hg). However, there was no significant relationship between the calculated PP and the intraoperative blood loss and post hepatectomy morbidity. Conclusions This formula, which uses ultrasonographic Doppler flow parameters, appears to be useful for predicting PP...|$|E

40|$|Legumes play an {{important}} role as food and forage crops in international agriculture especially in developing countries. Legumes have a unique biological process called nitrogen fixation (NF) by which they convert atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. Although legume genomes have undergone polyploidization, duplication and divergence, NF-related genes, because of their essential functional role for legumes, might have remained conserved. To understand the relationship of divergence and evolutionary processes in legumes, this study analyzes orthologs and paralogs for selected 20 NF-related genes by using comparative genomic approaches in six legumes i. e. Medicago truncatula (Mt), Cicer arietinum, Lotus japonicus, Cajanus cajan (Cc), Phaseolus vulgaris (<b>Pv)</b> and Glycine <b>max</b> (Gm). Subsequently, sequence distances, numbers of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) between orthologs and paralogs were calculated and compared across legumes. These analyses suggest the closest relationship between Gm and Cc and the farthest distance between Mt and Pv in 6 legumes. Ks proportional plots clearly showed ancient genome duplication in all legumes, whole genome duplication event in Gm and also speciation pattern in different legumes. This study also reported some interesting observations e. g. no peak at Ks 0. 4 in Gm-Gm, location of two independent genes next to each other in Mt and low Ks values for outparalogs for three genes as compared to other 12 genes. In summary, this study underlines the importance of NF-related genes and provides important insights in genome organization and evolutionary aspects of six legume species analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: It is {{not well}} known how local fatigue can impair the {{contractile}} properties of skeletal muscle, so {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the Tensiomyographic (TMG) characteristics of Rectus Femoris (RF) after a single bout of intense exercise. Approach: Twelve healthy male volunteers (mean±SEM; age, 24. 16 ± 0. 62 years, height 172. 02 ± 1. 21 cm, body mass 71. 84 ± 2. 19 kg, BMI 24. 42 ± 0. 70 kg m -&# 61485;&# 61489;) were recruited. Results: In session 1, a graded exercise test on cycle ergometer was performed in order to determine subjects maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) and power at this key point (<b>pV</b> O 2 <b>max).</b> In a second testing session, TMG rest values were assessed and then all subjects carried out 2 min of cycling at pVO 2 max after which TMG analysis was applied again. The results showed subjects VO 2 max values of 53. 44 ± 2. 67 ml kg - 1 min - 1 reaching a mean pVO 2 max of 270. 83 ± 8. 61 W. Maximal radial displacement (Dm) and time from the onset of electrical stimulus to 10 % of Dm (Td) were significantly lower at post-test (from 7. 577. 57 ± 0. 92 - 4. 37 ± 0. 67 mm; p = 0. 01, for Dm and from 25. 25 ± 0. 57 - 22. 44 ± 0. 89 ms; p&# 8804; 0. 05, for Td). Conclusion/Recommendations: It can be concluded that a brief and intense exercise consisting in 2 min of cycling at PVO 2 max provokes a reduction in contractile properties of RF considering TMG parameters such as Dm and Td. More studies are needed to clarify the role of muscle fatigue on temporal TMG parameters...|$|R
