The method is based on Fe(OH) co-precipitation of actinides and uses TEVA® and UTEVA® extraction chromatography resins in a simplified way for the final U and Pu purification.

The sample under investigation was a low-burn-up (< 5 GWd/tHM), depleted uranium dioxide (DUO 2) sample (~ 13 mg) irradiated in a fast neutron spectrum in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The {{objective of the}} study was to quantify the fission product decontamination factor for PUREX process steps while separating and purifying plutonium. Aliquots of the dissolved neutron-irradiated DUO 2 sample containing FPs and near weapons-grade plutonium (~ 89 % 239 Pu), underwent three modified PUREX decontamination cycles with products (organic and aqueous solutions) from each process step being analyzed via high-resolution gamma spectroscopy. The purification cycle consisted of tri-n-butyl-phosphate (TBP) and kerosene contacted with the feed solution aliquot to extract actinides (plutonium and uranium primarily) from feed to organic phase and further actinide (plutonium only) back-extraction using ferrous sulfamate.

Actinides were subsequently selectively co-stripped away from the lanthanides using a sulphonated and, therefore, hydrophilic bis-triazinyl pyridine (BTP) complexant in conjunction with acetohydroxamic acid (AHA). <b>Plutonium</b> and americium <b>recoveries</b> were high with decontamination factors across the strip contactors of ~ 14, 000 and ~ 390 respectively.

Another method investigated and partially developed as joint collaborative efforts during this time period was direct immobilization of <b>plutonium</b> with no <b>recovery</b> of <b>plutonium.</b> This method melts the untreated recovered sludges by microwave ultrahigh frequency (UHF) heating with glass formers. After cooling, melter-crucibles of vitrified sludge are stored on site in underground cavities for eventual disposal in a geologic repository.

40|$|For {{the past}} few years, the Department of Energy has favored the direct {{disposal}} of low plutonium content residue materials from Rocky Flats rather than engage in expensive and time consuming <b>plutonium</b> <b>recovery</b> operations. One impediment to direct disposal has been the wattage limit imposed by the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant on hydrogenous materials such as combustibles and sludges. The issue of concern is the radiolytic generation and accumulation of hydrogen and other explosive gases in waste containers. The wattage limits that existed through 1996 restricted the amount of plutonium bearing hydrogenous materials that could be packaged in a WIPP bound waste drum to {{only a fraction of}} the capacity of a drum. Typically, only about one kilogram of combustible residue could be packaged in a waste drum before the wattage limit was exceeded resulting in an excessively large number of drums to be procured, stored, shipped, and interred. The Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site has initiated the use of filtered plastic bags (called bag-out bags) used to remove transuranic waste materials from glove box lines. The bags contain small, disk like HEPA filters which are effective in containing radioactively contaminated particulate material but allow for the diffusion of hydrogen gas. Used in conjunction with filtered 55 gallon drums, filtered bag-out bags were pursued as a means to increase the allowable wattage limits for selected residue materials. In February 1997, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the use of filtered bag-out bags for transuranic waste materials destined for WIPP. The concomitant increase in wattage limits now allows for approximately four times the payload per waste drum for wattage limited materials...|$|E

40|$|The {{disposition}} of plutonium from decommissioned nuclear weapons, by incorporation into commercial UO{sub 2 }-based nuclear reactor fuel, is a viable means to reduce the potential for theft of excess plutonium. This fuel, {{which would be a}} combination of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide, is referred to as a mixed oxide (MOX). Following power generation in commercial reactors with this fuel, the remaining plutonium would become mixed with highly radioactive fission products in a spent fuel assembly. The radioactivity, complex chemical composition, and large size of this spent fuel assembly, would make theft difficult with elaborate chemical processing required for <b>plutonium</b> <b>recovery.</b> In fabricating the MOX fuel, it is important to maintain current commercial fuel purity specifications. While impurities from the weapons plutonium {{may or may not have}} a detrimental affect on the fuel fabrication or fuel/cladding performance, certifying the effect as insignificant could be more costly than purification. Two primary concerns have been raised with regard to the gallium impurity: (1) gallium vaporization during fuel sintering may adversely affect the MOX fuel fabrication process, and (2) gallium vaporization during reactor operation may adversely affect the fuel cladding performance. Consequently, processes for the separation of plutonium from gallium are currently being developed and/or designed. In particular, two separation processes are being considered: (1) a developmental, potentially lower cost and lower waste, thermal vaporization process following PuO{sub 2 } powder preparation, and (2) an off-the-shelf, potentially higher cost and higher waste, aqueous-based ion exchange (IX) process.

(2) {sup 241 }Am-contaminated cement waste from <b>plutonium</b> <b>recovery</b> processes (nitric and hydrochloric acid recovery) are estimated to exceed thermal limits by {approximately} 3 X. (3) {sup 239 }Pu-contaminated combustible waste, mainly organic waste materials contaminated with {sup 239 }Pu and {sup 241 }Am, is estimated to exceed thermal load requirements by a factor of {approximately} 2 X. (4) Oversized metal waste objects, (especially gloveboxes), cannot be shipped as is to WIPP because they will not fit in a standard waste box or drum...|$|E
40|$|The joint {{goal of the}} Russian work is to {{establish}} a full-scale plutonium immobilization facility at a Russian industrial site by 2005. To achieve this requires that the necessary engineering and technical basis be developed in these Russian projects and the needed Russian approvals be obtained to conduct industrial-scale immobilization of plutonium-containing materials at a Russian industrial site by the 2005 date. This meeting and future work will provide the basis for joint decisions. Supporting R&D projects are being carried out at Russian Institutes that directly support the technical needs of Russian industrial sites to immobilize plutonium-containing materials. Special R&D on plutonium materials is also being carried out to support excess weapons disposition in Russia and the US, including nonproliferation studies of <b>plutonium</b> <b>recovery</b> from immobilization forms and accelerated radiation damage studies of the US-specified plutonium ceramic for immobilizing plutonium. This intriguing and extraordinary cooperation on certain aspects of the weapons plutonium problem is now progressing well and much work with plutonium has been completed in the past two years. Because much excellent and unique scientific and engineering technical work has now been completed in Russia in many aspects of plutonium immobilization, this meeting in St. Petersburg was both timely and necessary to summarize, review, and discuss these efforts among those who performed the actual work. The results of this meeting will help the US and Russia jointly define the future direction of the Russian plutonium immobilization program, and make it an even stronger and more integrated Russian program. The two objectives for the meeting were to: (1) Bring together the Russian organizations, experts, and managers performing the work into one place for four days to review and discuss their work with each other; and (2) Publish a meeting summary and a proceedings to compile reports of all the excellent Russian plutonium immobilization contract work. This proceedings document presents the wide extent of Russian immobilization activities, provides a reference for their work, and makes it available to others...|$|E
40|$|Cesium Recovery from Ores. Adaptation of the phenol {{extraction}} (Phenex) {{process to}} {{the recovery of}} cesium from ore leach liquors continued to show promise. In roast-leach tests, 98 to 99 % of the cesium was dissolved from pollucite ore by roasting the ore at 800 deg C with 1. 8 parts of Na/sub 2 /CO/sub 3 / plus 1. 2 parts of NaCl and leaching with water. More than 99 % of the cesium was recovered from the leach liquor and separated from other alkali metals by extracting with 4 -sec-butyl- 2 -(alpha -methylbenzyl) phenol (BAMBP) in diisopropylbenzene and stripping with hydrochloric acid. Santophen- 1 also extracted cesium effectively, but, because of the limited solubility of the cesiumSantophen- 1 complex in the diluent, the utility of this phenol in ore processing is questionable. Separation of Alkali Metals. The extraction and separation of alkali metals from nitrate solutions was studied with several different types of extractants, including substituted phenols, alkylphosphoric acids, sulfonic acids, carboxylic acids, and mixtures of some of these. With all of these reagents, cesium was extracted more strongly than rubidium, which in turn was extracted more strongly than the other alkali metals. Separation factors were higher with the phenols than with the other extractants. Acid Recovery by Amine Extraction. Preliminary tests showed the potential usefulness of tertiary amines for recovering and purifying phosphoric acid from the highly contaminated wet-process acid produced in the fertilizer industry. Water stripping of the amine solvent yielded a product {{that was more than}} 1. 5 M in H/ sub 2 /PO/sub 6 / and was almost free of iron and aluminum. Final-Cycle <b>Plutonium</b> <b>Recovery</b> by Amine Extraction. Batch equilibration tests with both aged and fresh samples of Purex-plant 1 BP solution showed that the aged but not the fresh samples contained a considerable quantity of zirconium-niobium species highly extractable by the hydrocarbon diluents used with amines and other extractants. The amounts of zirconium-niobium extractable from the aged solution were sufficient to account for the low decontamination previously obtained when aged plant 1 BP solution was used to continuous countercurrent testing of the plutonium- recovery flowsheets. Individual and batch cascade tests with the fresh plant solution showed separation and decontamination factors high enough for use in the projected process. Extraction of Lanthanides and Transplutoniums by Dialkylphosphoric Acids. The behavior of americium and curium relative to the lanthanides in extraction by di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) from carboxylic acids was shifted from the behavior in extractions from mineral acids, where americium is similar to promethium. The shift was greatest in extractions from oxydiacetic acid, where cerium was 4 times as extractable as americium, while differences within the element groups were very small. Extractions from nitric acid were increased by adding glycine (aminoacetic acid). Extractions were greatly reduced by adding a phenol to HDEHP. Ditridecylphosphoric acid (HDTDP) was a stronger extractant than HDEHP and gave smaller differences beplease delete the above abstract 1799...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Advanced Fuel Cycle Program and the Atomic Energy Canada Ltd (AECL) seek {{to develop}} and {{demonstrate}} the technologies needed to minimize the overall Pu and minor actinides present in the light water reactor (LWR) nuclear fuel cycles. It is proposed to reuse the Pu from LWR spent fuel both for the energy it contains and to decrease the hazard and proliferation impact resulting from storage of the Pu and minor actinides. The use of fuel compositions {{with a combination of}} U and Pu oxide (MOX) has been proposed as a way to recycle Pu and/or minor actinides in LWRs. It has also been proposed to replace the fertile U{sup 238 } matrix of MOX with a fertile-free matrix (IMF) to reduce the production of Pu{sup 239 } in the fuel system. It is important to demonstrate the performance of these fuels with the appropriate mixture of isotopes and determine what impact there might be from trace elements or contaminants. Previous work has already been done to look at weapons-grade (WG) Pu in the MOX configuration [1][2] and the reactor-grade (RG) Pu in a MOX configuration including small (4000 ppm additions of Neptunium). This program will add to the existing database by developing a wide variety of MOX fuel compositions along with new fuel compositions called inert-matrix fuel (IMF). The goal of this program is to determine the general fabrication and irradiation behavior of the proposed IMF fuel compositions. Successful performance of these compositions will lead to further selection and development of IMF for use in LWRs. This experiment will also test various inert matrix material compositions with and without quantities of the minor actinides Americium and Neptunium to determine feasibility of incorporation into the fuel matrices for destruction. There is interest in the U. S. and world-wide in the investigation of IMF (inert matrix fuels) for scenarios involving stabilization or burn down of plutonium in the fleet of existing commercial power reactors. IMF offer the potential advantage for more efficient destruction of plutonium and minor actinides (MA) relative to MOX fuel. Greater efficiency in plutonium reduction results in greater flexibility in managing plutonium inventories and in developing strategies for disposition of MA, as well as a potential for fuel cycle cost savings. Because fabrication of plutonium-bearing (and MA-bearing) fuel is expensive relative to UO{sub 2 } in terms of both capital and production, cost benefit can be realized through a {{reduction in the number of}} plutonium-bearing elements required for a given burn rate. In addition, the choice of matrix material may be manipulated either to facilitate fuel recycling or to make <b>plutonium</b> <b>recovery</b> extremely difficult. In addition to plutonium/actinide management, an inert matrix fuel having high thermal conductivity may have operational and safety benefits; lower fuel temperatures could be used to increase operating and safety margins, uprate reactor power, or a combination of both. The CANDU reactor offers flexibility in plutonium management and MA burning by virtue of online refueling, a simple bundle design, and good neutron economy. A full core of inert matrix fuel containing either plutonium or a plutonium-actinide mix can be utilized, with plutonium destruction efficiencies greater than 90 %, and high (> 60 %) actinide destruction efficiencies. The Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) could allow additional possibilities in the design of an IMF bundle, since the tighter lattice pitch and light-water coolant reduce or eliminate the need to suppress coolant void reactivity, allowing the center region of the bundle to include additional fissile material and to improve actinide burning. The ACR would provide flexibility for management of plutonium and MA from the existing LWR fleet, and would be complementary to the AFCI program in the U. S. Many of the fundamental principles concerning the use of IMF are nearly identical in LWRs and the ACR, including fuel/coolant compatibility, fuel fabrication, and fuel irradiation behavior. In addition, the U. S. and Canada both have interest in development of Generation IV SCWR (supercritical water reactor) technology, to which this fuel type would be applicable for plutonium and MA management. An inert matrix fuel with high thermal conductivity would be particularly beneficial to any SCWR concept. Given these similarities, it is proposed that a joint project be conducted within the framework of a U. S. -Canada INERI project on IMF. This report will present analysis of the inert matrix fuel compositions of interest for application to US and Canadian light water reactor fuel cycles, report on the development of fabrication procedures for these compositions, and provide an overview of the test and demonstration plan for these fuel systems...|$|E
