The song's direction was largely influenced by the production team of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood. Lead vocalist Bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for the album and told the production team, [...] "Let's just try something that's gonna <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> completely different place". After they distorted his voice to make it sound as if it were coming from a megaphone, Bono was inspired to sing in a persona, as the effect gave his vocals a different [...] "emotional feel". Flood mixed the final track with the assistance of Shannon Strong. Along with Robbie Adams, Strong also assisted Flood with engineering. Lanois provided additional guitar during recording.|$|E

[...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while.

Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I did tell the producers it may be to their advantage to not have me interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something.

500|$|Kalam's {{desire to}} meet spiritual leaders {{to help create}} a more prosperous, spiritual, and unified India was what {{initially}} led him to meet Pramukh Swami, the Hindu guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru. The first of eight meetings between Kalam and Pramukh Swami over a fourteen-year period took place on 30 June 2001 in New Delhi, during which Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and spiritual purity. Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions. One such incident occurred the day following the terrorist attack on BAPS' Akshardham, Gandhinagar complex in September 2002; Pramukh Swami prayed for, and sprinkled holy water upon, the sites {{of all of the}} deceased, including the terrorists, demonstrating the view that all human life is sacred. Kalam recalled being moved by Pramukh Swami's equanimity and compassion, citing this incident as one of his motivations for writing [...] Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him, Kalam stated that [...] " [...] has indeed transformed me. He is the ultimate stage of the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> God-synchronous orbit.

[...] Following Kalam's death a month after his final book was released, co-author Arun Tiwari pointed to this passage as potentially prophetic and premonitory of Kalam's death.|$|E

Ammendola considered their third album, led by [...] "One Crowded Hour", to be significantly different from their previous releases. Chad Grischow of IGN wrote of [...] "lush, mesmerizing music meld with gorgeous melodies brought to life by Richards' rich vocals that wrap themselves around each instrument".

2500|$|By 1918, Lloyd and Roach {{had begun}} to develop his {{character}} beyond an imitation of his contemporaries.

The [...] "Glass" [...] character {{is said to have}} been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing; previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque [...] "Lonesome Luke". [...] "When I adopted the glasses," [...] he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, [...] "it more or less <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different category because I became a human being.

[...] Unlike most silent comedy personae, [...] "Harold" [...] was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition.
