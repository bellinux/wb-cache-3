40|$|Abstract—Because the nearspace slow-moving {{platform}} borne {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) can realize high resolution imaging using low pulse repetition frequency (PRF), a full-aperture ScanSAR (FA-ScanSAR) operation, which switches the range beam <b>pulse</b> <b>by</b> <b>pulse,</b> was proposed for wide swath imaging.

The SAR antenna switches the range beam to point at each of the sub-swaths in turn, transmits pulses and receives echoes <b>pulse</b> <b>by</b> <b>pulse.</b> The design method of main system parameters and the calculating expressions of the performance indexes are addressed in the paper. A design example is given to compare the performance of the conventional strip operation, ScanSAR and FA-ScanSAR operation.

40|$|Impulse {{through-wall}} radar (TWR) {{is considered}} as one of preferred choices for through-wall human indication due to its good penetration and high range resolution. Large bandwidth available for impulse TWR results in high range resolution, but also brings an atypical adversity issue not substantial in narrowband radars — high timing jitter effect, caused by the non-ideal sampling clock at the receiver. The fact that impulse TWR employs very narrow pulses makes little jitter inaccuracy large enough to destroy the signal correlation property and then degrade clutter suppression performance. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} timing jitter impact on clutter suppression in through-wall human indication via impulse TWR.
