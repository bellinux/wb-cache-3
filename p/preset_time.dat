To cover the sound of bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process. As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was introduced in the 1980s that, after activation, produces the sound of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand name commonly found is the [...] This device is now routinely placed in most new public women's rooms, and many older public women's rooms have been upgraded. The Otohime may be either a separate battery-operated device attached to the wall of the toilet, or included in an existing washlet. The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a hand in front of a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a <b>preset</b> <b>time</b> or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to 20 liters of water per use. However, some women believe that the Otohime sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the Otohime.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} preliminary {{analysis of}} strategies to activate and deactivate a bus pre-signal using vehicle count data. The bus pre-signal currently operates during <b>preset</b> <b>times</b> to regulate {{access to a}} length of road controlled {{at the other end}} by vehicle-actuated traffic signals. However, vehicle flows at the pre-signal vary on a daily basis so a more demand-based approach would be more effective. There has been much research performed to optimise pre-signal cycle times and bus priority at pre-signals. We focus on identifying the optimal strategy to activate and deactivate the bus pre-signal using vehicle demand rather than the current fixed time strategy. The ideal strategy should be stable, robust, consistent and timely. We investigate strategies using vehicle counts, queueing theory and estimation and prediction. Our recommended strategy combines aspects of all three areas...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — For aim 1, ABPM from 53 adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes was reviewed. Nocturnal dips in systolic blood pressure calculated by actual sleep time were compared with those from a <b>preset</b> sleep <b>time.</b> For aim 2, blood pressure monitoring from 98 patients using actual reported sleep time was reviewed. Reproducibility of the nocturnal dip in systolic blood pressure was assessed in a subset of “nondippers. ” RESULTS — For aim 1, the actual mean � SE decline in nocturnal systolic blood pressure was 11. 6 � 4. 7 %, whereas the mean decline in nocturnal systolic blood pressure calculated using the <b>preset</b> sleep <b>time</b> was 8. 8 � 4. 9 % (P � 0. 0001).

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new model}} for studying multiechelon inventory systems with stochastic demand. For the model we assume that each site in the system orders at <b>preset</b> <b>times</b> according to an order-up-to policy, that delivery times are deterministic, and that the demand processes are stochastic with independent increments. We introduce a new scheme for allocating stock in short supply, which we call virtual allocation and which permits significant tractability. We exercise the model {{on a set of}} test problems for two-echelon systems to get insight into the structure of good policies. The primary findings are that both the central warehouse (upper echelon) and the retail sites (lower echelon) should hold safety stock, but that most of the safety stock should be at the retail sites. Consequently, the central warehouse will stock out with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the virtual allocation rule is near optimal for the set of test problems. multiechelon inventory systems, optimal safety stocks, inventory allocation policies, order up to policies...|$|R

This system is set up for taking air samples automatically at remote places. Twenty glass flasks can be connected one by one or in pairs, {{and they can be}} filled at <b>preset</b> <b>times,</b> after <b>preset</b> intervals, or by online remote control. The system is capable of drying air continuously without operator intervention, with a flow rate of up to 4 L min- 1, to a dewpoint below - 50 °C. This enables continuous sampling, always retaining grab air samples of, for example, the last 24 h. This way, it is possible to decide afterward, according to online instrument records, if it is worthwhile to keep a single flask sample or even the whole diurnal cycle for later analysis at the laboratory.

40|$|Abstract- We {{present the}} {{improved}} solar radiospectrograph of the University of Athens operating at the Thermopylae Satellite Station. Observations now cover the frequency range from 20 to 650 MHz. The spectrograph has a 7 -meter moving parabola feeding by a log-period antenna for 100 to 650 MHz and a stationary inverted V fat dipole antenna for the 20 to 100 MHz. Two receivers are operating in parallel, one sweep frequency {{for the whole}} range (10 spectra/sec, 630 channels/spectrum) and one acousto-optical receiver for the range 270 to 450 MHz (100 spectra/sec, 128 channels/spectrum). The data acquisition system consists of two PCs (equipped with 12 bit, 225 ksamples/sec DAC, one for every receiver). The daily operation is fully automated: receiving universal time from a GPS, pointing the antenna to the sun, system calibration, starting and stopping the observations at <b>preset</b> <b>times,</b> data acquisition, and archiving on DVD. We can also control the whole system through modem or Internet.

40|$|Diffuse Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (DR-FTIR) {{spectroscopy}} {{has previously}} proven to provide time-resolved insights into early cement hydration spanning ~ 30 s to ~ 36 h {{after completing the}} mixing. Here, a previously validated ex situ freeze-dry procedure to stop hydration at <b>preset</b> <b>times</b> is complemented by an in situ Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) infrared spectroscopy method. The qualitative overall agreement between ex situ freeze-drying and in situ monitoring is demonstrated. Moreover, water conversion during hydration comes out clearly in the time-resolved ATR-FTIR spectra. This information is absent in DR-FTIR where buildups of crystal water and hydroxides are observed, while quenching of the hydration process requires removal of free water prior to acquiring the spectra. The ability of the IR technique to monitor the initial rate of hydration {{as a function of}} time is validated by comparing to calorimetry. The two approaches are understood to be complementary in that the former monitors alite grain surface hydration, while the latter reflects bulk hydration. IR is complementary to the calorimetry in cases of surface processes in conjunction with low enthalpy changes, that is, initial C–S–H formation and additive related surface chemistry...|$|R

The feeder equipped with such a sensor and governing control strategy is able to stop feeding according to the gathering behavior of eels. The control strategy contains six user-adjustable parameters with default values. If the sensor fails to detect the gathering behavior for three (default) consecutive trials, the feeder will stop feeding until the next wake-up, thus reducing the risk of polluting the water, etc...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer-controlled}} {{mechanism that}} fits a standard ankle-foot prosthesis {{was designed to}} capture the absorbed energy in the ankle and delay its release until specific times in the gait cycle.

This mechanism was added to a Talux prosthetic foot and was employed by a user of a conventional energy-storage ankle-foot prosthesis. His gait was recorded using a motion analysis system. Five settings: 0, 55, 65, 75, and 85 ms delay were tested on separate days, and the standard kinematic and kinetic gait data were recorded. The user reported some settings were more comfortable than others. When these preferences were tested with a randomized double-blind trial, the preferences were not consistent. A second user showed a preference for the 55 ms delay. The modifications to the device resulted in changes to the gait of the subjects, including increased cadence and kinematics of the unaffected joints and a longer, slower push from the ankle, which was noticed by both of the subjects...|$|R
