5|$|Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace (1975) applied {{rational}} expectations to models with <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> trade-offs between inflation and output {{and found that}} monetary policy {{could not be used}} to systematically stabilize the economy. Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E
5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E

This result stems fromvariations in {{the slope of the}} individual short-run <b>Phillips</b> <b>curves,</b> rather than from changes to the equilibrium level of unemployment.

Two main results arise: i) {{in most of the}} simulated scenarios the estimated reduced-form <b>Phillips</b> <b>curves</b> turn out to be unstable. However, if the structural new-keynesian model is predominantly - even if not fully - backward-looking, the estimated reduced-form parameters are stable; ii) the Chow-breakpoint test tends to underestimate the importance of regime-shifts in small samples.

5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as {{the importance of the}} demand for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not work under rational expectations. Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E

5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

For almost 40 years, Solow and Paul Samuelson worked together on many landmark theories: von Neumann growth theory (1953), theory of capital (1956), linear programming (1958) and the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> (1960).|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the U.S. dollar was {{therefore}} no longer anchored to gold, and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the {{value of the}} U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve, however, continued to increase the money supply, resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s. This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked (the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve),</b> and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign. Between 1965 and 1981, the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value.|$|E

40|$|Analysts {{typically}} use {{a variety}} of techniques to forecast inflation. These include both ‘bottom-up’ approaches, for near-term forecasting, as well as econometric methods (such as mark-up models of inflation, which have been found to perform quite well for Australia – see de Brouwer and Ericsson (1998)). One of the econometric approaches to inflation forecasting which is sometimes considered is the use of <b>Phillips</b> <b>curves</b> based on estimates of the output gap. This paper suggests, however, that the real-time capacity of such <b>Phillips</b> <b>curves</b> to forecast inflation is limited, relative even to such simple benchmark forecasting approaches as an autoregressive (AR) model of inflation or a random walk assumption. It appears that the lack of precision with which output-gap-based <b>Phillips</b> <b>curves</b> can be estimated in real time limits their usefulness as a means of forecasting inflation in isolation. Phillips curve-based forecasts may, however, perform a little better than AR model-based ones in at least predicting whether inflation will increase or decrease from its current level. Moreover, combining Phillips curve-based forecasts with those from simple, alternative approaches does seem to offer some scope for improving the real-time forecast accuracy of the latter. These observations suggest that, in spite of their generally disappointing performance as a means of forecasting inflation in isolation, output-gap-based <b>Phillips</b> <b>curves</b> may continue to be useful in real time – as a tool for conditioning gap estimates within a multivariate filtering framework, and as a possible complement to other, alternative inflation forecasting approaches. monetary policy; forecasting inflation; output gaps; real-time data...|$|R
500|$|The <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> {{appeared}} {{to reflect a}} clear, inverse relationship between inflation and output. The curve broke down in the 1970s as economies suffered simultaneous economic stagnation and inflation known as stagflation. The empirical implosion of the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> followed attacks mounted on theoretical grounds by Friedman and Edmund Phelps. Phelps, although not a monetarist, argued that only unexpected inflation or deflation impacted employment. Variations of Phelps's [...] "expectations-augmented Phillips curve" [...] became standard tools. Friedman and Phelps used models with no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Instead of the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> they used models based on the natural rate of unemployment where expansionary monetary policy can only temporarily shift unemployment below the natural rate. Eventually, firms will adjust their prices and wages for inflation based on real factors, ignoring nominal changes from monetary policy. The expansionary boost will be wiped out.|$|E
500|$|Friedman {{also argued}} for the {{cessation}} of government intervention in currency markets, thereby spawning an enormous literature on the subject, as well as promoting the practice of freely floating exchange rates. His close friend George Stigler explained, [...] "As is customary in science, he did not win a full victory, in part because research was directed along different lines by the theory of rational expectations, a newer approach developed by Robert Lucas, also at the University of Chicago." [...] The relationship between Friedman and Lucas, or new classical macroeconomics as a whole, was highly complex. The Friedmanian <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> was an interesting starting point for Lucas, but he soon realized that the solution provided by Friedman was not quite satisfactory. Lucas elaborated a new approach in which rational expectations were presumed instead of the Friedmanian adaptive expectations. Due to this reformulation, the story in which {{the theory of the}} new classical <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> was embedded radically changed. This modification, however, had a significant effect on Friedman’s own approach, so, as a result, the theory of the Friedmanian <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> also changed. Moreover, new classical Neil Wallace, who was {{a graduate student at the}} University of Chicago between 1960 and 1963, regarded Friedman’s theoretical courses as a mess. This evaluation clearly indicates the broken relationship between Friedmanian monetarism and new classical macroeconomics.|$|E
500|$|Friedman's {{challenges}} {{to what he}} later called [...] "naive Keynesian" [...] theory began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function. In the 1960s, he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies, and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using [...] "Keynesian language and apparatus" [...] yet rejecting its [...] "initial" [...] conclusions. He theorized that there existed a [...] "natural" [...] rate of unemployment, and argued that employment above this rate would cause inflation to accelerate. He argued that the <b>Phillips</b> <b>curve</b> was, in the long run, vertical at the [...] "natural rate" [...] and predicted what would {{come to be known}} as stagflation. Friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as [...] "monetarism", and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy. His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's response to the global financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E
