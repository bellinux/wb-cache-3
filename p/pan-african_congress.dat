5|$|In late 1945, Du Bois {{attended}} the fifth, and final, <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress,</b> in Manchester, England. The congress {{was the most}} productive of the five congresses, and there Du Bois met Kwame Nkrumah, the future first president of Ghana who would later invite Du Bois to Africa.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1921 {{to attend the}} second <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress.</b> The assembled black leaders {{from around the world}} issued the London Resolutions and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and that Africa be ruled by Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the consent of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E
5|$|To get to Europe, Trotter {{posed as}} a seaman seeking work in New York, {{and got a}} job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France. He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the {{principal}} peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference. He also missed Du Bois' <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress,</b> which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.|$|E
30|$|Du Bois gave a {{specific}} impetus to Pan-Africanist consciousness, particularly {{through a series}} of <b>Pan-African</b> <b>congresses,</b> most of which were held in Europe. Following the aforementioned Pan-African conference, five <b>Pan-African</b> <b>congresses</b> were organized and held in the West, before Bandung: the first one was held in Paris in 1919, the second in 1921 in London, the third in 1923 in London, the fourth in 1927 in New York, and the fifth in 1945 in Manchester.|$|R

50|$|Farfana {{participated in}} the first and second <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congresses</b> in 1919 and 1921, respectively. He also {{attended}} the First National Belgian Colonial Congress in 1920. He actively criticized Belgian colonial practices, arguing that the ban on forced labour in the Congo was not being consistently applied and education for the native population was inadequate. He also called for the Congolese to be granted political rights.|$|R
5|$|When the war ended, Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1919 {{to attend the}} first <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress</b> and to interview African-American soldiers for a planned book on their experiences in World War I. He was trailed by U.S. agents who were searching for evidence of treasonous activities. Du Bois discovered {{that the vast majority}} of black American soldiers were relegated to menial labor as stevedores and laborers. Some units were armed, and one in particular, the 92nd Division (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat. Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, and concluded that the Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of black soldiers, and promoted bigotry.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{was born}} to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before {{becoming}} politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu tribal land affairs. During the 1930s he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938 he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress</b> in Manchester. In 1946, he returned to Kenya and became a school principal. In 1947 he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support yet animosity from white settlers. In 1952, {{he was among the}} Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and then exiled in Lodwar until 1961.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, at {{the behest}} of Chief Mwase of Kasungu, whom he had met in England in 1939, and other {{politically}} active Malawians, he represented the Nyasaland African Congress at the Fifth <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress</b> in Manchester. From this time, he took an increasingly active interest in his native land, advising the Congress and providing it with some financial support. With help from sympathetic Britons, he also lobbied in London on behalf of the Congress.|$|E

25|$|The Cold War, {{especially}} in the 1950s and 1960s, {{put a damper on}} the Esperanto movement as well, as there were fears on both sides that Esperanto could be used for enemy propaganda. However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a <b>pan-African</b> <b>congress.</b> The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.|$|E
25|$|Before World War II, James {{left for}} the United States, where he met Kwame Nkrumah, a student from the Gold Coast who studied at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. James gave Nkrumah a letter of {{introduction}} to Padmore. When Nkrumah arrived in London in May 1945 intending to study law, Padmore {{met him at the}} station. It was the start of a long alliance. Padmore was then organizing the 1945 Manchester <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress,</b> attended not only by the inner circle of the IASB but also by W. E. B. Du Bois, the American organizer of earlier Pan-African conferences. The Manchester conference helped set the agenda for decolonisation in the post-war period.|$|E
25|$|Nkrumah {{spent his}} time on {{political}} organising. He and Padmore were among the principal organizers, and co-treasurers, of the Fifth <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress</b> in Manchester (15–19 October 1945). The Congress elaborated a strategy for supplanting colonialism with African socialism. They agreed to pursue a federal United States of Africa, with interlocking regional organizations, governing through separate states of limited sovereignty. They planned to pursue a new African culture without tribalism, democratic within a socialist or communist system, synthesizing traditional aspects with modern thinking, and {{for this to be}} achieved by nonviolent means if possible. Among those who attended the congress was the venerable W. E. B. Dubois along with some who later took leading roles in leading their nations to independence, including Hastings Banda of Nyasaland (which became Malawi), Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Obafemi Awolowo of Nigeria, and C. L. R. James.|$|E

5000|$|In 1904 Hunt married Ida Gibbs (1862-1957) in Madagascar, {{where he}} had been {{appointed}} to succeed her father. She had been educated at Oberlin College and was a friend of W. E. B. Du Bois. Ida Gibbs Hunt and Du Bois worked together on the <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congresses</b> held in Europe in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1923 in London, she gave a talk on [...] "The Colored Races and the League of Nations." ...|$|R
500|$|When the Great War ended, Trotter {{sought to}} use the 1919 Paris Peace Conference {{as a vehicle to}} raise {{international}} awareness of US government policy toward African Americans. He viewed the reality of segregation as incompatible with Wilson's war vision to [...] "make the world safe for Democracy." [...] Trotter organized a meeting in Washington, DC related to the peace conference; he and ten other African-American delegates were chosen to attend the peace conference. The State Department refused to issue passports to those delegates, or to African Americans planning to attend a <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress</b> that Du Bois was organizing to be held concurrently with the peace conference in Paris. Du Bois and other African Americans were supporting African colonies' desire for independence.|$|E
500|$|Harvard's {{decision}} to ban blacks from its dormitories in 1921 was decried by Du Bois as {{an instance of}} a broad effort in the U.S. to renew [...] "the Anglo-Saxon cult; the worship of the Nordic totem, the disfranchisement of Negro, Jew, Irishman, Italian, Hungarian, Asiatic and South Sea Islander– the world rule of Nordic white through brute force." [...] When Du Bois sailed for Europe in 1923 for the third <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress,</b> the circulation of The Crisis had declined to 60,000 from its World War I high of 100,000, but it remained the preeminent periodical {{of the civil rights}} movement. President Coolidge designated Du Bois an [...] "Envoy Extraordinary" [...] to Liberia and– after the third congress concluded– Du Bois rode a German freighter from the Canary Islands to Africa, visiting Liberia, Sierra Leone and Senegal.|$|E
500|$|Kenyatta {{and other}} senior IASB members began {{planning}} the fifth <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress,</b> held in Manchester in October 1945. They were assisted by Kwame Nkrumah, a West African {{who arrived in}} Britain earlier that year. Kenyatta spoke at the conference, although made no particular impact on the proceedings. Much of the debate that took place centred on whether indigenous Africans should continue pursuing a gradual campaign for independence or whether they should seek the military overthrow of the European imperialists. The conference ended with a statement declaring that while delegates desired a peaceful transition to African self-rule, Africans [...] "as a last resort, may have to appeal to force {{in the effort to}} achieve Freedom". Kenyatta supported this resolution, although was more cautious than other delegates and made no open commitment to violence. He subsequently authored an IASB pamphlet, Kenya: The Land of Conflict, in which he again blended political calls for independence with romanticised descriptions of an idealised pre-colonial African past.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress</b> — {{following}} on {{from the}} first Pan-African Conference of 1900 in London — {{was a series of}} seven meetings, held in 1919 in Paris (1st <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress),</b> 1921 in London (2nd <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress),</b> 1923 in London (3rd <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress),</b> 1927 New York City (4th <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress),</b> 1945 Manchester (5th <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress),</b> 1974 Dar es Salaam (6th <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress),</b> 1994 Kampala (7th <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congress),</b> and 2014 Accra that were intended to address the issues facing Africa as a result of European colonization of most of the continent.|$|E

5|$|Racism was {{the main}} target of DuBois's polemics, and he {{strongly}} protested against lynching, Jim Crow laws, and discrimination in education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congresses</b> {{to fight for the}} independence of African colonies from European powers. DuBois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.|$|R
2500|$|Some English {{people felt}} the Association would not {{last three months}} but by 1900 Williams was ready to hold the first Pan-African Conference (subsequent {{gathering}}s were known as Congresses). The three-day gathering took place at Westminster Town Hall on 23, 24, and 25 July with delegates comprising [...] "men and women of African blood and descent" [...] from West and South Africa, the West Indies, the United States and Liberia. W. E. B. Du Bois, who was to become the movement's torchbearer at subsequent <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congresses,</b> was a participant and his Address to the Nations with its prophetic statement [...] "The problem {{of the twentieth century}} is the problem of the colour-line" [...] came to be regarded as the defining statement of the conference.|$|R

The [...] "Outer Pocket" [...] column featured letters from readers. While Fauset’s primary concern and duties were with the literature of the times, she shared other political outlooks with Du Bois, such as a mutual concern with education and families. African cultural issues were also of concern to both Du Bois and Fauset in general, with their many trips overseas, their participation in several <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Congresses</b> and Conferences, and African-themed cover art and other art gracing the pages of The Crisis throughout the years.|$|R
