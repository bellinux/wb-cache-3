5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} was in place, the battle lines on both sides had largely solidified, leaving the 45th Infantry Division in a stationary position as it conducted attacks and counterattacks for the same ground. The division was put {{under the command of}} Eighth Army's I Corps for most of the conflict. It was deployed around Chorwon and assigned to protect the key routes from that area into Seoul. The terrain was difficult and the weather was <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. The division suffered its first casualty on 11 December 1951.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{in camps}} varied {{considerably}} geographically and over time. Conditions were particularly <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient {{to accommodate the}} large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front turned against Germany, conditions worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E

The Padres opted not to carry Nova on their 25-man roster, however, and returned him to the Yankees.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern and southern zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed {{the fact that the}} phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Harriet Fisher Jones {{was born}} on 2 May 1841 in Warrington to her father, Evan Jones, a tinsmith, and his wife, Harriet Jones. As {{she and her mother}} shared the same name, she became better known as Jeannie. In 1860, she married a fruit merchant, Robert Willis, and the couple {{travelled}} to New York City, where she took an interest in the black rights movement. On her return to England, she and her husband settled in London and had a son, Robert Frederick Evan Willis, better known as Fred. Willis spent some time helping the <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slums of London. She was heavily influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin, setting her on the path of socialism.|$|E
5|$|Impala browse {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Rodham then entered Yale Law School, {{where she}} {{served on the}} {{editorial}} board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action. During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973). She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese {{established}} an institute to train female schoolteachers for the Anglican schools in Brighton {{and the rest}} of Sussex in Black Lion Street in The Lanes (the ancient heart of the town) in April 1842. This was done in association with the National Society for the Education of the <b>Poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Principles of the Established Church. More space was soon needed, so in 1854 it found a site {{on the west side of}} Ditchling Road on which to build a larger college. Ditchling Road, which ran across Ditchling Beacon to Ditchling village and then on to Cuckfield and eventually London, became a turnpike in 1770 and was thereafter one of the main north–south routes into and out of Brighton. The chosen site was on the north side of Viaduct Road, which was built to link Ditchling and London Roads and which formed the northern edge of Brighton's ecclesiastical parish and municipal borough until 1873.|$|E

5|$|The Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601 formalized earlier {{practices}} of poor relief {{contained in the}} Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597 yet is often cited {{as the beginning of}} the Old Poor Law system. It created a system administered at parish level, paid for by levying local rates on rate payers. Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called 'impotent poor', was {{in the form of a}} payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as outdoor relief. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish alms houses, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in Houses of Correction or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes. Provision for the many able-bodied <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workhouse, was relatively unusual, and most workhouses developed later. The 1601 Law said that parents and children were responsible for each other, elderly parents would live with their children.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon was exceptional {{for a number}} of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, Alexander Wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds. The decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last individual in the species was dead by 1914. Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the <b>poor,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States throughout the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The route {{begins at}} I-5 near the Mexican border {{in a far}} south part of San Ysidro, a {{neighborhood}} of San Diego. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with State Route905 (SR905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide between rich and <b>poor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Chula Vista; those {{on the eastern side}} of the freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CRS17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} honeybees to learn mazes of four types: constant-turn mazes, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> appropriate turn is always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction <b>in</b> each decision chamber; zig-zag mazes, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> appropriate turn is alternately left and right in successive decision chambers; irregular mazes, {{in which there is}} no readily apparent pattern to the turns; and variable irregular mazes, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> bees were trained to learn several irregular mazes simultaneously. The bees were able to learn to navigate all four types of maze. Performance was best <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constant-turn mazes, somewhat <b>poorer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zig-zag mazes, <b>poorer</b> still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> irregular mazes, and <b>poorest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> variable irregular mazes. These results demonstrate that bees do not navigate such mazes simply by memorizing the entire sequence of appropriate turns. Rather, performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> various configurations depends on the existence of regularity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structure of the maze and on the ease with which this regularity is recognized and learned...|$|R
5|$|In the Middle Ages cruck timber {{construction}} {{was used in}} cottages, but the most common building material was stone. From the twelfth century, burghs contained the houses of significant inhabitants, but little has survived of the urban housing of the <b>poor.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early modern era most {{of the population was}} housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. Most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets, with temporary sheilings becoming permanent settlements. The standard layout of a house was a byre-dwelling or long house, with humans and livestock sharing a common roof. Cottages in the Highlands tended to be cruder while those from the Lowlands had distinct rooms and were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In towns, traditional thatched half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. In the eighteenth century new farm buildings replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. The Industrial Revolution transformed the scale of Scottish towns. Gridiron plans were used to lay out new towns in Edinburgh, Glasgow and smaller burghs. In Glasgow the growing workforce was lived in squalid sub-urban tenements like those of the Gorbals. New towns aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, were an important part of Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth century.|$|E
