Space resolved CC and CS interactions are important indicators of cell-density distribution, localized cellular behavior, and multiple cell-layers which are differentiators of normal and abnormal cell behavior. In this research, CS and CC interactions and the variations therein due to a) Cell growth, 2) cell-drug interaction, and 3) effect of Cytotoxin were studied using multielectrode, multi-frequency Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Contemporary impedance based methods sense either CC or CS interaction as a space averaged macroscopic quantity. A major contribution of this research is that, both CC and CS interactions are recorded and analyzed with spatio-temporal resolution. This research {{led to the development of}} an automated cell culture monitoring system, namely, CellMap. A planar eight electrode sensor was fabricated on a glass substrate and interfaced with a switching circuit. The switching circuit sequentially selects consecutive electrodes upon input of a 5 V trigger pulse which is generated by the frequency response analyzer at the end of each frequency scan, thereby facilitating automated switching and recording of multielectrode dataset.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} an optically pumped inter subband farinfrared (40 - 100 [mu]m) laser, using GaAs/ AlxGal-xAs heterostructures. The proposed design aims to use LO-phonon-mediated depopulation of the lower THz laser level to aid the intersubband laser population inversion. Interband recombination occurs by means of stimulated emission, thus combining an interband (~ 1550 me V) and intersubband (~ 16 - 18 meV) laser. As the subband properties of both the valence band and the conduction band are important for this work, a numerical program code was developed for the valence band to supplement the available tools for the conduction band. The steady state rate equations for the proposed quantum well structure were solved self-consistently for several different carrier temperatures. The calculations indicate that a pump beam of moderate power (0. 5 - 1 W) concentrated on a device of typical dimensions (104 cm 2) can generate an intersuhb and gain of 20 cm- 1 at 50 K for a THz emission linewidth of 2 meV. This gain level can suffice to obtain THz lasing action, provided that the cavity losses can be kept in check. The performance of the THz laser is predicted to be very dependent on electron temperature, mainly due {{to the opening of}} a <b>parasitic</b> LO-phonon <b>channel</b> between the THz laser levels.

By employing a multiple active region device configuration, high optical output has been demonstrated from devices in the 3 - 5 μm and 7 - 12 μm spectral bands. Mid-wave infrared optical output in excess of 0. 95 mW/sr has been observed from 120 × 120 μm 2 devices with peak emission at 3. 8 μm, and nearly 160 μW/sr has been measured from devices of the same size operating at 8 μm. Larger devices (1 × 1 mm^ 2) with output as high as 8. 5 mW/sr and 1. 6 mW/sr have been demonstrated with mid-wave and long-wave devices, respectively, under quasi-DC bias conditions. The high switching speed inherent to small area {{light emitting diodes}} as well as potentially high optical output make these devices appealing candidates to improve upon the current state-of-the-art in infrared projection technology. Simulation of thermal scenes with wide dynamic range and high frame rates is desirable for calibration of infrared detection systems. Suitable projectors eliminate the need for observation of a live scene for detector calibration, thereby reducing costs and increasing safety. Current technology supports apparent temperature generation of up to approximately 800 Kelvin with frame rates of hundreds of frames per second; strong desire exists to break these barriers.

Nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) TFTs have attracted attention recently, due to high-performance and low-cost, as an alternative of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) TFTs. The nc-Si:H TFTs has higher carrier mobility and better device stability than a-Si:H TFTs while lower manufacturing cost than poly-Si TFTs. However, current nc-Si:TFTs have several challenging issues on materials and devices, on which this thesis focuses. In the material study, the gate quality silicon nitride (a-SiNx) films and doped nc-Si:H contacts based on conventional plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are investigated. The feasibility of a-SiNx on TFT application is discussed with current-voltage (I-V) /capacitance-voltage(C-V) measurement and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) results which demonstrate 4. 3 MV/cm, relative permittivity of 6. 15 and nitrogen rich composition. The doped nc-Si:H for contact layer of TFTs is characterized with Raman Spectroscopy and I-V measurements to reveal 56 % of crystalinity and 0. 42 S/cm of dark conductivity. Inverted staggered TFT structure is fabricated for nc-Si:H TFT device research using fully wet etch fabrication process which requires five lithography steps. The process steps are described in detail as well as adaptation of the fabrication process to a backplane fabrication for direct conversion X-ray imagers. The modification of TFT process for backplane fabrication involves two more lithography steps for mushroom electrode formation while other pixel components is incorporated into the five lithography step TFT process. The TFTs are electrically characterized demonstrating 7. 22 V of threshold voltage, 0. 63 S/decade of subthreshold slope, 0. 07 cm 2 /V•s of field effect mobility, and 106 of on/off ratio.
