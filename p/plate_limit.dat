40|$|We {{describe}} the new, fast, high-precision microdensitometer SuperCOSMOS. Some aspects of {{hardware and software}} design that enable high-precision astrometry from photographic plates are explained. We show that the positioning repeatability of the measuring machine is less than 0. 1 μm standard error in either coordinate, and the absolute positional accuracy is about 0. 15 μm standard error. Furthermore, measurements of the same plate in different orientations show that the sampling errors are small (e. g. ∼ 0. 2 μm, rising to ∼ 1. 0 μm at the <b>plate</b> <b>limit,</b> for stellar images in a IIIaJ emulsion), thus allowing the extraction of relative positional information from Schmidt plates at accuracies less than 1 μm.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a simple mixed-hybrid element for the linear {{analysis}} of Reissner-Mindlin plates is discussed. The element is derived from a modified Reissner functional and standard bilinear (isoparametric) interpolation for displacement and rotations is assumed whereas local stresses (rather than stress resultants and moments) are explicitly modelled. It is assumed that in plane shear stresses are not a priori symmetric. This choice allows to decouple the equilibrium equations, and involves introducing an in-plane infinitesimal rotation field, corresponding to drilling degrees of freedom. Out-of-plane shear stresses are then obtained such that equilibrium equations are exactly satisfied. The proposed element does not exhibit locking effects at all: i. e. the shear deformation energy is zero in the thin <b>plate</b> <b>limit.</b> Details of the formulation are provided, and the performances of the element are assessed with reference to well-established benchmark problems...|$|E
40|$|Non-Euclidean {{plates are}} thin elastic bodies having no {{stress-free}} configuration, hence exhibiting residual stresses {{in the absence}} of external constraints. These bodies are endowed with a three-dimensional reference metric, which may not necessarily be immersible in physical space. Here, based on a recently developed theory for such bodies, we characterize the transition from flat to buckled equilibrium configurations at a critical value of the plate thickness. Depending of the reference metric, the buckling transition may be either continuous or discontinuous. In the infinitely thin <b>plate</b> <b>limit,</b> under the assumption that a limiting configuration exists, we show that the limit is a configuration that minimizes the bending content, amongst all configurations with zero stretching content (isometric immersions of the mid-surface). For small but finite plate thickness we show the formation of a boundary layer, whose size scales with the square root of the plate thickness, and whose shape is determined by a balance between stretching and bending energies...|$|E

The criteria are chosen to be sufficiently simple so that the resulting optimization problem can be formulated as a second-order cone programming problem, which is solved by the dedicated solver MOSEK. The efficiency of the proposed finite element is illustrated by means of numerical examples on different plate geometries, for which the thin plate solutions as well as the pure shear solutions are accurately obtained as two different limit cases of the plate slenderness ratio.

The numerical results indicate that for 2 D and 3 D continuum, locking can be avoided. New plate and shell formulations that avoid both shear and membrane locking are also briefly reviewed. The principle is then extended to partition of unity enrichment to simplify numerical integration of discontinuous approximations in the extended finite element method. Examples are presented to test the new elements for problems involving cracks in linear elastic continua and cracked plates. In the latter case, the proposed formulation suppresses locking and yields elements which behave very well, even in the thin <b>plate</b> <b>limit.</b> Two important features of the set of elements presented are their insensitivity to mesh distortion and a lower computational cost than standard finite elements for the same accuracy.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} schlieren {{technique has}} been applied to the study of two-dimensional free convection heat transfer in asymmetrically heated vertical channels, using water as working fluid. As it is well known, the schlieren technique utilizes the refraction of light rays to display a pattern related to the temperature field. The schlieren system employed here makes use of a focal filament filter to identify regions of fluid that deflect light rays by the same amount. The schlieren images recorded enable local heat transfer coefficients to be reconstructed. This optical technique has been extensively used for the measurement of heat transfer coefficients in air, whereas its use in water was limited in the past, and restricted to qualitative observation like flow visualizations. The present paper is seemingly the first to present measurements of the local heat transfer coefficient along the heated wall of a vertical channel using water as working fluid. Experimental results are presented for two values of the channel aspect ratio (0. 1 and 0. 2) and Rayleigh number values, based on the channel height, of the order of 10 ^ 7 (laminar flow regime).

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the role of}} flexibility in the weight-bearing characteristics of bodies floating at an interface. Specifically, we develop a theoretical model for a two-dimensional thin floating plate that yields the maximum stable plate load and optimal stiffness for weight support. Plates small relative to the capillary length are primarily supported by surface tension, and their weight-bearing potential does not benefit from flexibility. Above a critical size comparable to the capillary length, flexibility assists interfacial flotation. For plates {{on the order of}} and larger than the capillary length, deflection from an initially flat shape increases the force resulting from hydrostatic pressure, allowing the plate to support a greater load. In this large <b>plate</b> <b>limit,</b> the shape that bears the most weight is a semicircle, which displaces the most fluid above the plate for a fixed plate length.

The formalism incorporates dispersion. The electromagnetic Green's dyadic breaks up into transverse electric and transverse magnetic parts. We derive the Casimir interaction energy between two concentric δ-function spheres in this formalism and show that it has the correct asymptotic flat <b>plate</b> <b>limit.</b> We systematically derive expressions for the Casimir self-energy and the total stress on a spherical shell using a δ-function potential, properly regulated by temporal and spatial point-splitting, which {{are different from the}} conventional temporal point-splitting.

For finite coupling, there are additional divergent contributions; in particular, there is a familiar logarithmic divergence occurring in the third order of the uniform asymptotic expansion that renders it impossible to extract a unique finite energy except {{in the case of an}} isorefractive sphere, which translates into λ_g=-λ_e.

The evolution of the Australia-Antarctica-West Pacific plate system is dependent on the Gondwana fit chosen for the reconstruction. Our fit, as defined for the latest Triassic, implies an original scenario for the evolution of the region, in particular for the "early" opening history of the Tasman Sea. The interaction with the Pacific, moreover, is characterised by many magmatic arc migrations and ocean openings, which are stopped by arc-arc collision, arc-spreading axis collision, or arc-oceanic plateau collision, and subduction reversals. Mid-Pacific oceanic plateaus created in the model are much wider than they are on present-day maps, and although they were subducted to a large extent, they were able to stop subduction.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} {{plates and}} shells are funding an increasing interest in engineering applications; {{in most cases}} dynamic phenomena {{need to be taken}} into account. Consequently effective and robust computational tools are sought in order to provide reliable results for the analysis of such structural models. In this paper the laminate hybrid assumed-strain plate element presented in [1], and used there in a static analysis, has been extended to the dynamic realm. This model is derived {{within the framework of the}} so called First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) [2], [3]. What is peculiar in this assumed strain finite element is the direct modelling of the in-plane strain components; the corresponding stress components are deduced via constitutive law. By enforcing the equilibrium equations for each lamina, account taken of continuity requirements, the out-of-plane shear stresses are computed and, finally, constitutive law provides the corresponding strains. The resulting global strain field depends on a fixed number of parameters, regardless of the total number of layers. Since the proposed element is not locking prone even in the thin <b>plate</b> <b>limit</b> and provides an accurate description of inter-laminar stresses, an extension to the dynamic range seems to be particularly attractive. The same kinematic assumptions will lead to the formulation of a consistent mass matrix.

40|$|Abstract: Fibre-reinforced {{plates and}} shells are find-ing an {{increasing}} interest in engineering applications. Consequently, efficient and robust computational tools {{are required for}} the analysis of such structural models. As a matter of fact, a large amount of laminate finite el-ements have been developed and incorporated in most commercial codes for structural analysis. In this paper a new laminate hybrid assumed-strain plate element is derived {{within the framework of the}} First-order Shear Deformation Theory (i. e. assuming that par-ticles of the plate originally lying along a straight line which is normal to the undeformed middle surface re-main aligned along a straight line during the deformation process) and assuming perfect bonding between laminae. The in-plane components of the (infinitesimal) strain ten-sor are interpolated and by making use of the constitu-tive law, the corresponding in-plane stress distribution is deduced for each layer. Out-of-plane shear stresses are then computed by integrating the equilibrium equations in each lamina, account taken of their continuity require-ments. Out-of-plane shear strains are finally obtained via the inverse constitutive law. The resulting global strain field depends on a fixed num-ber of parameters, regardless of the total number of lay-ers; 12 degrees of freedom are for instance assumed for the developed rectangular element. The proposed model does not suffer locking phenomena even in the thin <b>plate</b> <b>limit</b> and provides an accurate de-scription of inter-laminar stresses.
