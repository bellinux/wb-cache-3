This results in a person becoming scared of doing or saying {{what they want to}} out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.|$|E

Kawai met with King Gyanendra and told the press, [...] "If Japan loses its bid this time, Japanese <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> the support Japan has been providing to {{the world for the}} last 60 years has been futile." [...] Japan donates significantly to Nepal.|$|E
500|$|Expressing honestly, in NVC, {{is likely}} to involve expressing an {{observation}}, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if {{the context of the}} conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> you are making them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, [...] "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation about what you want from them and why." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of routes {{directly}} to the summit: most people climb the fell from Great Langdale and usually together with all or some of the adjoining fells of Bowfell, Pike of Blisco, Rossett Pike and Cold Pike to make a high-level ridge walk which encompasses the whole of the high ground at the head of Great Langdale. The ascent from Eskdale is very good, but that is at least a 15-kilometre (9-mile) round trip (depending on where in Eskdale one starts), and many <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> that this too far to [...] "bag" [...] just one fell.

[...] She admitted to being nervous about her on-screen appearance prior to the broadcast of her first scenes, as she faced media ridicule in 2002 when an allergic reaction to collagen lip implants left her with a severely swollen mouth.

2500|$|Notwithstanding any {{position}} or duties retained in Cork, {{by the time}} he died Goold had lived in West Croydon for many years. The 1861 Census shows a married gentleman born in Marylebone called Henry Goold living in Pier Road, North Aylesford, Kent, with his wife Sarah, aged 35. He appears unmistakably on the Census only once: in 1881, living at 8 Canterbury Road, Croydon with a fifteen-year-old servant, Jane Smith. He is 77 years old, described as a married baronet and as a property and landowner. In April 1893, he was summoned before the County Court judge at Croydon to answer for an unpaid debt accrued by himself, but the judge declined to commit him to jail due to his advanced age. The York Herald made its own judgement, saying, [...] "If he is considered too old to be made to pay his debts, many <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> he is also too old {{to be in a position}} to incur any." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} it will cause consumers, {{particularly}} those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare {{because of the cost}} burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. [...] "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," [...] said Jonathan Oberlander. It is [...] "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people {{will never be able to}} save anything in their savings accounts. [...] "Employers like it because they're going to save money," [...] but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. [...] "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. If you move to high-deductible plans, <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> twice. If I have a sore throat, instead of going to my physician, I'll have a cup of tea instead." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 1961, Combs {{appropriated}} $50,000 {{from the}} governor's contingency fund {{to construct the}} clock on the lawn of the state capitol. Combs had seen a similar clock in Edinburgh, Scotland, and believed it would be a colorful addition to the capitol grounds. When construction was completed on the clock, some ridiculed it as [...] "Combs' Folly" [...] or [...] "Big Bert" [...] (an allusion to London's Big Ben). Combs' political foe, A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler, was particularly critical, declaring [...] "It's amazing what some <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> of when they have nothing better to do." [...] In a subsequent gubernatorial campaign, Chandler mocked the clock, declaring [...] "Well, they don't say it's half past 2 in Frankfort anymore. They say it's two petunias past the jimson weed." [...] Chandler's derision became the minority view in time, however; according to journalist John Ed Pearce, the clock {{became one of the most}} talked-about and visited tourist attractions in the state and the most visited place in Frankfort.|$|E
2500|$|At 10:00am, October 28, Kennedy {{first learned}} of Khrushchev's {{solution}} to the crisis to remove the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement {{for the world to}} hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. [...] "This is a pretty good play of his," [...] Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March of the year, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. [...] "Most <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it," [...] Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. [...] "We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood," [...] Kennedy said, [...] "when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that I have with Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. We just have to do our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you think <b>people</b> <b>will</b> <b>think</b> then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E
