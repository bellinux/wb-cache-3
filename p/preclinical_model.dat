5000|$|Tumor Organoids: A New <b>Preclinical</b> <b>Model</b> for Drug Sensitivity Analysis ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Although {{targeting}} angiogenesis with {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitors (TKIs) has become {{standard of care}} {{in the treatment of}} clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), resistance mechanism are not fully understood, and {{there is a need to}} develop new therapeutic options overcoming them. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To develop a <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> that predicts clinical activity of novel agents in 19 RCC patients, we established patient-derived cell (PDC) and xenograft (PDX) models derived from malignant effusions or surgical specimen. RESULTS: Successful PDCs, defined as cells that maintained growth following two passages, were established in 5 of 15 malignant effusions and 1 of 4 surgical specimens. One PDC, clinically refractory to TKIs, was implanted and engrafted in mice, resulting in a comparable histology to the primary tumor. The PDC-PDX model also showed similar genomic features when tested using targeted sequencing of cancer-related genes. When we examined the drug effects of the PDX model, the tumor cells showed resistance to TKIs and everolimus in vitro. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the PDC-PDX <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> we developed using malignant effusions can be a useful <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> to interrogate sensitivity to targeted agents based on genomic alterations...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> for the hyperbilirubinemia {{produced by}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} protease inhibitors has been developed. Indinavir and atazanavir produced significant hyperbilirubinemia, whereas amprenavir, the negative control, was indistinguishable from the ritonavir booster dose.

40|$|Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} difficult human malignancies to treat. Five-year survival rate of PDA patients is 7 %, and PDA is predicted to become the second leading cancer-related cause of death in the United States of America. Despite intensive efforts, the translation of findings in preclinical studies has been ineffective, due partially to the lack of <b>preclinical</b> <b>models</b> that faithfully recapitulate features of human PDA. Here we review current <b>preclinical</b> <b>models</b> for human PDA (e. g. human PDA cell lines, cell line-based xenografts and patient-derived tumor xenografts). In addition, we discuss potential applications of the recently developed pancreatic ductal organoids, three-dimensional culture systems and organoid-based xenografts as new <b>preclinical</b> <b>models</b> for PDA...|$|R
50|$|Targeting {{intratumoral}} TAMs and MDSCs {{can also}} reduce tumor burdens in <b>preclinical</b> <b>models,</b> in both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent ways. For instance, inhibiting chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in <b>preclinical</b> <b>models</b> of melanoma, pancreatic, breast, and prostatic carcinoma increased T cells and restricted tumor growth. The effect was enhanced by anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1. These studies did not {{determine whether the}} increases in T cells were a consequence of viability or replication.|$|R

40|$|Gastric cancer (GC) {{remains the}} third {{most common cause of}} cancer death worldwide, with limited {{therapeutic}} strategies available. With the advent of next-generation sequencing and new <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> technologies, our understanding of its pathogenesis and molecular alterations continues to be revolutionized. Recently, the genomic landscape of GC has been delineated. Molecular characterization and novel therapeutic targets of each molecular subtype have been identified. At the same time, patient-derived tumor xenografts and organoids now comprise effective tools for genetic evolution studies, biomarker identification, drug screening, and preclinical evaluation of personalized medicine strategies for GC patients. These advances are making it feasible to integrate clinical, genome-based and phenotype-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods and apply them to individual GCÂ patients in the era of precision medicine.

40|$|Background Efforts to {{identify}} novel therapeutic options for human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) {{have failed to}} result in a clear improvement in patient survival to date. Pancreatic cancer requires efficient therapies that must be designed and assayed in <b>preclinical</b> <b>models</b> with improved predictor ability. Among the available <b>preclinical</b> <b>models,</b> the orthotopic approach fits with this expectation, but its use is still occasional. Methods An in vivo platform of 11 orthotopic tumor xenografts has been generated by direct implantation of fresh surgical material. In addition, a frozen tumorgraft bank has been created, ensuring future model recovery and tumor tissue availability. Results Tissue microarray studies allow showing a high degree of original histology preservation and maintenance of protein expression patterns through passages. The models display stable growth kinetics and characteristic metastatic behavior. Moreover, the molecular diversity may facilitate the identification of tumor subtypes and comparison of drug responses that complement or confirm information obtained with other <b>preclinical</b> <b>models.</b> Conclusions This panel represents a useful preclinical tool for testing new agents and treatment protocols and for further exploration of the biological basis of drug responses...|$|R

30|$|For re-treatment of {{the rats}} with metastases, {{we used a}} dose of 400  MBq 177 Lu-DOTATATE, which is remarkably higher {{compared}} to the initial 125 or 275  MBq treatment doses. Still, only two out of seven rats with metastases were cured, suggesting metastases in our model to be more resistant to PRRT compared to the primary tumor. As it is quite complex to study responses of metastases in a <b>preclinical</b> <b>model,</b> there have not been many preclinical studies on therapies in metastatic models. However, {{to be able to}} get more solid information on sensitivity of metastases to PRRT in a <b>preclinical</b> <b>model,</b> certainly more studies in different models are necessary. The current CA 20948 metastatic tumor model after RAD 001 treatment could be a more realistic metastasis model for future experiments compared to often-applied metastasis tumor models in which tumor cell suspensions are injected intravenously.|$|E
30|$|Experimental {{models are}} {{essential}} {{tools in the}} development and evaluation of novel treatment options, but the <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is limited to the retrieval of (very) early functional data, leaving the pivotal long-term outcome unknown.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{therapeutic}} targets to treat organ fibrosis that are under investigation in <b>preclinical</b> <b>models.</b> There is increasing evidence that stimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) is a novel anti-fibrotic strategy and we have reviewed the published in vivo preclinical data relating to the effects of compound 21 (C 21), which is the only nonpeptide AT 2 R agonist that is currently available for use in chronic preclinical studies. In particular, the differential influence of AT 2 R on extracellular matrix status in various <b>preclinical</b> fibrotic <b>models</b> is discussed. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that pharmacological AT 2 R stimulation using C 21 decreases organ fibrosis, which has been most studied in the setting of cardiovascular and renal disease. In addition, AT 2 R-mediated anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to the beneficial AT 2 R-mediated anti-fibrotic effects seen in <b>preclinical</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aminochrome {{has been}} {{suggested}} as a more physiological <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> capable of inducing {{five of the six}} mechanisms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Until now, {{there is no evidence that}} aminochrome induces glial activation related to neuroinflammation, an important mechanism involved in the loss of dopaminergic neurons. In this study, the potential role of aminochrome on glial activation was studied in primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures and microglial primary culture from Wistar rats. We demonstrated that aminochrome induced a reduction in the number of viable cells on cultures exposed to concentration between 10 and 100 μM. Moreover, aminochrome induces neuronal death determined by Fluoro-jade B. Furthermore, we demonstrated that aminochrome induced reduction in the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons and reactive gliosis, featured by morphological changes in GFAP(+) and Iba 1 (+) cells, increase in the number of OX- 42 (+) cells and increase in the number of NF-κB p 50 immunoreactive cells. These results demonstrate aminochrome neuroinflammatory ability and support the hypothesis that it may be a better PD <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> to find new pharmacological treatment that stop the development of this disease...|$|E
40|$|For {{long-term}} {{attack on}} tumor cells {{in patients with}} prostate cancer, induction of cytolytic T cells is desirable. Several lineage-specific target proteins are known and algorithms have identified candidate MHC class I-binding peptides, particularly for HLA-A* 0201. We have designed tolerance-breaking DNA fusion vaccines incorporating a domain of tetanus toxin fused to candidate tumor-derived peptide sequences. Using three separate peptide sequences from prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) (peptides PSMA(27), PSMA(663), and PSMA(711)), this vaccine design induced high levels of CD 8 (+) T cells against each peptide in a HLA-A(*) 0201 <b>preclinical</b> <b>model.</b> In contrast, the full-length PSMA sequence containing all three epitopes was poorly immunogenic. Induced T cells were cytotoxic against peptide-loaded tumor cells, but only those against PSMA(27) or PSMA(663) peptides, and not PSMA(711), were able to kill tumor cells expressing endogenous PSMA. Cytotoxicity was also evident in vivo. The <b>preclinical</b> <b>model</b> provides {{a powerful tool for}} generating CD 8 (+) T cells able to predict whether target cells can process and present peptides, essential for planning peptide vaccine-based clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|Basic {{research}} and clinical trials are essential {{components of the}} process of discovery and development of new drugs. The use of <b>preclinical</b> <b>models</b> is a key component in every aspect of drug development in cancer. Unfortunately, <b>preclinical</b> <b>models</b> often fail to capture the diverse heterogeneity of human malignancies, and the correlation between the antitumor activity of cytotoxic agents observed in these animal models and that observed in humans is poor. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the application of <b>preclinical</b> cancer <b>models</b> which can actually recapitulate the clinical disease, including patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).
