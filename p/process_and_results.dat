25|$|As the {{temperature}} increases, an amorphous solid will become less viscous. At {{some point the}} molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This {{is known as the}} crystallization temperature (Tc). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an exothermic <b>process,</b> <b>and</b> <b>results</b> in a peak in the DSC signal. As {{the temperature}} increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (Tm). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine transition temperatures and enthalpies makes DSC a valuable tool in producing phase diagrams for various chemical systems.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David Griesinger and Steve Barbar {{developed}} LARES in 1988 {{while working}} at Lexicon, originally located in Waltham, Massachusetts. Lexicon had become respected for its digital reverberation products used for professional sound recording and concert sound reinforcement. The name LARES is an acronym of Lexicon Acoustic Reinforcement and Enhancement System. In 1989, Griesinger and Barbar, {{at the request of}} acousticians Neil Muncy and Robert Tanner, installed the first production LARES system in the Elgin Theatre in Toronto. This initial system used two microphones placed at the balcony's front edge to pick up sound from the stage. The microphone signals were treated electronically, and the resulting signals were sent to 116 loudspeakers positioned in the ceiling and under the balcony. Griesinger presented a technical paper on the concept, <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>results</b> to the Audio Engineering Society. A primary component of the electronic treatment was the addition of enough digital delay to make the enhanced loudspeaker output wave arrive at its target seating area at the same time or soon after the direct sound from the stage. Reverberation was digitally synthesized and added to the signal, and patented time variant signal processing was employed to overcome coloration from acoustic feedback between the microphones and loudspeakers. Two LARES mainframes were used, one for the 60 underbalcony speakers and one for the 56 loudspeakers in the main ceiling.|$|E

Ehrich & Rapp (2000) assume that the causative eventive chain consists of a causing <b>process</b> <b>and</b> a change-of-state event that takes the resultant state as its situational argument. Following that, I will conclude from the empirical evidence that –ment nominalizes the change-of-state event, while –age nominalizes the causing process. Furthermore, I will model the relevant –age- and –mentnominals in terms of Lieber’s (2004) conceptual structures and discuss the question whether we may assume that –ment and –age introduce different aspectual operators...|$|R

Even though the assessment leaders on campus such as assessment coordinators and department chairs understand this ultimate purpose of assessment, they often need concrete strategies to facilitate faculty collaborative work in interpreting and using assessment for program improvement. In this session, the presenter introduces how academic programs in a large research oriented university used assessment for improvement. The presenter offers concrete strategies for the program level assessment leaders to use assessment results, such as intriguing result presentation, presenting results with diagnostic information (e. g., on a curriculum map), and peer sharing of successful pedagogical strategies. In the end, the presenter provides a set of strategies with examples that illustrate how institutional-level assessment leaders can facilitate and promote use-of-results on campus. Strategies include showcasing (e. g., scholarship, awards, workshop training, map of excellence), packaging low-hanging fruit, using facilitation strategies to guide institutional committees’ actions, and building grassroots assessment leaders. Using assessment <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> <b>results</b> for program improvement is what makes program assessment meaningful.
