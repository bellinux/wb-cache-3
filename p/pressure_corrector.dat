40|$|In {{this paper}} a new finite-volume non-hydrostatic and shock-capturing {{three-dimensional}} {{model for the}} simulation of wave-structure interaction and hydrodynamic phenomena (wave refraction, diffraction, shoaling and breaking) is proposed. The model {{is based on an}} integral formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations which are solved on a time dependent coordinate system: a coordinate transformation maps the varying coordinates in the physical domain to a uniform transformed space. The equations of motion are discretized by means of a finite-volume shock-capturing numerical procedure based on high order WENO reconstructions.

The model {{is based on an}} integral formulation of the motion equations which are solved on a time dependent curvilinear coordinate system: a coordinate transformation maps the varying coordinates in the physical domain to a uniform transformed space. The motion equations are discretized by means of a shock-capturing numerical procedure based on high order WENO reconstructions. The solution procedure for the motion equations uses a five stage four order accurate Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) fractional- step method and applies a <b>pressure</b> <b>corrector</b> formulation in order to obtain a divergence-free velocity field at each stage.

40|$|Flow fields {{around an}} {{oscillating}} circular cylinder are studied by solving the incompressible Navier [...] Stokes equations in primitive variable formulation. A finite volume method with a <b>pressure</b> predictor [...] <b>corrector</b> scheme is {{used and the}} solution procedure is accelerated by a local time stepping technique. Numerical tests are carried out at the Keulegan [...] Carpenter number KC ! 20 and Reynolds number Re ! 4000. For the symmetrical flow (at either very low KC or low Re), the vorticity decaying effect is dominant in the flow field. At higher Re, the vorticity convection becomes stronger, eventually leading to {{the inception of the}} asymmetrical flow pattern. It was found that within this critical regime the artificial disturbances imposed to the flow field {{play an important role in}} determining the flow patterns: if the flow falls into the symmetrical category, it remains symmetrical even with the artificial disturbances; while if the flow falls into the unsymmetrical category, the a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} approach {{based on}} the Lattice Boltzmann and Immersed Boundary methods is proposed to tackle {{the problem of the}} interaction of moving and/or deformable slender solids with an incompressible fluid flow. The method makes use of a Cartesian uniform lattice that encompasses both the fluid and the solid domains. The deforming/moving elements are tracked through a series of Lagrangian markers that are embedded in the computational domain. Differently from classical projection methods applied to advance in time the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, the baseline Lattice Boltzmann fluid solver is free from <b>pressure</b> <b>corrector</b> step, which is known to affect the accuracy of the boundary conditions. Also, in contrast to other immersed boundary methods proposed in the literature, the proposed algorithm does not require the introduction of any empirical parameter. In the case of rigid bodies, the position of the markers delimiting the surface of an object is updated by tracking both the position of the centre of mass of the object and its rotation using Newtonʼs laws and the conservation of angular momentum. The dynamics of a flexible slender structure is determined {{as a function of the}} forces exerted by the fluid, its flexural rigidity and the tension necessary to enforce the filament inextensibility. For both rigid and deformable bodies, the instantaneous no-slip and impermeability conditions on the solid boundary are imposed via external and localised body forces which are consistently introduced into the Lattice Boltzmann equation. The validation test-cases for rigid bodies include the case of an impulsively started plate and the sedimentation of particles under gravity in a fluid initially at rest. For the case of deformable slender structures we consider the beating of both a single filament and a pair filaments induced by the interaction with an incoming uniformly streaming flow...|$|E
