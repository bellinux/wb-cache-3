25|$|With {{the basic}} need of shelter {{immediately}} settled, {{a short period}} of energetic growth and relative prosperity followed. Farmland was rented, a saw mill and flour mill opened, workshops established, and schools and a theater founded. A <b>periodical</b> <b>press</b> was launched, publishing in French, English, and German, and an office was established in Paris to recruit adherents for the American colony. The Nauvoo cultural life thrived. The Icarians held regular band concerts and theatre productions. Their library consisted of an extensive collection, ranging from reference works to applied science to popular novels, all in English and French, and totaling over 4,000 volumes. By 1855 there would be more than 500 participants in the Icarian project.|$|E

25|$|Hazlitt {{followed}} this by {{many years as}} a literary, art, and theatre critic, at which he enjoyed some success. He was subsequently beset by numerous personal problems, including a failed marriage, illness, insolvency, a disastrous love entanglement {{that led to a}} mental breakdown, and scurrilous attacks by political conservatives, many of them fueled by his indiscreet publication of Liber Amoris, a thinly disguised autobiographical account of his love affair. English society was becoming increasingly prudish, the ensuing scandal effectively destroyed his reputation, and he found it harder than ever to earn a living. He married a second time. Consequently, more than ever in need of money, he was forced to churn out article after article for the <b>periodical</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{impact of}} the {{internet}} on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated.

Her contributions were interrupted by illness, but immediately resumed and continued by an unknown hand. It was discovered that François Guizot had substituted for her. In 1812 Mademoiselle de Meulan married Guizot. She died in 1827. (An only son, born in 1819, died in 1837 of consumption.) In 1828 Guizot married Elisa Dillon, niece of his first wife, and also an author. She died in 1833, leaving two daughters (Henriette (1829-1908), a co-author with her father and prolific writer herself; and Pauline (1831-1874)) and a son (Maurice Guillaume (1833–1892), who attained some reputation as a scholar and writer).

2500|$|Hazlitt then {{reflects}} {{further on}} Lamb's taste {{in literature and}} art, his abilities as a conversationalist, and his appearance and personal character. [...] "Mr. Lamb's taste in books is not the worse for a little idiosyncrasy ... no man can give a better account of Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, or Sir Thomas Brown's [...] Urn-Burial, or Fuller's Worthies, or John Bunyan's Holy War. ... no one relishes a recondite beauty more" [...] than he. Hazlitt tempers his praise with a note of reservation: [...] "His worst fault is an over-eagerness of enthusiasm, which occasionally makes him take a surfeit of his highest favourites." [...] But then, as a conversationalist, at which he excels {{nearly as much as}} in his writing, [...] "He is as little of a proser as possible; but he blurts out the finest wit and sense in the world." [...] Hazlitt intersperses a few more thoughts on Lamb's character and notes that he [...] "is a general favourite", explaining this with the psychological observation that this is in part due to the absence of any kind of threat posed by Lamb's modest, unassuming personality, indeed by his personal shortcomings. Hazlitt also observes that such a retiring character as his might never have been noticed if not for the phenomenon of the <b>periodical</b> <b>press</b> of the day. And that led to a popularity, especially for his depictions of London, great enough that the Elia essays procured Lamb [...] "civic honours (a thing unheard of in our times), and he has been invited, in his character of Elia, to dine at a select party with the Lord Mayor." ...|$|E

40|$|Vygotsky's and Bakhtin's {{theories}} {{of social interaction}} are so general {{that they are not}} always useful guides for classroom practice. This study of secondary school classrooms in Great Britain and the United States reveals that when teachers apply similar theories to everyday practice, important pedagogical contrasts remain—both in terms {{of the ways in which}} instruction is organized and in terms of what students produce. The theories need elaborating. In everyday practice, social interaction is not binary, that is, either there is interaction or there is not. Rather, participants position themselves along a continuum of involvement—from highly involved to relatively uninvolved. Learners occupy different points within classrooms, from one classroom to another, and for the same student at different times. Also, the social space within the classroom affects student involvement and the teacher's ability to track it. This study found that in classrooms with the most highly involved interactions, students participated in curriculum making and belonged to a close-knit community. © 1995, SAGE <b>Periodicals</b> <b>Press.</b> All rights reserved...|$|R
60|$|To notice such criticisms, however, {{is giving}} them far more {{importance}} than they deserve.
