40|$|The Queensland Court of Appeal {{recently}} heard a {{case that}} raised the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> on fit injuria. By a majority of 2 : 1 the court held in Leyden v Caboolture Shire Council [2007] QCA 134 (20 April 2007) that the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> was established and defeated the action in negligence for damages for personal injury. The {{facts of the case}} were quite simple. The plaintiff was 15 years old when he was injured at the Bluebell Park which was controlled and managed by the Caboolture Shire Council (the defendant). The park had a BMX track – built and maintained by the defendant. At trial it was held that although the defendant owed a duty of care to entrants, a duty was not owed to the plaintiff. The judge found that the plaintiff was different to other entrants who used facilities provided by a council in a public park. The plaintiff was not relying upon the defendant to provide a BMX track with jumps that were reasonably safe as the evidence was that the track was regularly altered by third parties and the plaintiff knew that. Therefore it was reasoned that the plaintiff was relying upon the ability of the third parties who modified the jump and his own ability to use it, not the ability of the defendant to provide a reasonably safe track (at [10]). The trial judge also held that if a duty was owed, the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> applied so as to defeat the claim for damages. This was based upon the evidence that the plaintiff knew of the modification of the jump by third parties and knew of the risk. It was held that the plaintiff ‘had the appropriate subjective appreciation of the risk’ (at [11]) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{distance}} is typically both determined and {{constrained by the}} proximate edge of clear visibility, {{but it may be}} attenuated to a margin of which beyond hazards may reasonably be expected to spontaneously appear. The rule is the specific spatial case of the common law basic speed rule, and an application <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria. The two-second rule may be the limiting factor governing the ACDA, when the speed of forward traffic is what limits the basic safe speed, and a primary hazard of collision could result from following any closer.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that both drivers had been negligent, and that the {{negligence}} of each was equally to blame. Vorster had been volens in respect of the mechanical hazards, over which the drivers had no reasonable or immediate control; {{he had not been}} volens, however, in respect of the acts of negligence {{on the part of the}} two drivers. The court found, on the evidence, that the collision had been caused by these acts of negligence, not by any defects in the cars themselves; accordingly, the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria failed.|$|R
50|$|The defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> is now {{excluded}} {{by statute}} where a passenger was injured {{as a result}} of agreeing to take a lift from a drunk car driver. However, in a well-known case of Morris v Murray 1990 3 All ER 801 (Court <b>of</b> Appeal), <b>volenti</b> was held to apply to a drunk passenger, who accepted a lift from a drunk pilot. The pilot died in the resulting crash and the passenger who was injured, sued his estate. Although he drove the pilot to the airfield (which was closed at the time) and helped him start the engine and tune the radio, he argued that he did not freely and voluntarily consent to the risk involved in flying. The Court of Appeal held that there was consent: the passenger was not so drunk as to fail to realise the risks of taking a lift from a drunk pilot, and his actions leading up to the flight demonstrated that he voluntarily accepted those risks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} case, the {{plaintiff}} was an instructor who was injured while teaching the defendant to drive. The defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> failed: that is, because the plaintiff specifically inquired if the defendant's insurance covered him before agreeing to teach. In the second case, a doctor {{went in to}} try to rescue workmen who were caught in a well after having succumbed to noxious fumes. He did so despite being warned of the danger and told {{to wait until the}} fire brigade arrived. The doctor and the workmen all died. The court held that it would be [...] "unseemly" [...] to hold the doctor to have consented to the risk simply because he acted promptly and bravely in an attempt to save lives.|$|R
500|$|Section 2(5) of the Act {{provides}} {{that there is}} no liability for [...] "risks willingly accepted as his by the visitor", an application <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria. An occupier can also restrict or exclude liability via a notice providing warnings and conditions of entry, although under section 65 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) this cannot exclude liability for death or personal injury due to negligence where the premises are occupied for the business purposes of the occupier. Before CRA it was treated differently; in Ashdown v Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd [...] 1 QB 409 the Court of Appeal held that an occupier could exclude liability by displaying a notice disclaiming as such, even if the claimant had not read the notice. This provision of the Act has been heavily criticised by commentators.|$|R
2500|$|The trespasser's {{acceptance}} of a risk, known as the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria, is covered in Section 1(6) of the Act, which provides that [...] "no duty is owed ... to any person in respect of risks willingly accepted as his by that person". In Ratcliffe v McConnell [...] the plaintiff, who had been drinking (but was not drunk) jumped into a swimming pool marked with warning signs, suffering serious injuries after hitting the bottom. The Court of Appeal held that, because of the circumstances (jumping into an obviously shallow pool with warning signs during the winter), the plaintiff should have known of the risk and, by acting, had accepted the risk. The Law Commission had initially recommended that the Act contain provisions {{making it clear that}} a trespasser's awareness or {{acceptance of}} a warning sign was not conclusive evidence of acceptance of the risk, but this was not included.|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the impact on}} the law of negligence of a series of recent cases involving injured sports participants. In particular, it focuses on the perceived and potential influences on this are of the law of the English Court of Appeal’s decision in Caldwell v. Maguire [2001] EWCA Civ 1054. It revisits two rulings from cases involving rugby union, locating them within the context of Caldwell, before analysing the impact of the court’s decision on three more recent judging arising out of sports injuries. As a result of Caldwell there is now a requirement that courts take into account the ‘playing culture’ of a sport when determining a defendant’s liability, with the playing culture being the manner of playing the game that is accepted as reasonable by a sport’s participants. Consequently, the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria is no longer applicable to sports torts and Caldwell has introduced a variable standard of care dependent upon the level at which a game is being played within its organisational structure...|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common defense for the torts of {{trespass}} to the person is that <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria, literally, [...] "to a willing person, no injury is done", but shortened to [...] "consensual privilege" [...] or [...] "consent". If a plaintiff participates in a sporting activity in which physical contact is ordinary conduct, such as rugby, they are considered to have consented. This {{is not the case}} if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected, {{such as the use of}} hand gun during a fistfight, as in Andrepont v. Naquin, or where the injuries were suffered not from the plaintiff's participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken, as in Watson v British Boxing Board of Control Ltd. Where the plaintiff and defendant voluntarily agree to participate in a fight, some jurisdictions will deny relief in civil action, so long as the injuries caused are proportionate: [...] "in an ordinary fight with fists there is no cause of action to either of combatants for any injury suffered". Other jurisdictions refuse to recognize consent as a defense to mutual combat and instead provide relief under the doctrine of comparative negligence.|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines.

General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail.
