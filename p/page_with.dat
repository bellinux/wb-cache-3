40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the requirements and tasks in annotating existing Web <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> additional structural and semantic information. It suggests annotating existing Web <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> {{the concepts of}} a domain model, and annotating the links between the Web <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> the relations between these concepts. It also suggests explicitly representing high-level hypermedia structures, so-called hypertext composites and contexts, and annotating the corresponding composite and context <b>pages</b> <b>with</b> such structures. RDF and RDF Schema are adopted to represent the domain models and the resulting annotations. The architecture of a prototype annotation tool is outlined and corresponding requirements for automatic annotation support are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal style {{was also a}} knowing collage.

The new contract meant she also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to write more personal columns than she had done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the end of}} 2016, many rumors {{began to}} surface of a Daft Punk Alive 2017 tour.

A website that first appeared on 27 October 2016 featured a blank <b>page</b> <b>with</b> text reading Alive in plain text. Within the website coding were geo-coordinates based in Paris, Los Angeles, London, New York, Tokyo, São Paulo, Ibiza and Indio, the latter being location of Coachella. The website has since been taken down.|$|E
5|$|When Tintin in the Congo {{was first}} {{released}} by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this <b>page</b> <b>with</b> a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new <b>page</b> <b>with</b> the same name was created by other administrators, who said {{that they did not know}} what had happened to the original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley <b>Page,</b> <b>with</b> the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.|$|E

40|$|Publication 15 of {{the highly}} prestigious International Union of Crystallography {{monograph}} series is written by three well-known and highly qualified mineralogists. The contents are as follows: modular series – principles and types (126 <b>pages),</b> <b>with</b> 71 figures and 28 tables of types, OD structures (80 <b>pages),</b> <b>with</b> 52 figures and two tables, polytypes and polytype categories (20 <b>pages),</b> <b>with</b> 16 figures and one table, application of modularity to structure description and modeling (54 <b>pages),</b> <b>with</b> 36 figures and two tables, modularity at the crystal scale – twinning (28 <b>pages),</b> <b>with</b> five figures, references (52 pages), and subject index (10 pages). Scientists in different fields have used different ter-minology to describe the same phenomena. To standard-ize the terminology, this publication summarizes the ideas and data that are spread amongst the mineralogi-cal, chemical, and materials science literature. The tables provide useful lists of the homologues in the sulfosalt subkingdom, such as lillianite, pavonite and kobellite. The mineralogical literature supplies most of the examples, such as wollastonite, perovskite, mica and spinel. The 850 references span the period 1851 to 2004. More than half are 1988 or later, and most are 2001 t...|$|R
5|$|In the Book of Kells, the Chi Rho {{monogram}} {{has grown}} to consume the entire page. The letter chi dominates the <b>page</b> <b>with</b> one arm swooping across {{the majority of the}} page. The letter rho is snuggled underneath the arms of the chi. Both letters are divided into compartments which are lavishly decorated with knot work and other patterns. The background is likewise awash in a mass of swirling and knotted decoration. Within this mass of decoration are hidden animals and insects. Three angels arise from one of the cross arms of the chi. This miniature is the largest and most lavish extant Chi Rho monogram in any Insular Gospel Books and is the culmination of a tradition that started with the Book of Durrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} was bimonthly until the March 1954 issue, which {{was followed by}} April 1954, inaugurating a monthly period that ran until June 1955. This was followed by August 1955, resuming a bimonthly schedule that ran until July 1964, with only one irregularity, when the February 1959 issue was followed by July 1959. After July 1964, If ran a monthly schedule until April 1970, with three omissions: there were no issues dated September 1964, June 1969, or August 1969. From May–June 1970, the issues were bimonthly and bore the names of two months. This bimonthly sequence ran through the last issue {{at the end of}} 1974. The date the magazine printed on the cover reverted to a single month with the June 1971 issue, though the contents page still used two months to identify the issue. The volume numbering began with six issues to a volume: there were three errors on the magazine contents <b>page,</b> <b>with</b> volume 8 number 1 incorrectly printed as volume 7 number 6; volume 9 number 3 printed as volume 8 number 6; and volume 10 number 1 printed as volume 10 number 6.
