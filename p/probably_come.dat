This is the Aye formation, including spiriferida like Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Rhynchonellida as Rhynchonella pugnus and R. boloniensis, some Orthoceras, Orthis striatula or Atrypa reticularis Well-preserved feldspar and mica <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> from wind erosion under a semi-arid climate of mountains present in the Netherlands today and extending to Düsseldorf.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} chastity and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of the somewhat variant example from Sant Pere de Casseres (see below), which may be later, it is usually assumed that all the Monza-type ampullae predate the Persian sack, and <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> from the late sixth century, a few years before Theodelinda's reign. After a nearly complete gap of three centuries or so, different styles of pilgrimage souvenirs begin to appear from the 10th century, reflecting rather different pilgrimage experiences and customs.|$|E
25|$|Building {{colonies in}} space would require access to water, food, space, people, {{construction}} materials, energy, transportation, communications, life support, simulated gravity, radiation protection and capital investment. It is likely the colonies would be {{located near the}} necessary physical resources. The practice of space architecture seeks to transform spaceflight from a heroic test of human endurance to a normality {{within the bounds of}} comfortable experience. As is true of other frontier-opening endeavors, the capital investment necessary for space colonization would <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> from governments, an argument made by John Hickman and Neil deGrasse Tyson.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 2012, Game {{announced}} that he and fellow rapper Stat Quo were starting a new record label titled Rolex Records. Both artists would use the label to release new music and sign other artists. On October 1, 2013, Game announced he was officially leaving Interscope Records, {{and that he was}} now a free agent. The following day he told Artistdirect that him signing to Cash Money Records was likely, and that a final announcement of a signing would <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> in January 2014. He also stated he had talked to Kendrick Lamar, Nipsey Hussle, and Snoop Dogg about possibly doing collaboration albums in the future.|$|E

500|$|One log {{shows that}} Bamber rang Chelmsford police station—rather than the {{emergency}} number (999)—and spoke to PC Michael West {{in the information}} room. As a result West began an [...] "event log". This states that Bamber's call came in at 3.36am on 7 August 1985. The timing is important; Bamber maintains that he telephoned 10 minutes after his father phoned him. But at trial it was accepted that West had misread a digital clock, and that the call had <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> in just before 3:26am, because that was when West asked a civilian dispatcher, Malcolm Bonnett, to send a car to the scene. The car, Charlie Alpha 5, was dispatched at 3:35 am. The event log noted a call from: ...|$|E
500|$|Chevron-carved {{voussoirs}} (wedges) {{and three}} stone human heads, weathered by time and also probably from the 12th century, have been repositioned over the doorway, {{which is at}} the west end of {{the south side of the}} church. The wedges <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> from a former chancel arch and apse, removed (as in other churches in Anglesey) to make the chancel larger. The doorway has been enlarged at some point, most likely during the early part of the 19th century. On the north side, a doorway was added in the 18th century, but it was subsequently blocked and a window inserted instead. One writer has speculated that this might have been a leper niche and window. There are two other modern windows in the north wall, and all three are at different heights. There is a bellcote at the west end, housing a bell (probably from the 18th century). The roof has been described as being [...] "clearly one of the earliest on the island".|$|E
500|$|Shepseskare was a king of Ancient Egypt, {{the fourth}} or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. Egypt was unified at the time, with its capital located at Memphis. Shepseskare is the least-known king of the Fifth Dynasty as very few {{artefacts}} dating to his reign have survived to this day. Only two cylinder seals of Shepseskare are known: one, made of bronze, bears Shepseskare's Horus name and was uncovered in the ruins of Memphis in the early 20th century. The second seal, of unknown provenance, is made of black serpentine and reads [...] "Shepseskare beloved of the gods, Shepseskare beloved of Hathor". Beyond these two seals the only surviving artefacts attributable to Shepseskare are five fragments of seal impressions on clay from Abusir and six further fragments discovered in the mortuary temple and Sanctuary of the Knife of the Pyramid of Neferefre, also in Abusir. These fragments <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> from three different seals and were most likely placed on the doors of magazine rooms in the temple.|$|E

500|$|King Edward {{fell ill}} in early 1553. He {{drew up a}} document, [...] "My Devise for the Succession", whose final version of June 1553 was to settle the Crown on his Protestant cousin Lady Jane Grey, {{overturning}} the claims of his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth. Jane Grey {{was the daughter of}} Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk, a niece of Henry VIII by his younger sister Mary. On 25 May 1553 three matrimonial alliances were celebrated at Durham Place, the Dudleys' London town mansion. Two of their younger children were concerned: Guildford, aged about 17, married Lady Jane Grey, while Katherine, who was between eight and ten years old, was promised to the Earl of Huntingdon's heir, Henry Hastings. A few months later these matches came to be seen as proof of a conspiracy by the Duke of Northumberland to bring his family to the throne. At the time the marriages took place, however, their dynastical implications were not considered significant by even the most suspicious of observers, the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye. Modern historians have considered them either as part of a plot, or as [...] "routine actions of dynastic politics", in the words of David Loades. The initiative for the matches had <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> from the Marchioness of Northampton.|$|E
500|$|With {{no water}} to {{lubricate}} them, plate tectonics would very likely stop {{and the most}} visible signs of geological activity would be shield volcanoes located above mantle hotspots. In these arid conditions the planet may retain some microbial and possibly even multi-cellular life. Most of these microbes will be halophiles and life could find too refuge in the atmosphere as has been proposed {{that could have happened}} on Venus. However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 1.6 billion years and 2.8 billion years from now, with the last of them living in residual ponds of water at high latitudes and heights or in caverns with trapped ice; underground life, however, could last longer. What happens next depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a [...] "supergreenhouse" [...] state like that of the planet Venus. But as stated above without surface water, plate tectonics would <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> to a halt and most of the carbonates would remain securely buried until the Sun became a red giant and its increased luminosity heated the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide.|$|E
500|$|Accelerated Evolution {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Mike G. of Metal Maniacs called Accelerated Evolution [...] "the {{album of the}} year", praising it for [...] "the hard-to-accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy 'n' rockin' yet majestic and beautiful." [...] William Hughes of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "amazing", saying the album [...] "has elements that will appeal to fans of all different genres, from progressive to metal." [...] Alex Henderson of Allmusic called the album [...] "excellent", and praised Townsend's ability to blend genres and influences: [...] "The Canadian rocker provides enough downtuned guitars to put this CD in the alt rock category. And yet Accelerated Evolution has a big sound that suggests the pop-metal, arena rock and hard rock of the '70s and '80s – big melodies, big harmonies, big guitars, big vocals, big production." [...] Chris Hawkins of KNAC.com said, [...] "Like always, what Devin manages {{to do is take}} the most infectious rhythm, place his stamp upon it, and thus create something completely original." [...] Xander Hoose of Chronicles of Chaos compared the album favorably to SYL, noting that [...] "there is more variation, and the songs are more memorable and layered than their one-dimensional SYL counterparts." [...] Hoose added, [...] "For those who thought Terria was going too much in the wrong direction, Accelerated Evolution will <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> as a relief." ...|$|E

500|$|Jonathan O'Brien {{recommended}} {{the book in}} a review in The Sunday Business Post, but noted it focuses more on his life than an analysis of his music: [...] "If you want a meticulously researched, mind-bogglingly detailed account of his early years growing up in Belfast, his schooldays in Orangefield, his time as an unpopular member of the Olympics showband and so on, then, once again, No Surrender is heartily recommended. If, however, you're expecting a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of Morrison's music, of its textures, its surfaces – how and why it sounds {{the way it does}} – then you've <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> to the wrong place." [...] O'Brien concluded his review by writing: [...] "For all its flaws, No Surrender is a strong, absorbing biography, and never less than well written. It's just that it could potentially have been far, far better." [...] John Beck of The Press Democrat observed that the biography [...] "paints him [...] as a mercurial genius at best and a cantankerous lout on a bad day". In their 2008 book Northern Ireland After the Troubles, Colin Coulter and Michael Murray referenced the biography and stated it puts forth [...] "the view that Morrison's persona has been shaped by a specifically Ulster Protestant sensibility". Bernard Perusse of The Gazette described the earlier biography Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now as [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than Rogan's book.|$|E

2500|$|Details of {{his life}} are {{relatively}} sparse. [...] He came from west Flanders, and served as choirmaster in Bonn sometime in the earlier portion {{of his life}}. [...] By 1558 he had <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> to Italy, staying until 1562, and in 1565 he took the post of maestro di cappella at the church of San Lorenzo in Damaso, where he remained for over 40 years. [...] A note in a publication of 1596 indicates that he still held the post of choirmaster there, and was living in Rome.|$|E
2500|$|However, using {{loan words}} {{in the context of}} the {{language}} borrowing them is a markedly different situation from the study of Latin itself. In this classroom setting, instructors and students attempt to recreate at least some sense of the original pronunciation. What is taught to native anglophones is suggested by the sounds of today's Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin. Instructors who take this approach rationalize that Romance vowels <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> closer to the original pronunciation than those of any other modern language (see also the section below on [...] "Derivative languages").|$|E
2500|$|The Hierran Wolfdog {{originated}} in the Island of El Hierro, in the Canary Islands (Spain). Although its origin is still uncertain, in the 15th century dogs similar to wolves already existed in the Canary Islands, called cancha by Aboriginals. At {{the arrival of the}} Spanish conquest, the chaplains accompanying the Conquistadors wrote about the presence of [...] "wild dogs like wolves, but they are small". It is known that the Hierran Wolfdog has been present in the last two centuries and could have <b>probably</b> <b>come</b> up with the first settlers of the island. This species of dog has achieved its preference among the shepherds of the island.|$|E
