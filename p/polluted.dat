40|$|The extant {{literature}} has paid scant theoretical {{attention to the}} tripartite interaction among increasing environmental regulations, the resulting decision by a <b>polluting</b> firm to upgrade its capital stock, {{and the impact of}} innovation on this decision. Hence, the authors theoretically analyze this tripartite interaction when a <b>polluting</b> firm faces adjustment costs to upgrade its capital stock. First, they construct a dynamic model of regulation driven investment by a <b>polluting</b> firm. Second, they specify the conditions characterizing efficient investment. Third, they study the impact of an unanticipated increase in innovation on the <b>polluting</b> firm’s steady-state capital stock. Fourth, they analyze the impact of an anticipated increase in innovation on the <b>polluting</b> firm’s steady-state capital stock. Finally, the authors discuss the relationship between the <b>polluting</b> firm’s internal shadow price of capital and the stock market value of a unit of this firm’s capital...|$|R

5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{described}} as an outcaste and impure. Her association with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, considered to be <b>polluted</b> in Hindu society.

In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} two imperfectly competitive industries, with the <b>polluting</b> emissions from one industry harming {{the productivity of}} labor in the other. The <b>polluting</b> industry has to pay an environmental tax chosen by the government. In this framework, we analyze how the different organizational structure adopted by workers affect the environmental tax set by the government, total pollution emissions from the <b>polluting</b> industry and the productivity of workers in the industry that suffers the externality. We obtain that this depends on {{the degree to which}} pollution emissions from the <b>polluting</b> industry affects the marginal product of labor in the other industry. Production externality, productivity of labor, environmental taxes, imperfect competition, unionized labor. ...|$|R
