Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their <b>performances</b> <b>were</b> no {{different from those of}} film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so that it did not allow the actors to ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} board characteristics and CEO compensation on firm performance when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management. Results from regression analysis indicates that the CEO pay-performance relation is substantially lower when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management than when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> measured as reported <b>performance.</b> That <b>is,</b> {{the positive effect of}} executive compensation on firm performance disappears when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> measured as adjusted firm performance excluding earnings management in Chinese listed firms, and as a result, we can identify that the evident executive pay-performance relation is largely cosmetic. We also find that the proportion of independent directors on board is significantly positively associated with firm performance only when the firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management. Similar results are found in ownership concentration too. These results suggest that independent directors are shown as more effective governance mechanism in Chinese listed firms when true firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> considered while the positive effect of CEO compensation disappears concerning true firm performance...|$|R
