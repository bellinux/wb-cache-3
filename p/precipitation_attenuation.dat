40|$|Simple {{improvements}} in C-band weather {{radar data processing}} are performed based on radar polarimetry. The starting point is the estimation of the differential propagation phase FiDP from the measured total differential phase ??DP. The main topics are (ground) clutter removal and quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). For the former, a new test which checks some polarimetric quantities is added (as a trial) in a pre-existing clutter/non-clutter bin classification system. For the latter, three â€˜state-of-the-art' ??DP-based <b>precipitation</b> <b>attenuation</b> correction procedures are considered to correct ZH for <b>precipitation</b> <b>attenuation.</b> In addition, since the specific differential phase KDP proves {{to be a better}} rainfall rate estimator in heavy rain, some hybrid formulas R(ZH, KDP) are developed so that they result practically unbiased...|$|E

Attenuation scaling, effective path length, {{and the relationship}} between isolation and attenuation are discussed. Attenuation and effective path data are presented for the months of July, August, and September, 1977...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{for measuring}} <b>precipitation</b> <b>attenuation</b> and depolarization on the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS) 11. 7 GHz downlink is described. Attenuation and depolarization {{of the signal}} received from the spacecraft is monitored on a 24 hour basis. Data is correlated with ground weather conditions. Theoretical models for millimeter wave propagation through rain are refined for maximum agreement with observed data. Techniques are developed for predicting and mimimizing the effects of rain scatter and depolarization on future satellite communication systems...|$|E
50|$|Weather radars can {{resemble}} search radars. This radar uses {{radio waves}} along with horizontal, dual (horizontal and vertical), or circular polarization. The frequency selection of weather radar is a performance compromise between <b>precipitation</b> reflectivity and <b>attenuation</b> due to atmospheric water vapor. Some weather radars uses doppler shift to measure wind speeds and dual-polarization for identification {{of types of}} precipitations.|$|R
40|$|The strong {{fluctuation}} {{theory is}} applied {{to the study of the}} atmospheric snowfall which is modeled as a layer of random discrete-scatterers medium. As functions of size distribution, fractional volume, and radius of scatterers, the relationship is illustrated between the reflectivity factor and <b>precipitation</b> rate, the <b>attenuation</b> of the centimeter and millimeter waves, and the line-of-sight transmission of coherent and incoherent wave components. The theoretical results are shown to match favorably with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{predicting}} attenuation on microwave Earth/spacecraft communication links, over wide areas and under various atmospheric conditions, has been developed. In {{the area around}} the ground station locations, a nearly horizontally aimed polarimetric S-band ground radar measures the specific differential phase (Kdp) along the Earth-space path. The specific attenuation along a path of interest is then computed by use of a theoretical model {{of the relationship between the}} measured S-band specific differential phase and the specific attenuation at the frequency to be used on the communication link. The model includes effects of rain, wet ice, and other forms of <b>precipitation.</b> The <b>attenuation</b> on the path of interest is then computed by integrating the specific attenuation over the length of the path. This method can be used to determine statistics of signal degradation on Earth/spacecraft communication links. It can also be used to obtain real-time estimates of attenuation along multiple Earth/spacecraft links that are parts of a communication network operating within the radar coverage area, thereby enabling better management of the network through appropriate dynamic routing along the best combination of links...|$|R
40|$|The single {{terminal}} and two terminal diversity <b>precipitation</b> <b>attenuation</b> distributions are calculated for a millimeter wavelength earth-satellite propagation path. The calculated probability distributions are compared to attenuation probability distributions measured at two locations with the ATS- 5 millimeter wavelength experimental 15. 63 GHz downlink. Using an empirically derived three mode exponential cell diameter-rain rate function, the calculated distributions agreed within - 2 to + 1 db of the measured distributions for both terminal locations. The {{sensitivity of the}} calculated distribution to variations of the cell model parameters was also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Several {{possible}} {{frequency bands}} are discussed for application in PROMETHEUS and DRIVE short- and medium-range communications. This paper considers the following frequencies: 900 MHz, 2. 5 GHz, 6 GHz, 60 GHz. The aspects transmit power, transmission range, frequency reuse, bandwidth efficiency, influence of <b>precipitation,</b> <b>attenuation</b> due to obstacles, antennas and multipath fading will be discussed. Within the European PROMETHEUS research program the DLR investigates the 60 GHz link and is developping a channel model. A draft multipath propagation model is presented and compared with measurements. The probability density {{function of the}} received power shows a Rice/Rayleigh-Lognormal distribution. Simulations with measured channel data results in packet error rates {{in the order of}} 10 - 4 - 10 - 1 depending on the vehicles distance and the environment...|$|E
2500|$|The TDWRs and NEXRADs {{complement}} each other with overlapping coverage, each designed to optimally view different airspace regimes. TDWR's rapid update rate over short range (55 nmi range) captures microscale weather events quickly in terminal airspace. NEXRAD is a long range radar (200 nmi range) designed to serve multiple en route functions at high altitude, above terminal airspace, and far between terminals. NEXRAD's slower update rate covering a wider volume, captures mesoscale weather events. The shorter [...] wavelength, which {{is closer to the}} size of a raindrop than the [...] wavelength, is partially absorbed by precipitation.

When heavy rain is falling on the radome, the range of the TDWR is further limited. Finally, hail in a thunderstorm scanned by a TDWR can entirely block the signal as its size is larger than the wavelength.|$|R
40|$|Attenuation and {{reflection}} of a melting layer are calculated using a meteorological model. The model employs a new scheme for the calculation of the dielectric properties of melting ice particles with densities ranging from those of loose snow to hail, and a new scheme for calculating the melting rate is employed. The input parameters are derived from high resolution Doppler radar data and provide a data set for statistical analysis. Statistical relations were derived for attenuation in the melting layer based on measurements made with a surface rain gauge, a radar (with and without a polarisation facility), and a lower frequency satellite link. It {{was found that the}} specific attenuation of melting snow surpasses the value of rain because of the larger size and particle number density during melting, the attenuation within the melting layer increasing with its reflection. In stratiform <b>precipitation,</b> the <b>attenuation</b> in the melting layer is found to increase only slightly with frequency. The reflection in the melting layer decreases with the frequency of the radio waves {{in such a way that}} a bright band is only observed for frequencies below 20 GHz. ...|$|R

40|$|The reef {{ecosystem}} {{depends on}} healthy zooxanthellae, symbiotic microalgae {{that live in}} coral tissues. Under stressful conditions, the host corals expel the zooxanthellae in a phenomenon called bleaching. The stress can be inducted by environmental changes and results in severe impacts on coral metabolism, sometimes leading to death. The present study aims to connecting atmospheric and oceanographic data obtained from remote sensing, analysis and reanalysis, with bleaching events along the Bahia State coast and to model this relation using Bayesian networks (BN). The environmental variables are rain <b>precipitation,</b> diffuse <b>attenuation</b> coefficient at 490 nm (K 490), wind fields at sea surface and maximum sea surface temperature. The constructed BN connected bleaching events to thermal variables, resultant wind intensity and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. The BN indicates that temporal persistence of high SST values is the most influent variable on the bleaching intensity and present a predictive rate of 83 %, being capable of satisfactorily learn the bleaching conditions from data. The results from this work improve our understanding of this ecological system and present a framework from which coral bleaching can be predicted using environmental data. This has positive implications on the management, monitoring and conservation of the Brazilian reef environments. Pages: 6509 - 651...|$|R
40|$|Radar {{precipitation}} retrieval uses several {{relationships that}} parameterize precipitation properties (like rainfall rate and {{liquid water content}} and attenuation (in case of radars at attenuated frequencies such as those at C- and Xband) {{as a function of}} combinations of radar measurements. The uncertainty in such relations highly affects the uncertainty <b>precipitation</b> and <b>attenuation</b> estimates. A commonly used method to derive such relationships is to apply regression methods to precipitation measurements and radar observables simulated from datasets of drop size distributions (DSD) using microphysical and electromagnetic assumptions. DSD datasets are determined both by theoretical considerations (i. e. {{based on the assumption that}} the radar always samples raindrops whose sizes follow a gamma distribution) or from experimental measurements collected throughout the years by disdrometers. In principle, using long-term disdrometer measurements provide parameterizations more representative of a specific climatology. However, instrumental errors, specific of a disdrometer, can affect the results. In this study, different weather radar algorithms resulting from DSDs collected by diverse types of disdrometers, namely 2 D video disdrometer, first and second generation of OTT Parsivel laser disdrometer, and Thies Clima laser disdrometer, in the area of Rome (Italy) are presented and discussed to establish at what extent dual-polarization radar algorithms derived from experimental DSD datasets are influenced by the different error structure of the different type of disdrometers used to collect the data...|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{results of the}} Goddard Space Flight Center Millimeter Wave Experiment, flown aboard ATS- 6 to investigate the propagation characteristics of earth-space communications links at 20 and 30 GHz, are discussed. The spacecraft transmitters operate through spot beam (2 deg) or continental coverage (6 by 9 deg) antenna systems. The transmitted signals consist {{of a set of}} nine tones spaced out to 1440 MHz to allow measurement of wideband attenuation and coherence through precipitation. Initial data on <b>precipitation</b> depolarization and <b>attenuation</b> effects indicate that attenuation effects will exert the stronger influence on the design of frequency re-use communications systems in the 20 GHz region. The use of four ground terminals separated by 30 to 78 km to reduce the effects of rain attenuation has been successful, with improvement approaching the theoretical maximum demonstrated for five events. Preliminary results on the use of on-beam radar measurements for predicting rain attenuation are encouraging...|$|R
5000|$|Millimeter waves {{propagate}} {{solely by}} line-of-sight paths, {{they are not}} reflected by the ionosphere nor do they travel along the Earth as ground waves as lower frequency radio waves do. [...] At typical power densities they are blocked by building walls and suffer significant attenuation passing through foliage. [...] Absorption by atmospheric gases is a significant factor throughout the band and increases with frequency. However it is maximum at a few specific absorption lines, mainly those of oxygen at 60 GHz and water vapor at 24 GHz and 184 GHz. [...] At frequencies in the [...] "windows" [...] between these absorption peaks, millimeter waves have much less atmospheric attenuation and greater range, so many applications use these frequencies. Millimeter wavelengths are the same order of size as raindrops, so <b>precipitation</b> causes additional <b>attenuation</b> due to scattering (rain fade) as well as absorption. [...] The high free space loss and atmospheric absorption limits useful propagation to a few kilometers. Thus, they are useful for densely packed communications networks such as personal area networks that improve spectrum utilization through frequency reuse.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{intends to}} prove that a network of low-cost local area weather radars (LAWR) is a reliable and scientifically valuable complement to nationwide radar networks. A network of four LAWRs has been installed in northern Germany {{within the framework of}} the <b>Precipitation</b> and <b>Attenuation</b> Estimates from a High-Resolution Weather Radar Network (PATTERN) project observing precipitation with a temporal resolution of 30 s, a range resolution of 60 m and a sampling resolution of 1 ° in the azimuthal direction. The network covers an area of 60 km × 80 km. In this paper, algorithms used to obtain undisturbed precipitation fields from raw reflectivity data are described, and their performance is analysed. In order to correct operationally for background noise in reflectivity measurements, noise level estimates from the measured reflectivity field are combined with noise levels from the last 10 time steps. For detection of non-meteorological echoes, two different kinds of clutter algorithms are applied: single-radar algorithms and network-based algorithms. Besides well-established algorithms based on the texture of the logarithmic reflectivity field (TDBZ) or sign changes in the reflectivity gradient (SPIN), the advantage of the unique features of the high temporal and spatial resolution of the network is used for clutter detection. Overall, the network-based clutter algorithm works best with a detection rate of up to 70 %, followed by the classic TDBZ filter using the texture of the logarithmic reflectivity field. A comparison of a reflectivity field from the PATTERN network with the product from a C-band radar operated by the German Meteorological Service indicates high spatial accordance of both systems in the geographical position of the rain event as well as reflectivity maxima. Long-term statistics from May to September 2013 prove very good accordance of the X-band radar of the network with C-band radar, but, especially at the border of precipitation events, higher-resolved X-band radar measurements provide more detailed information on precipitation structure because the 1 km range gate of C-band radars is only partially covered with rain. The standard deviation within a range gate of the C-band radar with a range resolution of 1 km is up to 3 dBZ at the borders of rain events. The probability of detection is at least 90 %, the false alarm ratio less than 10 % for both systems. Therefore, a network of high-resolution low-cost LAWRs can give valuable information on the small-scale structure of rain events in areas of special interest, e. g. urban regions, in addition to the nationwide radar networks...|$|R
