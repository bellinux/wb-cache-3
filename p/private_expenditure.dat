Over 300 buildings were upgraded, leading to <b>private</b> <b>expenditure</b> of over £6million.

A housing association converted a warehouse in St Paul's Square into flats. Anvic House was refurbished into workshops whilst one firm converted their premises into an advertising agency.

25|$|Brazil is {{a country}} with highly diverse levels of {{development}} across its 27 states. The southern and southeastern regions show a much higher level of industrialization and scientific development than the northern ones, some of which encroach on the Amazonian forest and river basin. The centre-west is Brazil’s agricultural and cattle-raising powerhouse and has been developing rapidly recently. The starkest example of this contrast is the southeastern State of São Paulo. Home to 22% (44 million) of the country’s 202 million inhabitants, it generates about 32% of GDP and a similar share of the nation’s industrial output.

Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951–52 to 2.31% in 1970–71 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000–01. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004–05. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000–2001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget.

60|$|Now I {{want to get}} {{first at}} some, I do not say approximate, but at all events some suggestive, {{estimate}} of the quantity of real distress and misguided life in this country. Then next, I want some fairly representative estimate of our <b>private</b> <b>expenditure</b> in luxuries. We won't spend more, publicly, it appears, than eight hundred thousand a year, on educating men gratis. I want to know, as nearly as possible, what we spend privately a year, in educating horses gratis. Let us, at least, quit ourselves in this from the taunt of Rabshakeh, and see that for every horse we train also a horseman; and that the rider {{be at least as}} high-bred as the horse, not jockey, but chevalier. Again, we spend eight hundred thousand, which is certainly a great deal of money, in making rough minds bright. I want to know how much we spend annually in making rough stones bright; that is to say, what may be the united annual sum, or near it, of our jewellers' bills. So much we pay for educating children gratis;--how much for educating diamonds gratis? and which pays best for brightening, the spirit or the charcoal? Let us get those two items set down with some sincerity, and a few more of the same kind. Publicly set down. We must not be ashamed of the way we spend our money. If our right hand is not to know what our left does, it must not be because it would be ashamed if it did.|$|E
60|$|But I do {{not believe}} that the {{question}} of expenditure has had anything to do with it. I conceive it to be true that the railways are afraid to put themselves at variance with the general feeling of the people. If so, the railways may be right. But then, on the other band, the general feeling of the people must in such case be wrong. Such a feeling argues a total mistake as to the nature of that liberty and equality for the security of which the people are so anxious, and that mistake the very one which has made shipwreck so many attempts at freedom in other countries. It argues that confusion between social and political equality which has led astray multitudes who have longed for liberty fervently, but who have not thought of it carefully. If a first-class railway carriage should be held as offensive, so should a first-class house, or a first-class horse, or a first-class dinner. But first- class houses, first-class horses, and first-class dinners are very rife in America. Of course it may be said that the expenditure shown in these last-named objects is <b>private</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and cannot be controlled; and that railway traveling is of a public nature, and can be made subject to public opinion. But the fault is in that public opinion which desires to control matters of this nature. Such an arrangement partakes of all the vice of a sumptuary law, and sumptuary laws are in their very essence mistakes. It is well that a man should always have all for which he is willing to pay. If he desires and obtains more than is good for him, the punishment, and thus also the preventive, will come from other sources.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the time-series behaviour of <b>private</b> health <b>expenditure</b> and GDP {{to understand}} {{whether there is}} long-term equilibrium relationship between these two variables and estimate income elasticity of <b>private</b> health <b>expenditure.</b> The study uses cointegration analysis with structural breaks and estimates these relationships using FM OLS (fully modified ordinary least squares) method. The findings suggest that income elasticity of <b>private</b> health <b>expenditures</b> is 1. 95 indicating that for every one per cent increase in per capita income the <b>private</b> health <b>expenditure</b> has gone up by 1. 95 per cent. The <b>private</b> health <b>expenditure</b> was 2. 4 per cent of GDP in 1960 and this has risen to 5. 8 per cent in 2003. In nominal terms it has grown {{at the rate of}} 11. 3 per cent since 1960 and during 1990 ’s the growth rate is 18 per cent per annum. The study discusses four reasons for this high growth experience. These are: (i) financing mechanisms including provider payment system, (ii) demographic trends and epidemiological transition, (iii) production function of private health services delivery system, and (iv) dwindling financing support to public health system. In developing countries where per se the need for spending on health is high, high levels of <b>private</b> health <b>expenditures</b> pose serious challenge to policy makers. The sheer size of these expenditures once it has risen to high levels can impede control of health expenditures itself. The high <b>private</b> health <b>expenditures</b> are also cause of concern because most of these expenditures are out-of-pocket, insurance mechanisms cover small segment of population, provider payment systems are primarily based on fee-for-services and the professional regulation and accountability systems are weak and non-functioning in many ways. It is not clear whether these expenditures are sustainable as it can have number of undesirable consequences making the health system high cost, unaffordable, and vulnerable to provider payment system. ...|$|R
