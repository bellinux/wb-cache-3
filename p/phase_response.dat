This document {{may serve as a}} support tool for states as they develop a <b>phased</b> <b>response</b> to Zika virus in their jurisdictions. Guidelines for a <b>Phased</b> <b>Response</b> to Zika Virus: The objective of a <b>phased,</b> risk-based <b>response</b> using Zika virus surveillance data is to implement public health interventions appropriate to the level of Zika virus risk in a community, county, or state. An effective arboviral illness surveillance program and diagnostic testing algorithm that includes testing for Zika virus infection must be in place to recommend a <b>phased</b> <b>response.</b> Effective public health actions depend on interpreting the best available surveillance data and initiating prompt and aggressive intervention when necessary. zika-action-plan_ 3 - 10 - 16. pd...|$|R
25|$|One {{treatment}} {{strategy is}} light therapy (phototherapy), {{with either a}} full-spectrum lamp providing 10,000 lux at a specified distance from the eyes or a wearable LED device providing 350–550 lux at a shorter distance. Sunlight can also be used. The light is typically timed for 30–90 minutes at the patient's usual time of spontaneous awakening, or shortly before (but not long before), which is {{in accordance with the}} <b>phase</b> <b>response</b> curve (PRC) for light. Only experimentation, preferably with specialist help, will show how great an advance is possible and comfortable. For maintenance, some patients must continue the treatment indefinitely; some may reduce the daily treatment to 15 minutes; others may use the lamp, for example, just a few days a week or just every third week. Whether the treatment is successful is highly individual. Light therapy generally requires adding some extra time to the patient's morning routine. Patients with a family history of macular degeneration are advised to consult with an eye doctor. The use of exogenous melatonin administration (see below) in conjunction with light therapy is common.|$|E

40|$|Liquids {{have been}} shown to have a low satiating efficiency. The {{may be related to the}} high rate of {{consumption}} for liquids which may be higher than 200 g/min. In a number of studies, we showed that the positive relationship between eating rate and energy intake is mediated by oro-sensory exposure time. Longer sensory exposure times are consistently associated with lower food intakes. This observation maybe linked to the role of cephalic <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> to foods. Cephalic <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> are a set of physiological responses, which are conceived to prepare the digestive system for the incoming flow of nutrients after ingestion, with the aim of maintaining homeostasis. Results from various studies suggest that cephalic <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> are much smaller (absent) for liquids compared to solids. It is hypothesised that the absence of cephalic <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> to liquid foods may be one of the causes why liquid energies enter the body undetected and lead to weak energy intake compensation. This idea fits with the concept of the taste system as a nutrient-sensing system that informs the brain and the gastro-intestinal system about what is coming into our body. With liquids, this system is bypassed. Slower eating may help the human body to associate the sensory signals from food with their metabolic consequences. Foods that are eaten quickly may impair this association, and may therefore lead to overconsumption of energy, and ultimately to weight gain...|$|R
40|$|Tick bites may trigger acute <b>phase</b> <b>responses.</b> Positive and {{negative}} acute phase proteins were measured in infested cattle genetically resistant and susceptible to ticks. During heavier infestations levels of haptoglobin increased significantly in susceptible bovines; levels of serum amyloid A increased in resistant bovines; levels of alpha-l-acid glycoprotein decreased significantly in resistant bovines; levels of transferrin decreased significantly in susceptible bovines. In conclusion, tick infestations trigger acute <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> and enhancement of specific acute phase proteins differs {{according to the}} genetic composition of hosts. Acute phase proteins may constitute useful biological signatures for monitoring the stress induced by tick infestations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|Melatonin {{taken an}} hour or so before the usual bedtime may induce sleepiness.

In accordance with its <b>phase</b> <b>response</b> curve (PRC), a very small dose of melatonin can also, or instead, be taken some hours earlier as an aid to resetting the body clock; it must then be small enough not to induce excessive sleepiness.|$|E
2500|$|Masters and Johnson {{argued that}} all women are {{potentially}} multiply orgasmic, but that multiply orgasmic men are rare, {{and stated that}} [...] "the female is capable of rapid return to orgasm immediately following an orgasmic experience, if restimulated before tensions have dropped below plateau <b>phase</b> <b>response</b> levels". Though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first one, some sources state that {{both men and women}} experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. After the initial orgasm, subsequent orgasms for women may be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates.|$|E
50|$|All-pass {{networks}} have a constant gain with frequency, {{but they have}} a <b>phase</b> <b>response</b> which varies in some chosen manner.

40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to {{elevated levels of}} glucocorticoids leads to metabolic dysfunctions with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Long-term treatment with glucocorticoids induces severe impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We analyzed the effects of short-, and medium-term (2 - 120 h) treatment with 50 - 200 nM glucocorticoids on primary pancreatic islet cultures derived from lean C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. In contrast to animal models of insulin resistance, beta-cells from lean mice respond with an increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, with a peak effect around 18 - 24 h of treatment. Analyses of the insulin secretion response reveal that early and late <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> are dissociated upon glucocorticoid treatment. Whereas late <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> return to basal levels after long treatment, early <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> remain increased over several days. Increased insulin secretion is also obtained by incubation with the inactive glucocorticoid dehydrocorticosterone, pointing to an important role of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in mediating glucocorticoid effects in beta-cells. Transcript profiling revealed differential regulation of genes involved in mediation of signal transduction, insulin secretion, stress and inflammatory responses. The results show that short- to medium-term glucocorticoid treatment of pancreatic islets derived from lean mice leads to an increased insulin release and may constitute an important parameter in changing towards a pro-diabetic phenotype...|$|R

Further, new designs of recursive digital integrators are obtained by inverting the transfer functions of designed recursive digital differentiators with suitable modifications. Thereafter, the zero-reflection approach is discussed and then applied to improve the <b>phase</b> <b>responses</b> of designed recursive digital differentiators and integrators.
