40|$|Depending on its {{underlying}} <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of application, citizenship law can impact on territorial borders in varying ways, ranging from their reinforcement to their active subversion. In this paper I develop a schema of possible relationships between borders <b>and</b> four common <b>principles</b> of citizenship {{with the aim}} of assessing their compatibility. I then apply this schema to pre- 1998 Irish citizenship law to illustrate an instance of subversion of a territorial border. While highly distinctive in Europe, the formerly irredentist nature of Irish citizenship law calls attention to the potential for conflict between certain citizenship criteria and territorial boundaries, a potential which has increased in recent decades with the reform of citizenship regimes in Central and Eastern Europe...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{industrial}} communication {{networks are}} increasingly based on open protocols and platforms {{that are also}} used in the office IT and Internet environment. This reuse facilitates development and deployment of highly connected systems, but also makes the communication system vulnerable to electronic attacks. This paper gives an overview of IT security issues in industrial automation systems {{which are based on}} open communication systems. First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols. Finally, we illustrate the application of security concepts and tools by brief case studies describing security issues in the configuration and operation of substations, plants, or for remote access. Keywords—Cryptography, embedded systems, industrial automation, industrial communication systems, remote access, security objectives, security protocols, security standards...|$|R

Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, a modern Muslim scholar who was an expert in both Islamic philosophy and Qur'anic interpretation, developed new approaches to such issues as the role of human rational ability, logic and philosophy in religious knowledge. Furthermore he deals with such specific controversial topics on the subject of revelation and reason as, social freedom and freedom of thought and belief in Islam. He tends to elaborate his view of freedom based on both the Qur'an and rational bases.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the current curriculum for primary schools in South Africa – Curriculum 2005 (C 2005) {{and the subsequent}} Revised National Curriculum Statement (RNCS), with Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) as its fundamental educational approach - with specific reference {{to the place of}} music education in it. While the underlying <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> <b>scope</b> of this curriculum has many positive attributes, numerous studies have shown that there are still major stumbling blocks in the way of its successful implementation. Since the emphasis of the Arts and Culture Learning Area is on the nurturing of generic values and attitudes towards culture, it does not provide for sufficient development of subject-specific musical skills and knowledge. Instead this vital form of musical learning continues to be provided in the form of extra-curricular music programmes by those few schools who have the staff expertise and the funding to do so. Music therefore remains accessible only to the privileged few.. Although C 2005 encourages and requires significant levels of integration in Learning Outcomes and Assessment Standards within and across Learning Areas, this is currently one of the least successful aspects of its implementation. This lack of success, it is argued, is in part the result of severe limitations in the training of teachers and the availability of necessary resources in schools, and in part the result of the curriculum’s own limited interpretation of integration. Psychologist Dr Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences is a holistic approach to education that stresses, amongst other things, that Musical Intelligence is one of eight vital forms of intelligence that should be accessible to all children. It is argued that educational approaches based on Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences Theory provide some insights into the integration of Musical Intelligence with other forms of learning that may usefully be applied in C 200...|$|R

30|$|Down-hole {{tubular string}} {{buckling}} {{is the most}} classic and complex part of tubular string mechanics in well engineering. Studies of down-hole tubular string buckling not only have theoretical significance in revealing the buckling mechanism but also have prominent practical value in design and control of tubular strings. In this review, the basic <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> applicable <b>scope</b> of three classic research methods (the beam-column model, buckling differential equation, and energy method) are introduced. The critical buckling loads and the post-buckling behavior under different buckling modes in vertical, inclined, horizontal, and curved wellbores from different researchers are presented and compared. The current understanding {{of the effects of}} torque, boundary conditions, friction force, and connectors on down-hole tubular string buckling is illustrated. Meanwhile, some unsolved problems and controversial conclusions are discussed. Future research should be focused on sophisticated description of buckling behavior and the coupling effect of multiple factors. In addition, active control of down-hole tubular string buckling behavior needs some attention urgently.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{principles}} of agile development emerge as potential solutions to numerous design problems of software development. In this context, this paper aims {{to identify and}} analyze the profile of Brazilian software producers {{regarding the use of}} agile <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> their potential to achieve success in producing software. This is a quantitative study made with professionals from the software industry. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using technical descriptive analysis, factor analysis and cluster analysis. Based on the categorization of factors, three software organizations profiles have been obtained regarding the use of agile <b>principles</b> <b>and</b> the <b>scope</b> of success in producing software. The implications of this study are that organizations with the highest success rates in software are the same as those that have higher rates for capacity in terms of team, culture, communication with the client, environmental configuration and relationships with external partners. Organizations that used agile software development principles achieved success in software development, but it cannot be said that the use of agile principles alone can guarantee the achievement of such success in software development. Additionally, relationships with external partners, although not contemplated in the related studies investigated, was shown to be a critical factor for success in software development and, therefore, relevant to the agile software development field. In conclusion, this study is relevant because it helps to improve our understanding of the use of agile principles in the development of software <b>and</b> whether these <b>principles</b> are associated with obtaining success in software production; therefore, it explores a new factor that has not been observed previously...|$|R
