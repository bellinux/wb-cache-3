40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{evidence that}} the Martian climate undergoes quasi-periodic variations, including the polar layered terrain, differences between the residual polar caps, and the current net southward flow of H 2 O. The driving functions for these variations are oscillations in {{the elements of the}} Martian orbit coupled with precession of the Martian spin axis. These 'astronomic variations' control the distribution of the insolation, which in turn influences the partition of volatiles between atmospheric and surface reservoirs. The major effects anticipated at low obliquity are growth of the polar caps, substantial decrease in surface pressure, cessation of duststorms, release of CO 2 from the regolith, and poleward migration of H 2 O ground ice. At high obliquity, the mass of the perennial polar caps decreases and <b>permanent</b> CO 2 <b>frost</b> disappears, CO 2 desorbs from the regolith at high latitudes, the surface pressure may increase to several times its current value, and the atmospheric dust load increases...|$|R
40|$|The Infrared Thermal Mappers {{aboard the}} two Viking orbiters {{obtained}} solar reflectance and infrared emission {{measurements of the}} Martian north and south polar regions during an entire Mars year. The observations {{were used to determine}} annual radiation budgets, infer annual carbon dioxide frost budgets, and constrain spring season surface and atmospheric properties {{with the aid of a}} polar radiative model. The results provide further confirmation of the presence of <b>permanent</b> CO_ 2 <b>frost</b> deposits near the south pole and show that the stability of these deposits can be explained by their high reflectivities. In the north, the observed absence of solid CO_ 2 during summer was primarily the result of enhanced CO_ 2 sublimation rates due to lower frost reflectivities during spring. The results suggest that the present asymmetric behavior of CO_ 2 frost at the Martian poles is caused by preferential contamination of the north seasonal polar cap by atmospheric dust...|$|R
40|$|A thermal model, {{developed}} to predict seasonal nitrogen cycles on Triton, has been modified {{and applied to}} Pluto. The model was {{used to calculate the}} partitioning of nitrogen between surface frost deposits and the atmosphere, as a function of time for various sets of input parameters. Volatile transport was confirmed to {{have a significant effect on}} Pluto's climate as nitrogen moved around on a seasonal time scale between hemispheres, and sublimed into and condensed out of the atmosphere. Pluto's high obliquity was found to have a significant effect on the distribution of frost on its surface. Conditions that would lead to permanent polar caps on Triton were found to lead to <b>permanent</b> zonal <b>frost</b> bands on Pluto. In some instances, frost sublimed from the middle of a seasonal cap outward, resulting in a "polar bald spot". Frost which was darker than the substrate did not satisfy observables on Pluto, in contrast to our findings for Triton. Bright frost (brighter than the substrate) came closer to matching observables. Atmospheric pressure varied seasonally. The amplitudes, and to a lesser extent the phase, of the variation depended significantly on frost and substrate properties. Atmospheric pressure was found to be determined both by Pluto's distance from the sun and by the subsolar latitude. In most cases two peaks in atmospheric pressure were observed annually: a greater one associated with the sublimation of the north polar cap just as Pluto receded from perihelion, and a lesser one associated with the sublimation of the south polar cap as Pluto approached perihelion. Our model predicted frost-free dark substrate surface temperatures in the 50 to 60 K range, while frost temperatures typically ranged between 30 to 40 K. Temporal changes in frost coverage illustrated by our results, and changes in the viewing geometry of Pluto from the Earth, may be important for interpretation of ground-based measurements of Pluto's thermal emission...|$|R
40|$|Extract] The {{region known}} as coastal Far North Queensland extends from Cooktown {{in the north}} to Cardwell in the south. The narrow coastal plain varies between 20 and 50 {{kilometres}} and is flanked by a continuous line of ranges, including some of Queensland's highest mountains (e. g. Mt Bellenden Ker; Mt Bartle Frere). This region is characterized by high average annual rainfall (in excess of 2, 000 mm in some localities), warm maximum daily temperatures {{for most of the}} year (i. e. above 20 ° C) and an absence of <b>frost.</b> <b>Permanent</b> rivers, the Bloomfield, Daintree, Mossman, Barron, Mulgrave, Johnstone, Murray and Tully, and their tributaries, have carved deep gorges through the ranges. Patches of fertile alluvium had formed along the banks of these rivers as they meander across the narrow coastal plain. Before European settlement, the flood plains and ranges were thickly covered with vine forests (commonly known as tropical rainforest). 1 During the 1860 s, the majority of the first Europeans who penetrated this region were bêche-de-mer fishers and prospectors, not agriculturalists in search of fertile land. An attempt during the late 1860 s by John E. Davidson to establish a sugar plantation on the Murray River, between Cardwell and present-day Tully, had failed by 1875 due to repeated flooding of the property and attacks from Aborigines? Interest in the possibilities of tropical agriculture in Far North Queensland, particularly the cultivation of sugar cane, resurfaced in the mid- 1870 s. Two factors combined to stimulate this interest, especially from investors located in southern Australia. First, demand for sugar in the Australian colonies was increasing rapidly, and the already established sugar-producing regions in northern New South Wales and other parts of Queensland were unable to produce enough sugar to satisfy demand. 3 Second, the area was explored more effectively. In late 1873, the Queensland government funded an expedition to assess the resources of the colony's northeast coast. Leadership was entrusted to George Dalrymple, explorer and former Commissioner for Crown Lands, Kennedy District (1861 - 63). His investigations of the country between Cardwell and the Endeavour River (site of today's Cooktown) resulted in the discovery of several fertile coastal valleys which he considered were fit to be cultivated with sugar cane. Dalrymple advocated the immediate throwing open to selection of the agricultural lands along these river valleys. ...|$|R
