30|$|Epigeic species {{observed}} 18 % and 10 % in <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> <b>and</b> agricultural land, respectively. The anecic species noticed 23 % and 15 % in <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> <b>and</b> agricultural land, respectively. The {{distribution of}} the different ecological categories of earthworms in arable land <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>grasslands</b> showed a preference of endogeic species, as soil dwellers with horizontal burrows. However, the numbers of endogeic species was found higher in grasslands than in agricultural land. Particularly in grasslands, the correlation between earthworm characteristics (earthworm density and distribution) and soil physico-chemical properties {{was not so much}} (Table  4). These are usually much abundant in grassland in comparison with in agricultural land, which is probably due to number of factors among which lesser availability of food and regular soil tillage in agricultural lands {{may be the most important}} causes (e.g., Barley, 1961; Boag, Palmer, Neilson, Legg, & Chambers, 1997; Edwards & Bohlen, 1996; Edwards & Lofty, 1979; Evans & Guild, 1948; Tischler, 1955; Zicsi, 1969) An exception to this is the position of the abundance of epigeic species, located close to that of Lumbricus rubellus, reflecting the dominance of this species in this ecological group. This may be regarded as an indication that the management type is important in determining the abundance in which earthworm populations occur. In particular, the higher amount of soil organic matter in <b>grassland</b> farms, <b>and</b> the less intensive soil cultivation may be decisive in this respect. The porosity of the upper layers decreased when the land used for pasturage particularly.|$|R
