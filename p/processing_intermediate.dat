40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{processing}} of tomato fruit polygalacturonase (PG) (poly[1, 4 -α-d-galacturonide]glucanohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 15) was studied. Complete chemical deglycosylation of {{a mixture of}} mature, purified PG 2 A and PG 2 B isozymes (45 and 46 kilodaltons; respectively) with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid yielded a single polypeptide of 42 kilodaltons. Similarly, N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the PG 2 A/ 2 B isozyme mixture yielded a single 21 amino acid N-terminal sequence, suggesting that the two isozymes result from differential post-translational processing of a single polypeptide. Translation of PG mRNA in vitro results in the synthesis of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 54 kilodaltons. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a full-length PG cDNA clone indicates that the large size difference between the PG in vitro translation product and the mature isozymes {{is due to the}} presence of a 71 amino acid (8. 2 kilodaltons) domain at the N-terminus of in vitro translated PG, consisting of a hydrophobic signal sequence followed by a highly charged prosequence. To determine the precise cleavage site of the signal sequence, PG mRNA was translated in vitro in the presence of canine pancreas microsomal membranes. This resulted in the production of two glycosylated PG <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> with apparent molecular weights of 58 and 61 kilodaltons. The PG <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> were shown to be sequestered within the lumen of the microsomal membranes by protease protection and centrifugational analysis. Deglycosylation of the PG <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> with endoglycosidase H yielded a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 54 kilodaltons. The production of two distinct, glycosylated <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> from the single in vitro translated PG polypeptide suggests a mechanism by which the differential glycosylation observed for the mature PG 2 A and PG 2 B isozymes may occur. Edman degradation of 3 H-labeled 58 and 61 kilodalton PG <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> indicates that the site of signal sequence cleavage is after amino acid 24 (serine). These results suggest that the proteolytic processing of PG occurs in at least two steps, the first being the co-translational removal of the 24 amino acid signal sequence and the second being the presumed post-translational removal of the remaining highly charged 47 amino acid prosequence...|$|R

Several {{recent studies have shown}} that Pat 1 can enter the nucleus and can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. As a result, many nuclear roles have been proposed for Pat 1. In this study, we analyzed four previously suggested nuclear roles of Pat 1 and show that Pat 1 is not required for efficient pre-mRNA splicing or pre-mRNA decay in yeast. However, lack of Pat 1 results in accumulation of pre-rRNA <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates.</b> Intriguingly, we identified a novel genetic relationship between Pat 1 and the rRNA decay machinery, specifically the exosome and the TRAMP complex. While the pre-rRNA <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> that accumulate in the pat 1 deletion mutant are, at least to some extent, recognized as aberrant by the rRNA degradation machinery, it is unlikely that these accumulations are the cause of their synthetic sick relationship. Here, we show that the dysregulation of the levels of mRNAs related to ribosome biogenesis could be the cause of the accumulation of the pre-rRNA <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates.</b> Although our results support a role for Pat 1 in transcription, they nevertheless suggest that the primary cause of the dysregulated mRNA levels is most likely due to Pat 1 's role in mRNA decapping and mRNA degradation...|$|R

In the experiments reported here, antisera produced against synthetic peptides were used in conjunction with chemical protein cleavage to examine the structural relationship of these proteins in more detail. Results of these experiments verify that the carboxyl end of the 39 -kDa assembly protein precursor is lost during maturation and suggest that the 38 -kDa protein may be a <b>processing</b> <b>intermediate.</b> It is shown that the 45 -kDa protein is coterminal with the mature assembly protein at its carboxyl end but differs by a predicted 115 -amino-acid extension at its amino terminus.

The diurnal {{rhythm of the}} hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis also involves the periodic excursion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels in plasma, {{but it is not}} clear whether the diurnal release is accompanied by changes at the transcriptional level. In the present study, we have initially characterized the heteronuclear species of POMC (hnPOMC) RNA found in the anterior pituitary by a Northern blot analysis and subsequently used this method to quantitate relative changes in the levels of heteronuclear transcript during diurnal stimulation. Two species of RNA migrating at 6. 0 kb and 4. 1 kb were found in the nuclear fraction of the anterior pituitary. Successive probing by various POMC cRNAs indicated that the 6. 0 kb fragment was the primary transcript and the 4. 1 kb fragment corresponded to the intron A-containing <b>processing</b> <b>intermediate</b> of POMC. The nuclear species were quantitated after acute swim stress and during the diurnal ACTH secretion. Acute swim increased plasma ACTH levels by 243 % after 30 min.

The tissue concentration of carboxyamidated (i. e. bioactive) gastrin was only slightly reduced (601 ± 28 pmol/g in fat/fat mice vs. 715 ± 43 pmol/g in wild-type controls). However, progastrin <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> accumulated excessively with an 86 -fold increase in the concentration of the CPE substrate, glycyl-arginine extended gastrin, and a seven-fold increase in the concentration of glycine-extended gastrin. Accordingly, the total progastrin product was doubled, as was the concentration of gastrin mRNA. Plasma concentrations of carboxyamidated gastrin were, however slightly reduced both in fasted fat/fat mice and postprandially. The results show that the CPE mutation diminishes the efficiency of progastrin processing, but gastrin synthesis is nevertheless increased to maintain an almost normal production of bioactive gastrins. By comparison with other neuroendocrine prohormones, progastrin processing in CPE-deficient mice is unique. Hence, the increase of glycine-extended gastrin in combination with normal levels of carboxyamidated gastrin suggests that G-cells may have another biosynthetic pathway for gastrin...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of human mitochondrial RNA turnover and surveillance {{is still a}} matter of debate. We have obtained a cellular model for studying the role of hSuv 3 p helicase in human mitochondria. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of the hSUV 3 gene which encodes a protein with no ATPase or helicase activity results in perturbations of mtRNA metabolism and enables to study the <b>processing</b> and degradation <b>intermediates</b> which otherwise are difficult to detect because of their short half-lives. The hSuv 3 p activity {{was found to be}} necessary in the regulation of stability of mature, properly formed mRNAs and for removal of the noncoding <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> transcribed from both H and L-strands, including mirror RNAs which represent antisense RNAs transcribed from the opposite DNA strand. Lack of hSuv 3 p function also resulted in accumulation of aberrant RNA species, molecules with extended poly(A) tails and degradation intermediates truncated predominantly at their 3 ′-ends. Moreover, we present data indicating that hSuv 3 p co-purifies with PNPase; this may suggest participation of both proteins in mtRNA metabolism...|$|R
40|$|A cloned 16 S rRNA gene {{from the}} extreme {{thermophilic}} eubacterium Thermus thermophilus HB 8 {{was used to}} characterize the in vivo expression of the 16 S rRNA genes in this organism by nuclease S 1 mapping. The gene represents an isolated transcription unit encoding solely 16 S rRNA. Under exponential growth conditions, transcription was initiated at a single promoter, which represents the structural equivalent of Escherichia coli rrn P 2 promoters. The promoter-leader region was {{very similar to the}} E. coli rrn P 2 promoter-leader segment that is responsible for antitermination. The T. thermophilus leader region was approximately 85 nucleotides shorter than its E. coli P 2 counterpart. Potential <b>processing</b> <b>intermediates</b> were correlated with a proposed secondary structure of T. thermophilus pre- 16 S rRNA...|$|R
