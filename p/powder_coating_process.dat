40|$|In {{the course}} of an {{increasing}} employment of <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology, the complex interrelations in the powder application, mainly the particle size distribution and its influence, must be understood. For that, in the first part a new measuring method had to be developed, to make visible the problematics and in the next part to find a solution for it. This includes: the monitoring of the process control parameters (powder mass flow rate, particle size distribution, electrostatics, air flow and climate), {{the development of a new}} testing method for powder spray systems, the development of a simulation method to predict the recycling behaviour (KAP-SIM-method), the employment of a newly developed charge spectrometer for <b>coating</b> <b>powder.</b> With the aim of these methods in the experimental optimization measures the following process parameters were taken into consideration: particle size spectrum of <b>coating</b> <b>powder,</b> <b>coating</b> <b>powder</b> recovery method and the distribution nozzles of the spray systems. For an increasing and efficient use of <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> systems in the future, the users demand more flexible powder spray guns. That means powder guns with which the dimensions of the spray cloud may be shaped continuously. The present thesis was aimed at realizing such powder spray systems in form of powder spray guns using aerodynamical and electrostatical solution approaches. Two completely different solutions were separately realized. On the field of electrostatics mainly the influence of steering electrodes was tested. In combination with tribo charging powder this electrodes are very effective. On the other hand, a new pistol could be dimensioned and optimized with the help of numerical simulation. The continuous regulation of the spray cloud was realized with additional controlling airs. In the future, the simulation will be an important tool in the investigation of complex <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> <b>processes.</b> In the development of such systems the simulation will be used more and more. With it, the development time of the product is reduced. Therein the powder guns are only one part in the <b>coating</b> <b>process.</b> In the future, not only powder applicators will be simulated on the computer but also whole <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> and <b>coating</b> lines...|$|R

[...] For such {{powder coatings}}, film build-ups of greater than 50 μ (Microns) may be required to obtain an acceptably smooth film. The surface texture which is considered desirable or acceptable depends on the end product. Many manufacturers actually prefer to have a certain degree of orange peel since it helps to hide metal defects that have occurred during manufacture, and the resulting coating is less prone to showing fingerprints.There are very specialized operations where powder coatings of less than 30 micrometres or with a Tg below 40 °C are used in order to produce smooth thin films. One variation of the dry <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> <b>process,</b> the Powder Slurry process, combines the advantages of powder coatings and liquid coatings by dispersing very fine powders of 1-5 micrometre particle size into water, which then allows very smooth, low film thickness coatings to be produced.|$|E

Compacting and shaping such particles without reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} electrical insulation layer, while maintaining the magnetic characteristics, presents a major challenge. Furthermore, new motor designs taking into account the new possibilities of SMC's have been investigated only sparingly. The state-of-the-art SMC material today does not meet current requirements.

40|$|The {{powder coating}} is an economic, technologically {{superior}} and environment friendly painting technique {{compared with other}} conventional painting methods. However large variation in coating thickness can reduce the attractiveness of powder coated products. The coating thickness variation can also adversely affect the surface appearance and corrosion resistivity of the product. This can eventually lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of market share. In this paper, the author discusses a dual response surface optimization methodology to minimize the thickness variation around the target value of powder coated industrial enclosures. The industrial enclosures are cabinets used for mounting the electrical and electronic equipment. The proposed methodology consists of establishing {{the relationship between the}} coating thickness & the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters and developing models for the mean and variance of coating thickness. Then the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> is optimized by minimizing the standard deviation of coating thickness subject to the constraint that the thickness mean would be very close to the target.

Secondly, the structure build-up {{on the surface of the}} coatings was investigated with a combined SEM-CLA profilometry analysis at different stages of curing process for both EFB and CHDFB <b>coating</b> <b>processes.</b> Different finishes were found to characterize the films applied by using EFB and CHDFB <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> as a result of the different way the film is heated by. Finally, a strict relationship of film morphology to the degree of conversion and to the evolution of the complex viscosity was found out for both EFB and CHDFB <b>coating</b> <b>processes.</b> The surface structure is built up after gelation point and continues to evolve after gelation with a full development of the film fine structure. Differences were observed in the surface structure build-up when different curing temperature was used, thereby indicating an influence of minimum viscosity on achievable finishing. These experimental results lead to further advances in a better understanding of the formation of surface topography and morphology of polymeric films.

40|$|The {{research}} project {{focused on the}} study of different technologies for film coating of pellets using ethylcellulose as barrier-membrane coating polymer. In particular, two different approaches were investigated: the conventional aqueous film coating and the dry powder coating methods. The research carried out during {{the first part of the}} PhD provided a comprehensive study of the conventional aqueous film coating process of guaifenesin-loaded pellets in order to understand the variables affecting the drug migration through the barrier-membrane film coating and thus the stability over time of the final dosage form. The analysed process comprised the drug layering followed by the film coating technique in a Wurster fluid bed. The effect of curing conditions, drug loading and coating level and of the drug-layering solution on the technological properties of pellets was fully evaluated. In the second part of the research, an innovative dry powder coating technology was developed to apply the functional ethylcellulose based coating upon pellets avoiding the use of solvents (neither organic solvents nor water). In particular, the study was designed along three steps: i) Preparation of free films to evaluate the film formation process and to achieve the minimum film forming temperature of the coating formula; ii) <b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> of unloaded pellets; iii) Powder coating of drug-loaded pellets.

40|$|There {{are many}} and good reasons why <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> {{is a popular}} <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> {{for a lot of}} {{industrial}} products: the wide range of design possibilities; robust surface finish; and the total avoidance of polluting solvents, to name but three. In conventional <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> installations spray guns are used for powder application on the workpieces. This requires voluminous spray booths and powder recovery systems. Thus conventional <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technique causes high consumption of compressed air and of energy for the exhaust air as well as high costs for maintenance.

The new technique makes use of the well-known electrostatic fluidized bed principle. Its previous process limitations such as poor application uniformity and poor decorative surface quality have been overcome by using computer simulation as well as by adopting innovative technologies to regulate the electric field.
