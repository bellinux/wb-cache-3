25|$|The <b>puffers</b> {{developed}} from the , small single masted sailing barges which took most of the coasting trade. The original puffer was the Thomas, an iron canal boat of 1856, less than 66ft (20 m) long to fit in the Forth and Clyde Canal locks, powered by a simple steam engine without a condenser, since as it drew fresh water from the canal {{there was no need}} to economise on water use. Once steam had been used by the engine, it was simply exhausted up the funnel in a series of puffs as the piston stroked. As well as the visual sight of a series of steam puffs following the boat, the simple engines made a characteristic puffing sound. By the 1870s similar boats were being adapted for use beyond the canal and fitted with condensers so that they no longer puffed, but the name stuck. Some non-condensing <b>puffers</b> (included those with compound engines) were built until the 1920s when purely canal traffic decreased and the vast majority of coasters had to operate in sea water. A derrick was added to the single mast to lift cargo.|$|E
25|$|Just as some prey species evolved cryptic {{colouration}} {{and patterns}} to help avoid predators, some ambush predators evolved camouflage that lets them ambush their prey. The tassled scorpionfish is an ambush predator {{that looks like}} part of a sea floor encrusted with coral and algae. It lies in wait on the sea floor for crustaceans and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by. Another ambush predator is the striated frogfish (right). They lie {{on the bottom and}} wave a conspicuous worm-like lure strategically attached above their mouth. Normally about 10cm (4in) long, they can also inflate themselves like <b>puffers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Characteristically these boats had bluff bows, crew's {{quarters}} with {{table and}} cooking stove in the focsle, {{and a single}} mast with derrick {{in front of the}} large hold, aft of which the funnel and ship's wheel stood above the engine room while the captain had a small cabin in the stern. When publication of the Vital Spark stories began in 1905 the ship's wheel was still in the open, but later a wheelhouse was added aft of the funnel giving the <b>puffers</b> their distinctive image. Their flat bottom allowed them to beach and unload at low tide, essential to supply remote settlements without suitable piers. Typical cargoes could include coal and furniture, with farm produce and gravel sometimes being brought back.|$|E

25|$|From {{this basic}} type of puffer three {{varieties}} developed: inside boats continued in {{use on the}} Forth and Clyde canal, while shorehead boats extended their range eastwards into the Firth of Forth and westwards {{as far as the}} Isle of Bute and from there up the length of Loch Fyne, their length kept at 66ft (20 m) to use the canal locks. Both these types had a crew of three. <b>Puffers</b> of a third type, the outside boats, were built for the rougher sea routes to the Hebrides islands with a crew of four and the length increased to 88ft (27 m) still allowing use of the larger locks on the Crinan Canal which cuts across the Kintyre peninsula. There were more than 20 builders in Scotland, mainly on the Forth and Clyde canal at Kirkintilloch and Maryhill, Glasgow.|$|E

6000|$|Though Tennyson {{disliked the}} {{exhibition}} of [...] "the chips of the workshop," [...] we have commented on them, {{on the early}} readings of the early volumes. They may be regarded more properly as the sketches of a master than as [...] "chips," [...] and do more than merely engage the idle curiosity of the fanatics of first editions. They prove that the poet was studious of perfection, and wisely studious, for his alterations, unlike those of some authors, were almost invariably for the better, the saner, the more mature in taste. The early readings are also worth notice, because they partially explain, by their occasionally fantastic and humourless character, the lack of early and general recognition of the poet's genius. The native prejudice of mankind is not in favour of a new poet. Of new poets there are always so many, most of them bad, that nature has protected mankind by an armour of suspiciousness. The world, and Lockhart, easily found good reasons for distrusting this new claimant of the ivy and the bays: moreover, since about 1814 {{there had been a}} reaction against new poetry. The market was glutted. Scott had set everybody on reading, and too many on writing, novels. The great reaction of the century against all forms of literature except prose fiction had begun. Near the very date of Tennyson's first volume Bulwer Lytton, as we saw, had frankly explained that he wrote novels because nobody would look at anything else. Tennyson had to overcome this universal, or all but universal, indifference to new poetry, and, after being silent for ten years, overcome it he did--a remarkable victory of art and of patient courage. Times were even worse for poets than to-day. Three hundred copies of the new volume were sold! But Tennyson's friends were not <b>puffers</b> in league with pushing publishers.|$|E
