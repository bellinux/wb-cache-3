[...] His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.|$|E

2500|$|This {{thesis is}} also defended by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination. In this interpretation, Birth and Death refer not to {{physical}} birth and death, {{but to the}} birth and death of our self-concept, the [...] "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa: [...] "dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary <b>people.</b> <b>Right</b> Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".|$|E

2500|$|A risky {{decision}} of Barnum's established {{him as a}} legitimate impresario. During his Tom Thumb tour of England, Barnum had {{become aware of the}} popularity of Jenny Lind, the [...] "Swedish Nightingale". Lind's career was at its height in Europe. She was unpretentious, shy and devout, and possessed a crystal-clear soprano voice projected with a wistful quality and earnestness that audiences found touching. Barnum had never heard her and conceded to being unmusical himself. He approached her to sing in America at $1,000 a night for 150 nights, all expenses paid by him. He knew that his risk was great, noting: [...] "'The public' is a very strange animal, and although a good knowledge of human nature will generally lead a caterer of amusement to hit the <b>people</b> <b>right,</b> they are fickle and ofttimes perverse." [...] But Barnum was confident that her reputation for morality and philanthropy could be turned to good use in his publicity.|$|E

The over four decades of Moro struggle asserts freedom from Philippine colonialism as argued by Moro stalwarts Prof. Nur Misuari of MNLF and late Ustadz Salamat Hashims of MILF. Until the present the struggle for freedom and independence still lived on to the younger Moro generation. At the legal front, the Maradeka (literally means freedom) became seen at the forefront of a non-violent political movement enjoying the democratic space afforded to many political groups and activists in the Philippines.|$|E
