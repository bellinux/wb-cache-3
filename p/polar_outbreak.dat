50|$|<b>Polar</b> outbreaks: <b>Polar</b> <b>outbreaks</b> {{occur when}} cold dense polar air masses pass beneath warmer {{tropical}} air masses, significantly cooling subtropical South America. They {{occur as a}} result of anticyclogenesis in the Pacific subtropical high, which is constrained at a low level by the southern extent of the Andes mountain range. This leads to the formation of a slow-moving long wave that creates mountain-parallel, ageostrophic flow, causing incursions of high-latitude cold air. They generate an important drop in temperature and increase in pressure, resulting in regional precipitation for southern South America. These surges occur mainly during the winter but their impact on the precipitation is even greater during summer.|$|R
40|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>outbreaks</b> {{have long}} {{attracted}} the attention of meteorologists and climatologists. They are described here in terms of their air temperatures, air mass central pressures, and wind characteristics, as well as in relation to the atmospheric circulation and their trajectories over the continents. <b>Outbreaks</b> of <b>polar</b> air fito low latitudes tend to organize tropical convection and rain in summer, while the cold air tends to produce cooling in lower latitudes and freezes in the subtropics during winter. Cold waves accompanying <b>polar</b> <b>outbreaks</b> havê other significant impacts in the Americas,including adverse effects on coffee production in SouthAmerica and on citrus production in North America. Synoptic events leading to cold waves are somewhat similar in the Americas, particularly in terms of the upper air patterns and forcing, but the intensity of the outbreaks in terms of temperature and pressure is larger in North America. Typically, they are associated with an amplified ridge lying across the westem edge of the conti- nent. Records of freezes in coffee - and citrus-growing areas are used to reconstruct subtropical climate Variability and to identify linkages to low-frequency variability mechanisms in the atmospheric circulation. Results suggest that there is little link between the occurrence of EI Nino and cold waves and freezes in either hemisphere. Citrus freeze occurrences in Florida are linked to the long-term variability in the Pacific- North American (PNA) teleconnection pattem, and they arrear to occur in clusters concentrated near the end of each century. Comparisons are made of possible paleoclimate scenarios for the occurrence of cold waves based on evidence reconstructed from pollen and lake sedjment samples collected in southeastem and central Brazil.

40|$|ABSTRACT – In {{this paper}} we explore the impact of Rapid Climate Change (RCC) on prehistoric com-munities in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Early and Middle Holocene. Our {{focus is on the}} so-cial {{implications}} of the four major climate cold anomalies that have recently been identified as key time-windows for global RCC (Mayewski et al. 2004). These cooling anomalies are well-dated, with Greenland ice-core resolution, due to synchronicity between warm/cold foraminifera ratios in Medi-terranean core LC 21 as a proxy for surface water temperature, and Greenland GISP 2 non sea-salt (nss) [K+] ions as a proxy for the intensification of the Siberian High and for <b>polar</b> air <b>outbreaks</b> in the northeast Mediterranean (Rohling et al. 2002).

40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{high-resolution}} faunal, floral and geochemical (stable isotopes and trace elements) record from the sediments of Ocean Drilling Program Site 963 (central Mediterranean basin), which shows centennial/millennial-scale resemblance to the high-northern latitude rapid temperature fluctuations documented in the Greenland ice cores between 20 and 70 kyr BP. Oxygen and carbon isotopes, planktic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossil distributions suggest that Dansgaard-Oeschger (D/O) and Heinrich events (HE) are distinctly expressed in the Mediterranean climate record. Moreover, recurrent though subdued oscillations not previously identified in the Lateglacial Mediterranean sediments document a significant centennial-scale climate variability in the basin that is greater than previously thought. Alternations between climate regimes dominated by <b>polar</b> <b>outbreaks</b> during D/O stadials and warm D/O interstadials, with associated intensification of continental runoff, are well expressed in the ODP Site 963. These place the Mediterranean basin as an often overlooked recorder of the interplay between large- and regional- scale climate controls at intermediate latitudes, and of the possible interactions between different components of the climate system. Significant changes in Ba/Ca values measured in Globigerinoides ruber shells {{from a number of}} D/O stadials and interstadials suggest enhanced freshwater input from the north-eastern Mediterranean borderland during the D/O interstadials. However, the short duration of 3 D stratification events never led to complete oxygen consumption along the water column, but clear effects of sluggish 3 D circulation in the basin are testified to by negative excursions in d 13 C measured in selected species of planktic and benthic foraminifera. HEs are constantly associated with lightening in the d 18 O record of planktic foraminifera, possibly because of the impact of iceberg melting in the Iberian Margin on Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. Interestingly, in two cases in particular, HE 2 and HE 5, fresher water inputs also affected deeper horizons of intermediate waters, suggesting a basin-wide impact...|$|R
40|$|The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{components}} of atmospheric circulation variability within the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and largely affects winter weather in northeastern United States. This study examined the most recent decadal trend of the NAO as well as its influence on snowfall totals and storm track variability in the northeast U. S. over the previous 50 -year period. Previous research has indicated greater snowfall totals in the Northeast during NAO negative phases due to repeated <b>polar</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> Nonetheless, past research has also shown connections between the NAO positive phase and active winter seasons in this region. This study provides insight on how both positive and negative NAO phases can produce significant snowfall in the Northeast. Statistical and graphical analysis were completed to assess the relationship between the NAO and seasonal snowfall (NDJFM) from 1961 - 2010 for stations within the Northeast (Virginia to Maine). In addition, two case studies of recent winter events with differing NAO phases were evaluated to provide insight on how both NAO phases can produce significant snowfall in the Northeast. The statistical analysis revealed inverse relationships between the NAO negative phase and seasonal snowfall. The composite analysis indicated an average positive NAO pattern from 1961 - 2010, yet the NAO negative years produced higher frequency of snowfall in the Northeast. The case studies highlighted variations in storm track and snowfall distribution of the two winter events in differing phases. This study shows that snowfall can occur in particular regions of the Northeast regardless of the NAO phase which has important implications for forecasters. This research also provides the necessary information to complete the most recent decadal trend of the NAO and determine its average pattern. The update of this record will assist climatologists and weather forecasters in predicting future northeast U. S. winter storms. Department of GeographyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the weather situation on 20 - 23 April 1997, {{which was one}} of the strongest cold outbreaks ever recorded in April in Croatia. The processes leading to extremely low temperatures and heavy snowdrifts in the Dalmatian inland occurred on the front line between a <b>polar</b> air <b>outbreak</b> over central Europe and a deepening Mediterranean cyclone approaching the Adriatic. The genesis of a mesoscale vortex in the Adriatic has been diagnosed with the aid of satellite imagery and a high-resolution numerical model. The analysis of surface data has shown how the frontal system from the north slowed down over the Dinaric Alps and at mid-Adriatic, where the cyclogenetic process took place. The analysis of the vertical cross-sections produced using the rawinsonde data and the numerical model outputs have shown that the model successfully reproduced the intensity and time changes of the various meteorological frelds. In particular, the model successfully reproduced a mesoscale cyclone developed in the lower troposphere over the southern Adriatic on 23 April...|$|R
50|$|A {{study in}} 2001 found that stratospheric {{circulation}} can have anomalous effects on weather regimes. In {{the same year}} researchers found a statistical correlation between weak <b>polar</b> vortex and <b>outbreaks</b> of severe cold in the Northern Hemisphere. In more recent years scientists identified interactions with Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, NAO anomalies or weather anomalies which {{are linked to the}} polar vortex and jet stream configuration. However, because the specific observations are considered short-term observations (starting c. 13 years ago) there is considerable uncertainty in the conclusions. Climatology observations require several decades to definitively distinguish natural variability from climate trends.|$|R
40|$|Oxygen (delta O- 18) {{and carbon}} (delta C- 13) isotope records of calcitic {{carbonate}} components (Chara sp. algal encrustations and Bithynia tentaculata gastropod opercula) from a lake-sediment succession on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland, south-eastern Sweden, {{have been obtained}} to investigate regional climate dynamics during the Holocene. The hydrological sensitivity of the small lake, particularly in terms of spring snowmelt contribution to the local water budget, provides a means of tracing past changes in the influence of snow-bearing easterly winds across the Baltic Sea Proper, which signifies the wintertime strength of the Siberian High. Repeated episodic depletions in O- 18 at the centennial scale correlate with events of increased potassium concentration in the GISP 2 ice-core record from Greenland, which indicates a coupling to large-scale fluctuations in atmospheric circulation patterns. A corresponding correlation with simultaneous depletions in C- 13 suggests repeated responses of the local lake hydrology to snow-rich winters through decreasing water residence time, perhaps augmented by methanogenesis due to prolonged ice-cover seasons {{under the influence of}} an expanding Siberian High. Frequency analysis of the isotopic records reveals well-defined fluctuations at quasi- 500 - 520 -, 670 -, 830 - and 1430 -yr periodicities, and a gradually stronger impact of <b>Polar</b> air <b>outbreaks</b> across the southern Baltic Sea region with time after ca 6000 cal.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the impact of Rapid Climate Change (RCC) on prehistoric com- munities in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Early and Middle Holocene. Our {{focus is on the}} so- cial {{implications}} of the four major climate cold anomalies that have recently been identified as key time-windows for global RCC (Mayewski et al. 2004). These cooling anomalies are well-dated, with Greenland ice-core resolution, due to synchronicity between warm/cold foraminifera ratios in Medi- terranean core LC 21 as a proxy for surface water temperature, and Greenland GISP 2 non sea-salt (nss) [K+] ions as a proxy for the intensification of the Siberian High and for <b>polar</b> air <b>outbreaks</b> in the northeast Mediterranean (Rohling et al. 2002). Building on these synchronisms, the GISP 2 age- model supplies the following precise time-intervals for archaeological RCC research: (i) 8. 6 – 8. 0 ka, (ii) 6. 0 – 5. 2 ka, (iii) 4. 2 – 4. 0 ka and (iv) 3. 1 – 2. 9 ka calBP. For each of these RCC time intervals, based on detailed 14 C-based chronological studies, we investigate contemporaneous cultural developments. From our studies it follows that RCC-related climatic deterioration is a major factor underlying so- cial change, although always at work within a wide spectrum of social, cultural, economic and reli- gious factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{synoptic}} {{activity in}} the Southern Hemisphere is intimately associated with the climate variability in the Pacific Ocean. Here we show, {{through the use of}} a state-of-the-art automatic tracking scheme, that the mode known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (Mantua et al 1997) is linked with SH synoptic circulations over the tropics and mid-to-high latitudes, in particular with cyclone/anticyclone behavior. Three complementary analyses were considered. These consisted of the superposed cyclone and anticyclone trajectories, the System Density (SD) defined as the number of cyclones/anticyclones found in a given grid box per unit of area, and the system Depth (DP) which is an objective measure of cyclone/anticyclone strength. Composites of these properties and MSLP were calculated for the years when the PDO index was more than one standard deviation above and below the mean for all seasons. The ERA 40 data set for the period 1958 - 2002 has been used. The results show significant linear responses related to the PDO phase. The MSLP shows a strong annular structure related to the PDO phase, with lower pressure around Antarctica when the PDO index is positive and higher pressure when the PDO index is negative. This pattern is significantly different from the one obtained when compositing the SOI index, indicating a different response when compared with the El Nino / Southern Oscillation. For the El Nino composites, such a strong annular pattern around Antarctica is not seen, but is rather the well documented blocking high to the South west of South America during El Nino years. This structure is not seen in the PDO composites with the exception of the SON season. Our results show that the storm tracks fewer in number but more intense cyclones during the positive phase, with the opposite being true for the negative phase. This tends to be true for all seasons, but it is more pronounced during the winter period, when the PDO seems to have a greater influence in the annular pattern around Antarctica. The most intense anomalies found everywhere in the Southern Hemisphere tend to be significant at least between 90 and 95 % according to the T-student test, and many areas are also significant above the 99 % level. The PDO index is negatively correlated with the SOI during all seasons, but can be positively or negatively correlated with the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) depending on the season, this being weak despite of its strong annular structure. With regard to <b>polar</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in South America, the PDO index and the mean, maximum and minimum temperature anomalies in Sao Paulo city (Brazil) present a weak positive correlation, suggesting a weak tendency for colder winters during the negative PDO phase. However, in terms of the extreme minimum temperatures below 1 oC in the tropical and subtropical areas of Brazil in the last 100 years, it is not obvious to interpret any relationship between both variables. Further implications of the Era 40 climatology and climate variability in the last 50 years with trends in the number of cyclones/anticyclones and possible links with climate change are also going to be discussed.

500|$|In winter, North Carolina is {{somewhat}} {{protected by the}} Appalachian Mountains to the west. Cold fronts from Canada are typically reduced in intensity by the mountains.

40|$|<b>Polar</b> air <b>outbreaks</b> in South America are a {{remarkable}} example of extreme meridional air exchange driven by large scale anomalies and teleconnections. The international literature has documented several case studies and climatologies (Garreaud, 2000; Vera and Vigliarolo, 2000; Marengo et al, 2002) and, more recently, {{some elements of}} the long term synoptic climatology associated with the surface cyclone and anticyclone tracks have also been explored (Pezza and Ambrizzi 2005). This paper presents a 1973 2000 synoptic climatology (every 12 hours) of the surface cyclone and anticyclone tracks associated with extreme cold surges in South America leading to the friagem in the Amazon river Basin, when the cold front crosses the equator line. This has been complemented by the corresponding atmospheric circulation composed {{for the period of}} 1950 2000. The aim is to provide a new insight for the synoptic paths and the dynamics associated with distinct cold wave categorization in the tropics. Extreme minimum temperatures and frost occurrence from the University of São Paulo (USP) meteorological station in São Paulo city (Brazil) are used to select cold events with different intensities: extreme (T 2. 50 C plus frost). Atmospheric variables at low and upper levels derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP NCAR) reanalysis are composed from day minus nine to day zero with regard to the coldest day in São Paulo. In addition, an automatic tracking scheme is applied to diagnosing and tracking the cyclones and anticyclones at the surface associated with cold surges. Through a superposition technique, climatological clouds showing all tracks on the same map are produced, adding some new insights to the synoptic patterns of propagation and improving the Southern Hemisphere climatology. The lagged composites indicate that most of the cold events may be tracked up to nine days before their occurrence, with a persistent upper level signal in the eastern Pacific. The analyses also indicate the importance of the extratropical cyclone to produce frost events in Southeastern Brazil. A historical background of extreme cold cases in Sao Paulo during the 1888 - 2005 period and some examples of extreme cold outbreaks in high latitudes without meridional exchange at lower latitudes (inverse pattern due to subtropical blocking conditions) are also going to be discussed.
