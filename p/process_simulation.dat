Introduction Some quadtree/octree based mesh generation schemes have been employed for finite element methods used in device [1] and <b>process</b> <b>simulations</b> [3] because of the simplicity of the tree data structure and its advantage in faciliating adaptive mesh refinement.

These requirements are based on the same requirements as generic to FE/FV techniques with an additional difficulty coming from the changes in the geometry during the simulated fabrication of the device. <b>Process</b> <b>simulation</b> uses an FE/FV mesh to compute and store the dopant and stress profiles. Each geometrical change in the simulation domain requires a new mesh which fits to the new boundaries.
