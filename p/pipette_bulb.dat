25|$|Bubble flow meters: A simple, yet highly {{accurate}} way {{to measure}} flow rates involves timing movement of bubbles of soap film up glass tubes between marks of known volume. The glass tube is connected at the bottom (for push systems) or at the top (for pull systems) to the air stream. A small rubber <b>pipette</b> <b>bulb</b> attached {{at the base of}} the tube acts as both a reservoir and delivery system for the soap bubbles. Operation is simple. First, wet the glass surface along the path bubbles travel (e.g., press the bulb so that copious amounts of soap are pushed up the glass by the air flow) to provide a virtually friction-free surface. Second, pinch the bulb so that one clean bubble is produced. With a stopwatch in hand, record the time required for the bubble to travel between marks on the glass. Note the volume recorded on the upper mark (e.g., 125 = 125ml), divide the volume by the time required to travel between marks and the result is the flow rate (ml/s). These instruments can be purchased from a variety of sources, but they may also be constructed from appropriate-sized, glass volumetric pipettes.|$|E
50|$|The {{recommendation}} for using pipette is {{near to the}} desired volume. Before utilizing pipette, rinsing is required to prevent error. The standard technique for handling a graduated pipette is to hold the pipette in the solution without touching {{the bottom of the}} beaker. Then use a propipetter, a <b>pipette</b> <b>bulb</b> or rubber bulb, to draw the liquid into the pipette. The effective way to control the volume of the solution is to use a forefinger. After getting the desired volume, the solution can be released into another vessel by lifting the finger. During pipetting, the pipette must not divert from its upright position.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} a polyethylene bulb reservoir fabricated at the Pocatello Supply Depot, Pocatello, Idaho, as {{a potential}} cost savings replacement for the McBride lubber device that {{is used as a}} tranquilizer trap device (TTD). The polyethylene devices, also called pipette TTDs, were formulated with 0. 6 g of propiopromazine hydrochloride (PPZH) and 0. 4 g of ascorbic acid, an antioxidant. The <b>pipette</b> <b>bulb</b> was secured to a 1. 6 mm-diameter cable and the cable was attached to the trap jaw. TTD testing was conducted during routine operational control under an Investigational New Animal Drug application (INAD 9528) from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The targeted animals were feral dogs in Guam, coyotes in Utah and Idaho, and gray wolves in Minnesota. Various degrees of tranquilization ranging from quietness and lack of attention to sleepiness, were observed in the animals. Percent of tranquilization effects observed in feral dogs, coyotes, and wolves were 67 %, 90 %, and 67 %, respectively. Evidence of reduced struggling and reduced injuries to feet and legs was observed. Tranquilization effects were also observed in non-target animals such as badgers, skunks, and raccoons. A mortality that was probably related to beat stress was recorded in one juvenile wolf. A major drawback of the pipette TTD was leakage at the stem attached to the trap jaw. Degradation of PPZH was also observed but was reduced compared to formulations without ascorbic acid...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{presence}} of PCR inhibitors, PCR cannot be used directly on most clinical samples, including human urine, without pre-treatment. A magnetic bead-based strategy is one potential method to collect biomarkers from urine samples and separate the biomarkers from PCR inhibitors. In this report, a 1 mL urine sample was mixed within the bulb of a transfer pipette containing lyophilized nucleic acid-silica adsorption buffer and silica-coated magnetic beads. After mixing, the sample was transferred from the <b>pipette</b> <b>bulb</b> to a small diameter tube, and captured biomarkers were concentrated using magnetic entrainment of beads through pre-arrayed wash solutions separated by small air gaps. Feasibility was tested using synthetic segments of the 140 bp tuberculosis IS 6110 DNA sequence spiked into pooled human urine samples. DNA recovery was evaluated by qPCR. Despite {{the presence}} of spiked DNA, no DNA was detectable in unextracted urine samples, presumably due {{to the presence}} of PCR inhibitors. However, following extraction with the magnetic bead-based method, we found that ∼ 50 % of spiked TB DNA was recovered from human urine containing roughly 5 × 10 (3) to 5 × 10 (8) copies of IS 6110 DNA. In addition, the DNA was concentrated approximately ten-fold into water. The final concentration of DNA in the eluate was 5 × 10 (6), 14 × 10 (6), and 8 × 10 (6) copies/µL for 1, 3, and 5 mL urine samples, respectively. Lyophilized and freshly prepared reagents within the transfer pipette produced similar results, suggesting that long-term storage without refrigeration is possible. DNA recovery increased with the length of the spiked DNA segments from 10 ± 0. 9 % for a 75 bp DNA sequence to 42 ± 4 % for a 100 bp segment and 58 ± 9 % for a 140 bp segment. The estimated LOD was 77 copies of DNA/µL of urine. The strategy presented here provides a simple means to achieve high nucleic acid recovery from easily obtained urine samples, which does not contain inhibitors of PCR...|$|E

Confocal Z-projections using a single antibody on fixed tissue {{can be used to}} detail microglia profiles in comparison to various conditions including brain region, disease models, and aging. ### Introduction This profiling technique can be used to compare microglial morphology in response to injury, age, genetic background, or for regional comparisons. Sholl profiles detailing process length, complexity, and soma size may be obtained by following this procedure. ### Materials 1. 4 % PFA fixed floating brain sections - 0. 5 % Triton in PBS - PBS (0. 1 M) - Normal chicken serum (Vector Labs) - Bovine serum albumin - Aquamount - Polyclonal Rabbit anti-Mouse Iba 1 antibody (Biocare Medical) - Alexa Fluor® 647 Chicken anti-Rabbit IgG (Life Technologies) - DAPI nuclear stain (Sigma) ### Equipment 1. Confocal microscope (Leica SP 8 used in all of our studies) - FIJI software (Variant of ImageJ) ### Procedure 1. Sacrifice an animal with an i. p. injection of a lethal dose of ketamine. - Transcardially perfuse the mouse on a low speed (~ 3 minutes) with 15 mL of ice-cold 0. 1 M PBS containing 5 U/mL heparin. (the right atrium is clipped with scissors shortly after perfusion to ensure effective clearing of the brain). - Next infuse 25 mL of ice cold 4 % PFA. - Remove the brain and store in 4 % PFA at 4 degrees C for 72 hours of post-fixation with gentle rocking in 20 mL scintillation vials. - Remove excess PFA by dabbing the brain on a kimwipe and then transfer to a scintillation vial containing a 30 % sucrose solution at 4 degrees. - Once the brain has fully sunk (~ 2 days) the brain can be snap frozen in isopentane on dry ice or mounted immediately for freezing on chucks for slicing. - Mount the brain on a cryostat chuck using the cut bulb of a transfer pipette and OCT. - Place the empty cylinder of the transfer <b>pipette</b> <b>bulb</b> on to the chuck pre-stored in the cryostat Quick Freeze bar. - Place a layer of OCT on the chuck and orient the frozen or fresh brain flush with the bulb for coronal sectioning. - Place 40 um coronal sections in 0. 1 % sodium azide in PBS for storage at 4 degrees C. - Briefly wash slices in PBS to remove sodium azide. - Wash in 0. 5 % PBST (Triton X- 100) for 15 minutes at room temperature for permeabilization. - Wash in two rinses of PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. - Block for 2 hours at room temperature in 5 % normal chicken serum. - Incubate in primary antibody (Biocare Medical polyclonal rabbit-anti mouse Iba 1) at 1 : 300 in 0. 5 % BSA in PBS overnight at 4 degrees C. - Wash 3 x for 5 minutes in PBS at room temperature - Place in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor® 647 Chicken Anti-Rabbit IgG) diluted 1 : 800 in 5 % normal chicken serum in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. - Wash for 5 minutes in DAPI diluted 1 : 20, 000 in PBS at room temperature. - Wash 2 x for 5 minutes in PBS at room temperature. - Mount on slides using Aquamount and let dry in the dark at room temperature for at least four hours. - Using the 63 x objective on the confocal microscope, utilize the UV wide-field laser and DAPI fluorescence to select three fields from a given slice to represent that brain region. Three fields from each slice with three slices per mouse with at least three mice per experimental condition should be used to ensure a representative sampling of microglia (n > 30 microglia). - Once the focus is set on the eyepieces, switch to the optimal laser for Iba 1 fluorescence and range the z-stack on the microscope so that an entire microglia is located within the z-stack (~ 30 um per stack). - While imaging preferences should be determined by each user, our lab prefers to use HyD detectors in counting mode on the SP 8 Leica confocal microscope. This combined with a 3 -frame average provides the best resolution for obtaining clear Z-stacks. - Capture each Z-stack at a minimum resolution of 512 × 512, and enable your stack to make one slice per micron. - Load images on to FIJI using the drag and drop method. - Prepare a maximum intensity Z-stack projection - Make the image binary by thresholding to include microglial processes. - Isolate a single microglia by removing surrounding processes with the eraser tool. - Using the line segment tool, draw a single line {{from the center of the}} microglia soma to its longest process. - Using the Sholl analysis plugin, define the first shell to be 10 um outside of the cell body (to exclude the soma from Sholl analysis) and set each step to be 5 um. Select linear profile to conclude the analysis. - Copy the Sholl profile and enter in to Excel. Two complete microglia per field should be used for analysis. Avoid incomplete microglia or those with processes on the margin of the field. - Processes can then be erased and the microglia soma size recorded. - Once profiles are compiled for each mouse, total profiles for each experimental condition are pooled and imported in to statistical software. A two-way ANOVA should then be performed with the number of intersections from soma center and experimental variable used as the factors. ### Timing - Tissue Collection- ~ 2 hrs - Tissue Fixation and Cryoprotection- ~ 4 days - Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry – user defined - Imaging and quantification- (~ 1 day for a cohort of 6 mice) ### Anticipated Results Properly prepared tissue and a quality microscope should ensure excellent and reproducible microglial imaging with regards to the Iba 1 antibody. CX 3 CR 1 -GFP mice may also be imaged for Sholl Profiling in a similar way. ### References 1. Morrison, H. W., and Filosa, J. A.

40|$|Abstract—In {{studies of}} cells or stones in vitro, the {{material}} {{to be exposed to}} shock waves (SWs) is commonly contained in plastic vials. It is difficult to remove all air bubbles from such vials. Because SWs reflect at an air–fluid interface, and because existing gas bubbles can serve as nuclei for cavitation events, we sought to determine in our system whether the inclusion of small, visible bubbles in the specimen vial has an effect on SW-induced cell lysis. We found that even small bubbles led to increased lysis of red blood cells (1 - to 3 -mm diameter bubbles, 9. 8 6 0. 5 % lysis, n 5 7; no bubbles, 4. 4 6 0. 8 %, n 5 4), and that the degree of lysis increased with bubble size. Damage could not be reduced by centrifuging the cells to {{the opposite end of the}} vial, away from the bubble. B-scan ultrasound imaging of blood in polypropylene <b>pipette</b> <b>bulbs</b> showed that, with each SW, bubbles were recruited from the air interface, mixing throughout the fluid volume, and these appeared to serve as nuclei for increased echogenicity during impact by subsequent SWs; thus, bubble effects in vials could involve the proliferation of cavitation nuclei from existing bubbles. Whereas injury to red blood cells was greatly increased by the presence of bubbles in vials, lytic injury to cultured epithelial cells (LLC-PK 1, which have a more complex cytoarchitecture than red blood cells) was not increased by the presence of small air bubbles. This suggests different susceptibility to SW damage for different types of cells. Thus, the presence of even a small air bubble can increase SW-induced cell damage, perhaps by increasing the number of cavitation nuclei throughou...|$|R

50|$|Pasteur pipettes, {{also known}} as {{droppers}} or eye droppers, are used to transfer small quantities of liquids. They are usually glass tubes tapered to a narrow point, and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top. The combination of the Pasteur <b>pipette</b> and rubber <b>bulb</b> has also {{been referred to as}} a teat pipette. Pasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are sold in boxes of hundreds. They are named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who was known to have used a variant of them extensively during his research. The purpose of Pasteur pipette is invented as in laboratory, the sterile condition of samples is the most concerned. In the past, there is no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing to the external environment. The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment. The pasteur pipette both glass and plastic types are sterilized and plugs with rubber bulb at the open end of the pipette preventing the contamination from the atmosphere. Generally, they are considered cheap enough to be disposable, however, so long as the glass point is not chipped, the Pasteur pipette may be washed and reused indefinitely.|$|R
40|$|Various {{sampling}} methods for Schistosoma mattheei cercariae, including sampling from different concentrations, were tested. The most satisfactory method consisted of mixing the cercarial suspension by pouring it {{to and fro}} between two cylinders and then sampling it by oral suction on a <b>bulb</b> <b>pipette</b> with a large aperture. The aliquots withdrawn were stored in bottles containing formol-saline for later microscopic examination. This method of sampling was tested extensively. The {{results showed that the}} variation between aliquots was larger than that expected for either a binomial or a Poisson distribution, indicating that the cercariae were not randomly distributed in the suspension. Moreover, significant variations occurred between the totals of series of aliquots, possibly indicating uncontrolled factors, e. g. in mixing. From these results, methods of making up doses of carcariae for infesting sheep and cattle were developed: The Sheep Method is used for doses of up to 15 000 cercariae and is therefore applicable to infestation of primates as well as sheep. Several series of aliquots are made up, some of which (one or more series per animal) are used for infesting the animals concerned (Infestation Series), while others are retained for estimating the infestation doses (Estimation and Additional Estimation Series). One Estimation and one Additional Estimation Series suffice for estimating the numbers of cercariae in up to eight Infestation Series drawn from the same cercarial suspension, which is mixed immediately before each series of aliquots is withdrawn. In the Bovine Method, which is used for doses of over 15000 cercariae, an Estimation Series and an Additional Estimation Series of aliquots are withdrawn from every dose of cercariae to be used for infesting an animal. Thus the number of cercariae is estimated separately for each animal. Formulae were compiled for these methods to determine the upper levels (with a specified probability) of the percentage errors in the estimated doses. These formulae were applied to the results and some expected percentage errors in the numbers of cercariae estimated by the two methods, calculated. A result for the probability distribution of aliquot counts under the assumption of randomness is proved for the first time. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.
