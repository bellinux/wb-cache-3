The crystallization and melting behavior of these blends were examined by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). The blends of metallocene-catalyzed VLDPE 1 and LDPEs showed a smooth change in both crystallization and melting peak temperatures, indicating that there was co-crystallization and, hence, partial miscibility at all compositions. However, the blends of VLDPE 1 and long-chain branched VLDPE 2 co-crystallized at 50 % or less VLDPE 2 content, whereas Ziegler-Natta-catalyzed VLDPE 3 -VLDPE 2 blends showed co-crystallization at 50 % or higher VLDPE 2 compositions. It is concluded that either complete or partial miscibility has occurred between the two <b>polyethylenes</b> {{in each of the}} blends with VLDPE 2. Nevertheless, VLDPE 2 did not cause a significant change in the morphology of VLDPE 1, perhaps because of the reduced number of long branches present in VLDPE 2 compared with LDPEs. The molar masses or melt flow indices of the <b>polyethylenes</b> were not significant in controlling the morphology; only the distribution of branches along the chains was important...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of <b>polyethylene</b> glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of <b>polyethylene</b> supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as <b>polyethylene,</b> but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
40|$|Investigation of {{the melt}} {{rheological}} properties of <b>polyethylenes</b> prepared with chromium, titanium, vanadium, and zirconium catalysts immobilized on MgCl 2 supports has confirmed narrow (Schulz-Flory) molecular weight distribution, indicative of single-center catalysis, for Cr-, V-, and Zr-based systems, {{but not for}} Ti. In the case of polymers prepared with MgCl 2 -immobilized Ti complexes and having narrow MWD (M w/Mn 2 - 3) according to GPC, deviation from a Schulz-Flory distribution was evident from a decrease in storage modulus with decreasing angular frequencies, whereas <b>polyethylenes</b> prepared with analogous vanadium complexes exhibited a constant (plateau) modulus over a wide frequency range. The presence of the constant plateau modulus in high molecular weight <b>polyethylenes</b> is characteristic for narrow MWD, so that melt rheology provides a valuable tool to prove, or disprove, {{the presence of a}} Schulz-Flory distribution in cases where GPC does not provide a definitive answer. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|R

5|$|In {{studies of}} {{molecular}} and cellular biology {{it is often}} desirable to artificially induce fusion. The addition of <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting “hybridoma” from this combination expresses a desired antibody {{as determined by the}} B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the melanoma component. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers.|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of <b>polyethylene</b> with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E

The rheological and thermal {{measurements of the}} pure copolymers and their blends (VLDPE 1 -LDPE 1, VLDPE 1 -LDPE 2, VLDPE 1 -VLDPE 2, and VLDPE 2 -VLDPE 3) were taken by controlled stress rheometry and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The shear-thinning effect became stronger with increasing long-chain-branched polymer compositions when it was correlated with the flow behavior index, {{and the extent of}} shear thinning was different for each blend set. Stronger shear thinning and a linear composition dependence of the zero-shear viscosity were observed for the VLDPE 1 -LDPE 1 and VLDPE 1 -LDPE 2 blends. These blends followed the log additivity rule, and this indicated that they were miscible in the melt at all compositions. In contrast, a deviation from the log additivity rule was observed for the VLDPE 1 -VLDPE 2 blend compositions with 50 % or less VLDPE 2 and for the VLDPE 3 -VLDPE 2 blends with 50 % or more VLDPE 2. The thermal properties of the blends were consistent with the rheological properties. VLDPE 1 -LDPE 1 and VLDPE 1 -LDPE 2 showed that these blends were characteristic of a single-component system at all compositions, whereas the phase separation (immiscibility) was detected only for VLDPE 1 -VLDPE 2 blends with 50 % or less VLDPE 2 and for VLDPE 3 -VLDPE 2 blends with 50 % or more VLDPE 2...|$|R
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) onto the liposome surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E
5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include <b>polyethylene,</b> polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E

40|$|Branched <b>polyethylenes,</b> low density <b>polyethylenes</b> (LDPE) or {{long-chain}} branched {{very low}} density <b>polyethylenes</b> (VLDPE), were blended with VLDPEs containing short branches. The melting behaviour of pure copolymers and their blends were investigated using {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) after applying stepwise isothermal crystallisation (&# 039;thermal fractionation&# 039;). Thermal fractionation separates polymers according to their branching densities and fractionated curves {{used to determine the}} short-chain branching distribution (SCB), crystallisation and miscibility of blends. When both polymers have similar unbranched segments, they may co-crystallise if they are miscible in the melt. The co-crystallisation is observed to occur in all sets of blends, however, the extent of co-crystallisation varies from blend to blend. The blends of metallocene-catalysed VLDPE 1 and LDPEs show significant deviation from the additivity rule indicating the greater co-crystallisation and hence melt miscibility at all compositions. The extent of co-crystallisation decreases for the VLDPE 1 blends containing long-chain branched VLDPE 2 and increases for Ziegler-Natta-catalysed VLDPE 3 -VLDPE 2 blends, as the VLDPE 2 content increases. DSC fractionated curves allow detailed examination of co-crystallisation and miscibility of blends that is also comparable to the results gained by temperature rising elution fractionation...|$|R
