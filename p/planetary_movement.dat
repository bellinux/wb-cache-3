40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{detailed}} and fascinating {{picture of the}} astonishing astronomical knowledge on which the Roman calendar, traditionally attributed to the king Numa Pompilius (reign 715 - 673 BC), was based. This knowledge, of Mesopotamian origins, related mainly to the <b>planetary</b> <b>movements</b> and to the occurrence of eclipses in the solar system. The author explains the Numan year and cycle and illustrates clearly how astronomical phenomena exerted a powerful influence over {{both public and private}} life. A series of concise chapters examines the dates of the Roman festivals, describes the related rites and myths, and places the festivals in relation to the <b>planetary</b> <b>movements</b> and astronomical events. Special reference is made to the movements of the moon and Venus, their relation to the language of myth, and the particular significance that Venus was considered to have for female fertility. The book clearly demonstrates the depth of astronomical knowledge reflected in the Roman religious calendar and the designated festive days. It will appeal both to learned connoisseurs and to amateurs with a particular interest in the subject...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} astronomical threats have been identified. Massive objects, e.g. a star, large planet or black hole, could be catastrophic if a close {{encounter}} {{occurred in the}} Solar System. In April 2008, {{it was announced that}} two simulations of long-term <b>planetary</b> <b>movement,</b> one at Paris Observatory and the other at University of California, Santa Cruz indicate a 1% chance that Mercury's orbit could be made unstable by Jupiter's gravitational pull sometime during the lifespan of the Sun. Were this to happen, the simulations suggest a collision with Earth could be one of four possible outcomes (the others being Mercury colliding with the Sun, colliding with Venus, or being ejected from the Solar System altogether). If Mercury were to collide with Earth, all life on Earth could be obliterated: an asteroid 15 km wide is believed to have caused the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, whereas Mercury is 4,879 km in diameter.|$|E
5000|$|The Dialogue {{is a broad}} {{synthesis}} of Galileo's thinking about physics, <b>planetary</b> <b>movement,</b> how far we can rely on our senses in making judgements about the world, and how we make intelligent use of evidence. It drew together all his findings and recapitulated arguments made in earlier years on specific topics. [...] For this reason, there is not 'section on sunspots' in the Dialogue. Rather, they are referred to at various points in arguments about other topics. In the Dialogue, that sunspots are {{on the surface of}} the sun and not planets was taken as established fact. The discussion concerned what inferences could be drawn about the universe from their rotation. Galileo did not argue that the existence of sunspots conclusively proved that the Copernican model was correct and the Aristotelian model wrong; he explained how the rotation of sunspots could be explained in both models, but that the Aristotelian explanation was much more complicated and suppositional.|$|E
50|$|The first {{biography}} of Tycho Brahe, {{which was also}} the first full-length {{biography of}} any scientist, was written by Pierre Gassendi in 1654. In 1779 Tycho de Hoffmann wrote of Brahe's life in his history of the Brahe family. In 1913 Dreyer published Tycho Brahe's collected works, facilitating further research. Early modern scholarship on Tycho Brahe tended to see the shortcomings of his astronomical model, painting him as a mysticist recalcitrant in accepting the Copernican revolution, and valuing mostly his observations which allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of <b>planetary</b> <b>movement.</b> Especially in Danish scholarship Tycho Brahe was depicted as a mediocre scholar and a traitor to the nation — perhaps because of the important role in Danish historiography of Christian IV as a warrior king. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century scholars began reevaluating is significance and studies by Kristian Peder Moesgaard, Owen Gingerich, Robert Westman, Victor E. Thoren, and John R. Christianson focused on his contributions to science, and demonstrated that while he admired Copernicus he was simply unable to reconcile his basic theory of physics with the Copernican view. Christianson's work showed the influence of Tycho's Uraniborg as a training center for scientists who after studying with Brahe went on to make contributions in various scientific fields.|$|E

5000|$|Drohobych wrote a {{treatise}} {{about the}} solar eclipse {{that took place}} on July 29, 1478. He suggested that cosmic events of this nature {{may or may not}} have favorable effects on events on Earth but they certainly would not cause catastrophes. In the early 1480s, Italy was at the forefront of book printing. Initially all publications were of a religious nature, however books about astronomy, botany, and geography had been growing in popularity, too. In 1483 Drohobych published in Rome his first book in Latin [...] "Prognostic Estimation of the year 1483" [...] (Iudicium Pronosticon Anni MCCCCLXXXIII Currentis). It was a nineteen-page publication of astrological (zodiac) calendars, which were popular at that time, that helped its readers to make predictions about events on Earth depending on the planets' positions. This publication had several noteworthy elements: Drohobych gave accurate predictions for two lunar eclipses; he provided accurate calculations of the phases of the Moon; and he also touched upon the subject of <b>planetary</b> <b>movement.</b> Furthermore, he indicated that the geographic coordinates were an important factor in determining the sun's and planets' positions. Depending on the geographic location of the observer, the positions of cosmic objects would vary. His longitude calculations were not error-free, however. He deserves credit for being the first Eastern European scholar who in a printed publication indicated the exact geographic coordinates of several Ukrainian, Polish, and Lithuanian cities.|$|E

Lexell was shocked by Lalande's atheism, reminding him that Diderot was «brought down » on this subject by Æpinus in Petersburgh. This reference throws light on an obscure incident concerning Diderot's «demonstration » of the possibility of explaining <b>planetary</b> <b>movement</b> without, like Newton, supposing an initial impulse from the Creator. This reasoning, which he had proposed to several mathematicians (iCpinus, the Eulers, J. F. Hennert), should be linked to a paper by J. J. de Marguerite (1773). After having described his hostility to the Parisians' irreligion, Lexell, who was welcomed by Diderot and his friends, gives a favourable account of a conversation with the Philosopher (concerning Falconet's monument); he also shows sympathy for d'Holbach and admiration for the Histoire des deux Indes.

This is one of many capabilities that can replicated, with great accuracy, without using expensive, proprietary software. NASAs SCaN (Space Communication and Navigation) Center for Engineering, Networks, Integration, and Communications (SCENIC) project plans to provide its analysis capabilities using a combination of internal and open-source software, allowing for a much greater measure of customization and flexibility, while reducing recurring software license costs. MATLAB and the open-source Orbit Determination Toolbox created by Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) were utilized to develop tools with the capability to propagate orbits, perform line-of-sight (LOS) availability analyses, and visualize the results. The developed programs are modular and can be applied for mission planning and viability analysis in a variety of Solar System applications. The tools can perform 2 and N-body orbit propagation, find inter-satellite and satellite to ground station LOS access (accounting for intermediate oblate spheroid body blocking, geometric restrictions of the antenna field-of-view (FOV), and relativistic corrections), and create animations of <b>planetary</b> <b>movement,</b> satellite orbits, and LOS accesses.

Julia sets are perhaps the most drawn objects in Mathematics due to their fascinating fractal structure. The theory behind them is even more fascinating, and the dynamical systems generating them are in many ways archetypal.

50|$|The {{foundations}} of the theoretical structure used in astrology originate with the Babylonians, although widespread usage did not occur till {{the start of the}} Hellenistic period after Alexander the great swept through Greece. It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart. The appearance of them being close is illusory. The exact demarcation of what a constellation is, is cultural, and varied between civilisations. Ptolemy's work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire, like all astrologers of the time, to easily calculate the <b>planetary</b> <b>movements.</b> Early western astrology operated under the ancient Greek concepts of the Macrocosm and microcosm; and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations. This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy. While still defending the practice of astrology, Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions.|$|R
