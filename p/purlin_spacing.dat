For roof structures the critical loading combinations are predominantly wind actions. The accumulative effect of wind actions, by wind entering through dominant openings to exert pressure on the inside of roof structures together with the suction of wind vortices {{on the outside of the}} roof, can contribute to extreme load combinations. Frequently recorded failures on roof structures suggest that either the loads are underestimated or the resisting capacity of the roof coverings is overestimated. The focus of this study is directed on the latter, determining the effective resistance of roof coverings in the form of sheeting against a Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL) such as wind actions. To determine the carrying capacity of a roofing structure, the standard approach used involves experimental tests on certain configurations with two or more spans. The structural test set-up is loaded with sandbags until failure is reached. For the design of roofing systems, design tables are used that list the maximum allowable <b>purlin</b> <b>spacing.</b> The <b>purlin</b> <b>spacing</b> is presented in the form of a fixed value in units of length and is shown independent of a UDL that the roof needs to be designed for. The need to a new approach to determining the resistance of roof covering systems was identified. The resistance of roof coverings for the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) and the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) depends on a number of parameters such as the bending resistance, the stiffness of the sheeting in bending and the carrying capacity of the fastening system. To evaluate these structural parameters, experimental tests were performed. A full-scale experimental test setup, capable of simulating a UDL on roof sheeting, was developed. The experimental test set-up consists of four different configurations, each specifically schematized to evaluate a certain structural design parameter. The magnitude of the structural design parameters depends on the applied UDL and the span length, which is the distance between consecutive supports of the sheeting system. Therefore, by using the structural design parameters determined experimentally, a set of design tables could be generated. The design tables produce the maximum allowable span length of a roofing system that uses a desired UDL as a variable. By using the design tables, the <b>purlin</b> <b>spacing</b> for any roof structure can be calculated given its design loading combination. The calculated purlin spacings are now a function of the basic parameters that determine the resistance of the roof sheeting. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Geen opsommin...|$|E
40|$|Wind is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} that occurs in all regions and can be predicted. But nowadays, Malaysia experienced an extreme climate change and unexpected wind condition which is lead to severe damage to the building especially residential building and this case had increase in past few years. As this problem is forecasted {{to lead to the}} great amount of losses in term of money and can cause injuries to people, this paper is provide to study the characteristic of wind and to determine the maximum wind speed that can cause failure to roof, and hence provide theguideline of the safety design of roof truss for residential building. The research is focuses on standard roof trusses design of residential building with JKR standard as a guideline. As referring to the postdisaster investigation of major windstorm events that had been conducted in Unites States for past two decades prove that the failure of the roof structure is obviously because of the poor construction of the truss system and due to the construction itself that not following code. Based on the past research also shown that the presence of wind load in term of suction and uplift force that normally ignored in construction is the main cause of roof system to fail. The research is proceed by using data of various wind speed that lead to different potential damage to the building which is Fujita Scale and Tamura Scale. Basic wind speed of 33. 5 m/s is set up as a benchmark in determining the standard size of the truss and the dimension of the truss itself. The value of wind speed from Tamura Scale is used in analysing the loading on the roof truss by using simplified procedure in MS 1553 : 2002 since the cases is investigated in Malaysia. The methodology of the research then projected by create a model of roof trusses in ANSYS. Civi 1 FEM where the roof truss is modelled using hot rolled cross section with the same truss span, truss spacing, <b>purlin</b> <b>spacing</b> as calculated using simplified procedure. At the end of the research, it found that the minimum size of truss that can support basic wind speed 33. 5 mIs is 75 x 75 x 8 and truss to fail when reach wind speed 140 mls when considering wind tunnel coefficient and 1 60 m/s without considering wind tunnel coefficient. As a nutshell, this can be conclude that in designing for roof trusses, the value of wind speed that should be considered in the design is not only focusing on basic wind speed but also increase the design capacity of the trusses so that when unexpected high wind speed occur, the roof truss still can support the load without any failure...|$|E
