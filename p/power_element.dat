40|$|The {{problem of}} the article is the {{optimizing}} of the internal structure of the wing with the purpose to improve its stiffness characteristics at a constant weight of the structure. This task is put {{on the development of}} the methods to optimize the stress-strain state wing aircraft under the influence of arbitrary external and internal pressures. The paper proposes rigidity interpreted as a variable that depends on the configuration of <b>power</b> <b>elements,</b> varying the location of which can be achieved by maximizing stiffness. We defined the mathematical function of mass and stiffness depending on the internal configuration of <b>power</b> <b>elements</b> (plating, stringers, longerons). The wing has the <b>power</b> <b>elements,</b> the placement of which may be various: power paneling, two longerons and stringers, four on the bottom and top panels. As a result, on the basis of the spatial theory of elasticity were obtained equations describing the bending, torsional and longitudinal vibrations of the wings, and the proposed mathematical model of the optimal hardness wing by varying the functional dependence for placing <b>power</b> <b>elements</b> and varying the parameters of this function. The results made it possible to optimize the internal structure in terms of minimum deformation at constant values of the mass of the investigated structures such as wings to reduce bending, twist angles and tensile strength elements. ???????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????? ?????, ??????? ????????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ????????. ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ????????, ??????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????? ?????????, ???????? ??????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????. ???????? ???????? ???????, ??????? ???? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????? ?????. ?????????? ?????? ????? ???? ? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????????...|$|R

5000|$|Supranational {{integration}} of the North Atlantic area had emerged as a focus of thinking among intellectuals {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic already in the late 19th century. Although it was not known as Atlanticism at the time (the term was coined in 1950), they developed an approach coupling soft and hard power which would to some extent integrate the two sides of the Atlantic. The idea of an attractive [...] "nucleus" [...] union was the greatest soft power element; the empirical fact of the hegemonic global strength such a union would hold was the hard <b>power</b> <b>element.</b> This approach was eventually implemented to a certain degree in the form of NATO, the G7 grouping and other Atlanticist institutions. In the long debate between Atlanticism and its critics in the 20th century, the main argument was whether deep and formal Atlantic integration would serve to attract those still outside to seek to join, as Atlanticists argued, or alienate the rest of the world and drive them into opposite alliances. Realists, neutralists, and pacifists, nationalists and globalists tended to believe it would do the latter, citing the Warsaw Pact as the proof of their views and treating it as the inevitable realpolitik counterpart of NATO.|$|E

The High Capacity <b>Power</b> <b>element</b> is broken down into several subelements that includes energy conversion in the areas of the free piston Stirling power converter and thermoelectrics, thermal management, power management, system diagnostics, and environmental compatibility and system's lifetime. A recent overview of the CSTI High capacity <b>Power</b> <b>element</b> and a description of each of the program's subelements is given by Winter (1989). The goals of the Power Management subelement are twofold. The first is to develop, test, and demonstrate high temperature, radiation-resistant power and control components and circuits that will be needed in the Power Conditioning, Control and Transmission (PCCT) subsystem of a space nuclear power system. The results obtained under this goal will also be applicable to the instrumentation and control subsystem of a space nuclear reactor. These components and circuits must perform reliably for lifetimes of 7 - 10 years. The second goal is to develop analytical models for use in computer simulations of candidate PCCT subsystems. Circuits which will be required for a specific PCCT subsystem will be designed and built to demonstrate their performance and, also, to validate the analytical models and simulations. The tasks under the Power Management subelement will now be described in terms of objectives, approach and present status of work...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Rolamite architecture exploiting shape-memory alloys as <b>power</b> <b>element</b> {{to obtain}} a solid-state actuator. The Rolamite mechanism was discovered in the late 1960 s, initially as precision and low friction linear bearing. The most common Rolamite configuration consists of a flexible thin metal strip and two rollers mounted between two fixed parallel guide surfaces. The system can roll back and forth without slipping guided by the plates along its so-called sensing axis. The system presents another relevant advantage in addition to low friction coefficient, which is the possibility to provide force generation in a quite simple way. In the original literature works, the force was provided, thanks to cut-outs of various shapes in the strip, although this method does not allow the Rolamite {{to be considered a}} proper actuator, but only a force generator. In this article, we developed the idea of exploiting the shape-memory alloy as Rolamite <b>power</b> <b>element,</b> and therefore, to use the shape-memory effect to change the elastic properties of the strip and to provide the actuation force. The mechanical analysis, where the martensite–austenite transition is modelled in a simplified way, shows that this application is feasible, mainly thanks to the initial precurvature of the shape-memory alloy strip. The discussion of the results highlights some important merits of this architecture such as long stroke, constant force and compactness...|$|E
