5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, <b>post-treatment,</b> and relapse. By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors {{gain a better understanding}} of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.|$|E

Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a <b>post-treatment</b> process to ensure pathogen reduction. This <b>post-treatment</b> may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof.

40|$|Air {{classification}} is a milder {{and more}} sustainable method to obtain protein-enriched fractions than commonly used wet fractionation. The protein content of air-classified fractions is generally lower than obtained with wet methods, therefore we applied pre- and <b>post-treatments</b> {{to increase the}} protein purity. A starch-rich legume, pea, and an oil-rich legume, lupine, were pre-treated by varying the moisture content, defatting, soaking or freezing cycles. Higher moisture contents and defatting of lupine increased the protein purity, but lower moisture contents increased the protein yield. Soaking and freezing cycles lowered the particle density, which impaired the separation. Electrostatic separation is based on electrostatic charging behaviour and was successfully applied to enrich air-classified fractions by separating protein and fibre into oppositely charged fractions. The results showed that pre- and <b>post-treatments</b> yielded protein fractions that are significantly purer than those obtained in single-step milling and air classification...|$|R

However, the conductivities of the PANI/SNS nanocomposites were lower than the other popular values reported. It might due to the release of the acid dopant during the <b>post-treatments</b> such as washing and drying.|$|R
30|$|Different technologies, such as aerobic and {{anaerobic}} treatments, adsorption, coagulation-flocculation, ozonisation, {{electrochemical oxidation}} and electro-coagulation, have been explored {{to reduce the}} contaminants in vinasses.

As of 2016 the reason for the lingering symptoms was not known; the condition is generally managed similarly to fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Fresh feces {{consist of}} about 80% {{water and the}} {{majority}} of this water will evaporate away if it is allowed to do so by the feces not being enclosed in air-tight containers or vaults. The water content of dried feces after six months of drying is usually less than 25%. Depending on the degree of drying and the intended reuse application an additional <b>post-treatment</b> step, such as composting, might be necessary for reuse of excreta in agriculture.|$|E

40|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) {{films with}} c-oriented were grown on fused quartz glass {{substrates}} {{at room temperature}} using dc reactive magnetron sputtering. The as-grown films were annealed at 700 degrees C in air and bombarded by ion beam, respectively. The effects of <b>post-treatments</b> on the structural and optical properties of the ZnO films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL), optical transmittance and absorption measurements. The XRD spectra indicate that the crystal quality of ZnO films has been improved by both the <b>post-treatments.</b> Compared with the as-grown sample, both annealed and bombarded samples exhibited blueshift in the UV emission peaks, and a strong green emission {{was found in the}} annealed ZnO film. In both optical transmittance and absorption spectra, a blueshift of the band-gap edge was observed in the bombarded film, while a redshift was observed in the annealed film. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceFor 45 nm {{and beyond}} {{microelectronics}} technology nodes, {{the integration of}} porous low dielectric constant (low-k) materials is now required to reach integrated dielectric constant values lower than 2. 7. However, porous low-k materials have lower mechanical strength in comparison with traditional dense materials and are also affected by chemical diffusion through the interconnected porosity during the various integration processes. Different types of plasma <b>post-treatments</b> which lead to surface modification of the porous low-k material with possible formation of a top surface layer, change of surface structure and “pore sealing” effect were applied. Highly sensitive instruments for mechanical investigation of thin layers, such as the Ultra Nano Hardness Tester (UNHT) and Nano Scratch Tester (NST) were applied for characterization {{of the effect of}} the plasma <b>post-treatments</b> on the mechanical behavior of a porous low-k material.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the {{partitioned}} data {{is to be}} preferred a priori, what prevents one from partitioning the data into arbitrary sub-categories (say based on eye color or <b>post-treatment</b> pain) artificially constructed to yield wrong choices of treatments? Pearl shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. Worse yet, given the same table, one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the aggregated data, depending on {{the story behind the}} data, with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl considers this to be the real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs with {{a single}} vault have {{interchangeable}} containers to collect the fecal material. Depending {{on the size of}} the vault, two or more containers can be stored inside. Containers should be limited to a maximum volume of approximately 50 litres, so that they still can be manually moved when they fill up. Once a container is full, it can be left for further dehydration or removed for further treatment. Removal of the container requires care due to fresh, potentially pathogen-loaded feces being on top of the pile in the container. Because of the limited ventilation within a plastic bucket, such single-vault UDDTs may not reduce the pathogen load as effectively as double-vault UDDTs. Therefore, a <b>post-treatment</b> of the fecal material is usually required. This can be achieved through further dehydration, composting processes or heat treatments.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. It is {{estimated}} to affect 300,000 people a year in the United States and 65,000 people a year in Europe. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. Lyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition {{for the first time in}} 1975 in Old Lyme, Connecticut. It was originally mistaken for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The bacterium involved was first described in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. Chronic symptoms are well described and are known as <b>post-treatment</b> Lyme disease syndrome, although it is often called chronic Lyme disease. Some healthcare providers claim that it is due to ongoing infection; however, this is not believed to be true. A previous vaccine is no longer available. Research is ongoing to develop new vaccines.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{the effect}} of {{chemical}} <b>post-treatments</b> was also demonstrated. The covalent bonding of gold nanoparticles to the CFs remarkably improves conductivity, whereas annealing CFs in hydrogen-containing atmosphere leads to a dramatic decrease in conductivity [25].

25|$|Thrombolysis, such as with {{recombinant}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability.

25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the <b>post-treatment</b> incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E
25|$|Articulatory-kinematic {{treatments}} {{have the}} strongest {{evidence of their}} use in treating Acquired Apraxia of Speech. These treatments use the facilitation of movement, positioning, timing, and articulators to improve speech production. Sound Production Treatment (SPT) is an articulatory-kinematic treatment that has received more research than many other methods. It combines modeling, repetition, minimal pair contrast, integral stimulation, articulatory placement cueing, and verbal feedback. It was developed to improve the articulation of targeted sounds in the mid-1990s. SPT shows consistent improvement of trained sounds in trained and untrained words. The best results occur with eight to ten exemplars of the targeted sound to promote generalization to untrained exemplars of trained sounds. In addition, maintenance effects are the strongest with 1–2 months <b>post-treatment</b> with sounds that reached high accuracy during treatment. Therefore, the termination of treatment should not be determined by performance criteria, and not {{by the number of}} sessions the client completes, in order to have the greatest long-term effects. While there are many parts of SPT that should receive further investigation, it can be expected that it will improve the production of targeted sounds for speakers with apraxia of Speech.|$|E
40|$|Brain {{injuries}} promote upregulation {{of so-called}} proinflammatory prostaglandins, notably prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), leading to overactivation {{of a class}} of its cognate G-protein-coupled receptors, including EP 1, which is considered a promising target for treatment of ischemic stroke. However, {{the role of the}} EP 1 receptor is complex and depends on the type of brain injury. This study is focused on the investigation {{of the role of the}} EP 1 receptor in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model, a preclinical model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The therapeutic effects of <b>post-treatments</b> with a widely studied EP 1 receptor antagonist, SC- 51089, were examined in wildtype and EP 1 receptor knockout C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Neurological deficit scores (NDS) were assessed 24 and 48 h following CCI or sham surgery, and brain immunohistochemical pathology was assessed 48 h after surgery.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of surface energy measurements performed in situ during annealing of silicon wafers. The method allows conclusions to be drawn about the progress of silanol condensation while surface energy increases. The effects of wafer conditioning by atmospheric pressure plasmas, chemical <b>post-treatments</b> after plasma exposure but before bonding, and annealing temperatures on silanol condensation is investigated. Using nitrogen or nitrogen/oxygen gas mixtures for plasma activation, higher fracture surface energies gamma are obtained at room temperature compared with oxygen plasma activation. Upon annealing, all increase in surface energies starts below 100 degrees C. Possible reasons responsible for the effects of nitrogen plasma treatment and <b>post-treatments</b> with ammonia are discussed. Upward bent gamma(t) curves are obtained during annealing at 200 degrees C, independently of the type of wafer preconditioning, in contrast with the implications of existing chemical-kinetic models of the bonding process. Aside from it self-enhancement of the process due to facilitated water removal from the interface, the hypothesis of the nucleation and growth of covalently bonded microareas is able to explain the observed behavior qualitatively...|$|R

40|$|BiTe-based alloys are {{the best}} {{thermoelectric}} materials near room temperature and Bi(TeSe) alloys are their typical n-type ones. However, the dimensionless figure of merit ZT of the bulk Bi(TeSe) is normally less than 1. 0 despite various delicate and time-consuming preparations associated with complex <b>post-treatments.</b> Here, via liquid state manipulation (LSM), we obtained a high ZT for bulk n-type BiTeSe ingot direction-solidified with high temperature-gradient at a suitable growth rate. With the maximum ZT = 1. 22 at 477 K, its average value (1. 09) between 300 and 575 K is the highest among those of all the bulk Bi(TeSe) fabricated so far. Specifically, with proper structure texturing, LSM obviously raises the Seebeck coefficient due to the increased effective mass, with almost unaltered electrical conductivity. Moreover, as growth rate decreases, the enhanced texturing boosts the electrical conductivity, but raises the thermal conductivity along the growth direction. More significantly, at the same direction growth condition, LSM can increase nanoscale particles, dislocations and atomic-scale lattice distortions, resulting in substantially reduced lattice thermal conductivity. Consequently, via LSM and suitable texturing, the bulk n-type BiTeSe with outstanding ZT is directly obtained without complex <b>post-treatments.</b> This work provides a novel strategy for optimizing performance of thermoelectric materials with the merit of easy large-scale fabrication...|$|R
