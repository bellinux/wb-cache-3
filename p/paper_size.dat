5|$|The first 8 {{issues of}} Lobster are A5 <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> (148 × 210mm) format, growing to A4 (210 × 297mm) from Issue 9 in September 1985. The {{magazine}} was originally typewritten, reduced on a photocopier, pasted-up and printed on a Gestetner off-set litho duplicating machine. Around issue 17, {{the magazine was}} type-set on an Amstrad PCW using Wordstream and from Lobster 27, on an AppleMac with Claris Works. Lobster Issue 57 (Summer 2009) was the last hard copy issue. Issue 58 (Winter 2009/2010) was the first available without charge. The magazine is published from Ramsay's home in Hull.|$|E
25|$|All ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes (except some envelopes) {{have the}} same aspect ratio, 1:, at least to within the {{rounding}} to whole numbers of millimetres. This ratio has the unique property that when cut or folded in half widthwise, the halves also {{have the same}} aspect ratio. Each ISO <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> is {{one half of the}} area of the next larger size.|$|E
25|$|The printed format {{has gone}} through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded tabloid {{newspaper}} format, with no staples, black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint <b>paper</b> <b>size.</b> In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10"×12") magazine. As of edition of October 30, 2008, Rolling Stone has had a smaller, standard-format magazine size.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, US <b>paper</b> <b>sizes</b> are a {{de facto}} standard. The government, however, also uses ISO <b>paper</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{traditional}} <b>paper</b> <b>sizes,</b> which are now used mostly by printers. The most common of these old series are the Shiroku-ban and the Kiku <b>paper</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} <b>paper</b> <b>sizes</b> are used {{from the floor}} {{standing}} through to the smaller table-top versions, subject to the country's adopted <b>paper</b> <b>sizes.</b> These include A1, B1, 25" [...] x30" [...] through to 20" [...] x 23".|$|R
500|$|On Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London. In this match, two London fielders {{were badly}} injured by {{a clash of}} heads. H. T. Waghorn noted a lull in the {{advertising}} and reporting of cricket after this game {{and he wondered if}} that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the South Sea Bubble which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, [...] "the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased". The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company was found to be insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined. This could have included cricket patrons, while a potential impact on reporting was the application of stamp duty to newspapers as this increased their publication costs and probably caused publishers to reduce <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> with less room for sports coverage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{formula that}} gives the larger border of the <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> An in metres and without {{rounding}} off is the geometric sequence: [...] The <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> An thus has the dimension [...] and area (before rounding off) [...]|$|E
2500|$|The most used of {{this series}} is the size A4 which is [...] and so almost [...] square metres in area. For comparison, the letter <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> {{commonly}} used in North America (...) is about 6mm (0.24in) wider and 18mm (0.71in) shorter than A4.|$|E

50|$|The {{principal}} countries {{not generally}} using the ISO <b>paper</b> <b>sizes</b> are the United States and Canada, which use the Letter, Legal and Executive system. Although {{they have also}} officially adopted the ISO 216 paper format, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, and Chile also use mostly U.S. <b>paper</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Older LaserJet {{printers}} do {{not automatically}} resize a page when the page {{size of a}} document does not match the paper that is loaded in the printer. When trying to print a document whose <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> is set to [...] "letter" [...] on A4-sized paper the message occurs. The error [...] "PC LOAD A4" [...] appears in countries using this <b>paper</b> <b>size.</b> However, as many (American-written) programs use [...] "letter" [...] as the default format, the confusing message is often encountered by non-American users who are unaware of the recovery procedure (empty print queue and printer buffer or press [...] "Shift/Continue" [...] and in extreme cases, restart printer and repeat). The LaserJet 5 introduced an easy-to-find [...] "GO" [...] button to override the warning message.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "PC LOAD LETTER" [...] {{message is}} {{encountered}} when printing on older HP LaserJet printers {{such as the}} LaserJet II, III, and 4 series.

2500|$|In 1786, the German {{scientist}} Georg Christoph Lichtenberg {{described the}} advantages of basing a <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> on an aspect ratio of [...] {{in a letter to}} Johann Beckmann.

2500|$|Colorists applied {{each color}} in assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work). The {{original}} edition was engraved in aquatint by Robert Havell, Jr., {{who took over}} the task after the first ten plates engraved by W. H. Lizars were deemed inadequate. Known as the Double Elephant folio after its double elephant <b>paper</b> <b>size,</b> it is often regarded as the greatest picture book ever produced and the finest aquatint work. By the 1830s, the aquatint process was largely superseded by lithography. A contemporary French critic wrote, [...] "A magic power transported us into the forests which for so many years this man of genius has trod. Learned and ignorant alike were astonished at the spectacle...It is a real and palpable vision of the New World." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{error message}} {{comprises}} three parts. [...] "PC" [...] is an abbreviation for [...] "paper cassette", the tray which holds blank paper for the printer to use. These two-character codes are a legacy feature carried {{over from the}} first LaserJet printers, which could only use a two-character display for all printer status and error messages. [...] "Load", in this context, is an instruction to refill the paper tray. [...] "Letter" [...] is the standard <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> (8 1⁄2 × 11 in.) used in the United States and Canada. [...] Thus, the error is instructing the user to refill the paper tray with letter-sized paper. A variant is [...] "PC LOAD LEGAL", meaning that the printer needs more legal size (8 1⁄2 × 14 in.) paper.|$|E
2500|$|The message confuses {{people for}} several reasons. The {{abbreviation}} [...] "PC" [...] may mislead {{because it is}} widely understood — especially {{in the context of}} electronic office equipment — to mean [...] "personal computer", suggesting to many that the problem lies in the computer, not the printer. The word [...] "LOAD" [...] is also ambiguous, as it can also refer to the transfer of electronic data between disk and memory. Furthermore, the word [...] "LETTER" [...] is associated with <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> only in the US, Canada and some Latin American countries; A4 is the standard size used {{in the rest of the}} world. Thus, users encountering this message may believe that they are being instructed to transfer the data or content of their typed letter (as in correspondence) to the printer, even though they have already sent the job to the printer.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>paper</b> <b>size</b> is 'double folio', {{with two}} pages printed {{on each side}} (four pages per sheet). After {{printing}} the paper was folded once {{to the size of}} a single page. Typically, five of these folded sheets (10 leaves, or 20 printed pages) were combined to a single physical section, called a quinternion, that could then be bound into a book. Some sections, however, had as few as four leaves or as many as 12 leaves. Some sections may have been printed in a larger number, especially those printed later in the publishing process, and sold unbound. The pages were not numbered. The technique was not new, since it had been used to make blank [...] "white-paper" [...] books to be written afterwards. What was new was determining beforehand the correct placement and orientation of each page on the five sheets to result in the correct sequence when bound. The technique for locating the printed area correctly on each page was also new.|$|E
