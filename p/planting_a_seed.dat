50|$|Ficus carica were ideal {{candidates}} for domestication {{because they are}} one of the most easily proliferated of all fruit trees. By simply <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed,</b> or cutting off either a limb of the fig tree or a part the fruit itself, there is the potential to grow and entirely new individual. The ability to produce many more plants in such a relaxed manner may have been appealing to the early consumers of figs. Fig trees can also withstand harsh, varying temperatures. This may have been attractive as well because the people would not have to worry about their plants dying every time the weather fluctuated from the norm. Along with their rigidity, Ficus carica produces 3 crops throughout the year, so the yield from these plants would be significantly worth the effort put into growing them. Figs are known for containing a very large amount of sugar. Perhaps the sweetness of these fruits also played a small role in their domestication, as it would have made them more desirable to the human appetite.|$|E

Building a house would entail no more work than <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> in the ground. These scenarios may seem far-fetched, but pioneering geneticist George Church and science writer Ed Regis show that synthetic biology is bringing us ever closer to making such visions a reality. In "Regenesis," Church and Regis explorethe possibilities [...] and perils [...] of the emerging field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology, in which living organisms are selectively altered by modifying substantial portions of their genomes, allows for the creation of entirely new species of organisms. Until now, nature has been the exclusive arbiter of life, death, and evolution; with synthetic biology, we now have the potential to write our own biological future. Indeed, as Church and Regis show, it even enables us to revisit crucial points in the evolution of life and, through synthetic biological techniques, choose different paths from those nature originally took. Such exploits will involve far more than just microbial tinkering. Full-blown genomic engineering will make possible incredible feats, from resurrecting woolly mammoths and other extinct organisms to creating mirror life forms with a molecular structure the opposite of our own. These technologies [...] far from the out-of-control nightmare depicted in science fiction [...] have the power to improve human and animal health, increase our intelligence, enhance our memory, and even extend our life span.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a Seed System Security Assessment in Eastern and Coastal Kenya, implemented September 2011, several weeks prior to the time of planting. The assessment focused on result of Long Rains (LR) 2011, and immediate projections for Short Rains (SR) 2011 <b>planting.</b> <b>A</b> <b>seed</b> system security assessment (SSSA) reviews the functioning of seed systems which farmers use, both formal and informal. It assesses whether seed of adequate quality is available and whether farmers can access it. The approach also promotes strategic thinking about the relief, recovery or development vision ne eded. For instance, during the stress period, should aid aim to restore the system as it was, ex ante, or aim to strengthen it? ASSSA goes well beyond a conventional seed needs assessment as it hones in on specific seed security problems communities face, and then steers response to actions which alleviate specific constraints, and often improve systems. (F or full description of method, see [URL]). Three sites were chosen for the assessment : in Kathonzweni, Tharaka North and Magarini. The sites include zones where participating non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been prepared to address seed security-related constraints and opportunities. The three selected sites also represent well the cross-section of the regions in which drought-stressed agriculture and seed aid continue to unfold. Within Tharaka North, a fourth site, was also assessed, tied specifically to Internally-Displaced Persons (IDPs) suffering from prolonged land disputes. This report {{presents the}} seed security findings and recommendations across all four sites. Site-specific reports and recommendations tailored for each site have been posted separately and can be obtained through Catholic Relief Services (Mwende. Kusewa@crs. org).

40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi de avaliar o crescimento, a marcha de absorÃÃo e acÃmulo de nutrientes e a produtividade da cultura do pinhÃo manso na regiÃo oeste do ParanÃ. Para produÃÃo das mudas utilizou-se sementes procedentes de Dourados-MS sendo plantada uma semente por tubete de 120 cm 3 de substrato. O tempo de formaÃÃo das mudas foi de 60 dias apÃs semeadura. O experimento foi conduzido a campo no perÃodo de dezembro de 2009 a dezembro 2011, em espaÃamento 3 x 2 m, em um Latossolo Vermelho distrÃfico (LVd) na EstaÃÃo Experimental de Pato Bragado-PR, pertencente ao NÃcleo de EstaÃÃes Experimentais da Universidade Estadual do ParanÃ, sob as coordenadas geogrÃficas 24 Â 39 â 43 âS e 54 Â 15 â 53 âW, e {{altitude}} de 247 m. Durante a conduÃÃo do experimento foi realizada adubaÃÃo de cobertura com 40 kg ha - 1 de N e 40 kg ha - 1 de K 2 O anualmente. O delineamento experimental foi em blocos com quatro repetiÃÃes, sendo utilizada uma planta de cada bloco aos 90, 180, 270, 360, 450, 540, 630 e 720 dias apÃs o transplantio (DAT), as quais apÃs as medidas nÃo destrutivas foram cortadas rente ao solo e separadas em folhas, caule, pecÃolos e inflorescÃncia e frutos, e postas para secar. As avaliaÃÃes do crescimento das plantas consistiram da medida da altura de planta, diÃmetro de caule, nÃmero de folhas, Ãrea da copa, massa de matÃria seca de folhas, pecÃolo, ramos e frutos, quando presentes, determinaÃÃo da Ãrea foliar (AF), taxa de crescimento absoluto e relativo (TCA e TCR), razÃo de Ãrea foliar (RAF), razÃo peso de folha (RPF) e Ãndice de Ãrea foliar (IAF). Para a anÃlise quÃmica dos nutrientes, amostras representativas dos diferentes ÃrgÃos da planta foram passadas em moinho tipo Willye e armazenadas para futura determinaÃÃo dos elementos minerais. Para determinaÃÃo da quantidade total de nutrientes acumulados em cada parte da planta, a concentraÃÃo de cada nutriente foi multiplicada pela massa da matÃria seca do referido ÃrgÃo, em cada Ãpoca de amostragem. O acompanhamento da produÃÃo de frutos foi realizado em Ãrea adicional, em 32 plantas selecionadas. A cultura do pinhÃo manso apresenta crescimento linear em altura e diÃmetro da base nos primeiros anos de cultivo. O pinhÃo manso apresentou um perÃodo de repouso vegetativo bem definido, sendo este nos meses de marÃo a setembro; a maior massa de matÃria seca de folhas, massa de pecÃolo e o maior nÃmero de folhas ocorrem no mÃs de dezembro de cada ano juntamente com a maior Ãrea foliar com incremento de mais de 100 % neste parÃmetro de um ano a outro; a taxa de crescimento absoluto (TCA) e o Ãndice de Ãrea foliar apresentam maiores valores no final de cada ano, jÃ a taxa de crescimento relativo (TCR), a razÃo de Ãrea foliar (RAF) e a razÃo peso de folhas apresentam maiores valores no inÃcio de cada ano; a produÃÃo do pinhÃo manso apresenta valores de 93 g por planta aos 18 meses de idade, com perÃodo de colheita nos meses {{de janeiro}} a julho na regiÃo. O acÃmulo total de macronutrientes obedeceu a seguinte ordem decrescente: K>Ca>N>Mg>P>S, mesma ordem apresentada pelo caule, ÃrgÃo este responsÃvel pelo maior acÃmulo de nutrientes. Os macronutrientes P, K e Mg apresentam redistribuiÃÃo para o caule no perÃodo de senescÃncia foliar. Nas sementes maduras a ordem de acÃmulo de nutrientes encontrada foi: N>Ca>K>Mg>P>S, e no fruto inteiro foi: N>K>Ca>P>Mg>S. O acÃmulo total de micronutrientes obedeceu a seguinte ordem: Mn>Fe>Zn>B>Cu>Mo, e em frutos maduros a ordem foi: Fe>Mn>B>Zn>Cu>Mo. Os micronutrientes Cu, Zn e Fe apresentam redistribuiÃÃo para o caule no perÃodo de senescÃncia foliar. A exportaÃÃo de macronutrientes pelos frutos Ã elevada, sendo necessÃrios 199, 69, e 306 kg ha - 1 de N, P 2 O 5 e K 2 O, respectivamente para produÃÃo de 4000 g/planta em uma populaÃÃo de 1667 plantas ha - 1. As recomendaÃÃes de adubaÃÃes de cobertura na regiÃo oeste do ParanÃ devem ser realizadas no perÃodo de setembro a marÃo, dependendo do regime hÃdrico, sugerindo-se utilizar formulados com a relaÃÃo N:P 2 O 5 :K 2 O de 2, 88 : 1, 0 : 4, 4. The {{objective of the}} study was to evaluate the growth, the gait of absorption and accumulation of nutrients and the crop yield of jatropha in the western region of ParanÃ. For production of seedlings we used seeds coming from Dourados - MS, <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> in each tub of 120 cm 3 of substrate. The time of formation of the seedlings was 60 days after sowing. The field experiment was carried out in the period of December 2009 to December 2011, in spaced of 3 x 2, in an Oxisol dystrophic anagen bulbs (O D A) at the experimental station of Pato Bragado â PR, belonging to the core of experimental stations of the State University of ParanÃ, under the geographical coordinates 24 39 â 43 âS e 54 15 â 53 âW and altitude of 247 meters. During the experimental conduction the fertilization of coverage with 40 kg ha - 1 of N and 40 kg ha - 1 of K 2 O annually. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with four replicates, and it used a plant of each block every 90, 180, 270, 360, 450, 540, 630 and 72 days after transplanting (DAT) which after the measures that were not destroyed were cut close to the soil and separated in leafs, stems, petioles and flower and fruit, and put up for drying. The assessments of the growth of the plants consisted of the measure of the height of the plant, the stem diameter number of leafs, area of the cup, mass of dry leaves, petiole, branches and fruits, when present, determination of leaf area LA, rate of absolute and relative growth (RAG and RRG), reason of leaf area (RLA), reason weight of leaf (RWL), and leaf area index (LAI). For the chemical analysis of nutrients, representative samples of the different components of the plant were passed in mill type Willye and stored for future determination of mineral elements. For determination of the total quantity of nutrients accumulated in each part of the plant the concentration of each nutrient was multiplied by the mass of the dry material of the said component in each time of sampling. The monitoring of fruit production, was performed in additional area, in 32 selected plants. The analysis data of growth, of dry material, concentration and accumulation of nutrients in each component were submitted to statistical analysis using the program Sigmaplot 12. The cultivation of jatropha presents linear growth in height and diameter of the base in the early years of cultivation. The jatropha curcas has a period of vegetative rest well defined, and it is in the months of March to September; the greatest mass of dry leaves, mass of petiole and the highest number of leaves occur in the month of December of each year along with the largest leaf area with increments of more than 100 % in this parameter from one year to another, the absolute growth rate (and the leaf area index (LAI) exhibit higher values at the end of each year, the relative growth rate, ratio of leaf area and the reason weight of leaves have higher values at the beginning of each year; the production of jatropha shows values of 93 g per plant at 18 months of age, with harvest period in the months of January to July in the region. The total accumulation of macronutrients followed the following descending order K, Ca,N,Mg,P,S. The macronutrients P, K, and Mg present redistribution to the stem in the period of leaf senescence. In the fruits (seed + shell) the order of accumulation was N,K,Ca, P, Mg, S. The total accumulation of micronutrients obeyed the following order: Mn, Fe, Zn, B, Cu, Mo and in ripe fruits the order was: Fe, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, Mo. The micronutrients Cu, Zn and Fe present redistribution to the stem in the period of leaf senescence. The export of macronutrients by fruits is high, and is needed 199, 69 and 306 kg ha- 1, of N, P 2 O 5 and K 2 O, respectively for the production of 4000 g/plant in a population of 1667 plants ha- 1. The recommendations for fertilization of coverage in the western region of ParanÃ must be carried out in the period from September to march, depending on the water regime it is suggested to use formulated with the relationship N:P 2 O 5, K 2 O of 2, 88 : 1, 0 : 4, 4...|$|E
