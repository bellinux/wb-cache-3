Of course, mate-rial overlapping is not physically realistic, and one possible way to prevent it uses a constrained minimization theory. In this theory, a minimization problem consists of mini-mizing the total <b>potential</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> a linear elastic body subject to the constraint that the deformation field be locally invertible. Aguiar (2004, 2006 a) have used, respectively, an interior and an exterior penalty formulation of the minimization problem together with a standard finite element method to compute the minimizers. The formulation consists of finding the displacement field that minimizes an augmented <b>potential</b> <b>energy</b> functional, which is composed <b>of</b> the <b>potential</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>elasticity</b> theory and <b>of</b> a penalty functional divided by a penalty parameter. In the interior penalty formulation, the penalty functional becomes unbounded {{as we approach the}} boundary of the set of all kinemati-cally admissible deformation fields from inside the set. A sequence of minimizers belong-ing to this set and parameterized by the penalty parameter is then constructed. As the penalty parameter becomes unbounded, the sequence is shown to converge to the solutio...|$|R
40|$|In Part I of this work, we {{have found}} a closed form {{expression}} for a minimizer <b>of</b> the total <b>potential</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> a circular homogeneous and aeolotropic pipe {{in the context of}} a constrained minimization theory that preserves injectivity. The pipe is in a state of plane deformation, is fixed at its inner surface, and is radially compressed along its outer surface. In general, however, constrained minimization problems are highly nonlinear and require a numerical solution. In this work, we use an exterior penalty formulation of the constrained minimization problem together with a standard finite element procedure to find an approximate solution of the constrained pipe problem. The exterior penalty formulation consists of finding the displacement field that minimizes an augmented <b>potential</b> <b>energy,</b> composed <b>of</b> both the <b>potential</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>elasticity</b> theory and a penalty functional divided by a penalty parameter, over all displacement fields that respect essential boundary conditions. A sequence of solutions, parameterized by the penalty parameter, is then constructed and is shown to converge to the solution of the constrained problem when this parameter tends to zero. The numerical procedure is then applied in the numerical solution of the constrained pipe problem. When compared to another numerical procedure presented in previous work, the procedure presented here yields sequences of solutions with better convergence properties. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} model for {{analysing}} static problems of three-dimensional thin panel constructions is presented. The <b>potential</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> stretching of each panel {{is represented by the}} classical Reissner formulation <b>of</b> two-dimensional <b>elasticity,</b> and in the finite element discretisation piecewise constant stresses and piecewise linear u-, v- displacements are used. The <b>potential</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> bending of each panel is represented in the finite element discretisation by Herrmann's model, i. e. piecewise constant moments and piecewise linear w- displacements. The physical appropriateness of the model is verified for different assemblages of panels, and in all cases good numerical results are obtained. 1. The description of the model.
