5|$|The game {{offers a}} number of {{traditional}} Mario items, such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman, along with new power-ups that bestow special suits onto Mario and grant him new abilities. Returning from Super Mario Bros. 3 is the Super Leaf <b>power-up,</b> which gives Mario the Tanooki suit, allowing him to float {{in the air and}} attack with his tail, with a later variant also allowing him to transform into a statue upon performing a ground pound. The player is able to reserve an extra <b>power-up,</b> which can be retrieved by tapping the item visible on the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the speeder must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for the vehicles, they can explode if allowed to overheat. Heat builds up from acceleration and from collisions. To counteract this, the player may activate the onboard cooler, however, this will slow the vehicle down. Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice <b>power-up</b> can cool the vehicle without a speed penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are rewarded}} with cash for {{attaining}} high speeds, placing highly in races and obtaining the Flip-Score <b>power-up.</b> Cash {{can be used}} in between races to upgrade their speeder by purchasing new parts. Parts are split into four categories - chassis, cooler, engine and front shield, with each affecting the speeder in different ways. Some tracks may favour a particular set-up over others.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Power-ups</b> are {{provided}} at various levels. List of <b>power-ups</b> includes: ...|$|R
50|$|Each suit is also {{equipped}} with a backpack unit that can use backpack <b>power-ups.</b> These backpack <b>power-ups</b> are rocket launcher, grenade launcher, mine layer, and gravity inverter. Like the suit's ranged gun, the backpack unit may be disabled if the suit takes significant damage. Other <b>power-ups</b> suits can use are health <b>power-ups</b> (instantly restoring a damaged suit to full health), and various upgrades for the suit's primary gun.|$|R
5000|$|Shields and Force Fields: Unlike Gradius, which labels {{shield and}} force field <b>power-ups</b> as [...] "?", Parodius games label such <b>power-ups</b> properly.|$|R
5|$|Speeders have a boost meter, {{showing how}} much fuel is {{available}} for the onboard speed boost. Although the boost provides greater speeds and acceleration than the standard throttle, it also increases the speeder's heat levels. Designated booster load zones along the track replenish the meter, and a super boost <b>power-up</b> is available which doubles the potency of the boost.|$|E
5|$|With stone, needle, flame, and spark power-ups, Kirby can {{transform}} {{to interact with}} blocks differently. For instance, the spark <b>power-up</b> lets Kirby break through otherwise indestructible blocks, and the needle lets Kirby hit spikes once without losing a life. The game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in-game when played with the Super Game Boy.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{alternate}} outfits for Batman were revealed in August 2011, including suit designs {{worn by the}} character in The Dark Knight Returns, , the Bronze Age of Comics, , and Batman Beyond. The Batman: The Animated Series skin was initially only available to GameStop customers in the U.S. with a <b>Power-Up</b> Rewards Membership. A PlayStation 3-exclusive Sinestro Corps outfit was revealed in August 2011 that initially was only unlockable via a unique code obtained by purchasing the extended cut edition of the Warner Bros. film, Green Lantern on Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} weapons and <b>power-ups</b> can be found {{throughout}} the game. Defensive <b>power-ups</b> have {{a wide range of}} effects, such as providing temporary invincibility or slowing down enemies. Player ships also come equipped with a grapple gun, which allows the player to pick up distant <b>power-ups</b> more quickly. Unique for a scrolling shooter game, all <b>power-ups</b> can be targeted, shot, and bounced off the sides of a level, making them more difficult to acquire for other players.|$|R
5000|$|When defeated, some enemies provide <b>power-ups</b> that {{constantly}} change colour. A <b>power-up's</b> power {{is determined by}} its colour when the spaceship captures it.|$|R
50|$|Though {{similar to}} the arcade Darius entries, Darius Twin {{featured}} slightly different gameplay features, most notably in the player's <b>power-ups.</b> Players collected weapon and shield <b>power-ups</b> from square shaped enemies that approached the player from the front and behind, but once players died after collecting {{a certain number of}} <b>power-ups,</b> the <b>power-ups</b> the player collected stayed with the ship post-destruction. Players 1 and 2 were allowed their own separate number of lives, but there were no continues in the game.|$|R
5|$|Defeated enemies {{would drop}} {{two types of}} items: cards, which either {{unlocked}} new characters or allowed the player to boost their characters' stats when increasing their level; and bullets, {{which could be used}} on cards that had been increased to their maximum level, to transform them into higher-ranking cards. The player could also find other <b>power-up</b> items scattered in the arenas, which could be used to increase the speed or strength of their characters, recover health points, or make aiming easier.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2014, in {{partnership}} with (RED) and Apple Inc., an update to the app were was exclusive to iOS. In this update, there was added special (RED)-themed Golden Egg level and Red's power from the Red's Mighty Feathers episode as a stand-alone <b>power-up,</b> that when purchased, can be used indefinitely (1 use per level) and 100% of the money went to the Global Fund to end AIDS. This purchase was only available until December 7.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{similarities}} {{however, the}} gameplay offered many new changes. Instead of collecting four Jet Pods, the player-character must rescue four MuuMuus in each level before exiting. Another new addition {{is the new}} interface, which displays one of Robbit's travelling AI companions, a health bar, a timer and a jump-meter that displays {{whether or not the}} player is eligible for a triple jump. Other new additions include the power orbs as an added <b>power-up</b> and the ability to obtain Performance Medals. A certain Performance Medal may be awarded depending on how the player completes a level. For example, playing through a single level without firing any weapons will reward the player with the Flower Child medal. There are a total of twelve medals to collect.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} coins that player has to catch. He can buy for them some <b>power-ups</b> like pistols. <b>Power-ups</b> {{can also be}} bought for real money.|$|R
50|$|The game's main mode, {{which allows}} Pac-Man to equip {{up to three}} <b>power-ups,</b> {{requires}} credits which are replenished over time (the player can purchase unlimited credits with real money). Alternatively, the player can use Free Play, which can be played at any time without <b>power-ups.</b> Credits {{can also be used}} to revive the player once per game. However, in version 2.0 the credits system was removed, continues (revives) uses coins or videos instead, and <b>power-ups</b> are unlocked over time and the player always can use the <b>power-ups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The game {{includes}} 5 <b>power-ups</b> that {{do different}} things. The first available power {{up is the}} [...] "Vitamin", which slows down time for a specific amount of seconds. The other <b>power-ups</b> do various things, like auto-sort an amount of stock, give a money multiplier, or change top stocks to special ones. To get the <b>power-ups,</b> the player spends money in the [...] "Black Market".|$|R
5|$|Enemies {{range from}} camouflaged plants to large {{vultures}} to Komodo dragon-like lizards and huge leviathan in water. Many enemies can kill the Slugcat in one hit, and some species have internal variation, {{such as the}} pink lizards that can climb. The enemies spawn at random, such that the player cannot progress {{through trial and error}} experimentation. These creatures possess dynamic AI and exist in the game's world perpetually, even when not on the same screen as the player. The player does, however, need to experiment with spears to climb walls and knock fruit out of trees. The Slugcat can hold two objects at once and switch between them. It can also eat <b>power-up</b> plants, which grant status effects, such as slowing time.|$|E
5|$|The red-and-white spotted {{toadstool}} is {{a common}} image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden ornaments and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes. Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two {{of the most famous}} uses of the mushroom are in the video game series Super Mario Bros. (specifically two of the <b>power-up</b> items and the platforms in several stages), and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film Fantasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first <b>power-up</b> of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
50|$|When obtained, {{missiles}} are fired automatically {{together with the}} main weapon and work on air targets. Four <b>power-ups</b> are needed for full power. Like weapon <b>power-ups,</b> these cycle between the possible choices: Nuclear Missiles and Homing Missiles.|$|R
50|$|As stated above, {{gameplay}} is {{very similar}} to the Gradius series, with a few exceptions. For one, there is an impressive array of characters to choose from. Each one of these characters utilizes different weapons and abilities as you obtain <b>power-ups.</b> The second main difference is the addition of bell <b>power-ups,</b> from the TwinBee series. These bells act as one-time <b>power-ups,</b> allowing you to destroy every enemy on screen, fire huge beams of energy, etc.|$|R
50|$|Categorised by colour, {{the game}} {{features}} twenty <b>Power-Ups</b> {{in groups of}} ten blue, five red, and five grey. Basically, the blue <b>Power-Ups</b> are considered good, while red increase the difficulty, and grey may {{vary depending on the}} situation.|$|R
5|$|Wipeout is {{a racing}} game that {{is set in}} 2052, where players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league. The game allows the player to pilot one of a {{selection}} of craft in races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over <b>power-up</b> pads found on the tracks, the player can pick up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft.|$|E
5|$|Players will {{be granted}} {{experience}} points upon each match. After they have collected sufficient experience points, players can level up, by which new armor, skins, weapons, and power-ups would be unlocked for players to use. Both the player character and weapon can be customized extensively by applying new skins and colors onto them. In addition, players can receive hack modules while playing the game, which are special abilities {{that can only}} be used once after they are collected. There are six types of modules. Scout reveals the locations of all enemies to the player for a limited time after respawning, while Vital Signs shows all enemies' health. Retribution allows players to track their last killer by showing their health and location, while Power Seeker guides players to the power weapon pickup in the game. The Resupply Timer, meanwhile, shows the respawn time of the <b>power-up</b> items. Players can also perform taunts in the game's multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{levels are}} {{available}} in each of eight worlds, which are shown in the Nintendo DS' bottom touchscreen while viewing the world map. The map of the currently selected world appears in the top screen, {{which is used to}} navigate between the world's levels. The goal of each level is to reach a black flag {{at the end of the}} level. At the end of each world, a boss must be defeated before proceeding to the next world. There are six power-ups available in New Super Mario Bros.; the game allows the player to store an extra <b>power-up</b> when he is already using one, a feature carried over from Super Mario World. Three power-ups from Super Mario Bros. return: the Super Mushroom makes Mario grow in size, the Fire Flower lets Mario throw fireballs, and the Starman makes Mario temporarily invincible. Three more power-ups are introduced in New Super Mario Bros.: the Blue Koopa Shell lets Mario withdraw into a shell to protect himself, the Mega Mushroom grows Mario to an incredible size, and the Mini-Mushroom makes Mario very small.|$|E
50|$|It is a tube shooter {{based on}} the classic arcade game Tempest. The {{gameplay}} expands upon that of the original by including <b>power-ups</b> which grant the player additional abilities. The option is available to play without <b>power-ups,</b> however.|$|R
5000|$|Gradius III (PS2) - Pausing {{the game}} and {{entering}} [...] will activate all <b>power-ups</b> and the Laser weapon. Alternately, pressing [...] and [...] in place of [...] and [...] will activate the Double weapon with the other <b>power-ups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Players must {{navigate}} {{a series}} of levels, defeating enemies by blowing them up with Bomberman's infinite supply of bombs. Unlike previous games, <b>power-ups</b> are added to an inventory to be used when the player wishes, rather than activated immediately upon collection. <b>Power-ups</b> in the player's inventory are carried over should the player lose a life, but those which have been used have their effects canceled. A total of 18 different <b>power-ups</b> {{are available in the}} game.|$|R
5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag {{and return it to}} their own base whilst preventing the other team from doing the same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas of the map, attempting to take hold of an object {{for as long as possible}} while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent <b>power-up.</b> These match types may also be customizable, allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during <b>power-up</b> after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} hosts {{a maximum}} of 16 players. The game features three standard game modes along with modes exclusive to each system: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Sabotage (exclusive to Xbox and PC), The Hunt (exclusive to PC, PS2 and GameCube), and <b>Power-Up</b> (exclusive to PC and PS2). Depending on the platform, players in online and offline modes (against bots) range from 4 to 16. The GameCube version {{does not have any}} online modes, while the PC version excludes the multi-screen modes but includes a map editor. There are 13 maps on Deathmatch plus one additional on Team Deathmatch, while 5 on Capture the Flag and 3 on Sabotage. The player can choose from among 10 different character appearances, but 99 more are available in unofficial skin packs for PC players, the most recent being 2.0. Four additional animal skins (shark, duck, bat, dog, seagull) may be downloaded. As their bodies are not realistically proportioned, new or inexperienced players may face difficulty in distinguishing the skin's exact body. Cheating in both multiplayer and singleplayer is possible, as the software does not include any anti-cheat protection.|$|E
50|$|Health and weapon <b>power-ups</b> can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the game. Weapon <b>power-ups</b> available include a machine gun, shotgun, flamethrower, acid bath gun, {{and an increase in}} the standard gun's magazine capacity. They can be obtained by shooting floating icons, such as a shotgun shell or a barrel of acid; the weapons cannot be reloaded, but the magazine increase remains in effect until the player's life meter is empty. Grabbing these <b>power-ups</b> also provides bonus points to the player.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} {{a total of}} twenty <b>power-ups,</b> which may cause a variety of effects in the game. While {{the majority of these}} are direct clones from DX-Ball 2, Ice Ball and Chain Lightning are two new additions, replacing Falling Bricks and Level Warp. Also, unlike in DX-Ball 2, the ball size of small balls and big balls can be restored to its default medium size, when catching the Big Ball and Tiny Ball <b>power-ups,</b> respectively. However, the Fire Ball and Ice Ball <b>power-ups</b> will always come into effect and remain as big balls, regardless of any conditions. The difficulty setting will determine which <b>power-ups</b> are available during the game and how they behave (see Standard Game).|$|R
50|$|Gigandes is a {{horizontal}} scrolling shooter arcade game released by East Technology. Spanning eight stages, the player's ship kept {{all of its}} weapon <b>power-ups</b> if they lost a life, but would promptly lose the <b>power-ups</b> and items once they started the next stage.|$|R
