[...] Likewise, Thurm called it the [...] "most exciting moment" [...] in the miniseries and that the song [...] "is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> perfect Adventure Time song.

Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's [...] "delicate upper range is nicely attuned {{to some of}} the ballads, but anything that requires belting is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> loss". Mark Edwards of The Times called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his [...] "trademark delivery" [...] is [...] "lazy and somewhat slurred".

Sandberg praised backup shortstop Freddy Galvis' attitude (which many in the media saw as the manager {{sending a message to}} the team that no one – including Rollins – was above team rules), and one column examined the point at which Rollins ceased being the team's unquestioned leader. Rollins (who had a good relationship with former manager Charlie Manuel) said, [...] "He's [...] completely different from Charlie from the very onset, their personalities.

Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am.

English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have.

[...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! called it [...] "so well written, produced, acted and directed {{it felt like a}} movie". [...] Michael Ausiello of TV Guide described it as [...] "easily one of the best hours of TV so far this season." [...] Bruce Fretts of TV Guide responded well to Reddick's performance.

500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"
