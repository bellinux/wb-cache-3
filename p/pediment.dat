5|$|Built of limestone, {{in classic}} Palladian style, the {{southern}} façade {{takes the form}} of a temple-like central bay with symmetrical wings connecting to two flanking, terminating pavilions. The central bay is given eminence by a broken <b>pediment</b> supported by austere Doric pillasters. It in turn is flanked by two small bays, each with a small pointed <b>pediment</b> supported by shallow pilasters, which further emphasise and complement the central broken <b>pediment</b> sitting above a large Palladian window– the focal point of the building. On this southern side the structure comprises a principal floor at street level, with a low mezzanine separated by stone banding above. Beneath the principal floor is a sub-floor constructed in the masonry between the spans of the bridge, its presence indicated by ocular windows placed symmetrically beneath the span of each arch. This ocular motif, on a reduced scale, is repeated symmetrically at mezzanine level beneath the central broken <b>pediment.</b> The two terminating pavilions, in reality slight projections, have shallow saucer domes concealed behind their pointed pediments. The roof is pitched and of Welsh slate.|$|E
5|$|Classical {{sculpture}} {{covers the}} <b>pediment</b> above the front colonnade, with {{the seal of}} the State of Illinois dominating the relief. Stained glass windows can be found topping the third floor windows. The cornice on the roof consists of three rows of eight balustrades and stone blocks. A common decorative ornament in Greek Revival and Classical Revival architecture {{can be found in}} an anthemion {{at the peak of the}} <b>pediment.</b> The courthouse roof is enclosed in stonework and balustrades.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} Cretaceous period {{and into the}} early Tertiary, there was {{uplifting}} {{in the area of}} the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde <b>pediment</b> with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde <b>pediment</b> from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.|$|E
40|$|Pediplains {{are formed}} by the {{coalescence}} of <b>pediments</b> and by implication are of considerable areal extent. But {{the nature of the}} component <b>pediments</b> {{and the size of the}} area covered have not been specified. Three types of <b>pediments</b> of similar morphology but of different structure, distribution and perceived origins, have been described. Mantled <b>pediments</b> of etch origin are the most widely distributed and examples now lacking a backing scarp are recognized. Selected Australian regions are considered as possible as examples of pediplains. Areas of regional extent with prominent mantled <b>pediments</b> but also significant areas of upland and alluviated plains are differentiated from <b>pedimented</b> landscapes in which scarpless mantled forms are dominant. Many suggested pediplains are also inselberg landscapes. C. R. Twidale and J. A. Bourn...|$|R
5000|$|Hamley House (c.1840), {{the other}} <b>pedimented</b> Greek Revival house. It has a [...] "handsome <b>pedimented</b> portico with its open work columns which {{dates from the}} 1870's." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{house built}} by John Congreve in about 1700 was {{originally}} two-storeyed with dormers above, a three-bay <b>pedimented</b> central block and two-bayed wings {{with a central}} <b>pedimented</b> entrance door.|$|R
5|$|The Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town, South Africa, {{was built}} in 1666. The gateway {{was built in}} 1682, with a <b>pediment</b> and two pilasters of grey-blue stone, and an {{entrance}} made of the small yellow bricks called ijseltene (IJssel stones).|$|E
5|$|The attic is {{tall and}} embraces the second floor. It has moulded stone coping and a small <b>pediment</b> in the centre, which is {{supported}} by an entablature decorated with triglyphs and modillions.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} remodelled again under the 3rd Baron Coleraine's ownership. An extra range of rooms {{was added to}} the north, and the <b>pediment</b> of the north front ornamented with a large coat of the Coleraine arms.|$|E
5000|$|In 1877 Grove Karl Gilbert first {{observed}} <b>pediments</b> in the Henry Mountains in Utah. He {{described the}} formation as [...] "hills of [...] {{cut across the}} upturned edges of tilted beds". Gilbert believed the origin of <b>pediments</b> in the Henry Mountains are due to stream [...] and active erosion of deserts. This theory was advocated by Paige (1912), Blackwelder (1931), and Johnson 1932. Johnson came up with three zones of <b>pediments.</b>|$|R

5|$|The inner baroque façade, {{which is}} part of the 1734 church built by the Jesuits, is {{decorated}} with pilasters, capitals, blind niches and volutes. It is patterned after the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros, with two levels, a triangular <b>pediment,</b> and two narrow octagonal bell towers on each side. The neoclassical portico houses niches for Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Along the <b>pediment</b> is a wooden bas-relief on galvanized iron of the papal tiara over crossed keys (the symbol of Saint Peter) on the center and medallions carrying the icons of the Augustinians and Saint Peter on both ends.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular <b>pediment,</b> again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular <b>pediment.</b> That <b>pediment</b> was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E
5|$|When the Students' Building opened, {{it stood}} two stories tall with a basement, {{as well as}} wooden pillars on its facade {{supporting}} a <b>pediment.</b> A cupola topped the structure and stairs beneath the <b>pediment</b> led to a three sets of double doors—one large, the others smaller but otherwise identical. Above each set of doors was a single large window. In the 1973 renovation, two red brick wings {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the building to accommodate numerous dining rooms. Featuring large windows, the new wings were more modern in their style than the old central portion of the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{symmetrical}} principal facade faces Church Street. It {{is dominated}} by two <b>pediments</b> at each end that are supported by four monumental engaged Doric columns. A frieze with incised triglyphs and a dentil (rectangular block) course is found beneath the <b>pediments.</b> The Lee Street elevation features a colonnade of eight Doric columns, while the Court Street elevation contains three-story pilasters. Entrances have bronze doors with <b>pediments</b> decorated with eagles and floral scrolls.|$|R
50|$|Numbers 1 to 21 are 3 storey {{houses with}} mansard roofs. Each {{building}} has matching doors and widows with central <b>pediments</b> and flat entablatures {{either side of}} the 1st floor windows and Tuscan pilasters and <b>pediments</b> to the doorways.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows are}} {{rectangular}} with <b>pediments.</b> The portico entrance doors are also <b>pedimented.</b> The buildings were topped with an entablature with architrave and an unadorned frieze with a dentiled cornice. The building {{has a low}} roof with an open balustrade.|$|R
5|$|Miller made Pflueger {{his junior}} partner {{following}} their {{completion of the}} US$80,000 San Francisco Stock Exchange building at 350 Bush Street in 1923. The firm conducted business as Miller and Pflueger. The building at 350 Bush, a neoclassic design topped with a <b>pediment</b> displaying a sculpture by Jo Mora and later called the San Francisco Mining Exchange, is currently empty; it was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 113 in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} comprises a compact, three-storey house, in the Dutch-classical style {{which was}} introduced into England by Sir Roger Pratt, and {{is typical of}} Bruce's work. The six-bay entrance front has a two-bay projecting central section, surmounted by a <b>pediment</b> topped by three pineapples, of which one remains. The tympanum is carved with the coat of arms of the Earl and his wife, with their initials (WEA and SCA for William, Earl of Annandale, and Sophia Countess of Annandale) and the date 1699. The roof behind was bell-cast, with a cupola and four tall chimneys symmetrically placed, although this was replaced in the 1950s. The centrally placed entrance is reached by steps, and surmounted by carved decorations. The garden front is similar, and is also topped by a decorated <b>pediment.</b> Once the house was complete, two wings connected by curved passages were added. These incorporated additional accommodation and a library, but the passages and south wing were later demolished.|$|E
5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base <b>pediment.</b> The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base <b>pediment</b> over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house. The property also had a dairy barn that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
50|$|The front facade is richly detailed, {{while other}} {{elevations}} are more perfunctory. The front facade has three bays, expressed with rusticated pilasters and parapet decoration comprising <b>pediments</b> either end and a central name plaque. The <b>pediments</b> are flanked by acroteria, and the plaque is inscribed {{with the words}} PLOUGH INN. The <b>pediments</b> and plaques are connected by a miniature balustrade, and rest on a deep cornice with dentils, separated by another band of decoration from a second cornice.|$|R

5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} {{example of}} a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken <b>pediment</b> with a small oculus. Between each pair of columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{siege of}} Copenhagen in 1807, the mansion served as {{headquarters}} of General Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. Built in the Baroque style with yellow-rendered masonry and red tile roofing, the four-winged complex {{consists of a}} two-storey main wing, two one-storey lateral wings and a curved gate wing opening onto the Stændertorvet. The four wings are connected by curving galleries. Facing the courtyard, the façade of the main wing has pilasters and a median risalit tipped by a triangular <b>pediment</b> decorated with the royal coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|The Masonic Hall {{sits at the}} {{southern}} end of a terrace. It has a stucco front, with two pairs of Ionic pilasters; the larger ones frame the building, and appear to support an overhanging cornice with a decorative dentil finish. The smaller pilasters are either side of a large doorway, and are topped by a <b>pediment.</b> The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building. On {{the southern}} side of the building, more Ionic pilasters rise the height of the building, spread between four large windows.|$|E

5|$|The Sicilian belfry. Belfrys {{were not}} placed beside {{the church in}} a campanile tower as is common in Italy, but on the façade itself, often surmounting the central <b>pediment,</b> {{with one or more}} bells clearly {{displayed}} beneath its own arch, such as at Catania's Collegiata (Illustration 1). In a large church with many bells this usually resulted in an intricately sculpted and decorated arcade at the highest point of the principal façade (Illustration 3). These belfries are among the most enduring and characteristic features of Sicilian Baroque architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. Stained glass, columns and a <b>pediment</b> are among the more noticeable features at a glance. The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more stained glass, {{in the form of}} a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
5|$|The former St John the Evangelist's Church {{was listed}} at Grade II on 20 August 1971. It is a Greek Revival-style stucco-clad {{building}} {{of stone and}} brick with a partly hipped roof. The three-bay façade has four Tuscan pilasters beneath a substantial entablature and <b>pediment.</b> The frieze between them has metopes and triglyphs. Work by L.A. Mackintosh in 1957 altered the exterior; the architect added his personal monogram and an eagle emblem (representing John the Evangelist) above {{the left and right}} entrances respectively.|$|E
