40|$|NSR 1 is a yeast nuclear {{localization}} sequence-binding protein showing striking {{similarity in}} its domain structure to nucleolin. Cells lacking NSR 1 are viable {{but have a}} severe growth defect. We show here that NSR 1, like nucleolin, is involved in ribosome biogenesis. The nsr 1 mutant is deficient in pre-rRNA processing such that the initial 35 S pre-rRNA processing is blocked and 20 S pre-rRNA is nearly absent. The reduced amount of 20 S pre-rRNA leads to a shortage of 18 S rRNA and is reflected in {{a change in the}} distribution of 60 S and 40 S ribosomal subunits; there is no free pool of 40 S subunits, and the free pool of 60 S subunits is greatly increased in size. The lack of free 40 S subunits or the improper assembly of these subunits causes the nsr 1 mutant to show sensitivity to the antibiotic paromomycin, which affects protein translation, at concentrations that do not affect the growth of the wild-type strain. Our data support the idea that NSR 1 is involved in the <b>proper</b> <b>assembly</b> of pre-rRNA particles, possibly by bringing rRNA and ribosomal proteins together by virtue of its nuclear localization sequence-binding domain and multiple RNA recognition motifs. Alternatively, NSR 1 may also act to regulate the nuclear entry of ribosomal proteins required for <b>proper</b> <b>assembly</b> of pre-rRNA particles...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} coding for AIPL 1 cause Leber {{congenital}} amaurosis (LCA), a severe form of childhood blindness. The severity in disease {{is reflected in}} the complete loss of vision and rapid photoreceptor degeneration in the retinas of mice deficient in AIPL 1. Our previous observations suggest that rod photoreceptor degeneration in retinas lacking AIPL 1 is due to the massive reduction in levels of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE 6) subunits (α, β, and γ). To date, the crucial link between AIPL 1 and the stability of PDE 6 subunits is not known. In this study using ex vivo pulse label analysis, we demonstrate that AIPL 1 is not involved in the synthesis of PDE 6 subunits. However, ex vivo pulse-chase analysis clearly shows that in the absence of AIPL 1, rod PDE 6 subunits are rapidly degraded by proteasomes. We further demonstrate that this rapid degradation of PDE 6 is due to the essential role of AIPL 1 in the <b>proper</b> <b>assembly</b> of synthesized individual PDE 6 subunits. In addition, using a novel monoclonal antibody generated against AIPL 1, we show that the catalytic subunit (α) of PDE 6 associates with AIPL 1 in retinal extracts. Our studies establish that AIPL 1 interacts with the catalytic subunit (α) of PDE 6 and is needed for the <b>proper</b> <b>assembly</b> of functional rod PDE 6 subunits...|$|R

In the cases where disordered assembly is possible, the change from an ordered to a disordered state leads to a transition from function to dysfunction of the complex, since disordered assembly leads to aggregation.|$|R
