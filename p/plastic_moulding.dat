500|$|Adding to Sinclair's problems, {{production}} of the C5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that the <b>plastic</b> <b>moulding</b> attached to the gearbox was impairing {{the performance of their}} vehicles. 100 Hoover workers were shifted from the C5 production line to work on replacing the faulty mouldings on returned vehicles. Barrie Wills admitted that Sinclair was also taking the opportunity to [...] "adjust stocks" [...] {{in the light of the}} C5's poor sales. When production resumed a month later it was at only 10% of the previous level, with 90 of the workers being transferred back to the washing machine production lines. Only 100 C5s were now being produced a week, down from the original 1,000. Over 3,000 unsold C5s were piled up in storage at the Hoover factory, with additional unsold stock in 500 retail outlets nationwide.|$|E

40|$|There are {{multiple}} demands placed upon <b>plastic</b> <b>mould</b> steels, {{depending on the}} application they will have. Among these requirements, machinability has generally a great economic importance in mould steels and in pre-hardened mould steels in particular. The machining cost can exceed {{more than half of}} the cost of a mould. Nevertheless, to avoid subsequent heat treatment, distortion and dimensional inaccuracy, there has been the tendency to use even higher hardness in the pre-hardened mould steels, a hardness range of 38 - 40 HRC instead of 30 - 32 HRC. In this work, machinability of some of the most popular grades of pre-hardened <b>plastic</b> <b>mould</b> steel at 38 - 40 HRC is compared in two milling and two drilling operations. The materials have shown very different properties in different machining operations. This, beside the high requirements upon the <b>plastic</b> <b>mould</b> steels, such as polishability, hardness, impact toughness etc. makes it very complicated to improve these types of steels to be superior in all mould applications...|$|R

Among these requirements, machinability is of great economic importance. Mould steel influences the cost of plastic parts more through its machinability, since machining cost exceeds {{more than half of}} the cost of a mould. Milling and drilling are the machining operations that are mostly used in production of a mould and the highest volume of material removal performs through these two categories of operations and specially milling. Recently, there has been a high tendency to use prehardened mould steels with the hardness range of 38 - 40 HRC, for the higher demands on mechanical properties and wear resistance. Additionally, to avoid distortion and dimensional inaccuracy, the mould steels are supplied in prehardened condition which impairs their machinability.
