The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on <b>pile</b> <b>foundations.</b> The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set it apart.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that soil investigation conducted in construction projects is limited. The budget allocated for soil investigation is often minimized {{in order to}} reduce preliminary cost of project, rather than being allocated to characterize properly soil properties. The budget allocated for soil investigation ranges from 0. 1 % to 3 % of the construction budget. These inadequate site investigations remain one of the main factors in the failure of structural foundations, and leading to unforeseen additional construction or repair costs. At the other extreme, inadequate site investigations can result in over-design of the foundation, increasing the cost unnecessarily. This study investigated the effect of limited soil investigation to estimate bearing stratum of <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> in the construction project. Case study was undertaken on the contruction project of Coal Unloading Jetty PT. Semen Tonasa in Pangkep, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. To characterize the soil properties of Coal Unloading Jetty with the area of 122 ?? 20 m 2, soil investigations were conducted with limited amount, consisting of 1 SPTs. The limited site investigations was found to increase waste length of <b>pile</b> <b>foundation,</b> accounted for 9. 19 % of the total <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> length. If the waste is not recognized and paid by the owner of construction project, the waste cost to be a risk to the contractor.

The use of geostatistical methods found that the addition of 3 CPTs into the existing site investigation can reduce the waste length of <b>pile</b> <b>foundation</b> to be 5. 38 % and 5. 39 % for Kriging and Inverse Distance to a Power respectively.
