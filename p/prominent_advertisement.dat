60|$|In {{the room}} from which the {{conversation}} proceeded Bathsheba and her servant-companion, Liddy Smallbury, were to be discovered sitting upon the floor, and sorting a complication of papers, books, bottles, and rubbish spread out thereon--remnants from the household stores of the late occupier. Liddy, the maltster's great-granddaughter, was about Bathsheba's equal in age, {{and her face was}} a <b>prominent</b> <b>advertisement</b> of the light-hearted English country girl. The beauty her features might have lacked in form was amply made up for by perfection of hue, which at this winter-time was the softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity that we meet with in a Terburg or a Gerard Douw; and, like the presentations of those great colourists, it was a face which kept well back from the boundary between comeliness and the ideal. Though elastic in nature she was less daring than Bathsheba, and occasionally showed some earnestness, which consisted half of genuine feeling, and half of mannerliness superadded by way of duty.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first series}} had been {{broadcast}} in the 9.30 p.m. timeslot on Sunday nights. This was {{a compromise between}} Harries and ITV director of channels David Liddiment; Liddiment wanted it to go out at 10 p.m. because he believed that viewers needed {{to concentrate on the}} plot; in the 9 p.m. [...] "ironing slot"—for undemanding programmes. For the second series, Harries was able to get Cold Feet moved to 9 p.m., an action that made advertisers [...] "furious". For the second time, Allied Domecq's Cockburn's Port sponsored the broadcast. The deal, which included <b>prominent</b> <b>advertisements</b> either side of commercial breaks, was estimated to be worth £1.4 million.|$|R

50|$|The {{newspaper}} that would publish the Moomin comic strip {{ended up being}} Evening News, part of the Associated Newspapers syndicate, which was the largest afternoon newspaper at the time, with a circulation of 12 million. The comic strip Moomin {{was first published in}} the newspaper on 20 September 1954. Sutton had organised a very <b>prominent</b> <b>advertisement</b> campaign to support the start of the new comic strip. The strip was quickly sold to other countries, particularly the Nordic countries. In Finland, the strip started on 21 April 1955 in Ilta-Sanomat, the largest afternoon newspaper in the country. In the same year, the strip also started in the Swedish-language local newspapers Västra Nyland and Vasabladet, and in 1957 in Åbo Underrättelser. Most newspapers publishing the Moomin comic strip were European, but it was also published in more distant places. In North America, it was finally sold to the Canadian Toronto Daily Star, but in the United States, no newspaper worthy of note accepted it on its pages.|$|E

5000|$|In 1901, {{the facade}} {{competition}} was won by another remarkable architect, Jules Lavirotte (1864-1924), {{for an apartment}} building whose facade featured ceramic decoration by Alexandre Bigot, a chemistry professor who became interested in ceramics at the Chinese exhibition at the 1889 International Exposition, and who started his own firm to make ceramic sculpture and decoration. The Lavirotte Building, located at 29 Avenue Rapp in the 7th arrondissement, became its most <b>prominent</b> <b>advertisement.</b> The Lavirotte Building was more a piece of sculpture than a traditional building. Unlike other Paris buildings, whose decoration was usually modeled a particular period or style, the Lavirotte Building, like the opera house of Charles Garnier, was unique; {{there was nothing else}} in Paris like it. The front entrance was surrounded by ceramic sculpture, and upper floors were entirely covered with ceramic tile and decoration. The building also featured a novel construction feature; the walls were built of hollow bricks; iron rods were inserted inside, and the bricks were filled with cement. For the exterior decoration, Lavirotte commissioned a team of sculptors and craftsmen.|$|E

This stealthy attack can be thought of as a threatening mutation of spam and phishing attacks, with which it has many commonalities, except for the fact that it is not the targeted individual who is the victim in the attack, but the unwitting advertiser...|$|E
40|$|Magister Artium - MAThe {{purpose of}} this study was two-fold: firstly, to do a {{multimodal}} analysis of the multilingual signage, advertisements and graffiti present on different surfaces in the main business hub of a multicultural community called Wesbank, situated in the Eastern Metropole of the city of Cape Town. Signage of this nature, taken together, constitute the „linguistic landscape‟ (Gorter, 2006) of a particular space. My analysis of the signage included interviews with a number of the producers of these signs which reveal why their signs are constructed in particular ways with particular languages. Secondly, I interviewed 20 mature women from the community in order to determine their level of understanding of these signs as well as whether the linguistic landscape of the township had an impact on their levels of literacy. The existing literacy levels of the women being surveyed as well as those of the producers of the signs were also taken into account. My main analytical tools were Multimodal Discourse Analysis (Kress, 2003), applied to the signage, and a Critical Discourse style of Analysis (Willig, 1999; Pienaar and Becker, 2007), applied to the focus group and individual analysis. Basic quantitative analysis was also applied to the quantifiable questionnaire data. The overriding motivation for the study was to determine the strategies used by the women to make sense of their linguistic landscape and to examine whether there was any transportation of literacy from the signage to these women so that they could function more effectively and agentively in their own environment. This study formed part of a larger NRF-funded research project entitled Township women’s discourses and literacy resources, led by my supervisor, Prof. C. Dyers. The study revealed the interesting finding that the majority of the vendors in Wesbank, especially in terms of house shops, hairdressers and fruit and vegetable stalls, are foreigners from other parts of Africa, who rely on English as a lingua franca to advertise their wares. The signage makers had clearly put some thought into the language skills of their multilingual target market in this township, and did their best to communicate with their potential customers through the complete visual image of their signs. The overall quality of the codes displayed on the signage also revealed much about the literacy levels in the township as well as language as a local practice (Pennycook 2010). While English predominated on the signs, at times one also found the addition of Afrikaans (especially in the case of religious signage) and isiXhosa (as in one very <b>prominent</b> <b>advertisement</b> by a dentist). The study further established that the female respondents in my study, as a result of their different literacy levels, made use of both images and codes on an item of signage to interpret the message conveyed successfully. Signage without accompanying images were often ignored, or interpreted with the help of others or by using one comprehensible word to work out the rest of the sign. As has been shown by another study in the larger research project, these women displayed creativity in making sense of their linguistic landscape. The study further revealed that, as a result of frequent exposure to some words and expressions in the linguistic landscape, some of the women had become familiar with these terms and had thereby expanded their degree of text literacy. In this way, the study has contributed to our understanding of the notion of portable literacy as explored by Dyers and Slemming (2011, forthcoming) ...|$|E

Their most notorious performance was a collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror (and Barney Greenaway of Napalm Death) at the February 1992 BRIT Awards, where they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance announced the KLF's departure from the music business, and in May 1992 the duo deleted their entire back catalogue.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{population}} of older people, traditional prejudices against age continue to flourish in society. The media {{in particular are}} often guilty of ageism, persistently focusing upon the `youth market', and advertisers are particular offenders. By ignoring older people, or using them as caricatures, the advertising industry not only violates its ethical responsibilities to this group within the community, but also overlooks the commercial opportunity presented by {{the new generation of}} older consumers. The article presents research into UK print media which shows that older people tend not to be featured in advertisements in mainstream publications, but are <b>prominent</b> in <b>advertisements</b> in publications for the over-fifties. The issues this raises in terms of the duty of advertisers to respect the rights of older people are discussed, along with the commercial imperative to provide more appropriate images of older people in UK advertising...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} minstrelsy in the US contemporary burlesque movement, or neo burlesque, {{in order}} to revise current understandings about the sexual politics of neo-burlesque. Since the mid- 1990 s neo-burlesque, or {{the revival of the}} art of striptease, has become a permanent staple of nightlife in many cities in the US, with women and men of all sizes performing in scantily clad sequined costumes, baring it {{all in the name of}} individual artistic sexual expression. Proponents of the resurgence of burlesque suggest that neo-burlesque provides a vital ground for sexual liberation and power in the 21 st century. This thesis complicates this assertion by investigating the performance of neo-minstrelsy, or the contemporary performance of racial mimicry as staged by white neo-burlesque performers. Drawing on <b>prominent</b> performer websites, <b>advertisements,</b> and photography, semiotic tools are used to analyze the race-gender meanings of five recurring minstrel characters/acts. This thesis reveals how the resurgence of burlesque has resurrected early twentieth century colonial and imperial characters that powerfully reproduce white female conceptions of sexual liberation and white female superiority...|$|R

Telford was required to develop the philosophy, select major positions in sports medicine, physical therapy, psychology and biomechanics areas, develop sports science and medicine services and develop a plan for future facilities. John Bloomfield stated Telford was an excellent choice to establish sports science at the AIS as he was a talented exercise physiologist as well as competent distance running coach. Telford appointed Robert De Castella, as a sport science technician and he later when onto to become a world class marathon runner. Telford was appointed team physiologist for the Australian swim team at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Telford expanded physiological services to include nutrition services and as the sport science medicine staffing expanded he was appointed Head of Applied Physiology and Nutrition. Telford {{played a major role in}} raising the profile of the AIS and sports science through the development and advertising promotion of two products. In 1986, Kellogg's launched the Sustain breakfast cereal, Telford played a major role and was <b>prominent</b> in television <b>advertisements.</b> In 1988, Telford and AIS nutritionist Vicki Deakin worked with Goodman Fielders to develop the Gold Medal bread. During his time in charge of AIS Physiology, the AIS undertook major research into nutrition, heat, altitude and talent identification. His philosophy was [...] " [...] I always considered the coaches to be my boss. You were trying to help the coach get the best out on an athlete". He left as Head of AIS Physiology to take up a distance running coaching role with AIS Track and Field. He was replaced by Allan Hahn.|$|R
