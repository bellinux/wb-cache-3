They are host-specific ectoparasites of two species of flatfish: the common dab (Limanda limanda) and the European {{flounder}} (<b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus).</b> They attach themselves to the bases of the gill arches of their hosts. They can infest as much as 2 to 30% of fish in a given population.|$|E

Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and European flounder (<b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus)</b> in the Baltic Sea, and between the English sole (Parophrys vetulus) and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) in Puget Sound. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.|$|E

Several flatfish which live on intertidal mudflats feed on the ragworm.

40|$|Nekton was sampled in five marshes {{along the}} {{salinity}} gradient of the Schelde River. The utilisation {{of three different}} habitats (large and small creek, marsh pond) by fish and macrocrustacean species was compared among the five sampling sites. In the larger channels fyke nets were deployed to capture fish and macrocrustaceans leaving the marsh at ebb while block nets were set in smaller intertidal creeks. Fish traps passively sampled fish and shrimp in the marsh ponds. The tidal freshwater marsh had a species poor fauna and only a low number of fish was caught. Besides some freshwater species (Alburnoides bipunctatus, Carassius carassius) the European eel, Anguilla anguilla was still present. The four other marshes had a similar community structure although <b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus</b> was absent from the euhaline area. Among fish species, dominance of Dicentrarchus labrax, <b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus</b> and Pomatoschistus microps was observed. Carcinus maenas and Palaemonetes varians were the most abundant macrocrustacean species in every marsh. Between the large and small intertidal creeks {{there was no difference}} in nekton species composition. The main species used both habitats.

40|$|Animals are {{influenced}} by both biotic and abiotic factors when selecting a habitat. The final decision of an organism to select a habitat generally depends on the fitness increase that can be expected. Within a selected habitat, interactions with conspecifics and other species also affect its quality. This thesis describes the habitat use of estuarine fishes in the Scheldt estuary. In the first part (Chapter 1 to Chapter 3) we studied the importance of intertidal migration for fishes and discussed the various factors that affect intertidal habitat quality. We also examined to what extent fishes affect their environment by predation on the intertidal infauna.

40|$|Statistical {{models are}} key for {{estimating}} fish distributions based on environmental variables, and validation is generally advocated as indispensable but seldom applied. Generalized Linear Models {{were applied to}} distributions of juvenile Solea solea, Solea senegalensis, <b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus</b> and Dicentrarchus labrax in response to environmental variables throughout Portuguese estuaries. Species-specific Delta models with two sub-models were used: Binomial (presence/absence); Gamma (density when present). Models were fitted and tested on separate data sets to estimate the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Temperature, salinity and mud content in sediment were included in most models for presence/absence; salinity and depth in most models for density (when present). In Binomial models (presence/absence), goodness-of-fit, accuracy and robustness varied concurrently among species, and fair to high accuracy and robustness were attained for all species, in models with poor to high goodness-of-fit. But in Gamma models (density when present), goodness-of-fit was not indicative of accuracy and robustness. Only for <b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus</b> were Gamma and also coupled Delta models (density) accurate and robust, despite some moderate bias and inconsistency in predicted density. The accuracy and robustness of final density estimations were defined by the accuracy and robustness of the estimations of presence/absence and density (when present) provided by the sub-models. The mismatches between goodness-of-fit, accuracy and robustness of positive density models, {{as well as the}} difference in performance of presence/absence and density models demonstrated the importance of validation procedures in the evaluation of the value of habitat suitability models as predictive tools.

This pattern in the infection dynamics is possibly related to seasonal variations in spatial overlap of the intermediate (<b>Platichthys</b> <b>flesus)</b> and the final host (Merlangius merlangus). The dispersion pattern of Lernaeocera branchialis within the whiting population can be described by the Poisson distribution. Possible explanations for the observed dispersion pattern are given.
