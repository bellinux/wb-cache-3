40|$|Ryanodine is {{a natural}} <b>product</b> <b>modulator</b> of ryanodine receptors, {{important}} intracellular calcium ion channels that {{play a critical role}} in signal transduction leading to muscle movement and synaptic transmission. Chemical derivatization of (+) -ryanodine has demonstrated that certain peripheral structural modifications can alter its pharmacology, and that the pyrrole- 2 -carboxylate ester is critical for high affinity binding to ryanodine receptors. However, the structural variation of available ryanodine analogues has been limited by the challenge of site-specific functionalization of semisynthetic intermediates, such as (+) -ryanodol. Here we report a synthetic strategy that provides access to (+) -ryanodine and the related natural product (+) - 20 -deoxyspiganthine in 18 and 19 steps, respectively. A key feature of this strategy is the reductive cyclization of an epoxide intermediate that possesses the critical pyrrole- 2 -carboxylate ester. This approach allows for the direct introduction of this ester in the final stage of the synthesis and provides a framework for the synthesis of previously inaccessible synthetic ryanoids...|$|E

For example, a communications receiver might contain two mixer stages for conversion of the input signal to an intermediate frequency and another mixer employed as a detector for demodulation of the signal.|$|R

Over the last decade, O- 2, NO, and CO {{have been reported}} to act as signaling molecules in the control of several distinct biological functions. Here, the heme-based mechanisms of CO sensing by the bacterial homodimeric CooA and the mammalian heterodimeric NPAS 2 -BMAL 1 transcriptional factors are reviewed, and the signal transduction pathways are discussed...|$|R

This paper summarizes the results obtained to date with this technique at 20 to 100 GHz, with phase modulators, Mach-Zehnder modulators, and delta-beta directional coupler modulators...|$|R
40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} {{is a major}} obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. Cancer cells efflux chemotherapeutic drug out of cell by means of transporter and reduce the active concentration of it inside cell. Such transporters are member of the ATP binding cassettes (ABC) protein. It includes P-gp, multiple resistant protein (MRP), and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP). These proteins are widely distributed in the human cells such as kidney, lung, endothelial cells of blood brain barrier etc. However, there are number of drugs developed for it, {{but most of them}} are getting transported by it. So, still there is necessity of a good modulator, which could effectively combat the transport of chemotherapeutic agents. Natural <b>products</b> origin <b>modulators</b> were found to be effective against transporter such as flavonoids, which belongs to third generation modulators. They have advantage over synthetic inhibitor {{in the sense that they}} have simple structure and abundant in nature. This review focuses on the P-gp structure its architecture, efflux mechanism, herbal inhibitors and their mechanism of action...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Mach-Zehnder {{modulators}} fabricated on X- and Z-cut {{lithium niobate}} wafers are presented. The optical waveguides were fabricated by the Zn-diffusion method, which allows monomode TM-propagation at the wavelength of interest by choos-ing the channel waveguide width. The TM-mode {{is shown to}} be buried beneath the surface, which avoids the need of using a dielectric buffer to reduce propa-gation losses induced by the metallic electrodes to perform electro-optic modulation. A figure of merit of 9. 2 V·cm has been obtained for the switching volt-age-interaction length <b>product</b> in Z-cut <b>modulators</b> with CCS configuration, which is slightly higher that the calculated theoretical value using the overlap between the externally applied electrical field and the propagating optical field...|$|R
40|$|Nitric oxide (an endothelium-derived {{relaxing}} factor) induces {{smooth muscle}} relaxation {{and is an}} important mediator in the regulation of vascular tone. Advanced glycosylation end products, the glucose-derived moieties that form nonenzymatically and accumulate on long-lived tissue proteins, have been implicated {{in many of the}} complications of diabetes and normal aging. We demonstrate that advanced glycosylation products quench nitric oxide activity in vitro and in vivo. Acceleration of the advanced glycosylation process in vivo results in a time-dependent impairment in endothelium-dependent relaxation. Inhibition of advanced glycosylation with aminoguanidine prevents nitric oxide quenching, and ameliorates the vasodilatory impairment. These results implicate advanced glycosylation <b>products</b> as important <b>modulators</b> of nitric oxide activity and endothelium-dependent relaxation...|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} binding {{capabilities and}} catalytic activity of enzymes make them popular bioreceptors. Analyte recognition is enabled through several possible mechanisms: 1) the enzyme converting the analyte into {{a product that}} is sensor-detectable, 2) detecting enzyme inhibition or activation by the analyte, or 3) monitoring modification of enzyme properties resulting from interaction with the analyte. The main reasons for the common use of enzymes in biosensors are: 1) ability to catalyze {{a large number of}} reactions; 2) potential to detect a group of analytes (substrates, <b>products,</b> inhibitors, and <b>modulators</b> of the catalytic activity); and 3) suitability with several different transduction methods for detecting the analyte. Notably, since enzymes are not consumed in reactions, the biosensor can easily be used continuously. The catalytic activity of enzymes also allows lower limits of detection compared to common binding techniques. However, the sensor's lifetime is limited by the stability of the enzyme.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we have deeply {{investigated}} the transmission efficiency degradation of electrooptic modulator devices in thermal irradiated hard environments over {{wide range of}} the operating parameters. It {{is well known that}} the radiation-induced electrooptic modulator defects can modify the initial doping concentrations, creating generation-recombination centres and introducing trapping of carriers. Additionally, rate of the lattice defects is thermally activated and reduces for increasing irradiation temperature as a result of annealing of the damage. Both the ambient temperature and the irradiation dose possess sever effects on the electro-optical characteristics and consequently the performance characteristics of electroptic modulator devices. As well as we have deeply developed the modelling basics of electrooptic modulator devices, which may be used to analyzed the modulator quantum efficiency, dark current, modulating voltage, modulating frequency, 3 -dB bandwidth, transmitted signal bandwidth, modulator quality factor, modulator sensitivity, <b>modulator</b> sensitivity bandwidth <b>product,</b> switching voltage, <b>modulator</b> device performance index, operating switching time and speed response of these irradiated electrooptic modulator devices after different irradiation fluences...|$|R
40|$|Protons {{participate}} in most biologically important reactions, as substrates, <b>products,</b> cofactors and <b>modulators,</b> and proton transport {{is an essential}} step in energy transduction. The dynamics of protonation reactions have been studied extensively in solution and in model systems involving lipid-water interfaces, but have never been resolved at the timescale of the elementary molecular event. Here we show that, under appropriate conditions, binding and unbinding reactions of single protons and deuterium ions to a single site on the L-type calcium channel can be resolved and the protonation and deprotonation rates quantified. The protonation rate constant considerably exceeds previous estimates obtained in simpler systems. The functional consequences of channel protonation is a threefold reduction of the channel conductance, independent of the applied voltage. The data {{are consistent with the}} presence of a single protonatable group with pK in the physiological pH range, close to the external mouth of the channel. The two conductance levels of the open channel might be explained by greatly differing local potentials associated with the protonated and deprotonated state of the group...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this report on the Australian Health and Medical Research Congress, held November 25 - 29, 2002, in Melbourne, Australia, {{considers}} some of the symposia and three plenary lectures: Neurosteroids: Nature 2 ̆ 7 s Valium, G-Protein-Coupled Receptors and the Mike Rand Memorial Lecture. In the new era in relaxin research symposium, we learned that relaxin is a general antifibrotic agent rather than just a hormone of pregnancy. The drugs discussed in the drug discovery symposium included drugs from natural <b>products,</b> allosteric <b>modulators,</b> antibodies to cytokines and AM- 336, an N-type Ca 2 + channel blocker. In the matrix proteases symposium, we learned of the importance of these enzymes in bone, endometrial remodeling and cardiovascular disease. The emphasis of the cytokine antagonist symposium was the involvement of cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis and how these effects could be inhibited with cytokine antagonists. The second part of this report is on the cardiovascular components of the meeting. One of the major strengths of Australian research is the cardiovascular area. Thus, it was not surprising that there were three major symposia with a cardiovascular theme this congress. Although the clinical trials of the NHE 1 inhibitors in ischemia and reperfusion have been disappointing to date, evidence was presented in the sodium-hydrogen exchanger symposium that these agents might be beneficial in hypertrophy and heart failure. The discussion in the vessel wall biology in diabetes symposium ranged from molecular aspects to clinical trials. In this, and the NAD(P) H oxidases symposium, many new potential drug targets were discussed. The plenary lecture of the High Blood Pressure Research Council concerned the pathophysiology and management of obesity hypertension, and included a discussion of the drugs for weight reduction...|$|R
40|$|Quadrature digital {{modulation}} techniques {{are widely used}} in modern communication systems because of their high performance and flexibility. However, these advantages come {{at the cost of}} high power consumption. As a result, power consumption has {{to be taken into account}} as a main design factor of the modulator. In this thesis, a low-power quadrature digital modulator in 0. 18 um CMOS is presented with the target system clock speed of 150 MHz. The quadrature digital modulator consists of several key blocks: quadrature direct digital synthesizer (QDDS), pulse shaping filter, interpolation filter and inverse sinc filter. The design strategy is to investigate different implementations for each block and compare the power consumption of these implementations. Based on the comparison results, the implementation that consumes the lowest power will be chosen for each block. First of all, a novel low-power QDDS is proposed in the thesis. Power consumption estimation shows that it can save up to 60 % of the power consumption at 150 MHz system clock frequency compared with one conventional design. Power consumption estimation results also show that using two pulse shaping blocks to process I/Q data, cascaded integrator comb (CIC) interpolation structure, and inverse sinc filter with modified canonic signed digit (MCSD) multiplication consume less power than alternative design choices. These low-power blocks are integrated together to achieve a low-power modulator. The power consumption estimation after layout shows that it only consumes about 95 mW at 150 MHz system clock rate, which is much lower than similar commercial <b>products.</b> The designed <b>modulator</b> can provide a low-power solution for various quadrature modulators. It also has an output bandwidth from 0 to 75 MHz, configurable pulse shaping filters and interpolation filters, and an internal sin(x) /x correction filter...|$|R
40|$|Current {{approaches}} for {{the discovery of}} bioactive molecules tend to treat all molecules in large collections with the same significance regardless of their ultimate biological activity. Furthermore, these approaches exploit a limited palette of reliable well-working reactions, that have been optimised for the preparation of individual compounds. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} new discovery approach –Activity-Directed Synthesis. The approach aims to merge the discovery of small bioactive molecules with the emergence of a synthetic route. In this regard Activity-Directed Synthesis may be analogous with the evolution of biosynthetic pathways as is observed in Nature. For the implementation of Activity-Directed Synthesis, a well-studied chemical toolbox – metal carbenoid chemistry – that has been underutilised in bioactive molecule discovery was used. The approach was demonstrated in the discovery of novel chemotypes of small bioactive molecules that agonise the Androgen Receptor. Both intra- and intermolecular reactions were exploited in sequential rounds of carbenoid reactions which had many alternative outcomes. Three iterative rounds of screening crude reaction mixtures and design of subsequent reaction arrays enabled the rapid discovery of reactions that yielded bioactive <b>products.</b> Hence small-molecule <b>modulators</b> of the Androgen Receptor, based on scaffolds with no previously annotated activity were discovered. A total of 272 microreactions was performed in the case of intramolecular reactions and a total of 326 microreactions was performed in the case of intermolecular reactions. In the case of the intramolecular chemistry, it was demonstrated retrospectively that the approach enabled the parallel optimisation of both the structure of bioactive molecules and the routes for their synthesis. In the case of the intermolecular chemistry, it was demonstrated that non-exhaustive reaction arrays could still lead to the discovery of sub-micromolar modulators of the Androgen Receptor, greatly improving the efficiency of Activity-Directed Synthesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Monocytes and Macrophages {{are part}} of the {{cellular}} immune system and {{play a vital role in}} the eradication of foreign particles and the maintenance of homeostasis. Aim of this study was the investigation of the influence of IFNγ and different Toll-like receptor (TLR) -agonist on the undifferentiated and differentiated monocytic cell line THP- 1. Furthermore it was addressed if and to what extend various natural products of plant origin had an effect on an induced infection in the context of TNFα-secretion and mRNA-expression of certain adhesion molecules. The results of this work showed that the stimulation with IFNγ and TLR-agonists alone and in combination led to a strong activation of specific immunologic processes. In undifferentiated THP- 1 cells this stimulation resulted in an early (3 h) increase of TNFα and ICAM- 1 mRNA-expression and a late (24 h) activation of PECAM- 1, MAC- 1, L-Selectin, ESL- 1, PSGL- 1 and CD 86, as well as a strong intercellular adhesion. Yet, for the increase of TNFα-secretion and the observed inhibition of lysozyme activity the stimulation of the protein kinase C with the phorbol ester PMA was required. The above mentioned effects showed to be the strongest in the combination of IFNγ with either the synthetic TLR-agonists LPS and FSL- 1 as well as certain bacterial preparations of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus firmus and Escherichia coli which demonstrates the importance of TLR-agonists on the activation of the innate immune system. Traditional medicinal plants become more and more popular yet molecular insights into underlying mechanisms are scarce. β-glycosidically cleaved Aucubin and Catalpol exhibited a stimulatory impact on differentiated, IFNγ/LPS untreated and treated THP- 1 cells. The iridoid glycosides Harpagoside and Harpagide as well as the diterpene Aconitin led to a reduction of TNFα-secretion down to 50 %. On the other hand they stimulated mRNA-expression of TNFα, ICAM- 1, L-Selectin, ESL- 1, PSGL- 1 and CD 86 and diminished the time related decrease of TNFα and ICAM- 1 expression which demonstrates the importance of natural <b>products</b> as immune <b>modulators</b> that not only guide immune competent cells to sites of infection but also impair local pro-inflammatory stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), {{a product}} of endothelial cells and the most potent {{vasoconstrictor}} known, was first discovered and characterized in 1988. Recent studies have suggested a role for ET- 1 in bovine luteal function, but the role of ET- 1 in ovine luteal function has not been examined. Endothelial cells comprise more than 50 % of the cell population of the mature corpus luteum and their <b>products</b> are likely <b>modulators</b> of luteal function. A diversified series of experiments was conducted to determine the potential role of ET- 1 in ovine luteal function. ET- 1 inhibited basal and gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone production by dispersed ovine luteal cells during a 2 hour incubation. This inhibition was removed when cells were pre-incubated with cyclo-D-Trp 1 -D-Asp 2 -Pro 3 -D-Val 4 -Leu 5 (BQ 123), a highly specific endothelin receptor (ETA) antagonist, indicating that the anti-steroidogenic action of ET- 1 is mediated through the ETA receptor subtype in these cells. Intra-luteal administration of a single dose of BQ 123 to ewes on Day 8 or 9 of the estrous cycle mitigated the luteolytic effect of prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) in vivo. Intra-muscular administration of 100 μg ET- 1 to ewes at mid-cycle increased plasma progesterone concentrations 4 hours later and reduced plasma progesterone concentrations {{for the remainder of}} the estrous cycle. However, when ewes were pretreated with a subluteolytic dose of PGF 2 α, intra-muscular administration of 100 μg ET- 1 caused a rapid decline in plasma progesterone and shortened the length of the estrous cycle. Administration of a luteolytic dose of PGF 2 α stimulated gene expression for ET- 1 in ovine CL collected at mid-cycle. Following PGF 2 α administration, binding of ET- 1 was immunolocalized in frozen sections to large and small luteal steroidogenic cells and to luteal endothelial cells. This is the first study to utilize ET- 1 and its receptor antagonist in ewes in vivo. These data complement and extend previously published reports of the influence of ET- 1 in bovine luteal function and are the strongest evidence presented to date in support of a novel role for ET- 1 in PGF 2 α-mediated ruminant luteal function. ...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the phage {{display is}} the {{potential}} method for target identification of small molecules. Thus, the first objective of this thesis was to establish a cDNA phage display protocol for affinity isolation of target proteins binding to small molecules of interest {{as an alternative to}} the affinity-based approach. For that reason we generated a cDNA phage display library using HeLa cells, which are usually used for phenotypic studies and for target identification using affinity chromatography in our group. This approach was applied different molecules including melophlin A, CD 267, tubulexin A. and glutathione (GSH) as control. Preincubation the library with streptavidin-biotin or streptavidin-PEG-biotin or inactive compound before biopanning step was employed to reduce on-specific binding. In parallel, specific elution approaches was employed to elute proteins and identified one known hit of GSH. The binders identified by phage display were not identical with the binders identified using affinity purification in the case of melophlin A, CD 267 and tubulexin A. Even though we could succeed in establishing a protocol with the optimal conditions determined. However, there is unlikely to get the same hits of affinity purification for melophlin A, CD 267 and tubulexin A. A separate study focused on the biological evaluation of hit compounds from phenotypic high content screening that monitors changes in cytoskeleton and DNA. Molecules interfering with microtubule dynamics are among the most successful therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Despite the availability of many tubulin targeting agents, cells can become resistant towards the drugs. Hence, there is high demand for the identification of new anti-tubulin agents that are able to overcome anti-tubulin drug resistance. Within this work, the aim was to further validate the effects of tubulexin A and podoverin A and characterize their mode of action. Tubulexin A and the natural product podoverin A are potent inducers of a G 2 /M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Tubulexin A is the most active compound identified from tetrahydropyran library. Base on target validation showed that tubulexin A inhibits tubulin polymerization by targeting the vinca alkaloid binding site of tubulin and also bind to the protein CAS. Further validation of the effects of those compounds on tubulin polymerization, the cell cycle, and their binding to CAS was done by biophysical measurements, binding assays, tubulin polymerization assays, immunofluorescence and life time imaging, binding assays, and affinity chromatographic methods. Results showed that CAS binds to tubulexin A independent from tubulin. Additionally, tubulin polymerization is inhibited in a synergistic manner in the presence of both, tubulexin A and CAS in vitro. Based on results of overcome vinblastine-resistance, tubulexin A can become a promising antimitotic drug for cancer treatment with the dual mode of action of the tubulexin A and CAS. For the natural product podoverin A is the most active mitosis <b>modulator</b> in natural <b>product</b> library. This compound is a potential target for further study on natural <b>product</b> as mitosis <b>modulator</b> to use for anticancer drugs, also used as natural product scaffold for synthesis library. The third aim of this thesis is discovery new CAS inhibitors as mitosis modulators. Despite the high relevance of CAS as a target in cancer, there is no small molecule targeting CAS published yet. Therefore, additional focus of this work was to discover further compounds that bind to CAS which might interfere with CAS function and thus might inhibit growth of cancer cells. A reverse chemical genomics-approach was chosen in collaboration with the group of Prof. Osada (RIKEN-Wako-Japan). This strategy is based on a chemical array screening. After chemical array screening of approximately 25, 000 compounds, 263 potential hit compounds have been obtained. Further validation the hit compounds was based on phenotypic changes and specific function of the target using immunofluorescence and life time imaging, biophysical methods for the determination of the binding affinity, as well as studies on the interaction of the hit compounds with DNA and tubulin polymerization in vitro. The most interesting compound R 89 was further validated on HeLa cells and we found that this compound inhibited cell proliferation. Result showed that R 89 has effect on mitosis by formation of multipolar mitotic spindles and caused chromosome congression defects and also induces nuclear accumulation of RANBP 1. Thus R 89 is an interesting mitosis modulator to study for anticancer drugs...|$|R
