500|$|The CPG policy {{document}} {{is regarded as}} self-contradictory {{for at least two}} reasons. Firstly, it identified the two greatest threats to NATO as terrorism and the <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction (WMD), whilst simultaneously reaffirming the 1999 Strategic Concept as [...] "remaining valid" [...] {{despite the fact that it}} barely mentioned these threats. Secondly, the document states that collective defence remains the core purpose of NATO, but at the same time emphasizes potential NATO contributions to conflict prevention and crisis management, and the potential planning and management of missions like that in Afghanistan. The Riga Declaration even described the capability for such missions as NATO's [...] "top priority". Additionally, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer wanted and expected a new Strategic Concept to be debated and agreed upon by 2008, reinforcing already existing views that the CPG will most likely last much less than the 10 to 15 years as the guiding {{policy document}}.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{operational}} use of {{a rotating}} turret was on the American ironclad , designed by John Ericsson. Open barbettes were also used to house their main batteries on rotating mounts. Both designs allowed naval engineers to dramatically {{reduce the number of}} guns present in the battery, by giving a handful of guns the ability to concentrate {{on either side of the}} ship. In time this trend reversed, with a <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> multiple calibers being arranged somewhat haphazardly about a vessel, many in mounts on the hull or superstructure with limited travel. Confusion also arose when combinations of large caliber [...] "main battery" [...] and smaller [...] "secondary battery" [...] <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mixed offensive and defensive use were deployed. This began to be resolved with the 1906 launching of the revoutionary [...] "all big gun" [...] battleship [...] It shipped a main battery of ten heavy caliber guns, and a smaller secondary battery for self-defense. This leap in heavy offensive armament from a standard four large caliber guns to ten made all other battleships obsolete overnight, as the weight of broadside it could unleash, and overwhelming rate of fire a superior number <b>of</b> similar <b>weapons</b> could sustain, could overwhelm any similarly sized warship.|$|R

Additionally, the late Anna Lindh, Sweden's former minister for foreign affairs, {{took the lead in}} promotion of non-proliferation policy, which eventually affected the European Union's strategy to combat the <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction (WMD). Lindh also instigated the International WMD Commission, chaired by Blix, which in 2006 released its study, which offers [...] over 60 recommendations on how to reduce the threat posed by WMD. [...] The negotiations resulted in the non-proliferation treaty, which was ready for signature in 1968. Sweden signed the treaty on 19 August 1968, immediately after West Germany had done the same.|$|E

The following features <b>of</b> biological <b>weapons</b> are worth highlighting: first, biological weapons can have a spatial coverage of impact equivalent to nuclear weapons making them equally effective as <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> mass destruction. Second, biological weapons have environmental consequences. They can be used in many different ways in a variety of scenarios ranging from contaminating food or water supplies, insects spreading the deadly diseases, deadly toxins to dissemination through the air and inhalation into lungs.
