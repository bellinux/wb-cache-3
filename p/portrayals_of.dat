40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> {{men and boys}} within the women, peace and security agenda, {{and in particular the}} United Nations Security Council’s (UNSC)  security discourse on this theme. The relationship between the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> victims and perpetrators, and the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> men and boys are analysed and discussed based on the three-dimensional framework for Critical Discourse Analysis by Norman Fairclough. Through the theoretical framework of Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink on norm theory, this thesis furthers the understanding of the evolution of how men and boys are portrayed within the women, peace and security agenda. The results of this thesis are that the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> victims often does not correspond with the portrayal of men and boys, while the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> perpetrators often does correspond to the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> men and boys. The study also shows that the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> men and boys as the perpetrators as well as leaders in society has reached the third stage of the norm cycle by Finnemore and Sikkink; internalisation, and that the <b>portrayal</b> <b>of</b> men and boys as victims as partners to the female leaders in society has reached only reached the first stage of the norm cycle: norm emergence...|$|R
