40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>schedules</b> are {{typically}} defined in relatively strict terms and often rely on well-defined task ordering. Commonly, each task has either a pre-determined duration, or, a minimum, a maximum and a mostlikely duration length. In real-life, however, projects {{are subject to}} numerous uncertainties. They often impact durations of tasks and may lead to project re-scheduling. In such cases managers need to decide about some remedial action scenario (RAS) to limit the impact of uncertainty on the overall project success. They are usually left clueless on what the most appropriate action to take is. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach to enhance <b>project</b> <b>schedules</b> by the inclusion of an optimal RAS to be followed when uncertainties occur. This defines the enhanced <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> model. The particular RAS, modeled {{by a set of}} fuzzy rules and selected using proxel-based simulation, becomes {{an integral part of the}} enhanced <b>project</b> <b>schedule.</b> ...|$|R

Because our focus is <b>schedule</b> analysis, <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> visualization {{is at the forefront}} of our research efforts. This white paper presents some topics that are related to that research. Henry Laurence Gantt brought us the Gantt chart in the 1910 ’s, and in 1958, the use of the PERT method brought us PERT network charts. In almost a century, there have been very few innovations in the science of <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> visualization. With major advances in visualization in so many other fields (e. g. medical, manufacturing, data mining), why have advances in <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> visualization been so few and far between? Are Gantt Charts and Network Diagrams sufficient to the point that no additional insights might be gained via other charts and diagrams? How can new approaches in schedule visualization help the project manager in their day-to-day work? This presentation will examine these questions and provide an introduction to the work of Edward Tufte, who has been described by The New York Times as “the Leonardo da Vinci of Data. ” With Tufte’s work as a backdrop, new ideas and approaches will be presented, with the goal of stimulating discussion and real advances in <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> visualization.

40|$|In {{construction}} management, {{the task}} of planning <b>project</b> <b>schedules</b> with consideration of labor utilization is very crucial. However, the commonly used critical path method (CPM) does not inherently take into account this issue. Consequently, the labor utilization of the <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> derived from the CPM method often has substantial low ebbs and high peaks. This research proposes a model to obtain <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> with the least fluctuation in labor demand while still satisfying the project deadline and maintain the project cost. The Differential Evolution (DE), a fast and efficient metaheuristic, is employed {{to search for the}} most desirable solution of project execution among numerous combinations of activities’ crew sizes and start times. Furthermore, seven DE’s mutation strategies have also been employed for solving the optimization at hand. Experiment results point out that the Target-to-Best 1 and a new hybrid mutation strategy can attain the best solution of <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> with the least fluctuation in labor demand. Accordingly, the proposed framework can be an effective tool to assist decision-makers in the project planning phase...|$|R
