40|$|Hirudotherapy has a broad {{spectrum}} of therapeutic application in the medical field ranging from cardiology, gynaecology, ophthalmology, <b>plastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgeries.</b> In medieval <b>and</b> early modern medicine, leeches were used to remove blood from patients in an attempt to balance the biological humours. Leeches are widely used to treat venous congestion in microvascular replantation, free and conventional flap surgery and traumatology. Recently, Food and Drug Administration has approved the usage of live leeches as medical device for therapeutic applications. Presently, some of the leech species have declined dramatically in its population due to the over utilization of leech for medicinal purposes and also due to pollution in several parts of the world particularly in European and Asian countries. This review presents an overview of leech including the history, biology, classification, and its application as medical device. Further, it also covers the controversies and misconception related to leech species identification and complications of post hirudotherapy...|$|R
40|$|In {{modern day}} <b>plastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{numerous}} skin flap designs {{have been developed}} and are used to close open wounds. Skin flaps are developed {{with the intention of}} imposing minimal tension in skin closure. Excessive tension can lead to poor blood flow that result in post-surgery complications such as necrosis. Currently there is no standard in choosing a skin flap design and a surgeon 2 ̆ 7 s choice is based personal experience. A comparison of the mechanical loading in these various designs has not yet been done. We have developed a parametric study, using finite element analysis, of two advancement skin flaps designs. The study focuses on the stress in the design as the defect size is increased. The defect size is increased by scaled by scaling the overall boundary condition to size. From this study, we have found that the stresses of a skin flap on a planar surface are dependent on the defect size. In addition, the choice of skin flap can significantly impact the stresses...|$|R
50|$|The use of leeches {{in modern}} {{medicine}} made a small-scale comeback in the 1980s {{after years of}} decline, {{with the advent of}} microsurgeries, such as <b>plastic</b> <b>and</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgeries.</b> In operations such as these, problematic venous congestion can arise due to inefficient venous drainage. Sometimes, because of the technical difficulties in forming an anastomosis of a vein, no attempt is made to reattach a venous supply to a flap at all. This condition is known as venous insufficiency. If this congestion is not cleared up quickly, the blood will clot, arteries that bring the tissues their necessary nourishment will become plugged, and the tissues will die. To prevent this, leeches are applied to a congested flap, and a certain amount of excess blood is consumed before the leech falls away. The wound will also continue to bleed for a while due to the anticoagulant hirudin in the leech's saliva. The combined effect is to reduce the swelling in the tissues and to promote healing by allowing fresh, oxygenated blood to reach the area.|$|R
