5|$|In September 1929 Casey was {{assigned}} to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, DC. This job involved reviewing the project studies, <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications</b> of all river and harbor projects throughout the United States, including flood control and hydroelectric power projects. He also had responsibility for correspondence with U.S. senators and congressmen. During this time he co-designed and patented the Kingman-Casey Floating Mooring Bit for navigation locks. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 May 1933.|$|E

The Army chose Ford as the second supplier, building Jeeps to the Willys' design. Willys supplied Ford with a complete set of <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications.</b> American Bantam, the creators of the first Jeep, built approximately 2700 of them to the BRC-40 design, but then {{spent the rest of the}} war building heavy-duty trailers for the Army.|$|E

2500|$|The haggadic utterances of Hoshaiah are numerous, {{scattered}} principally in Midrash Rabbah, {{which some}} have erroneously attributed {{to him because}} of the opening words [...] "R. Hoshaiah Rabbah." [...] In Genesis Rabbah, Hoshaiah's text {{with reference to the}} Creation is the verse [...] "Then I was by him, as one brought up [...] with him" [...] (Prov. viii.30). He transposes the letters to read אומן ("an architect"), and explains that [...] "wisdom" [...] (the Torah) was used as an instrument by God to create the universe. He illustrates this by the example of an earthly king who, in building a palace, needs an architect with <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 4 August 1892, the {{proposal}} was put that a new church be constructed, {{in front of the}} existing one, at a proposed cost of £5,100, with the erection of an adjoining suite of offices to fund the building of the church. This was accepted and Trinity Church was dedicated in December 1893 and opened in 1894. The <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications</b> were prepared by Henry Trigg and the contractors were Bunning Brothers at a contract price of £6,100 pounds. The design for the new church provided accommodation for 750 people on the ground floor and for 100 in the galleries. Additional funds of £500 were budgeted for furnishings, and £500 for an organ. The new building was designed for the minister's voice to be heard from every part of it. The church was to have been furnished with chairs, but owing to the slope in the floor, locally crafted pews were substituted. The foundation stone for Trinity Church was laid by Governor William Robson on 22 March 1893. Dr Bevan from the Collins Street Congregational Church, Melbourne came to Perth to conduct the opening services. The ceremony was attended by Sir John and Lady Forrest, Sir James Lee Steere, Alexander Forrest (Mayor of Perth) and a crowd of the leading citizens of Perth and Fremantle. John Forrest proclaimed that such [...] "..a magnificent building would be an ornament to the principal street of the city. Such an undertaking showed that the people were progressing materially and morally and that progress was the order of the day." ...|$|E

For the survey, traditional definitions of lump sum and cost reimbursable contracts were used, and an easily quantifiable project complexity rating was developed.

In some cases, such as Logan Village, the government agreed to provide half the construction costs <b>and</b> a recommended <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications</b> were prepared by the Department of Public Instruction.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} a bandstand funded in 1903–1904 by Thomas Dence (1840–1918), a local developer {{who had been}} involved in the Frome Park Estate in Stroud Green and roads in the parish of St Mary, Islington, and owned property in Herne Bay. Dence had moved to Herne Bay for his health, bought the Downs, laid out roads at the top and built himself a house on Beacon Hill close by. He conveyed the remaining sloping land back to the Council, and in 1901 and 1903 suggested plans for a bandstand. He had in mind: [...] "The erection of a pavilion on the east cliff for the use of residents and visitors. [...] Its accommodation [...] [...] [...] should include a roofed in verandah shelter facing the sea, a large reading room intended to be supplied with newspapers, ladies' and gentlemens' lavatories, rooms for attendants, and drinking fountains [...] [...] [...] Band performances might at the discretion of the Council be permitted in the public hall, but no beach minstrels, or conjurors, or variety entertainments [...] [...] [...] The Urban Council should instruct their surveyor to prepare <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications</b> for this pavilion to cost £2,000, the plans to be so arranged as not to interfere with the view of residences then and thereafter to be erected on Beacon Hill." [...] The Council was expected at its own cost to provide, prepare and level the site, to provide the design and specification, to superintend the erection, and to provide control, upkeep and management. It also had to place a stone {{in front of the building}} saying: [...] "East Cliff Pavilion presented to the town of Herne Bay by Thomas Dence 1902." [...] Dence would pay up to £2,000 for erection, fixtures, and the builder's invoices. Due to a new estimate by the Council surveyor and to site-preparation costs, Dence finally agreed to pay £3,745 in all, although the final cost as announced at the Pavilion's opening was £4,000. The completed building was handed over formally by Dence to the Council on Easter Monday, 4 April 1904.|$|E

6000|$|He {{was good}} to me when we first met, because I did not ask questions, and {{believed}} in Charles Reade as a most shamefully neglected author. Later he approved of my writings {{to the extent of}} one pamphlet of twenty-four pages that I wrote for Holdock, Steiner & Chase, owners of the line, when they bought some ventilating patent and fitted it to the cabins of the Breslau, Spandau, and Koltzau. The purser of the Breslau recommended me to Holdock's secretary for the job; and Holdock, who is a Wesleyan Methodist, invited me to his house, and gave me dinner with the governess when the others had finished, and placed the <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> <b>specifications</b> in my hand, and I wrote the pamphlet that same afternoon. It was called [...] "Comfort in the Cabin," [...] and brought me seven pound ten, cash down--an important sum of money in those days; and the governess, who was teaching Master John Holdock his scales, told me that Mrs. Holdock had told her {{to keep an eye on}} me, in case I went away with coats from the hat-rack. McPhee liked that pamphlet enormously, for it was composed in the Bouverie-Byzantine style, with baroque and rococo embellishments; and afterwards he introduced me to Mrs. McPhee, who succeeded Dinah in my heart; for Dinah was half a world away, and it is wholesome and antiseptic to love such a woman as Janet McPhee. They lived in a little twelve-pound house, close to the shipping. When McPhee was away Mrs. McPhee read the Lloyds column in the papers, and called on the wives of senior engineers of equal social standing. Once or twice, too, Mrs. Holdock visited Mrs. McPhee in a brougham with celluloid fittings, and I have reason to believe that, after she had played owner's wife long enough, they talked scandal. The Holdocks lived in an old-fashioned house with a big brick garden not a mile from the McPhees, for they stayed by their money as their money stayed by them; and in summer you met their brougham solemnly junketing by Theydon Bois or Loughton. But I was Mrs. McPhee's friend, for she allowed me to convoy her westward, sometimes, to theatres where she sobbed or laughed or shivered with a simple heart; and she introduced me to a new world of doctors' wives, captains' wives, and engineers' wives, whose whole talk and thought centred in and about ships and lines of ships you have never heard of. There were sailing-ships, with stewards and mahogany and maple saloons, trading to Australia, taking cargoes of consumptives and hopeless drunkards for whom a sea-voyage was recommended; there were frowzy little West African boats, full of rats and cockroaches, where men died anywhere but in their bunks; there were Brazilian boats whose cabins could be hired for merchandise, that went out loaded nearly awash; there were Zanzibar and Mauritius steamers and wonderful reconstructed boats that plied to the other tide of Borneo. These were loved and known, for they earned our bread and a little butter, and we despised the big Atlantic boats, and made fun of the P. & O. and Orient liners, and swore by our respective owners--Wesleyan, Baptist, or Presbyterian, as the case might be.|$|E
