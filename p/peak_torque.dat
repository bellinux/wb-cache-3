40|$|Objectives: Measuring <b>peak</b> {{insertion}} <b>torque</b> {{in relation}} to different bone densities, the present study seeks to determine whether micromotion at the interface is related to primary stability achieved by increasing insertion torque. Material and methods: A total of 120 Ti-Bone implants were placed in fresh bovine bone samples representing three density categories: hard, normal and soft (HNS). Five groups of <b>peak</b> insertion <b>torque</b> (20, 35, 45, 70 and 100 N/cm) were evaluated in the three bone density categories noted. Customized electronic equipment connected to a PC was used to register the peak and other insertion torque data.

Objective: To assess the test-retest reliability of knee flexor/extensor strength using the Biodex Multi-Joint System 4 Isokinetic Dynamometer in children. Methods: Peak isometric knee extensor (KE) and peak isokinetic knee flexor (KF) torques of the dominant and nondominant limbs were assessed twice in 11 children aged 10 to 13 yrs, 7 to 10 days apart. Results: <b>Peak</b> <b>torques</b> {{were higher in the}} dominant limb (p ≤ 0. 006). <b>Peak</b> isometric KE <b>torque</b> was 8. 4 % higher (SEM 2. 5 %) at the second testing session, but there was no inter-action with the limb tested (p > 0. 2). <b>Peak</b> isokinetic KE/KF <b>torque</b> ratios agreed well between tests and had intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0. 96. Conclusions: The dynamometer provides a reliable means of assessing knee strength in 10 to 13 year olds, with excellent test-retest reliability for isokinetic KE/KF. A learning effect occurred when assessing isometric torque, indicating the importance of habituation for this measure. Margarita D. Tsiros, Paul N. Grimshaw, Anthony J. Shield, Jonathan D.
