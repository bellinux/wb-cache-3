25|$|The channel {{originally}} {{featured a}} lower display line (LDL) {{similar to that}} seen on TWC at the bottom one-tenth of the screen, to display continuous weather information and inform viewers of current and forthcoming segments in tab form (the tab highlighting the segment being aired at the time cycled between the segment's title and a countdown clock). The national feed's LDL showed current conditions (denoting the sky condition, and cycling through the temperature, wind data and if applicable, apparent temperature) and daypart forecasts for 20 major U.S. cities, and the current time in all four time zones in the Contiguous U.S. The localized versions – which were keyed over the national LDL – cycled through current conditions and forecasts for cities within proximity of the metropolitan area, with the time bar corresponding to the local time zone. As part of a graphical overhaul on February 20, 2017, the LDL {{was replaced by a}} <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> counting down the runtime of the current segment, which had previously appeared atop the LDL.|$|E

Visual signs in Moodle indicated where hidden <b>progress</b> <b>bars</b> were to be found and these were automatically unlocked {{as soon as the}} tasks and activities linked to them were completed. Thus <b>progress</b> <b>bars</b> provided individual feedback of the student’s mastery. Since data protection guidelines had to be observed, the processing of the associated tasks to the game elements were all optional for the students, only visible to the students themselves and did not affect their final grade.|$|R

30|$|Digital badges and <b>progress</b> <b>bars</b> {{were chosen}} as game {{elements}} because both features {{were expected to}} support progress, mastery and recognition and to thereby generate learner engagement, motivation and interaction (Hakulinen et al., 2015; Utomo & Santoso, 2015; Werbach & Hunter, 2012). In addition, badges and <b>progress</b> <b>bars</b> were expected to help foster own goal-setting and learning strategies (Werbach & Hunter, 2012) in the self-determined learning environment at hand.|$|R

2500|$|Some critics, such as Eric Burns of Websnark, {{have found}} the comic to suffer from [...] "incredibly slow pacing" [...] ( [...] , only about 2 months of in-universe time have elapsed), unclear {{direction}} or resolutions for plot threads, a lack of official character profiles and plot summaries for the uninitiated, and an erratic update schedule. Burns also harshly criticized the often uncanonical filler material Gallagher employs to prevent the comic's front page content from becoming stagnant, such as Shirt Guy Dom, a punchline-driven stick figure comic strip {{written and illustrated by}} Megatokyo editor Dominic Nguyen. Following Gallagher taking on Megatokyo as a full-time occupation, some critics have complained that updates should be more frequent than when he worked on the comic part time. Update schedule issues prompted Gallagher to install an update <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> for readers awaiting the next installment of the comic; however, it has since been removed as it itself often wasn't updated.|$|E
2500|$|The Priv shiped with Android 5.1.1 [...] "Lollipop" [...] a {{month after}} Android Marshmallow was launched, using a [...] "stock" [...] user {{experience}} customized with additional features and BlackBerry-developed apps. BlackBerry Hub (which originates from BlackBerry 10) aggregates notifications and content from multiple sources and allows for granular management of messages and [...] "snoozing" [...] based off time, location or network availability. Hub can also be accessed alongside BlackBerry Search and Google Search options when swiping {{from the bottom of}} the screen. The [...] "Productivity Edge" [...] feature allows a tab to be shown on either the left or right curve of the display, which can be dragged out to display an agenda screen. A <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> can also be displayed on an edge when the device is charging. An application's home screen widget can be made available from its respective shortcut icon by swiping, which displays the widget as a pop-up window. The DTEK app allows users to view an overview of the security and privacy status of the device based on best practices, and provide notifications when apps attempt to access sensitive information or permissions. The Priv also integrates with the pre-existing Android for Work suite, which allows personal and work-oriented data on a device to be segregated (similarly to the BlackBerry Balance features on BB10).|$|E
2500|$|Build 4015 (build date of March 28, 2003) {{was leaked}} to the Internet on April 28, 2003. A number of {{features}} Microsoft {{had been working on}} were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, also moved and enlarged the Windows logo to {{the left side of the}} Start button a lot of additional configurability for the sidebar (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of [...] "Libraries" [...] (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special shell folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1's release in mid-2005. Libraries were later included in Windows 7. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> that is seen in the final release (though 4015's version was blue, not green). A new Download Manager shell location suggested that Internet Explorer would get a Mozilla-style download manager, though no such functionality was apparent. Significant memory leak problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.|$|E

50|$|The {{gameplay}} mechanics {{are almost}} the same as Normal Mode. In Time Trial Mode, the <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> starts at half. The <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> depletes as the player doesn't make any matches. The player levels up by filling the <b>progress</b> <b>bar,</b> like in Normal Mode. The <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> depletes faster as the player levels up, and gets faster and faster. If no moves are possible, the player gets a new board instead of getting a game over. If the <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> depletes completely, the player is given a Game Over.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept was}} later adopted in computing. The first {{graphical}} <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> appeared in Mitchell L Model‘s 1979 Ph. D. thesis, Monitoring System Behavior in a Complex Computational Environment. [...] In 1985, Brad Allan Myers presented {{a paper on}} “percent-done progress indicators” at a conference on computer-human interactions. [...] Myers's research involved asking people to run database searches, some with a <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> and some without.

Myers concluded {{that the use of}} a <b>progress</b> <b>bar</b> reduced anxiety and was more efficient.|$|E

30|$|To sum up, {{most of the}} {{students}} in the interview appreciated the gamification concept with badges and <b>progress</b> <b>bars</b> as useful offering not only for themselves but also for their fellow students. Looking at {{the students}}’ learning experience, the gamification concept was evaluated as a positive option to be available. The surveyed students would also like to have additional online classes gamified with badges and <b>progress</b> <b>bars.</b> In addition, most learners thought that the concept had the potential to support different learning behavior in a distance online course (e.g. “I think all students could profit.”, or “I don’t need it, but others might profit.”) since it was positively understood that gamification was voluntary (“Yes, everybody had the choice to participate.”). Students very much appreciated badges as a way of receiving direct feedback from instructors and of gaining recognition for their efforts. Badges therefore fostered their motivation for online learning (“For me, the badge was like receiving a recognition directly from the instructors.” or “I liked collecting the badges. It motivated me to keep on going.”). Interestingly, most students in the interview stated that they used the <b>progress</b> <b>bars</b> as a management tool which helped them to organize their studies and to monitor their mastery (“Progress Bars were very useful for my learning management.”, or “Yes, I could follow my progress and that helped me to follow my learning schedule.”). These statements reflect an important result, since they show that <b>progress</b> <b>bars</b> were neither perceived nor clearly identified as game elements within this context, but rather as a tool to organize and to structure online learning. Finally, however, some of the interviewees cautioned that gamification might lead to demotivation because students were not only able to follow their progress but were also able to confirm their lack of knowledge and as a result may become discouraged.|$|R
