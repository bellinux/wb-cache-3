5|$|Although NAD {{is written}} with a {{superscript}} plus sign {{because of the}} formal charge on a particular nitrogen atom, at <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> {{for the most part}} it is actually a singly charged anion (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly charged anion.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E

50|$|At <b>physiological</b> <b>pHs,</b> {{acetic acid}} is usually fully ionised to acetate. The acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is {{fundamental}} to all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it {{is central to the}} metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.|$|R
5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions at or near the <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E

Multiple organic cation transporters are determinants of the pharmacokinetics of metformin, {{and many of them}} are important in its pharmacological action, as mediators of metformin entry into target tissues. Furthermore, a recent genome-wide association study in a large multi-ethnic population implicated polymorphisms in SLC 2 A 2, encoding the glucose transporter, GLUT 2, as important determinants of response to metformin. Here, we describe the key transporters associated with metformin pharmacokinetics and response...|$|R

40|$|Glycerophosphodiesters are the {{products}} of phospholipase-mediated deacylation of phospholipids. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single gene, GIT 1, encodes a permease responsible for importing glycerophosphodiesters, such as glycerophosphoinositol and glycerophosphocholine, into the cell. In contrast, the Candida albicans genome contains four open reading frames (ORFs) {{with a high degree}} of similarity to S. cerevisiae GIT 1 (ScGIT 1) Here, we report that C. albicans utilizes glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) and glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho) as sources of phosphate at both mildly acidic and <b>physiological</b> <b>pHs.</b> Insertional mutagenesis of C. albicans GIT 1 (CaGIT 1) (orf 19. 34), the ORF most similar to ScGit 1, abolished the ability of cells to use GroPIns as a phosphate source at acidic pH and to transport [3 H]GroPIns at acidic and <b>physiological</b> <b>pHs,</b> while reintegration of a GIT 1 allele into the genome restored those functions. Several lines of evidence, including the detection of internal [3 H]GroPIns, indicated that GroPIns is transported intact through CaGit 1. GroPIns transport was shown to conform to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an apparent Km of 28 ± 6 μM. Notably, uptake of label from [3 H]GroPCho was found to be roughly 50 -fold greater than uptake of label from [3 H]GroPIns and roughly 500 -fold greater than the equivalent activity in S. cerevisiae. Insertional mutagenesis of CaGIT 1 had no effect on the utilization of GroPCho as a phosphate source or on the uptake of label from [3 H]GroPCho. Growth under low-phosphate conditions was shown to increase label uptake from both [3 H]GroPIns and [3 H]GroPCho. Screening of a transcription factor deletion set identified CaPHO 4 as required for the utilization of GroPIns, but not GroPCho, as a phosphate source...|$|R
25|$|Whereas {{histidine}} {{is positively}} charged and interacts {{well with the}} negative charges found {{on the surface of}} 2,3-BPG, Serine has a neutrally charged side chain at <b>physiological</b> <b>pH,</b> and interacts less well.

25|$|Most living tissues prosper at a near-neutral pH; that is, a pH {{close to}} 7. The pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, for instance. When cells are grown in tissue culture, the medium {{in which they}} grow is held close to this <b>physiological</b> <b>pH.</b> A small amount of phenol red added to this growth medium will have a pink-red color under normal conditions.

30|$|Bacteria are {{susceptible}} to copper loading in their intracellular environment, {{and the effectiveness of}} a copper source is related to its ability to release copper ions [16, 17]. In this respect, a significant challenge for copper-based antimicrobials is the achievement of a concentrated formulation that allows the sustained release of antimicrobial copper at effective concentrations into fluids such as wound exudate. This is because copper is a hydrolytic metal ion and as its concentration is increased at the pH of typical topical formulations (i.e. near neutral), so does its tendency to induce hydrolysis and form insoluble oxo-hydroxides [18]. At <b>physiological</b> <b>pHs,</b> these oxo-hydroxides are not good substrates for the release of soluble or, therefore, potentially efficacious, copper ions [16, 19, 20].|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that pheomelanins, the {{distinctive}} pigments of red hair and celtic skin, arise by the oxidative cyclization of cysteinyldopas, mainly the 5 -S-isomer 1, via 1, 4 -benzothiazines. However, the nature and reactivity of these intermediates have remained poorly defined. In an reexamination of the oxidation of 1, in aqueous buffers at <b>physiological</b> <b>pHs,</b> a hitherto unknown labile intermediate was identified and formulated as the 3 -hydroxy- 3, 4 -dihydro- 1, 4 -benzothiazine 5 based on direct NMR analysis of the reaction mixture and conversion to the stable benzothiazines 3 and 4 under different conditions.

25|$|Arginine (abbreviated as Arg or R) is an α-amino acid {{that is used}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of proteins. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG. It {{contains an}} α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain consisting of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain ending in a guanidino group. At <b>physiological</b> <b>pH,</b> the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−COO−), the amino group is protonated (−NH3+), and the guanidino group is also protonated to give the guanidinium form (-C-(NH2)2+), making arginine a charged, aliphatic amino acid. It is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide.|$|E
25|$|Arginine's {{side chain}} is amphipathic, because at <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> it {{contains}} a positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, {{at the end of}} a hydrophobic aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Because globular proteins have hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic surfaces, arginine is typically found on the outside of the protein, where the hydrophilic head group can interact with the polar environment, for example taking part in hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. For this reason, it is frequently found at the interface between two proteins. The aliphatic part of the side chain sometimes remains below the surface of the protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{covalent}} pair-wise {{interaction between}} boronic acids and hydroxy groups {{as found in}} alcohols and acids is rapid and reversible in aqueous solutions. The equilibrium established between boronic acids and the hydroxyl groups present on saccharides has been successfully employed to develop a range of sensors for saccharides. One of the key advantages with this dynamic covalent strategy lies {{in the ability of}} boronic acids to overcome the challenge of binding neutral species in aqueous media. If arranged correctly, the introduction of a tertiary amine within these supramolecular systems will permit binding to occur at <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> and allow signalling mechanisms such as photoinduced electron transfer mediated fluorescence emission to report the binding event.|$|E
30|$|Heat {{treatments}} by autoclaving, acid hydrolysis, or enzymatic {{treatment are}} often used to release elicitors from plant or fungal material, although {{this is not always}} essential [22]. With the L. perenne elicitor, autoclaving the supernatant or pellet fractions neither increased nor decreased the elicitor activity (Fig.  3). Thus, the elicitor(s) from L. perenne is water soluble at ambient temperatures and heat-stable. The possibilities remain that the elicitor activity could be increased by heating in acid conditions or by treating the extract with enzymes to release increased quantities of biologically active oligosaccharides. Clearly organic component(s) of the extracts are responsible for the elicitor activity, since ashing the extract completely abolished activity. Likewise, the elicitor is readily adsorbed by a cation ion exchanger and activated carbon indicating that it carries a positive charge at <b>physiological</b> <b>pHs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the isoelectric point from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly acidic pH and less soluble at a <b>physiological</b> <b>pH.</b> Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic human insulin. When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not bioavailable. A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in subcutaneous tissue. As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is somewhat slower than NPH human insulin. It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E
25|$|They used {{spider silk}} fibers {{to create a}} nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. Spider silk has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until now because of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel. Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks {{and the fact that it}} does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E
25|$|HbS {{has a lower}} {{negative}} charge at <b>physiological</b> <b>pH</b> than does normal adult hemoglobin. The consequences of the simple replacement of a charged amino acid with a hydrophobic, neutral amino acid are far ranging, Recent studies in West Africa suggest that the greatest impact of Hb S {{seems to be to}} protect against either death or severe disease—that is, profound anemia or cerebral malaria—while having less effect on infection per se. Children who are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene have only one- tenth the risk of death from falciparum as do those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin gene. Binding of parasitized sickle erythrocytes to endothelial cells and blood monocytes is significantly reduced due to an altered display of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1), the parasite’s major cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor on the erythrocyte surface. Protection also derives from the instability of sickle hemoglobin, which clusters the predominant integral red cell membrane protein (called band 3) and triggers accelerated removal by phagocytic cells. Natural antibodies recognize these clusters on senescent erythrocytes. Protection by HbAS involves the enhancement of not only innate but also of acquired immunity to the parasite. Prematurely denatured sickle hemoglobin results in an up regulation of natural antibodies which control erythrocyte adhesion in both malaria and sickle cell disease. Targeting the stimuli that lead to endothelial activation will constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit sickle red cell adhesion and vasco-occlusion.|$|E
30|$|Here, we have {{demonstrated}} {{that the issue of}} bioavailable copper ions, at <b>physiological</b> <b>pHs</b> and high concentrations, can be solved by doping a copper nanomineral with organic acids, in a similar strategy to that previously utilised for iron analogues [21, 22]. These copper-based nanoparticles (termed CHAT) readily dissolved in the bacterial medium, showing equivalent intracellular copper uptake and antibacterial activity to soluble copper salts. Critically, however, and unlike for simple copper salts, CHAT can be concentrated in a pH-neutral formulation and retain its lability in terms of copper ion release. Indeed, CHAT released copper ions within the bactericidal range and could thus be the basis for a novel, topical antimicrobial agent either alone or enhancing the efficacy of resisting antibiotics. With increasing antibiotic resistance, new topical antimicrobials are needed and CHAT is inexpensive, readily synthesised, and uses components that are generally recognised as safe (GRAS). In vivo studies are merited.|$|R
40|$|The human {{cysteine}} peptidase cathepsin K is a {{key enzyme}} in bone homoeostasis and other physiological functions. In the present study we investigate the mechanism of cathepsin K action at <b>physiological</b> plasma <b>pH</b> and its regulation by modifiers that bind outside of the active site. We show that at <b>physiological</b> plasma <b>pH</b> the enzyme fluctuates between multiple conformations that are differently susceptible to macromolecular inhibitors and can be manipulated by varying the ionic strength of the medium. The behaviour of the enzyme in vitro can be described {{by the presence of}} two discrete conformations with distinctive kinetic properties and different susceptibility to inhibition by the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg- 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin. We identify and characterize sulfated glycosaminoglycans as natural allosteric modifiers of cathepsin K that exploit the conformational flexibility of the enzyme to regulate its activity and stability against autoproteolysis. All sulfated glycosaminoglycans act as non-essential activators in assays using low-molecular-mass substrates. Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate bind at one site on the enzyme, whereas heparin binds at an additional site and has a strongly stabilizing effect that is unique among human glycosaminoglycans. All glycosaminoglycans stimulate the elastinolytic activity of cathepsin K at <b>physiological</b> plasma <b>pH,</b> but only heparin also increases the collagenolytic activity of the enzyme under these conditions. Altogether these results provide novel insight into the mechanism of cathepsin K function at the molecular level and its regulation in the extracellular space...|$|R
