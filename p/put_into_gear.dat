50|$|Schumacher {{was left}} leading David Coulthard and Gerhard Berger, who was {{promptly}} assessed a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for jumping {{the start of}} the race. The penalty dropped Berger to 14th position though he fought back to finish back in 3rd place. Berger denied jumping the start, claiming that though his car did move slightly when he <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> it was stationary when the green light came on to start the race.|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} the race was aborted with the Prost car of Jarno Trulli {{stalling}} from 14th position. Before the second attempt to start the race, Schumacher's Ferrari moved forward from his starting position and stalled as he <b>put</b> his car <b>into</b> <b>gear.</b> This promoted Häkkinen into pole position as Schumacher started {{from the back of}} the grid.|$|R
50|$|This {{starting}} method inspired Porsche {{to locate the}} ignition key switch {{to the left of}} the steering wheel.

5000|$|Although it is a {{very old}} design, the Powerglide still has a strong {{following}} in drag racing due to its strength and simplicity. Powerglides are also popular in mud racing and monster truck racing. In the first few years after introduction, they became known as the [...] "Slip-N-Slide Powerglide", due to the fluid coupling, as opposed to the mechanical coupling of a clutch-driven gearbox, and the [...] "Positive-Pop transmission". This last is due to the characteristic [...] "bump" [...] or [...] "pop" [...] which occurs as the transmission is <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> from neutral.|$|E

There, he finds a gravely wounded Blaire, who stabs him suddenly, insisting {{that no one can}} know the truth about Mount Massive, but the Walrider kills him before he can finish Park off. Park then stumbles out the open front door and towards Miles Upshur's jeep, which is still idling near the main gates. He <b>puts</b> the jeep <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> and drives through both gates as Miles, now the Walrider's host, helps him escape.|$|R
5000|$|Co-founded in September 2014 by Karnesh Sharma and Anushka Sharma, Clean Slate Films {{was set up}} {{with the}} single-minded {{intention}} of producing movies that the sibling duo [...] "believe in and the audience loves, while backing exciting, hot new talent."

50|$|The single {{circumstance}} {{under which}} a Teletouch could be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> {{with the car}} moving at greater than three to five miles per hour was if the neutral button was depressed first, thereby removing hydraulic pressure from the inhibitor switch, and then the reverse or park button pushed. These actions would, as a result, either shear off the parking pawl or suddenly set the rear wheels turning in the reverse direction, effectively locking them up against the road surface and possibly damaging the reverse bands in the transmission. Ironically, the failed Autolite Packard system protected against this set of circumstances by locking out not only reverse and park, but also neutral while the car was moving with any significant speed.|$|E
5000|$|... 1993 brought minimal {{changes to}} the Cavalier line. The {{convertibles}} receive a glass rear window, allowing rear window defrost as an option. [...] Also, General Motors received a new grille for the final time in this generation of the Chevrolet Cavalier.1994 models were also carryovers, as a redesign of the Cavalier was in development. The VL trim was dropped on the wagon, while the 2.2 L OHV L4 was now converted to the SFI version found in the Corsica, which delivered an output of 120 horsepower. Additional changes included a slightly redesigned climate control interface and the power locking system being again redesigned: the doors would still lock automatically when <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> but they would also unlock automatically when the ignition was switched off.|$|E
50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch brake stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|E
50|$|In Jerry John Rawlings' first {{official}} speech {{subsequent to the}} removal of Hilla Limann, he announced {{the creation of the}} National Commission on Democracy (NCD), which began decentralisation and dissemination. Opposition to the PNDC, agitated for a return to multi-party democracy. The National Commission on Democracy was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> high <b>gear</b> to begin the process to return to multi-party elections. National Commission for Democracy (NCD) was empowered to hold debates and formulate some suggestions for a transition to multi-party democracy. Opposition groups complained that the NCD was too closely associated with the PNDC, the commission continued its work through 1991. In March of that year the NCD released a report recommending the election of an executive president, the establishment of a national assembly, {{and the creation of a}} prime minister post. The PNDC accepted the report, and the following year it was approved in a referendum. Political parties were legalised by Rawlings—-with the provision that none could use names that had been used before—and a timetable was set for presidential and parliamentary elections.|$|R
5000|$|We {{understand}} that early {{last week the}} slip at Granton was tried for the first time, and found to answer the expectations of its most sanguine promoters. The other one, at Burntisland, at which the melancholy accident occurred, was tried on Saturday morning January 1850, and found to be equally successful. It appears that another trial of the Burntisland slip was fixed {{to take place in}} the afternoon; and while preparations were being made for what is called <b>putting</b> the engine <b>into</b> <b>gear,</b> by which the platform is moved up and down the slip, two of the workmen, unknown to any of the officials, had got under the platform, one of whom, thinking that all was right, but without receiving a signal to that effect, slipped out the [...] "palls" [...] pawls which hold the platform to the slip, the consequence of which was that the heavy mass rushed down the slip at a fearful velocity into the sea, the two poor men being underneath it, {{and one of them was}} so dreadfully mangled that ... it was found that life was extinct.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the first}} series {{produced}} ÖV4 {{was about to}} drive out of the factory and engineer Eric Carlberg <b>put</b> it <b>into</b> first <b>gear,</b> the car went backwards, where the car was actually in reverse gear. The explanation was that the differential gear in the rear axle had been fitted incorrectly. This mistake delayed the introduction by one day and the official introduction day for the ÖV4 was then adjusted to 14 April 1927, the day AB Volvo officially says the automobile company Volvo was [...] "born" [...] - [...] this is from a marketing point of view. The company as an automobile company was born as a subsidiary company to SKF on 10 August 1926.

50|$|At {{this point}} the blocks advance and are gently pressed twice against the colour pads (or sieves) which then retreat once more towards the colour troughs. During this last {{movement}} the cloth to be printed is drawn forward over the first table, and, immediately the colour pads are sufficiently out of the way, the block advances and, with some force, stamps the first impression on it. The second block is now <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> and the foregoing operations are repeated for both blocks, the cloth advancing, after each impression, a distance exactly equal to {{the width of the}} blocks. After the second block has made its impression the third comes into play in precisely the same way, so that as the cloth leaves the machines it's fully printed in three separate colours, each fitting into its proper place and completing the pattern. If necessary the forward movement of the cloth can be arrested without in any way interfering with the motion of the block, an arrangement which allows any insufficiently printed impression to be repeated in exactly the same place with a precision practically impossible in hand printing.|$|E
5000|$|The early-1960s era Corona {{reconnaissance}} satellite returned delicate film capsules to Earth that required mid-air retrieval by a JC-130 Hercules & HC-130 airlifter. These aircraft were manned by {{a crew of}} 10 personnel. The crew consisted of two pilots, one flight engineer, two telemetry operators, one winch operator, and four riggers. The telemetry operators would acquire {{the location of the}} satellite and relay the info to the pilots. Once visually acquired the pilots would head on course to the satellite descending towards the Pacific Ocean. One could visually acquire the satellite and its parachute at an altitude of approximately 50,000 ft. The winch operator and the riggers would deploy the retrieving apparatus called the [...] "Loop", which consisted of high quality nylon rope with a series of brass hooks spliced into the apparatus. The whole snatching operation by the pilots was done visually. The winch operator and the four riggers would deploy the loop. Once contact was made between the parachute and the loop the winch line would pay out and stop. The winch then was <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> and the retrieval process commenced. Once on board, the aircraft flew back to Hickam Air Force Base, where they were stationed, where the satellite or canister was offloaded onto a truck and then loaded immediately onto a running C-141 airlifter and then transported to a location in Maryland for analysis. The crews acquired these skills by practicing almost daily on practice missions, carried out with other aircraft dropping dummy bombs with chutes attached. The weights were 200 lb. in the early 70s and later to the conical parachute system which weighed in at 1,100 lb.|$|E

5000|$|Concrete mixers are {{equipped}} with anywhere from two axles and up.Four, five and six axle trucks {{are the most common}} with the number being determined by the load and local legislation governing allowable loads on the road.These are necessary to distribute the load evenly and allow operation on weight restricted roads and to reduce wear and tear on normal roads. A two or three axle truck during the winter when road weight limits are reduced has no usable payload in many jurisdictions. Other areas may require expensive permits to operate.Additional axles other than those used for steering ("steers") or drivetrain ("drives") may be installed between the steers and drives or behind the drives.Mixers commonly will have multiple steering axles as well, which generally result in very large turning radii.To facilitate maneuvering the additional axles may be [...] "lift axles" [...] which allows them to be raised off the ground so that they do not scrub (get dragged sideways across the ground) on tight turns, or increase the vehicle's turning radius.

40|$|Abstract__ On Monday morning, the {{birthday}} boy was walking {{to school with}} another boy. They were passing a bag of potato chips {{back and forth and}} {{the birthday}} boy was {{trying to find out what}} his friend intended to give him for his birthday that afternoon. Without looking, the birthday boy stepped off the curb at an intersection and was immediately knocked down by a car. He fell on his side with his head in the gutter and his legs out in the road. His eyes were closed, but his legs moved back and forth as if he were trying to climb over something. His friend dropped the potato chips and started to cry. The car had gone a hundred feet or so and stopped in the middle of the road. The man in the driver's seat looked back over his shoulder. He waited until the boy got unsteadily to his feet. The boy wobbled a little. He looked dazed, but okay. The driver <b>put</b> the car <b>into</b> <b>gear</b> and drove away. These are the events that take place at the beginning of ‘A Small, Good Thing’, a short story by Raymond Carver (1983). Later, the boy, whose name is Scotty, falls unconscious and is hospitalized. During the hours she visits home to rest, his mother receives a series of strange calls that turn out to be the baker reminding her about the birthday cake she had ordered. Despite these bleak circumstances, it is a work of fiction I thoroughly enjoyed. However, the reason I cite this mildly upsetting passage is that it serves to illuminate some themes that are important throughout the present thesis, in which I investigate text comprehension in children and adults.
