Assistant manager Graham Rodger was promoted to manager. Isaiah Rankin who had a short stay with the club in 2004, was re-signed from Brentford and other signings such as veteran Peter Beagrie and Sheffield United goalkeeper Phil Barnes were brought in. Former Mansfield Town manager Stuart Watkiss was appointed as the club's assistant manager. The Mariners got {{off to a slow start}} and the club's main strike partnership of Rankin and Michael Reddy never got going due to injury woes and Reddy harbouring the desire to play at a higher level. Grimsby found themselves near the foot of the table, and by November the poor start had basically destroyed any chances of promotion. On 6 November 2006 John Fenty sacked Graham Rodger. The club released a statement, saying [...] "He has been a loyal servant to the club, but has become a victim of circumstances... Graham has qualities this club needs – the shame of it is that this man deserved better." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{piece of}} {{research}} quantifies and analyses empirically the given economic differences among public service television in Spain {{according to the}} adopted management model (classic or outsourced). Design/methodology/approach: In so doing, an average contrast of different economic variables studied in the literature is conducted (audience share, total assets, public subsidies, cost of personnel, suppliers spending and <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxes).</b> In addition, these variables are related so as to calculate productivity obtained by each two groups of television operators. This analysis is conducted for period 2010 - 2013, featured by a crisis context in the Spanish economy. Findings: Management model adopted by each regional broadcaster impacts on different economic variables as obtained share, total assets, public subsidies, cost of personnel, suppliers spending or <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxes.</b> Moreover, those public corporations adopting an outsourced management model present better productivity values. Research limitations/implications: Only one country has been analyzed for a 4 years period. Practical implications: Regional public service broadcasters with an outsourced model present less economic losses and require less public subsidies by their corresponding regional governments. Social implications: Outsourcing part of the value chain can be useful {{so as to guarantee}} sustainability of regional public service television. Originality/value: It has been proven empirically that the management model of a regional public service television impacts its economic result...|$|R
