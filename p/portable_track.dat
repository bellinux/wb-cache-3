A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New <b>portable</b> <b>track</b> vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E

50|$|The 1906 Queensland cyclone {{destroyed}} the Church but the bell tower standing beside it survived. A new church was built of silky oak and with {{two sets of}} stumps supporting the frame to make it stronger {{but this was not}} enough to save it from the 1918 Innisfail cyclone. After the cyclone, the silky oak framework of the church was visible lying on its side but the priory was destroyed and the school razed to its floor boards. In 1920, the community began to fund raise for a new church that would withstand cyclones. Funds were raised by cake stalls, raffles, dances and concerts. 12,000 pounds were raised over four years, half of it in direct donations, many of them from towns people who were not Catholics. The plans for the church were drawn up in 1922 by Maurice Lordan. Father Clancy had decided that the new church was to be built of concrete and devised a method for transporting sand and gravel to the building site at minimum cost. The plan involved gaining permission to construct a section of <b>portable</b> <b>track</b> to meet the existing CSR tram-track so that gravel could be collected from the North Johnstone River at Goondi and carted to the building site in boxed cane trams drawn along the track by horses. Builders and volunteers came from all over the parish during construction. Mother of Good Counsel Church was blessed and opened on August 5, 1928. Aware of the large debt remaining on the church, Father Clancy had collectors among the large crowd present at the opening and the church debt was considerably reduced that afternoon.|$|E

LabVIEW was used to write the algorithm program to achieve a <b>portable</b> <b>track</b> defect visual inspection system, based on the machine vision of the <b>portable</b> <b>track</b> inspection car to carry out the field experiment. Through the test of the target area location under the different sub-value, the best value of the target area location algorithm is determined. Using the image acquisition site and part of the manual synthesis, defect images verify the effectiveness of rail surface defects detection and detection time meets the requirements of real-time detection, can be in a certain extent instead of manual inspection. Due to the limited time, the <b>portable</b> <b>track</b> defect visual inspection system is only a preliminary realization of the track defect detection automation. Further research is needed: measures for preventing the influence of the uneven light on the rail surface on the defects of the rail and the station’s throat area and rapid discrimination of the occlusion; measures to complete the whole line real-time detection and other issues under the existing train speed; and measures to better facilitate the application of real-time detection of existing lines.|$|E
