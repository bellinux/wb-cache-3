5|$|The Altiplano {{started to}} form during the Eocene, when {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate caused compression along the <b>plate</b> <b>margin.</b> Strong volcanism and tectonic uplift occurred between 15and 20million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, {{perched on}} the edge of the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 million years ago. At its current velocity, the {{seamount}} will be destroyed within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the <b>plate</b> <b>margin.</b> It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American <b>Plate</b> <b>margin.</b> A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of plate tectonic theory, geologists thought that convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> were zones of compression, thus zones of strong extension above subduction zones (back-arc basins) were not expected. The hypothesis that some convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> were actively spreading was developed by Dan Karig (1970) while {{a graduate student at}} the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. This resulted from several marine geologic expeditions to the Western Pacific.|$|R
5000|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{states that the}} Earths crust {{is made up of}} rigid plates that [...] "float" [...] on top of the mantle and move relative to one another. As the plates move, the crust deforms dominantly along the <b>plate</b> <b>margins.</b> Intraplate deformation differs from that respect by the observation that deformation can occur anywhere the crust is weak and not just at <b>plate</b> <b>margins.</b>|$|R

25|$|Throughout the Cenozoic Era, {{the large}} North American and South American {{continental}} plates moved westward from the Eurasian plate. This drift interlocked {{with the development}} of the Atlantic Ocean, trending north-south, with the North Pole in the small, nearly landlocked basin of the Arctic Ocean. The Isthmus of Panama developed at a convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> about 3 million years ago, and further separated oceanic circulation, closing the last strait, outside of the polar regions, that had connected the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.|$|E
500|$|All {{volcanic}} seamounts {{follow a}} particular pattern of growth, activity, subsidence and eventual extinction. The {{first stage of}} a seamount's evolution is its early activity, building its flanks and core up from the sea floor. This {{is followed by a}} period of intense volcanism, during which the new volcano erupts almost all (e.g. 98%) of its total magmatic volume. The seamount may even grow above sea level to become an oceanic island (for example, the 2009 eruption of Hunga Tonga). After a period of explosive activity near the ocean surface, the eruptions slowly die away. With eruptions becoming infrequent and the seamount losing its ability to maintain itself, the volcano starts to erode. After finally becoming extinct (possibly after a brief rejuvenated period), they are ground back down by the waves. Seamounts are built in a far more dynamic oceanic setting than their land counterparts, resulting in horizontal subsidence as the seamount moves with the tectonic plate [...] towards a subduction zone. Here it is subducted under the <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> and ultimately destroyed, but it may leave evidence of its passage by carving an indentation into the opposing wall of the subduction trench. The majority of seamounts have already completed their eruptive cycle, so access to early flows by researchers is limited by late volcanic activity.|$|E
2500|$|Mount Etna (or Etna; [...] or Mongibello , [...] or â Muntagna, [...] ) is {{an active}} {{stratovolcano}} {{on the east coast}} of Sicily, Italy, in the Metropolitan City of Catania, between the cities of Messina and Catania. It lies above the convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is the tallest active volcano in Europe outside the Caucasus. It is currently [...] high, though this varies with summit eruptions. It is the highest peak in Italy south of the Alps. Etna covers an area of [...] with a basal circumference of 140km. This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being {{about two and a half}} times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. Only Mount Teide in Tenerife (owned by Spain) surpasses it in the whole of the European–North-African region west of the Black Sea. In Greek Mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under this mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder and king of gods, and the forges of Hephaestus were said to also be located underneath it.|$|E
40|$|We have {{incorporated}} faults as <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> into time-dependent mantle convection models {{by using a}} mixed Eulerian and Lagrangian finite element formulation. <b>Plate</b> <b>margins</b> in our models can migrate dynamically in response to variations in mantle buoyancy, and this enables us to study the dynamics of mantle and plates including changes in plate size. Convection models in a cylindrical geometry with such a faulted converging margin, non-Newtonian rheology, and continents indicate that the converging margin tends to migrate oceanward. The oceanward trench migration leads {{to an increase in}} the size of the overriding continental plate...|$|R

2500|$|Trenches are centerpieces of the {{distinctive}} physiography of a convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margin.</b> Transects across trenches yield asymmetric profiles, with relatively gentle (~5°) outer (seaward) slopes and a steeper (~10–16°) inner (landward) slopes. [...] This asymmetry {{is due to}} the fact that the outer slope is defined by the top of the downgoing plate, which must bend as it starts its descent. [...] The great thickness of the lithosphere requires that this bending be gentle. As the subducting plate approaches the trench, it first bends upwards to form the outer trench swell, then descends to form the outer trench slope. The outer trench slope is typically disrupted by a set of sub-parallel normal faults that 'staircase' the seafloor down to the trench. The plate boundary is defined by the trench axis itself. Beneath the inner trench wall, the two plates slide past each other along the subduction decollement, the seafloor intersection of which defines the trench location. The overriding plate typically contains a volcanic arc and forearc region. The volcanic arc is caused by physical and chemical interactions between the subducted plate at depth and asthenospheric mantle associated with the overriding plate. The forearc lies between the trench and the volcanic arc. Globally, forearcs have the lowest heatflow from the interior Earth because there is no asthenosphere (convecting mantle) between the forearc lithosphere and the cold subducting plate.|$|E

40|$|Convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> {{occur when}} two {{adjoining}} tectonic plates {{come together to}} form either a subduction zone, where {{at least one of}} the converging plates is oceanic and plunges beneath the other into the mantle, or a collision zone, where two continents or a continent and a magmatic arc collide. Convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> are arguably the most complicated and dynamic plate boundaries on Earth and have been the subject of many investigations and discussions since the advent of plate tectonic theory. This paper provides a historical background and a review of the development of geological and geodynamic theories on convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins.</b> Furthermore, it discusses some of the recent advances that have been made in the fields of structural geology, geophysics and geodynamics, which are fundamental to our understanding of this phenomenon. These include: (1) the finding that plates and plate boundaries move at comparable velocities across the globe; (2) the emerging consensus that subducted slabs are between two to three orders of magnitude stronger than the ambient upper mantle; (3) the importance of lateral slab edges, slab tearing and toroidal mantle flow patterns for the evolution of subduction zones; and (4) clear evidence from mantle tomography that slabs can penetrate into the lower mantle. Still, many first-order problems regarding the geodynamic processes that operate at convergent margins remain to be solved. These include subduction zone initiation and the time of inception of plate tectonics, and with it convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins,</b> on Earth. Fundamental problems in orogenesis include the mechanism that initiated Andean mountain building at the South American subduction zone, the potential episodicity of mountain building with multiple cycles of shortening and extension, and the principal driving force behind the construction of massive mountain belts such as the Himalayas-Tibet and the Andes. Fundamental questions in subduction dynamics regard the partitioning of subduction into a trench and plate component, and the distribution of energy dissipation in the system. In seismic imaging, challenges include improving resolution at mid to lower mantle depth in order to properly understand the fate of slabs, and better constraining the 3 -D flow-related anisotropic structure in the surrounding mantle. Future insights into such fundamental problems and into the regional and global dynamics of convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> will likely be obtained from integrating spatio-temporal data, structural geological data, geophysical data and plate kinematic data into plate tectonic reconstructions and three-dimensional geodynamic models of progressive deformation...|$|R

50|$|Convergent margins {{where the}} angle of {{subduction}} is oblique will often result in the partitioning of strain into an arc parallel component (accommodated by strike slip faults or shear zones) and an arc normal component (accommodated through thrust faults).

50|$|Many {{geophysical}} {{observations in}} Tibet show a weak crustal zone {{and suggest that}} the middle to lower crust may contain fluids and be partially melted. As the Himalayan-Tibet region began to rise, lateral extrusion of the crust in the Tibetan plateau gradually became the dominant mechanism for accommodating the collision and crustal shortening. The lateral extrusion is sliding dominantly {{to the east and}} out of India's path. Eastern Tibet is traditionally interpreted as being part of a broad accommodation zone. Much of the eastern movement is due to major strike-slip faults. These strike-slip faults, along with the other faults in Tibet could still be interpreted as on a <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> though. True intraplate deformation occurs farther north in areas such as Mongolia or the Tian Shan mountains. These areas display true intraplate deformation because there is still much faulting and folding to accommodate some of the crustal shortening from the India/Eurasia collision hundreds of kilometers away from the <b>plate</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{large scale}} and {{dispersion}} of the ash tells researchers that the eruptions {{must have been}} very large and also have occurred in a convergent tectonic setting. Researchers believe this because the trace element geochemistry of the bentonite shows that its source was a felsic calc-alkalic magmatic source. This type of source is characteristic of volcanism from a continental crust destructive <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> setting.|$|E
40|$|Convergent <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> are {{currently}} distinguished as "accretional’ or ‘erosional’, {{depending on the}} tendency to accumulate sediments, or not, at the trench. Accretion and erosion can coexist along the same margin and we have noticed that this mostly occurs where subduction is oblique. Here we show that at oblique subduction zones, sediments that enter the trench are first buried, and later migrate laterally parallel to the trench and at various depths. Lateral migration of sediments continues until they reach a physical barrier where they begin to accumulate. The accretionary wedge size decreases along the trench {{moving away from the}} barrier. We therefore suggest that the gradual variation of the accretionary wedge size and sediment amount at the trench along one single subduction zone, as observed in many active <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> worldwide, {{can be explained by the}} lateral tectonic migration of sediments driven by obliquity of subduction as well...|$|R
40|$|Concentrated strain within <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> and a {{significant}} toroidal component in global plate motion {{are among the most}} fundamental features of plate tectonics. A significant proportion of strain in <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> is accommodated through motion on major tectonic faults. The decoupling influence of faulted <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> primarily results from history-dependent lithospheric deformation rather than from instantaneous stress-weakening rheologies. For instantaneous mantle flow models, we argue that faults should be treated as preexisting mechanical structures. With models incorporating preexisting faults, a power law rheology with an exponent of 3, and slab pull and ridge push forces, we demonstrate that nonlinear interaction between weak faults and this power law rheology produces plate-like motion. Our models show that in order to produce plate-like motion, the frictional stress on faults needs to be small and the asthenosphere viscosity should be much weaker than that of lithosphere. While both plateness and the ratio of toroidal to poloidal velocities are reduced with increasing fault coupling, the viscosity contrast between the lithosphere and asthenosphere only influences plateness. This shows that both diagnostics, plateness and the ratio of toroidal to poloidal velocities, are necessary to characterize plate motion. The models demonstrate that weak transform faults can guide plate motion. This guiding property of transform faults and the decoupling of thrust faults result in oblique subduction where the strike of subducted slabs is oblique to transform faults. Subducted slabs beneath a dipping fault produce oceanic trench and fore bulge topography and principal stresses consistent with subduction zone observations...|$|R
