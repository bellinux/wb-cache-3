40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency for separating liquid paraffin (or water) from a slurry consisting of 25 weight% spherical alumina in a Slurry Bubble Column Reactor (SBCR) comprised of a cylindrical tube of 10 cm diameter and 150 cm length was studied. Various differential pressures (ΔP) {{were applied to}} two separate tubular sintered metal stainless steel <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> with nominal pore size of 4 and 16 μm. The experimental results disclosed {{that the rate of}} filtrations increased on applying higher differential <b>pressure</b> to the <b>filter</b> <b>element.</b> Albeit this phenomenon is limited to moderate ΔPs and for ΔP more than 1 bar is neither harmful nor helpful. The highest filtration rates at ΔPs higher than 1 bar were 170 and 248 ml/minute for 4 and 16 μm respectively. Using water as the liquid in slurry the rate of filtration enhanced to 4 folds, and this issue reveals impact of viscosity on {{filtration efficiency}} clearly. In all situations, the total amount of particles present in the filtrate part never exceeded a few parts per million (ppm).

In order to increase the current advanced coal combustion processes, under the U. S.

The Coal Research Center of Southern Illinois University (SIUC), in collaboration with SWPC, developed a program for long-term filter testing at the SIUC Steam Plant followed by experiments using a single-filter reactor unit. The objectives of this program funded by the U. S.

The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{intake air}} {{filtration}} {{is a key}} element for limiting fouling, erosion, and corrosion in the compressor section and hot corrosion in the hot section of offshore gas turbine installations. Current intake air systems on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) are normally able to prevent serious corrosion and erosion problems in the compressor section and ensure acceptable service intervals for the hot section of the gas turbines, but compressor fouling remains a challenge. This compressor fouling occurs despite the presence of “state-of-the-art” intake air filtration systems. The performance deterioration caused by compressor fouling increases fuel consumption and emissions and has a particularly severe economic impact when it reduces the maximum available power from the gas turbine and consequently reduces oil and gas production. The main objective of this work is to determine the performance of current intake air filters offshore and their influence on gas turbine performance. The work is empirical, and the empirical data have been obtained from offshore installations, from tests performed on a GE J 85 - 13 jet engine at Kjeller, Norway, and from experimental tests on <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> in a test rig at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The filter test rig was designed and built as part of this work. The work has confirmed that considerable amounts of contaminants build up in the compressor section of offshore gas turbines despite the presence of state-of-the-art filtration systems, causing deterioration in gas turbine performance. It has been determined through analysis of compressor fouling in different offshore gas turbine engines that sodium-based salts are the dominant component of the fouling, and the influence of the observed contamination levels on gas turbine performance has been determined. The extensive test program on different types of deteriorated <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> from offshore service has revealed that accumulated salt and other contaminants are shed from the filters and re-entrained into the airflow on the downstream side of the filters when they are exposed to wet/humid operating conditions. The relationship between ingested amount of water and shed contamination from the <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> as well as the influence on differential pressure drop over the filters have been quantified. The review of offshore filter performance and experimental testing have documented that the current practice for condition monitoring of intake filter performance by monitoring the total pressure drop over the intake filters is inadequate. The re-entrainment of accumulated particles into the downstream side of the <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> causes a significant change in the pressure drop characteristics for some types of <b>filter</b> <b>elements.</b> After such incidents, an apparent improvement in filter performance in terms of reduced pressure drop will be accompanied by an increase in compressor fouling. The work has also revealed significant variations in the level of accumulated particle mass and differential <b>pressure</b> drop among <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> from the same installation. Such variations may cause some <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> to operate outside of their design criteria and will normally not be discovered by monitoring the total pressure loss over the intake filters. A thorough review of current international standards and available filter manufacturer specifications for intake air treatment systems has documented important shortcomings in how offshore-specific challenges pertaining to intake air filtration for gas turbines are handled and has revealed a need for new or improved standards for gas turbine intake systems offshore. No international standard for evaluating and documenting the performance of the complete gas turbine intake air systems in offshore applications exists. Applicable heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) air filtration standards for <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> fail to address the offshore-specific challenges related to salt removal and moist and wet operation and cannot be used to accurately predict operational performance or life. Some suppliers of <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> for offshore gas turbine application also choose not to test their filters in accordance with these standards. An international standard for offshore gas turbine air intake systems is needed {{in order to ensure that}} the specific challenges that stem from operating in an offshore environment are handled in a responsible manner. Such a standard should take a holistic approach to the intake air system rather than solely focusing on some specific components or conditions. Experimental performance evaluation of used filters from offshore service and filters exposed to accelerated deterioration in the laboratory has increased the knowledge of intake filter deterioration in offshore applications and created a basis for establishing guidelines and requirements for future standards for offshore gas turbine intake filters and systems. The accelerated saltwater deterioration method developed and applied in this work was effective in revealing significant variations in how new filters performed when exposed to this challenge. Saltwater ingestion caused filter performance to deteriorate within a short time frame, and the recorded increases in differential pressure drop were within the range of differential pressure drops recorded for used filters from offshore operation.

A series of qualification and quality assurance test methods have been identified for the range of filtering efficiencies covered by this proposed standard. Performance characteristics of sintered metal powder vs. sintered metal fiber media are dramatically different with respect to parameters like differential pressures and rigidity of the media. Wide latitude will be allowed for owner specification of performance criteria for filtration units that will be placed into newly designed systems. Such allowances will permit use of the most appropriate metal media for a system as specified by the owner with respect to material of manufacture, media velocity, system maximum static pressure, maximum differential <b>pressure</b> across the <b>filter,</b> and similar parameters...|$|R
