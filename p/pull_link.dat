Their main concern was implementing a middleware structure, not accelerating the calculation. Nishiwaki et al. proposed whole-body motion generation for reaching an object using one arm [15]. They tested their method with a real robot grasping an object on the floor. Nevertheless, they did not show the applicability of their method to reaching objects using both arms. Yamane et al. proposed a pin-and-drag interface for a human agent in a dynamics simulator [16]. They controlled the humanoid robot by <b>pulling</b> <b>links</b> in the dynamics simulation. Their method is suitable for computer graphics, where the animator controls the kinematics of the animated model. Ferrari et al. proposed a manipulation movement including locomotion for the humanoid robot [17]. They plan the CoM trajectory based on {{the distance to the}} target object and use the Jacobian-based whole-body IK to satisfy the planned CoM trajectory [18]. They tested their method in a dynamics simulation with a motion of reaching an object on a table. All these methods employ the standard Jacobian-based IK.|$|R

50|$|The mechanoreception {{of sound}} {{requires}} a {{specific set of}} receptor cells called Hair Cells that allow for gradient signals to pass onto spatial ganglia where the signal will be sent to the brain to be processed. Since this is mechanoreception, different from chemoreception, adaptation of sound from surroundings highly depends on the physical movement of opening and closing of cation channels on the hair cell stereocilia. Mechanoelectric transduction (MET) channels, located at the tops of stereocilia, are poised to detect tension induced by hair bundle deflection. Hair bundle deflection generates a force by <b>pulling</b> on tip <b>link</b> proteins connecting adjacent stereocilia.|$|R

50|$|The {{bundle of}} cilia that {{projects}} {{from the surface}} of the hair cell is the organelle which participates in mechanosensation. Each of these bundles are approximately 4-10 μm high and have 30-300 stereocilia and one kinocilium, which has motile characteristics. Along the axis of symmetry, each successive row of stereocilia is approximately 0.5-1.0 μm taller, with the kinocilium next to the tallest row. Extracellular structures connect the stereocilia together. These include ankle links (between adjacent stereocilia), shaft links (entire length of hair cell), and cross links (laterally between tips). Tip links run along the tips of the stereocilium, from the shorter end to the longer end. Tip <b>links</b> <b>pull</b> on the ion channels to open them up.

50|$|Before the {{industrialisation}} of the Rhondda Valleys in {{the late}} 19th century, Blaenrhondda was an agricultural area and sparsely populated. With {{the coming of the}} coal industry two mines were sunk in the locality. The first was the North Dunraven, also known as the Blaenrhondda, sunk in 1859, followed by Fernhill Colliery around 1871. The Dunraven closed in the 1920s but the Fernhill was still operating as late as 1978. In an attempt to break the monopoly of the Taff Vale Railway and the Cardiff docks, a tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to link up with the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway to supply coal to the Swansea Docks for export. The resulting tunnel, at a length of 3,300 yards was the longest rail tunnel in Wales and the seventh longest in Britain. Due to an issue with the weight the engines could <b>pull,</b> the rail <b>link</b> was never the success it was hoped to be, though it did prove popular with day-trippers from the Rhondda, visiting Swansea and the Gower. The station was closed in 1970.|$|R

40|$|High-fidelity {{chromosome}} {{transmission is}} fundamental in controlling {{the quality of}} the cell division cycle. The spindle pole-to-pole distance remains constant from metaphase to anaphase A. We show that fission yeast sister centromere-connecting proteins, Mis 6 and Mis 12, are required for correct spindle morphogenesis, determining metaphase spindle length. Thirty-five to sixty percent extension of metaphase spindle length takes place in mis 6 and mis 12 mutants. This may be due to incorrect spindle morphogenesis containing impaired sister centromeres or force unbalance between <b>pulling</b> by the <b>linked</b> sister kinetochores and kinetochore-independent pushing. The mutant spindle fully extends in anaphase, although it is accompanied by drastic missegregation by aberrant sister centromere separation. Hence, metaphase spindle length may be crucial for segregation fidelity. Suppressors of mis 12 partly restore normal metaphase spindle length. In mis 4 that is defective in sister chromatid cohesion, metaphase spindle length is also long, but anaphase spindle extension is blocked, probably due to the activated spindle checkpoint. Extensive missegregation is caused in mis 12 only when Mis 12 is inactivated from the previous M through to the following M, an effective way to avoid missegregation in the cell cycle. Mis 12 has conserved homologs in budding yeast and filamentous fungi...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this article}} is to broaden the perception of women trafficked for sexual purposes. It is argued here that women can be both victims and actors; they may for example at the same time be main supporters of a household and passive objects in a merciless commerce. Victimhood is a social construction, it is stressed here. The image of a trafficking victim is a notion that the trafficked women is related to and ordered by. Those that fulfill the idea of trafficked women are more likely to get support and assistance. An empirical study of 9000 trafficked persons from seven different countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc is presented. An analysis of the respondents shows that there are differences among them, and intersectional relationships within the group of trafficked persons. Four sub-groups are identified, and various push and <b>pull</b> factors are <b>linked</b> to those sub-groups. Their specific needs and problems are discussed from different feminist theoretical perspectives, and applied on four case studies. The empirical study and its results may in-deepen the understanding of the variety amongst trafficked women and thus enable support and identification mechanisms to be evaluated to meet the needs of each subgroup under the umbrella of trafficked persons for sexual purposes...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{computer}} systems called virtual patients {{are available in}} medical education today. Virtual patients are designed to emulate realistic clinical cases on a computer, and help students to practice diagnosis and clinical reasoning. They are used {{as an integral part}} of the curriculum in many medical schools. However, the technologies currently used to build virtual patients present limitations. Feedback has to be edited manually by medical experts, and the feedback provided is often not adapted to each student's interactions with the virtual patient. This makes creating and editing a virtual patient time-consuming, and limits its pedagogical impact. Indeed, relevant feedback is crucial to help students assess and reflect on their performance, reflect on their decisions and improve their clinical reasoning skills. This paper presents research on automatic feedback generation for virtual patients, using semantic web technologies. To generate feedback, a computer model has been designed to represent virtual patients and students’ interactions, using semantic web technologies. The use of semantic web technologies allows a computer readable connection between medical conditions, their symptoms and the corresponding examinations. Some of these connections can be <b>pulled</b> from existing <b>linked</b> data available on the web, which would facilitate the creation and maintenance of virtual patient data. A survey has been conducted to determine the most useful types of feedback for medical students. Relating this encoded knowledge to data describing the student’s choices of examinations allows the automatic generation of such feedback in virtual patients...|$|R
40|$|Robotics {{have shown}} {{tremendous}} developments, such as industrial robots that assist us in production lines in manufacturing such as KUKA, FANUC and mobile robots in our everyday lives/work that perform various {{tasks such as}} material handling or inspection in hazardous environments, space exploration as well as entertainment or services that involve interaction with humans or objects. Many of these robot designs are driven by servo motors that actuate the joints, i. e. classical two link planar robot manipulator design. Some designs include pulleys, ball screw, gears and other mechanisms. Although these options produces acceptable results for position control, problems such as Coulomb friction, backlash, backdrivability are not negligible. Thus researchers started venturing into direct-drive actuators that eliminate such problems and {{have come up with}} several solutions such as harmonic drive and twin drive di erential gear system. However, these solutions results in relatively low torque/thrust volume densities, i. e large and heavy motors to support large torque/forces. Others propose tubular linear permanent magnet motors as an option for linear/prismatic actuation to replace servo motor coupled with ball screw or other mechanisms. A biarticular manipulator is a musculoskeletal manipulator that consists of links and muscles. For a two-link arm, muscles consist of two pairs of monoarticular muscles (muscles that actuate single joint) and a pair of biarticular muscles (muscles that actuate two joints simultaneously). A pair of muscles means exor and extensor muscles that push or <b>pull</b> arm <b>links.</b> A new manipulator design using direct-drive spiral motors is presented. One spiral motor can represent a pair of exor/extensor muscles thus reducing the number of muscles in the biarticular manipulator from six to only three. This is because the spiral motor is a three-phase Permanent Magnet direct-drive linear actuator that provides high thrust force in forward/reverse direction without any transmission mechanism (gears/belt/pulley). Control of the spiral motor is experimentally validated by simultaneously maintaining rotational angle and gap between stator and rotor (magnetic levitation). Due to the complexity of the closed-link musculoskeletal manipulator and two degree-of-freedom spiral motors, kinematics and dynamics is derived to address spiral motor current inputs and force/torque outputs. Although actuatorlevel control can be easily achieved, workspace control requires kinematic redundancy of the manipulator to be resolved, which is investigated in position and force control in workspace domain. 横浜国立大学, 平成 25 年 3 月 22 日, 博士（工学）, 甲第 1537...|$|R

Just before <b>Link</b> <b>pulls</b> the Master Sword from its pedestal, Ganondorf reveals his wicked intentions and Zelda must flee Hyrule Castle with her guardian Impa before he can capture either of them. Still in hiding seven years later, she poses as a young Sheikah named Sheik. In this disguise she offers Link advice and assistance throughout the remainder of his quest, until she finally reveals her true identity as Princess Zelda. Thus exposed, she is finally captured by Ganondorf. After Link rescues her, Zelda works with him to escape the collapsing Castle, guiding him and using her powers to open sealed gates. When Link defeats the resurrected Ganon, she and the other six sages are able to seal Ganon away in the Sacred Realm. After this, she sends Link back to his own time, seven years earlier. After the credits, we see young Link again approaching the princess in the Hyrule Castle courtyard. This child version of this incarnation appears briefly in Majora's Mask, although this is only a cameo appearance in a flashback as Link is remembering an earlier meeting between the two of them.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the designs}} of other early {{semi-automatic}} pistols, Browning's design used a full length slide that covered {{the full length of}} the barrel, as opposed to other designs which utilized a barrel and bolt that slid in grooves machined in the frame. In the Browning design, the slide fitted into rails in the frame, and was integral with the bolt. The barrel rode in locking grooves machined into the interior of the slide, but attached to swinging links secured to the frame, one at the front and one at the rear. When the slide is forward (i.e., in battery), the length of the links holds the barrel up, locking it securely into matching grooves in the slide. Upon recoiling, the barrel and slide move backwards a short distance, locked together, until the arc of the <b>links</b> <b>pulls</b> the barrel downwards, disengaging it from the slide and halting its rearward motion. The barrel then stops moving, while the slide continues rearwards, extracting and ejecting the fired cartridge case and then returns forward, loading a fresh cartridge from the magazine. The barrel is caught, and moved forward with the slide, the camming action of the links lifting it again to lock into the matching grooves. This is identical to the modern style of short recoil action as developed for the later M1911, with the exception of employing both front and rear links, which causes the whole barrel to remain parallel to the slide as it drops out of the locking grooves. The M1911, and most other pistols since, found that it was only necessary to use a single rear link and locking grooves in the rear. When the slide retracts, only the rear of the barrel is dropped, causing it to tilt relative to the slide, while a fixed barrel bushing holds the front of the barrel in place when the slide is in battery, yet allows for movement of the slide and barrel. This approach was found to work perfectly well, and saved in complexity, cost of manufacture, as well as simplicity of assembly and disassembly.|$|R
