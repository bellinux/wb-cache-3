50|$|The PERQ 2 {{used the}} same 16k WCS CPU as the PERQ 1A and had a 3-button mouse {{in place of the}} {{graphics}} tablet. It was configured with a quieter 8-inch 35 MB Micropolis Corporation 1201 hard disk, 1 or 2 MB of RAM and had the option of the PERQ 1's <b>portrait</b> <b>monitor</b> or a 19-inch, 1280×1024 landscape orientation monitor.|$|E
50|$|The IBM DisplayWriter had a <b>portrait</b> <b>monitor</b> and {{keyboard}} {{with large}} backspace key, {{as it was}} designed for use in word processing instead of spreadsheets. Lanier, Wang, and CPT also made competing dedicated word processing computers with portrait modes. The height {{of the market for}} these computes was the late 1970s and early 1980s, prior to the introduction of the IBM PC. However, according to a long-time regional manager of the IBM personal computer division, speaking in confidence to the author of this entry in the mid-1980s, when the IBM PC was introduced, no portrait mode was made available for two reasons: (1) Top management didn't want the PC division to undermine the DisplayWriter product, (2) The computer was designed with spreadsheets and software development in mind, not word processing. Thus, it had a keyboard without a large backspace key at first, substituting a key widely used in computer software writing. Within a short period of time, the DisplayWriter and other dedicated word processors were no longer available. However, Portrait Display Labs leaped into this market niche, producing a number of rotating CRT monitors as well as software which {{could be used as a}} driver for many video cards. The later advent of the World Wide Web, whose pages are largely in portrait mode, failed to result in a widespread return to portrait displays. As of November 2011, for instance, HP no longer sells monitors in portrait mode, although they have a display stand which permits the user to attach two monitors and rotate either from landscape to display.|$|E

Some drawings are straight reportage, some slyly satirical, all expose his victims’ singularity. Aside from his <b>portraits,</b> the <b>Monitor</b> published pages’-worth of his article-illustrations as well as sketches from his travels—many from Austria—for which The President of Austria awarded him their Golden Badge of Honor in 1964.|$|R
