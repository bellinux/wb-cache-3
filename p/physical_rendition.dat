40|$|Different music {{performances}} of the same score may significantly differ from each other. It is obvious that not only the composer’s work, the score, defines the listener’s music experience, but that the music performance itself {{is an integral part}} of this experience. Music performers use the information contained in the score, but interpret, transform or add to this information. Four parameter classes can be used to describe a performance objectively: tempo and timing, loudness, timbre and pitch. Each class contains a multitude of individual parameters that are at the performers ’ disposal to generate a unique <b>physical</b> <b>rendition</b> of musical ideas. The extraction of such objective parameters is one of the difficulties in music performance research. This work presents an approach to the software-based extraction of tempo and timing, loudness and timbre parameters from audio files to provide a tool for the automatic parameter extraction from music performances...|$|E
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] major training device used to train all Landing Signal Officers (LSOs) for several decades has been the Landing Signal Officer Trainer, Device 2 H 111. This simulator, located in Oceana, VA, is contained within a two story tall room; it consists of several large screens and a <b>physical</b> <b>rendition</b> of the actual instruments used by LSOs in their operational environment. The young officers who serve in this specialty will typically encounter this system for only {{a short period of}} formal instruction (six one-hour long sessions), leaving multiple gaps in training. While experience with 2 H 111 is extremely valuable for all LSO officers, the amount of time they can spend using this training device is undeniably too short. The need to provide LSOs with an unlimited number of training opportunities unrestricted by location and time, married with recent advancements in commercial off the shelf (COTS) immersive technologies, provided an ideal platform to create a lightweight training solution that would fill those gaps and extend beyond the capabilities currently offered in the 2 H 111 simulator. This paper details our efforts on task analysis, surveying of user domain, mapping of 2 H 111 training capabilities to new prototype system to ensure its support of major training objectives of 2 H 111, design and development of prototype training system, and a feasibility study that included tests of technical system performance and informal testing with trainees at the LSO Schoolhouse. The results achieved in this effort indicate that the time for LSO training to make the leap to immersive VR has decidedly come...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{constructed}} from a conglomerate {{of materials and}} forms that have shaped me. A forests of tea-tree sticks, a mound of cuttlefish; wave, a midden, a coastline, the sea currents and star systems, {{the blink of an}} eye. These elements merge to represent the places and stories that impact on my everyday. The point of juncture, between past and present, offers me practical ways to inculcate and make sense of my childhood, raised besides a noisy amusement park (St Kilda Luna Park), and of my maternal Indigenous, Trawlwoolway, family ancestry on coastal north eastern Tasmania, amidst tea-tree and she-oak and brilliant night skies. Making <b>physical</b> <b>renditions</b> of how we create ourselves from our own and inherited stories interests me; figuring ways to render distinct, sometimes blurred and disassociated personal and public memories is an ongoing process...|$|R

In the mid 1980s, he often appeared on Vivian and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall's showboat, the Old Profanity Showboat, in Bristol's Floating Harbour.|$|R
