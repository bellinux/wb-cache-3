5|$|In 2012, the {{combined}} Hard Rock/Metal category returned following a major overhaul of Grammy Award categories. The separate Best Hard Rock <b>Performance</b> and Best Metal <b>Performance</b> categories were merged into the slightly renamed Best Hard Rock/Metal <b>Performance</b> category. However, in June 2013, {{it was announced}} that {{the combined}} category was being discontinued in favor of reinstating Best Metal <b>Performance.</b> Beginning in 2014, quality hard rock performances were recognized under the category Best Rock <b>Performance.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{performers}} and groups, including several early leaders, {{have been recognized}} for their contributions to taiko <b>performance.</b> Daihachi Oguchi was best known for developing kumi-daiko <b>performance.</b> Oguchi founded the first kumi-daiko group called Osuwa Daiko in 1951, and facilitated the popularization of taiko <b>performance</b> groups in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend <b>performance.</b> Peck suggests that digital folklore <b>performance</b> extends the dynamics of face-to-face <b>performance</b> in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for <b>performance</b> that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual <b>performance</b> with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
50|$|PDS Stage <b>performances</b> are smaller-scaled <b>performances,</b> {{generally}} with 10-20 performers on stage. Unlike the larger-scaled Field <b>Performances,</b> stage <b>performances</b> usually {{include more}} spectacular, advanced PDS drills. Stage <b>performances</b> {{have also been}} known to include special lighting effects into its <b>performances.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other {{critically}} acclaimed live recordings by Richter include <b>performances</b> of Scriabin's selected études, preludes and sonatas (multiple <b>performances,</b> different years), Schumann's Cmajor Fantasy (multiple <b>performances,</b> different years), Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata (Moscow, 1960), Schubert's B-flat Sonata (multiple <b>performances,</b> different years), Ravel's Miroirs (Prague, 1965), Liszt's B minor Sonata (multiple <b>performances,</b> 1965–66), Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata (multiple <b>performances,</b> 1975) and selected preludes by Rachmaninoff (multiple <b>performances,</b> different years) and Debussy (multiple <b>performances,</b> different years).|$|R
30|$|As can be seen, in a “top-down” consideration, the infrastructural <b>performances</b> can {{generally}} {{influence the}} technical/technological <b>performances,</b> and consequently create a mutual interaction between these {{and all other}} <b>performances.</b> In a “bottom-up” consideration, the environmental and social <b>performances</b> can influence the infrastructural and technical/technological <b>performances</b> and consequently create a mutual interaction between these and all other <b>performances.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{a part of}} {{the major}} {{overhaul}} of Grammy categories, the award was discontinued in 2011. The Female R Vocal <b>Performance</b> category, Male R Vocal <b>Performance</b> category and all duo/group vocal performances in the R category shifted to the Best R <b>Performance</b> category in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{category}} Best Soul Gospel <b>Performance,</b> Male or Female {{there were two}} categories separated by gender: Best Soul Gospel <b>Performance,</b> Female and Best Soul Gospel <b>Performance,</b> Male. Both awards were presented from 1984 to 1989. The first gender-neutral award was presented in 1990. In 1991, another category restructure resulted in the soul gospel categories being divided into awards for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album and Best Traditional Gospel Album (previously known as Best Soul Gospel <b>Performance,</b> Contemporary and Best Soul Gospel <b>Performance,</b> Traditional from 1978 to 1983), both of which lasted until the 53rd Grammy Awards in 2011.|$|E

30|$|As can be seen, {{according}} to the ‘top-down’ approach, the infrastructural <b>performances</b> directly influence the technical/technological <b>performances,</b> thus causing their mutual influence {{as well as the}} influence between them and all other <b>performances.</b> According to the ‘bottom-up’ approach, the social/policy <b>performances</b> can directly influence the infrastructural and technical/technological <b>performances,</b> thus creating the mutual influence of these and all other <b>performances.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{restructuring}} of the categories and combination of Best Rap Solo <b>Performance</b> and Best Rap <b>Performance</b> by a Duo or Group back into Best Rap <b>Performance</b> was the consequence of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences' wish to decrease the number of categories and awards and to eliminate distinctions between solo and duo or group performances.|$|E

50|$|PDS <b>performances</b> can be {{generally}} classified under two major types, Stage <b>Performances</b> and Field <b>Performances.</b>|$|R
50|$|PDS Field <b>performances</b> are the largest-scaled <b>performances,</b> {{generally}} with 28-40 performers on a {{grass field}} or courtyard. Unlike the smaller-scaled Stage <b>Performances,</b> Field <b>Performances</b> can be displayed to a significantly much larger crowd of spectators. Pyrotechnic {{devices such as}} sparks or fireworks could be included in its <b>performances.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Performance</b> {{appraisal}} or <b>performance</b> {{evaluation is}} the process in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job. <b>Performance</b> appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for <b>performance</b> management. <b>Performance</b> management {{is the process}} of providing <b>performance</b> feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). <b>Performance</b> management may also include documenting and tracking <b>performance</b> information for organizational evaluation purposes.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{measures}} of <b>performance</b> and constant reactivity to <b>performance</b> appraisals challenge the very {{purpose of the}} system of <b>performance</b> appraisals, but <b>performance</b> evaluations can still offer organizations feedback about their practices. If <b>performance</b> evaluations did not accurately measure individual's abilities and productivity, it would be fruitless to continue to execute a system of constant <b>performance</b> evaluations. However, a phenomenon known as the <b>performance</b> paradox seems to suggest that <b>performance</b> evaluations may not be altogether futile.|$|E
25|$|To assess job <b>performance,</b> {{reliable}} and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with <b>performance</b> ratings, error can be reduced through rater training and {{through the use of}} behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior <b>performance.</b> Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job <b>performance</b> include the instability of job <b>performance</b> over time due to forces such as changing <b>performance</b> criteria, the structure of the job itself and the restriction of variation in individual <b>performance</b> by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor <b>performance</b> and lack of importance of individual <b>performance.</b>|$|E

25|$|Musical <b>performances</b> at the Tang court are of two types: seated <b>performances</b> (坐部伎) and {{standing}} <b>performances</b> (立部伎). Seated <b>performances</b> {{were conducted in}} smaller halls with limited number of dancers, and emphasised refined artistry. Standing <b>performances</b> involves numerous dancers, and were usually performed in courtyards or squares intended for grand presentations.|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{military}} ceremonial <b>performances,</b> the 78th Army Band frequently performs {{community relations}} <b>performances.</b> These <b>performances</b> often include {{high school and}} community concerts, parades and other such <b>performances</b> as requested {{by members of the}} community at large.|$|R
25|$|The {{most basic}} Roofline {{model can be}} visualized by {{plotting}} floating-point <b>performance</b> {{as a function of}} machine peak <b>performance,</b> machine peak bandwidth, and arithmetic intensity. The resultant curve is effectively a <b>performance</b> bound under which kernel or application <b>performance</b> exists, and includes two platform-specific <b>performance</b> ceilings: a ceiling derived from the memory bandwidth and one derived from the processor’s peak <b>performance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} <b>performance</b> paradox is {{grounded}} in three characteristics of <b>performance</b> measurement. Firstly, there are many <b>performance</b> metrics, and the number continues to grow. Secondly, most measures of <b>performance,</b> even those that are used most frequently, exhibit little to no correlation with one another. And thirdly, the dominant <b>performance</b> measures at any given point in time change continuously.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, perverse {{learning}} {{results in}} stagnating <b>performance</b> levels within an organization because it leads individuals {{to focus on}} improving their outcome in <b>performance</b> measures, rather than their actual <b>performance.</b> For example, teachers may often dedicate their efforts towards improving their students' test scores rather than their teaching style. Similar to positive learning, perverse learning leads to a decreased variability in measured <b>performance</b> levels, but this <b>performance</b> improvement is artificial.|$|E
50|$|Professional <b>performances,</b> {{as opposed}} to amateur <b>performances,</b> are those in which {{performers}} receive payment for their <b>performances.</b> Professional <b>performances</b> are engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work. A professional actor is someone who derives income by participating in professional <b>performances.</b> A professional theatre company auditions actors to perform in their professional theatre. The company sells tickets; actors receive payment for their <b>performances.</b> This {{is the same for}} musicians, dancers, comedians. Also see: professional sports.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} point loss for {{symmetrical}} probe <b>performances</b> on other <b>performances</b> of an observed equivalence class, on {{the emergence of}} equivalence <b>performances,</b> and on <b>performances</b> in other contexts were examined.

In context 3, only trained conditional discrimination trials were delivered. After demonstrations of equivalence in contexts 1 and 2, point loss was placed on symmetrical <b>performances</b> {{in one of these}} contexts; probe trials and point loss for symmetrical <b>performances</b> were simultaneously introduced in context 3.
