40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the relationship of managerial compensation to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses.</b> This study discusses the arguments that have made the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> an intuitively appealing concept within the broad agency literature, and, based on these arguments, conducts empirical tests aimed at determining whether managerial compensation does relate to the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses.</b> ^ The most current means of studying the income-compensation relationship, the compensation coefficients, makes finding a good understanding of managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>loss</b> reserves an important goal. The loan loss provision is hypothesized to be a function of loan quality and managerial compensation. If internal and external parties interested in bank performance and reporting better understand the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses,</b> more efficient labor contracts can be written and financial performance and reporting should be improved. ^ The structure of the empirical tests flows from the argument that earnings management represents a cost to shareholders. This argument rests {{on the assumption that the}} <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> specifically plays a central role in managerial compensation at financial institutions. Recent work in agency theory is utilized to construct the setting in which the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> is tested <b>for</b> its ability to influence earnings. The empirical model constructed is a multiple regression equation with the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>loss</b> as the dependent variable, and asset equity, income and compensation item as independent variables. ^ The empirical results show that the relationship between managerial compensation and the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> is much like the arguments would suggest. Although assets, equity and income are the dominant factors in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses,</b> managerial compensation plays a role in explaining the <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Prior {{research}} shows that during the pre- 1990 bust financially weak banks managed income upward by delaying <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> on heterogeneous loans. In contrast, we predict and find that during the 1990 s boom profitable banks managed income downward by accelerating <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> on homogeneous loans. Prof-itable banks obscured their income smoothing by accelerating charge-offs of homo-geneous loans and by recording more gross charge-offs to offset recoveries of previ-ously charged-off loans. Over the three years subsequent to the acceleration of charge-offs, they had higher and more persistent income before <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> than other banks, consistent with income smoothing over a prolonged horizon...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that banks smooth income by managing <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> and loan charge-offs in a coordinated fashion that varies across the bust and boom phases of the business cycle and across homogeneous and heterogeneous loan types. In particular, during the 1990 s boom, we predict and find that banks accelerated <b>provisioning</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> and made this less obvious by accelerating loan charge-offs, especially for homogenous loans for which charge-offs are determined using number-of-days-past-due rules. We also {{provide evidence}} that the valuation implications of banks’ <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> and loan charge-offs vary across the phases of the business cycle and loan types reflecting {{the effect of these}} factors on banks’ income smoothing. In particular, during the 1990 s boom, we predict and find that charge-offs of homogenous loans have a positive association with current returns and future cash flows, because these charge-offs are recorded primarily by healthy banks with good future prospects reducing over-stated allowances <b>for</b> loan <b>losses.</b> We also predict and find that these charge-offs have a positive association with future returns that is explained by their positive association with future net income and recoveries. Our results are consistent with the market only partially appreciating healthy banks’ overstatement of charge-offs of homogeneous loans based on number-of-days-past-due rules during the 1990 s boom, because of the perceived non-discretionary nature of these charge-offs. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Computer, Statistical and Mathematical Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. With the {{acceptance}} of the new Basel II banking regulation (implemented in South Africa in January 2008) the search for improved ways of modeling the most important banking activities has become very topical. Since the notion of Levy-process was introduced, it has emerged as an important tool for modeling economic variables in a Basel II framework. In this study, we investigate the stochastic dynamics of banking items that are driven by such processes. In particular, we discuss bank <b>provisioning</b> <b>for</b> loan <b>losses</b> and deposit withdrawals. The first type of provisioning is related to the earnings that the bank sets aside in order to cover loan defaults. In this case, we apply principles from robustness to a situation where the decision maker is a bank owner and the decision rule determines the optimal <b>provisioning</b> strategy <b>for</b> loan <b>losses.</b> In this regard, we formulate a dynamic banking loan loss model involving a provisioning portfolio consisting of <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> expected <b>losses</b> and loan <b>loss</b> reserves <b>for</b> unexpected <b>losses.</b> Here, unexpected loan <b>losses</b> and <b>provisioning</b> <b>for</b> expected <b>losses</b> are modeled via a compound Poisson process and an exponential Levy process, respectively. We use historical evidence from OECD (Organization for Economic Corporation and Development) countries to support the fact that the <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> loan losses-to-total assets ratio is negatively correlated with aggregate asset prices and the private credit-to-GDP ratio. Secondly, we construct models <b>for</b> <b>provisioning</b> <b>for</b> deposit withdrawals. In particular, we build stochastic dynamic models which enable us to analyze the interplay between deposit withdrawals and the <b>provisioning</b> <b>for</b> these withdrawals via Treasuries and reserves. Further insight is gained by considering a numerical problem and a simulation of the trajectory of the stochastic dynamics of the sum of the Treasuries and reserves. Since managing the risk that depositors will exercise their withdrawal option is an important aspect of this thesis, we consider the idea of a hedging <b>provisioning</b> strategy <b>for</b> deposit withdrawals in an incomplete market setting. In this spirit, we discuss an optimal risk management problem for a commercial bank whose main activity is to obtain funds through deposits from the public and use the Treasuries and reserves to cater for the resulting withdrawals. Finally, we provide a brief analysis of some of the issues arising from the dynamic models of the banking items derived. Doctora...|$|R

The author of this article argues that such behavior reflects not a general decline in ethical standards so much as executives' growing sense that accounting itself has become "unhinged from value. " For example, clearly valuable expenditures on R&D, customer acquisition, and employee training are generally expensed immediately against earnings. And reported corporate income is often further reduced by <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>losses</b> that most companies never expect to incur, by "book" taxes they never expect to pay, and by depreciation charges on assets that are actually increasing in value.

Policy components include the extent of patent coverage across industry sectors, enforcement mechanisms, <b>provisions</b> <b>for</b> <b>loss</b> of patent protection, memberships to other international patent agreements, and duration of patent protection. Extending the empirical and theoretical work of Smith (2002), this paper uses a gravity model to analyze how IPRs affect the market power and market expansion effects of exports to countries with differing abilities to imitate technology. The findings suggest that strengthening global IPRs grant a market power effect to U. S. exporters; strong IPRs reduce U. S. exports by awarding a temporary monopoly over the protected good. However, {{the analysis of the}} individual policy components of an IPR system reveal which components inhibit trade through market power effects and which components counterbalance it through market expansion effects, increasing the flow of trade and access to biotechnology related agricultural inputs...|$|R

The relationship between parameters including journal type, number of authors, trial design, involvement of methodologist, single-/multi-center study and region and year of publication, and the accuracy of sample size reporting was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.
