40|$|Abstract: Are parental {{financial}} transfers to adult children correlated with subjective parental longevity? Despite rapid and continuing increases in life expectancy, {{no previous study}} has looked at transfers in relation to parents ‟ opinions of how long they will live. This paper uses the subjective survival probability data included in the Health and Retirement Study to examine this potential correlation for {{a select group of}} unmarried older parents. I find no relationship between subjective longevity and reported actual transfers. For mothers only, I consistently find modest positive correlations between subjective longevity and anticipated future inter vivos transfers and bequests. For fathers, I find a non-linear relationship between subjective longevity and anticipated future inter vivos transfers. I discuss the potential reasons for these descriptive results and some further questions that arise from them. 1 1 Many thanks to Professors Donald Cox and Peter Gottschalk of Boston College and Professor Kathleen McGarry of UCLA for their comments and advice.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} framework that encompasses four distinct motives for dollarization and discuss appropriate policy responses to help contain dollarization and its attendant risks. "Moral hazard " dollarization provides a clear case for prudential policy activism, including through the introduction of currency-speci 8 ̆ 5 c prudential norms. However, prudential reform will have only a limited impact on dollarization when the main culprits are fear of oating and lack of monetary credibility. In such cases, a concerted and comprehensive reform agenda, including market oriented and institutional reforms, {{would be needed to}} shift the balance of risks in favor of the peso. While quantitative limits on dollarization could also be used to speed up dedollarization, risks could be high.

40|$|Medulloblastoma, a {{small blue}} cell {{malignancy}} of the cerebellum, {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric oncology. Current mechanisms for clinical prognostication and stratification include clinical factors (age, presence of metastases, and extent of resection) as well as histological subgrouping (classic, desmoplastic, and large cell/anaplastic histology). Transcriptional profiling studies of medulloblastoma cohorts from several research groups around the globe have suggested the existence of multiple distinct molecular subgroups that differ in their demographics, transcriptomes, somatic genetic events, and clinical outcomes. Variations in the number, composition, and nature of the subgroups between studies brought about a consensus conference in Boston in the fall of 2010. <b>Discussants</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conference came to a consensus that the evidence supported the existence of four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (Wnt, Shh, Group 3, and Group 4).

40|$|Unemployment in Britain {{has fallen}} from high European-style levels to US levels. I argue that the key reasons are first the reform of {{monetary}} policy, in 1993 with the adoption of inflation targeting and in 1997 {{with the establishment of}} the independent Monetary Policy Committee, and second the decline of trade union power. I interpret the reform of monetary policy as an institutional change that reduced inflationary expectations in the face of falling unemployment. The decline of trade union power contributed to the control of wage inflation. The major continental economies failed to match UK performance because of institutional rigidities, despite low inflation expectations.

It concludes that adequate infrastructure is necessary for economic growth and that it can contribute to reduction in inequality. The second section of the paper summarizes the lessons learned from infrastructure reform in Latin America and in the “transition ” economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The lessons from Latin America show the importance of introducing competition where feasible, regulating where monopoly power exists and encouraging private participation. An important lesson from the “transition ” economies is that it is necessary to introduce mechanisms to avoid asset stripping and tunneling. While lessons from other countries can be useful, the specific reforms in Cuba or any other country must be modified to fit the loca...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{regulation}} on productivity and welfare in the U. S. sugar manufacturing industry. While this U.

We show that regulation significantly reduced productivity, with these productivity losses leading to large welfare losses. Our initial {{results indicate that the}} welfare losses are many times larger than those typically studied – those arising from higher prices. We also argue that the channels through which regulation led to large productivity and welfare declines in this industry were also present in many other regulated industries, like banking and trucking.
