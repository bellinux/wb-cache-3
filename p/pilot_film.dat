The fifth season aired on cable network TNT. The show aired every week in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 without a break; {{as a result the}} last four or five episodes of the early seasons were shown in the UK before the US. The <b>pilot</b> <b>film</b> debuted in the United States with strong viewing figures, achieving a 9.7 in the Nielsen national syndication rankings. The series proper debuted with a 6.8 rating/10 share. Figures dipped in its second week, and while it posted a solid 5.0 rating/8 share, with an increase in several major markets, ratings for the first season continued to fall, to a low of 3.4 during reruns, and then increasing again when new episodes were broadcast in July.|$|E

25|$|Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (September 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was an American {{business}} magnate, investor, record-setting <b>pilot,</b> <b>film</b> director, and philanthropist, known {{during his}} lifetime {{as one of the}} most financially successful individuals in the world. He first made a name for himself as a film producer, and then became an influential figure in the aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle—oddities that were caused in part by a worsening obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain from several plane crashes, and increasing deafness.|$|E

25|$|Spelling and Goldberg {{decided to}} add actor David Doyle to the cast as John Bosley, an {{employee}} of Charlie, who would frequently aid the 'Angels' in their assignments. Although ABC had approved of a <b>pilot</b> <b>film,</b> {{they were concerned about}} how audiences would accept three women fighting crime on their own. ABC executives brought in David Ogden Stiers as Scott Woodville, who would act as the chief back-up to the Angels and Bosley's superior; he would also be depicted as the organizer of the plan, in similar fashion to Jim Phelps in , a series for which Goff and Roberts had written. Woodville also was the only regular known to meet Charlie face to face.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Huguenot congregations (or individuals) in North America {{eventually}} {{affiliated with}} other Protestant denominations with more numerous members. The Huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate French communities, {{which led to}} their assimilation. Their descendants in many families continued to use French first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century. Assimilated, the French made numerous contributions to United States economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late Colonial and early Federal periods. For example, E.I. du Pont, {{a former student of}} Lavoisier, established the Eleutherian gunpowder mills.. Howard Hughes, famed investor, <b>pilot,</b> <b>film</b> director, and philanthropist, was also of Huguenot descent and descendant from Rev. John Gano.|$|E
25|$|Windaria {{was first}} {{distributed}} in Japan to home video by Victor Entertainment.

25|$|Anderson {{hoped to}} {{continue}} his renewed success with a series called Space Police, a new show mixing live action and puppets. The Space Police name had already been registered by another company, so Anderson's programme eventually emerged in 1995 as Space Precinct. A <b>pilot</b> <b>film</b> had previously been made with Shane Rimmer, but it took almost ten years to get the concept to the screen. In the meantime, Anderson and Burr produced the cult stop-motion animated series Dick Spanner, which enjoyed many showings on the British Channel 4 in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was the final project completed by Anderson Burr. Anderson then joined the Moving Picture Company as a commercials director, and provided special effects direction for the musical comedy Return to the Forbidden Planet.|$|E
25|$|The 90-minute <b>pilot</b> <b>film</b> {{initially}} {{aired on}} March 21, 1976. The story focuses heavily on Kelly Garrett (a role intended for Jackson before she and Smith swapped) who poses as an heiress who returns home to gain her father's successful winery. In {{the end of}} the film the three women are caught in a bind and Scott attempts to save them, but to no avail, leaving them to solve the dilemma on their own (and with the help of allies made during the story). ABC executives were somewhat disappointed in this initial project, fearing there was more emphasis on light-weight fluff than serious drama. After viewing the pilot, Spelling encouraged executives to delete Scott Woodville from the series; according to The Charlie's Angels Casebook, audiences also reacted negatively to the character. Bosley was kept, made slightly less inept than depicted in the pilot, and was given many of Woodville's attributes and responsibilities. The series formally premiered on Wednesday, September 22, 1976 at 10:00pm.|$|E

500|$|Nomura {{sought to}} make Cloud's design [...] "distinctly {{different}} from the other characters." [...] About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which [...] "looked gross." [...] Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the <b>pilot</b> <b>film,</b> which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of [...] "clothes designed for action", the staff began {{with the idea of a}} black robe, eventually parring it down to a [...] "long apron" [...] shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as [...] "the fusion swords" [...] during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't [...] "logically thought out" [...] and the staff didn't think that they could [...] "make it work physically", it was believed to provide [...] "an interesting accent to the story." [...] Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's [...] "Hardy-Daytona" [...] motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.|$|E
