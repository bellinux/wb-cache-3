25|$|The Kindle Paperwhite (1st generation) was {{announced}} on September 6, 2012, and released on October 1. It has a 6in, 212PPI E Ink Pearl display (758×1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs {{to illuminate the}} screen. It was available in Wi-Fi ($120 ad-supported, $140 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($180 ad-supported, $200 no ads) models, with the ad-supported options only intended to {{be available in the}} United States. The light {{is one of the main}} features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. The 3G access restrictions are the same as the Kindle Touch, and usage of the 3G data is limited to 50 MB per month and only on Amazon and Wikipedia's websites; additional data may be purchased. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. The official leather cover for the Paperwhite uses the hall effect sensor in the device that detects when the cover is closed/opened to turn the screen off/on respectively. This device was the first Kindle to track one's reading speed to estimate when one will finish a chapter or book; this feature was later included with updates to the other Kindles and Kindle Fire tablets. The Kindle Paperwhite lacks physical buttons for <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> and does not perform auto-hyphenation. Except for the lock screen/power button at its bottom, it relies solely on the touchscreen interface. In November 2012, Amazon released the 5.3.0 update that allowed users to turn off recommended content on the home screen in Grid View (allowing two rows of user content) and included general bug fixes. In March 2014, the Paperwhite 5.4.4 update was released that added Goodreads integration, Kindle FreeTime to restrict usage for children, Cloud Collections for organization and Page Flip for scanning content without losing your place, which closely matched the Paperwhite 2's software features.|$|E
500|$|Yellow Star {{was made}} into an {{audiobook}} read by Christina Moore in 2007. A Booklist review noted that [...] "Moore's 'vroom sput-sput pop' to mirror Nazi motorcycles, booming bomb sounds, and transition to a scratchy voice to reflect the youngster's oncoming sickness more than make up for a few technical glitches, including evidence of <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> and distracting breathing sounds." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{books of}} sheet music, {{relatively}} short pieces {{of music that}} span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of <b>page</b> <b>turns</b> for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left-hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one <b>page</b> <b>turn</b> during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right-hand sheet), the two-page work will span {{the left and right}} pages, alleviating the need for a <b>page</b> <b>turn</b> during the second work. Intentionally blank pages may also prevent a <b>page</b> <b>turn</b> during a difficult passage.|$|R

50|$|A {{specialized}} form of document scanning is book scanning. Technical difficulties {{arise from}} the books usually being bound and sometimes fragile and irreplaceable, but some manufacturers have developed specialized machinery to deal with this. Often special robotic mechanisms are used to automate the <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> and scanning process.|$|E
5000|$|Released on November 22, 2010 {{and added}} {{optional}} password {{protection for the}} device and for making purchases, a [...] "My Shelves" [...] feature for organizing the user's e-book library, and automatic syncing of the last page read across multiple devices. Other improvements include faster <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> and improved search options.|$|E

50|$|The book is {{laid out}} so that hymns occupying two pages in the book always start on the left. Thus, a <b>page</b> <b>turn</b> is never {{required}} {{in the middle of}} a hymn.|$|R
50|$|Braille music {{tends to}} be rather bulky. Because of this, a system of {{repetition}} symbols—much more extensive than that in print music—is employed to reduce <b>page</b> <b>turns,</b> size of scores, and expense of printing.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} page layouts: Book, Full Screen, and Scroll. In Book or Full Screen layout, pages are turned by tapping or {{dragging}} the page, animated {{to imitate the}} appearance of a paper book. In Scroll, there is no <b>page</b> <b>turning,</b> and the book appears as continuous text, read vertically like a web browser.|$|E
5000|$|For fantasybookreview.co.uk, Bindi Lavelle wrote [...] "The detective stylings of Foolmoon enriches a plot full of red {{herrings}} and {{clues that}} only {{come together in}} the book's climax; Fool Moon reads like a good detective novel, with magic. For a <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> mix or neo noir and urban fantasy, {{look no further than}} Fool Moon." ...|$|E
5000|$|Storybook World is an {{animated}} series that {{was released on}} video. The opening, ( [...] which was better animated {{than most of the}} cartoons [...] ) showed a castle and zoomed inside the castle which showed an enormous pile of books.

50|$|Eventually, the <b>page</b> <b>turns</b> up, but {{the case}} against him falls apart for lack of evidence. As for the other three, they are never heard from again, and it is {{believed}} that they perished in the wreck of the Norah Creina off Portugal.|$|R
5000|$|Publishers Weekly wrote, in a starred review, [...] "Crammed {{with the}} kind of {{characters}} and detail that make <b>pages</b> <b>turn</b> and moviemakers salivate, self-described 'mobster, drug lord, and porn kingpin,' Gallo's story of life as a criminal and Fafia associate is tantalizing material." ...|$|R

5000|$|Critics {{pointed to}} the Nook's [...] "sluggish" [...] performanceand user {{interface}} design, with New York Times reviewer David Pogue writing that the Nook suffered from [...] "half-baked software." [...] Pogue later demonstrated using a postal scale that the Nook's weight differed from the product specifications advertised by Barnes & Noble (12.1 ounces rather than 11.2 ounces as the company had advertised). Engadget reviewer Joshua Topolsky argued that menu responsiveness and organization was not optimal but commented that [...] "many of the problems seem like they could be fixed with firmware tweaks." [...] PC Magazine wrote that the 1.3 firmware update, released after most reviews of the Nook, improved the device's responsiveness: [...] "On the original Nook, <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> took {{twice as long as}} <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> on the Kindle - two seconds compared to one second. With the 1.3 firmware update, it's about a tenth of a second slower than the Kindle, but the difference is negligible." ...|$|E
5000|$|Introductory reading {{features}} at launch included selecting font, font size, line spacing, and day/night reading modes, and {{the ability}} to pick up reading positions while using multiple devices. On Android, the home screen ("Read now") shows the recently opened books at the top, along with book recommendations and books +1'd by friends. The [...] "My Library" [...] section shows all the books grouped into three categories: [...] "Purchases", [...] "Samples" [...] and [...] "Uploads". Books can be [...] "kept on device" [...] for offline reading. Play Books features a 3D <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> effect, with an option to turn it off. It also allows users to turn pages using the device's volume controls. The website interface does not support different reading modes or any <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> effect. Text can be read out loud using the device's text-to-speech engine or Google Text-to-Speech, with an option for [...] "High-quality voice" [...] in settings, although the feature requires a data connection to stream the voice data.|$|E
5000|$|In April, Amazon {{released}} the Kindle Oasis, its first e-reader {{in five years}} to have physical <b>page</b> <b>turn</b> buttons and as a premium product includes a leather case with a battery inside; the Oasis without including the case is the lightest e-reader on the market.|$|R
5000|$|In October, Amazon {{releases}} the Kindle Voyage {{that has a}} 6-inch, 300 ppi E Ink Carta HD display, which was the highest resolution and contrast available in e-readers as of 2014.

25|$|Engadget {{gave the}} Glowlight a 73 out of 100, {{saying it is}} the best Nook with its {{improved}} display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical <b>page</b> <b>turn</b> buttons compared to previous Nooks.|$|R
50|$|As {{the printed}} version gives the {{impression}} of being organised for convenient <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> when sight-playing the score, {{the order of the}} pieces intended by Bach (if there was an intended order) remains uncertain, although it is customary to open the collection with the Ricercar a 3, and play the trio sonata toward the end. The Canones super Thema Regium are also usually played together.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{the term}} 'flipchart' in {{describing}} these electronic documents derives from the similarity in the way a physical flipchart is commonly used, effectively starting with a set of 'blank canvas' pages upon which to present. The very early versions of Activstudio had a much reduced functionality set, comprising simple pens, highlighters and <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> and hence the analogy with 'flipcharts' was born and has remained.|$|E
50|$|Until May 2009 all KOS Media {{newspapers}} were free. In June both Kent on Saturday and Kent on Sunday became paid {{for in the}} newsagents, {{in order to increase}} availability, whilst the free copies were diverted to business rounds and home delivery. The mid-week local papers remain free. All titles have a fast-growing online audience as they are available free as a <b>page</b> <b>turning</b> e-edition, or by subscription on Kentnews.co.uk.|$|E
5000|$|According to Den Valdron, {{assessing}} the series in ERBzine, {{the book is}} [...] "better than Lankar of Callisto, and Carter makes a real effort to keep the <b>pages</b> <b>turning.</b> But sadly, he offers nothing new and nothing remarkable, and the plot is thin with complications literally shoehorned in." ...|$|R
5000|$|Liverpool Central Library {{currently}} has {{a copy of}} Birds of America on display in a glass case, with its <b>pages</b> <b>turned</b> weekly, [...] {{as well as being}} displayed through an interactive kiosk, allowing readers to view the contents close-up without damaging the original copy using an Evoke Ev5 Kiosk.|$|R
