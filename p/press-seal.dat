40|$|BACKGROUND: The beetle Xylotrechus arvicola (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is {{a serious}} pest of {{vineyards}} in the Iberian Peninsula. In previous work, the male beetles, but not females, were shown to produce (R) - 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone, and female beetles were attracted to this compound in a laboratory bioassay. In this study, release rates of 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone from different dispensers were measured in the laboratory and the attractiveness of these to X. arvicola adults determined in trapping tests in three traditional wine-growing regions in Spain. RESULTS: As a result of laboratory experiments, for field experiments 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone was formulated as 100 µl in a polyethylene sachet (50 mm x 50 mm x 250 µ) and ethanol was formulated as 1 ml in a polyethylene <b>press-seal</b> bag (76 mm x 57 mm x 50 µ). Field catches were similar at all three study sites. Catches in traps baited with 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone alone {{were not significantly different}} from those in unbaited control traps, but catches in traps baited with 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone and ethanol in separate sachets, with 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone and ethanol in the same sachet, or with ethanol alone, were significantly greater than those in control traps. These results confirm that the beetles are attracted to ethanol and addition of 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone does not seem to make any difference. CONCLUSIONS: Attraction of females for the male-produced compound, (R) - 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone, has been observed in laboratory but not in field experiments. Traps baited with ethanol are highly attractive to both sexes of adults of X. arvicola, and these can be used for improved monitoring of the adult emergence and for population control by mass trapping...|$|E
40|$|Characterization of {{the three}} {{different}} as- received TiAl powders, namely Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3 produced by Titanox development Ltd has been done. Predominate TiAl phase was observed in all the three compositions. The powder particles were very fine with average particle size of 12 μm, 5 μm and 10 μm respectively for Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3. Chemical analysis of the powders showed high oxygen content in all the three compositions of the powders. Bulk samples were produced from Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3 powders by hot isostatic pressing at 1200 C under a pressure of 200 Mpa for two hours. The pressurization gas used for the process was argon. The relative density of Tax 1, Tax 2 and Tax 3 HIPped samples was 96 %, 86 % and 93 %and respectively. The characterization of the HIPped samples showed that the predominate phase was γ-TiAl phase in all the three HIPped samples. A small fractions of Ti 3 Al and TiAl 3 was also observed in tax 1 and Tax 3 HIPped material. Also some of the dark Al rich phases was Al 2 O 3 phase in Tax 1 and Tax 3 HIPped samples. High oxygen content of the powder and air leaking in the can {{during the process of}} <b>press-seal</b> and welding {{of the end of the}} tube of the can prior to HIPping lead to poor consolidation of Tax 2 which eventually resulted in high porosity and formation of Ti 2 O and Al 2 O 3. Half of the Tax 2 HIPped sample was canned and heated to 1160 C and was subjected to open die hammer forging with a high strain and a total reduction of height by 66 %. The forging produced a pancake shaped sample without breaking of the sample. Tensile specimens were cut from the Tax 1 and Tax 3 HIPped sample and one from the Tax 2 forged sample using electrical discharge machine (EDM) wirecutting. Tax 1 HIPped material showed the average fracture strength of 204 MPa, 256 MPa and 197 MPa at room temperature, 800 C and 900 C respectively., Whereas Tax 3 HIPped material showed average fracture strength of 103 MPa and 234 MPa respectively at room temperature and 800 C respectively. The HIPped and the forged Tax 2 sample showed low fracture strength of 91 MPa because of the micro-cracks produced during forging...|$|E
