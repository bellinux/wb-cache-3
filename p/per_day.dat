5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g <b>per</b> <b>day</b> tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg.

40|$|PURPOSE: Recent {{advances}} in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} influenza, such as rapid testing and neuraminidase inhibitor therapy, are available, but their place in clinical practice and their cost-effectiveness have not been determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To estimate the cost-effec-tiveness of these newer interventions, we used a decision model that compared several influenza management strategies: no testing or treatment, amantadine or rimantadine treatment without testing, testing then amantadine or rimantadine treat-ment, neuraminidase inhibitor treatment without testing, or testing then neuraminidase inhibitor treatment. Antiviral ther-apy began within 48 hours in febrile patients with characteristic symptoms of influenza. We assumed that antiviral treatment did not change rates of influenza complication or mortality, and chose parameter values in the baseline analysis to bias slightly against antiviral treatment and toward testing strategies. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, testing strategies are more expensive and less effective than treatment strategies. Amanta-dine costs $ 9. 06 <b>per</b> illness <b>day</b> avoided or $ 11. 60 <b>per</b> quality-adjusted <b>day</b> gained. Compared with amantadine, zanamivir costs $ 198 <b>per</b> illness <b>day</b> avoided or $ 185 <b>per</b> quality-adjusted <b>day</b> gained, whereas oseltamivir costs $ 252 <b>per</b> illness <b>day</b> avoided or $ 235 <b>per</b> quality-adjusted <b>day</b> gained. In elderly pa-tients who require reduced dosage, rimantadine costs $ 128 <b>per</b> quality-adjusted <b>day</b> gained compared with amantadine. In younger patients, amantadine is favored if the likelihood of in-fluenza A is 67 %; otherwise, neuraminidase inhibitors are fa-vored. Testing strategies are more costly and less effective when the influenza probability is 30 %. No testing or treatment is favored if the influenza probability is 32 % and the influenza utility is 0. 77. In elderly patients, amantadine is favored over rimantadine if the utility of medication side effects is 0. 94. CONCLUSION: Antiviral treatment of influenza without rapid testing is reasonable economically in febrile patients with typical symptoms during influenza season. The choice of anti-viral agent depends on age, the likelihood of influenza A, and the willingness to pay <b>per</b> quality-adjusted <b>day</b> gained. Am...|$|R
