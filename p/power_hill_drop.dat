50|$|The castle <b>hill</b> <b>drops</b> steeply away on all sides; {{thus the}} {{fortress}} {{was very difficult}} to attack despite its relatively low situation above the valley. Vilsegg lies about 350 m lower than its neighbouring castle on the German side of the border - the Falkenstein.|$|R
50|$|Just {{before the}} <b>hill</b> <b>drops</b> away towards Benzingerode, {{the remains of}} fortifications {{belonging}} to a 10th-century fortress, the Struveburg are visible in the terrain.

50|$|The {{surrounding}} <b>hills</b> <b>drop</b> steeply to the water's edge, from Cefn Cyfarwydd and Creigiau Gleision to the east, and Pen Llithrig y Wrach to the west, and as {{a consequence}} have not been forested in the 20th century, as were the slopes of neighbouring Llyn Crafnant. Indeed there is not a tree to be seen, and the general aspect is one of bleakness. Dependent on the weather conditions, the waters often appear dark.|$|R

Singletrack which descends significantly, and in the most downward direction, is said to be following the fall line.|$|R

60|$|The 10th of August, 1852, brought {{little change}} to the dull monotony of wind, fog, and {{treeless}} coast line. Only the sea was occasionally flecked with racing sails that outstripped the old, slow-creeping trader, or was at times streaked and blurred with the trailing smoke of a steamer. There were a few strange footprints on those virgin sands, and a fresh track, that led from the beach over the rounded <b>hills,</b> <b>dropped</b> into the bosky recesses of a hidden valley beyond the coast range.|$|R

50|$|Riders {{board the}} trains in an {{enclosed}} loading station on a hillside. Leaving the station, trains make a left hand {{turn into a}} bat-infested tunnel, make a slight right turn, and climb the first lift hill. At {{the top of the}} lift hill, trains pass under a waterfall and drop to the left. This is followed by a right hand turn, after which the track crosses under the second lift <b>hill</b> and <b>drop.</b> After crossing under the second lift <b>hill</b> <b>drop,</b> the track goes through a 270 degree clockwise spiral and passes through a short tunnel. Trains emerge from the tunnel and pass through the flooded town of Tumbleweed. The train passes over a decaying trestle (where the track is slightly banked from side to side), before entering Davy Jones Mine, where it hits a trim brake. Trains then make a left hand turn and climb the second lift hill.|$|R
