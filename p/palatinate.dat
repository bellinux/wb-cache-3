5|$|In {{addition}} to this, Lancaster was given <b>palatinate</b> status {{for the county}} of Lancashire, which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown. This grant was quite exceptional in English history; only two other counties palatine existed: Durham, which was an ancient ecclesiastical <b>palatinate,</b> and Chester, which was crown property.|$|E
5|$|She {{departed}} for Düsseldorf, her husband’s capital, on 6 May 1691, accompanied by her younger brother, Gian Gastone. Johann Wilhelm surprised her at Innsbruck, where they officially married. The <b>Palatinate</b> Anna Maria Luisa arrived in was ravaged by the ongoing Nine Years' War, in which Louis XIV assaulted the <b>Palatinate</b> {{on behalf of}} his brother, Philippe of France, Duke of Orléans, occupying the city of Philippsburg in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{same year}} as Gian Gastone's marriage, the Peace of Ryswick ended the Nine Years' War: French troops withdrew from the Electoral <b>Palatinate</b> and Johann Wilhelm {{received}} the County of Megen. Following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, a document which had hitherto given rights to Calvinists, in 1685, 2,000 French Huguenots emigrated to the Electoral <b>Palatinate.</b> Johann Wilhelm, under criticism for his treatment of the Palatine Protestants from the Elector of Brandenburg introduced a Religionsdeklartion in 1705, which sanctioned religious freedom.|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{return to}} Versailles, Eliza joins Elizabeth Charlotte of the <b>Palatinate</b> at her estate before the {{invasion}} of the <b>Palatinate</b> in her name. Eliza informs William of Orange of the troop movements caused by the French invasion which frees his forces along the border of the Spanish Netherlands, a region of stalemate between France and the Dutch Republic. During her flight from the Electorate of the <b>Palatinate,</b> Eliza becomes pregnant by Louis's cryptographer, though popular knowledge suggested it was the French nobleman Etienne D'Arcachon's child. Meanwhile, William takes the free troops from the border on the Spanish Netherlands to England, precipitating the Glorious Revolution, including the expulsion of JamesII. James flees London and Daniel Waterhouse soon encounters him in a bar. Convinced that the Stuart monarchy has collapsed, Daniel returns to London and takes revenge on Jeffreys by inciting a crowd to capture him for trial and later execution. Though he plans to depart for Massachusetts, Daniel's case of bladder stones increasingly worsens during this period. The Royal Society and other family friends are very aware of this and force Daniel to get the stone removed by Robert Hooke at Bedlam.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} campaigns Rupert had visited his uncle's court in England. The <b>Palatinate</b> cause {{was a popular}} Protestant issue in England, and in 1637 a general public {{subscription}} helped fund an expedition under Charles Louis to try and regain the electorate {{as part of a}} joint French campaign. Rupert was placed in command of a <b>Palatinate</b> cavalry regiment, and his later friend Lord Craven, an admirer of Rupert's mother, assisted in raising funds and accompanied the army on the campaign. The campaign ended badly at the Battle of Vlotho (17 October 1638) during the invasion of Westphalia; Rupert escaped death, but was captured by the forces of the Imperial General Melchior von Hatzfeldt {{towards the end of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Bayern also {{enjoys a}} strong rivalry with the 1. FC Kaiserslautern, {{originating}} in parts from {{a game in}} 1973, when Bayern lost 7–4 after leading 4–1, {{but also from the}} two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga as well as the city of Kaiserslautern together with the surrounding <b>Palatinate</b> having been part of Bavaria until a plebiscite {{after the end of the}} Second World War.|$|E

5000|$|The Polish {{authorities}} {{renamed the}} eastern part of Austrian Galicia [...] "Eastern Little Poland" [...] and created administrative units (<b>Palatinates)</b> designed to include as many non-Ukrainians as possible.|$|R
5|$|Between 1803 and 1815 all German regions {{west of the}} River Rhine were French, {{organised}} in the départements Roer, Sarre, Rhin-et-Moselle, and Mont-Tonnerre. As {{a result}} of the Congress of Vienna these became part of various German states. A large part of the <b>Palatinate</b> fell to Bavaria, but having the metric system it was excepted from the Bavarian reform of weights and measures.|$|E
5|$|George {{was born}} on 28 May 1660 in Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire. He was the eldest son of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and his wife, Sophia of the <b>Palatinate.</b> Sophia was the granddaughter of King James I of England through her mother, Elizabeth of Bohemia.|$|E
5|$|Saar was a {{province}} formed from parts of Prussia and the Rhenish <b>Palatinate</b> and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite {{was to be}} held after fifteen years of League rule {{to determine whether the}} province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 percent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.|$|E
50|$|Monastic lordship was {{followed}} by Electoral <b>Palatinate’s</b> rule. Beginning in 1794, Riesweiler lay under French rule. In 1814 it {{was assigned to the}} Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna.|$|R
50|$|In the 8th century, Dienheim had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention. The village passed in Charlemagne’s {{time to the}} Fulda Abbey. Later it ended up as an Imperial pledge in Electoral <b>Palatinate’s</b> ownership.|$|R
50|$|According to the Electorate of the <b>Palatinate’s</b> oldest book of fiefs from 1401, the Counts Palatine had enfeoffed 438 vassals {{with various}} holdings, among them several {{whom they had}} granted fiefs in Dichtelbach.|$|R
5|$|Anna Maria Luisa was {{the only}} {{daughter}} of Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Marguerite Louise d'Orléans, a niece of Louis XIII of France. On her marriage to Elector Johann Wilhelm II, she became Electress of the <b>Palatinate,</b> and, by patronising musicians, she earned for the contemporary Palatine court the reputation of an important music centre. As Johann Wilhelm had syphilis the union produced no offspring, which, combined with her siblings' barrenness, meant that the Medici {{were on the verge}} of extinction.|$|E
5|$|Cossa succeeded Alexander V as John XXIII in 1410. John XXIII was {{acknowledged}} as pope by France, England, Bohemia, Prussia, Portugal, {{parts of the}} Holy Roman Empire, and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and Venice; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the Kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, and Scotland and Gregory XII was still favored by Ladislaus of Naples, Carlo I Malatesta, the princes of Bavaria, Louis III, Elector of the <b>Palatinate,</b> and parts of Germany and Poland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a more flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the <b>Palatinate</b> regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E
50|$|The town is {{characterized}} by winegrowing and tourism. By land area, {{it is one of}} the <b>Palatinate’s</b> biggest winegrowing centres. In June, the town’s biggest event is held, the Burg- und Weinfest (“Castle and Wine Festival”).|$|R

50|$|The Protestant Castle Church (Schlosskirche) - {{formerly}} Saint John’s Church (Kirche St. Johannis) - {{was built}} in the late 13th century. Its tower, with a height of 70 m, is the Further (or “Anterior”, that is, East) <b>Palatinate’s</b> third tallest churchtower.|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{troops of}} the {{competing}} Archbishops of Cologne fought {{for control of the}} Electorate; within a few months, the local feud between the two parties expanded to include supporters from the Electorate of the <b>Palatinate</b> on the Protestant side, and the Duchy of Bavaria on the Catholic side. Italian mercenaries hired with papal gold augmented the Catholic force. In 1586, the conflict expanded further, with direct involvement of the Spanish Netherlands for the Catholic side, and tertiary involvement from Henry III of France and Elizabeth I of England on the Protestant side.|$|E
5|$|Jost Hite, a German immigrant, {{purchased}} a large land grant {{in the northern}} Shenandoah Valley in 1731. Peter Stephens and a small party of German Protestants from Heidelberg, in the <b>Palatinate,</b> arrived about 1732 to buy and settle that land, including the site of what became Stephens City, named for the Stephens family. Although Hite's title to the land was challenged by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the land baron of the area, the matter was settled amicably.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} twelve months, Rupert {{was asked by}} the Duke of Modena in {{northern}} Italy to raise an army against the Papal States—having done so, and with the army stationed in the <b>Palatinate,</b> the enterprise collapsed, with the Duke requesting that Rupert invade Spanish held Milan instead. Rupert moved on, having placed his brother Charles Louis in some diplomatic difficulties with Spain. Rupert travelled onwards, continuing to attempt to convince Ferdinand to back Charles II's efforts to regain his throne.|$|E
5000|$|Bavaria {{retained}} the <b>Palatinate's</b> {{vote in the}} Imperial Council of Electors (which elected the Holy Roman Emperor), which it had been granted by the ban on the Elector Palatine Frederick V in 1623. The Prince Palatine, Frederick's son, was given a new, eighth electoral vote.|$|R
50|$|The {{church in}} Albsheim {{was built in}} Romanesque times; in 1520 and 1794 it {{underwent}} conversions. Here is found the <b>Palatinate’s</b> oldest organ that is still played.

The rest practised other faiths or none.|$|R
5|$|Rupert's family {{continued}} {{their attempts to}} regain the <b>Palatinate</b> during their time in The Hague. Money was short, with the family relying upon a relatively small pension from The Hague, the proceeds from family investments in Dutch raids on Spanish shipping, and revenue from pawned family jewellery. Frederick set about convincing an alliance of nations—including England, France and Sweden—to support his attempts to regain the <b>Palatinate</b> and Bohemia. By the early 1630s Frederick had built {{a close relationship with}} the Swedish King Gustavus, the dominant Protestant leader in Germany. In 1632, however, the two men disagreed over Gustavus' insistence that Frederick provide equal rights to his Lutheran and Calvinist subjects after regaining his lands; Frederick refused and started to return to The Hague. He died of a fever along the way and was buried in an unmarked grave. Rupert had lost his father at the age of 13, and Gustavus' death at the battle of Lützen in the same month deprived the family of a critical Protestant ally. With Frederick gone, King Charles proposed that the family move to England; Rupert's mother declined, but asked that Charles extend his protection to her remaining children instead.|$|E
5|$|The mitre may {{be shown}} {{in all sorts of}} colours. It may be {{represented}} either gold or jewelled, the former more common in English heraldry. A form of mitre with coronet is proper to the Bishop of Durham because of his role as Prince-Bishop of the <b>palatinate</b> of Durham. For similar reasons the Bishop of Durham and some other bishops display a sword behind the shield, pointed downward to signify a former civil jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The story {{takes place}} in the world of Eora, in a region placed in the {{southern}} hemisphere called the Eastern Reach, an area roughly the size of Spain. The Eastern Reach contains several nations, including the Free <b>Palatinate</b> of Dyrwood, a former colony of the mighty Aedyr Empire that won its independence through a revolutionary war; the Vailian Republics, a confederation of sovereign city-states; and the Penitential Regency of Readceras, a quasi-theocratic state ruled by priests of the god Eothas.|$|E
50|$|Breitenbach is an Ortsgemeinde - a {{municipality}} {{belonging to}} a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality - in the Kusel district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

50|$|These centres {{had already}} had a bond lasting from the Middle Ages to the early 19th century when {{they were all in}} the Electorate of the <b>Palatinate’s</b> Aicher Cent (tithing area). Only Litzelbach belonged to the Abtsteinach tithing area in the Archbishopric of Mainz. The Cent - an {{administrative}} division similar to a community today - bore the name Aicher or Hammelbacher Cent. The name Aicher Cent it got from the court’s location, which lay where a Gefehlte Aiche - an oak with many trunks - stood. Hammelbach’s first documentary mention goes back to the year 795, while the other constituent communities had theirs about 1300. The Electorate of the <b>Palatinate’s</b> and Mainz’s overlordship in the area lasted until 1802, when under the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss they all became part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse.|$|R
