2500|$|Kevin Bankston, {{senior staff}} {{attorney}} specializing in privacy law with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (an international digital rights advocacy and legal organization), said: [...] "I've {{never heard of}} anything this egregious. Nobody would have imagined that schools would <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> students private homes, and even bedrooms, without any kind of justification. [...] He continued: [...] "This is utterly shocking, and a blatant violation of [...] constitutional rights. The school district would have no more right to [...] than to install secret listening devices in the textbooks that they issued students." [...] He suggested that students tape over the lens of their laptop's camera. [...] Parry Aftab, an internet privacy lawyer {{and executive director of}} WiredSafety.org, said the district committed a clear violation of several laws including the Fourth Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|More {{renovation}} – and a {{round of}} controversy – came after the 1938 season when Mack sought to install light towers for night play, which local residents were against. They objected in general to the light, noise and traffic that night games would bring to the neighborhood, and objected specifically to the danger of home run balls hitting them as they sat on their porches and {{to the ability of}} fans in the upper decks to <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> their bedrooms at night. The matter went to court, and Mack hired a young Philadelphia lawyer to plead his case. The presentation of young Richardson Dilworth, future mayor of the city, carried the day: the A's won the case and the light towers went up in time for the 1939 season. The first night game in the AL was at Shibe Park on May 16, 1939: the Indians beat the A's, 8–3.|$|E

2500|$|Belknap died {{suddenly}} from a massive {{heart attack in}} Washington, D.C. on Sunday October 12, 1890. The New York Times stated that his death occurred on Sunday between 1:00 A.M and 9:00 A.M., and that he died alone at his residence in the Evans building on New York Avenue. Prior to his death, Belknap had played cards with his friends on Saturday night, then retired upstairs for the evening. Belknap's wife, Amanda, was in New York City at the time. At 8:30 A.M. on Monday morning, Belknap's business associate, John W. Cameron, picked up Belknap's mail {{on the first floor}} of Belknap's home, where he maintained his law office, and proceeded to the second floor, where Belknap lived. Cameron and a maid found that all the rooms had been locked. [...] A janitor was summoned to open the doors, and a step ladder was used to <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> Belknap's bedroom. Belknap had placed his hat and coat on a chair and his lifeless body was found on his bed. His left arm had been raised toward his head with his left hand tightly clenched. The bed clothes were disheveled and he appeared to have struggled for breath. The physician who initially examined the body stated that he had died of apoplexy; however, an autopsy by the coroner revealed that Belknap suffered from heart disease. The War Department was notified and received with [...] "genuine sorrow" [...] the news of Belknap's death, since Belknap had been a popular Secretary of War.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain was {{critically}} acclaimed. The UK Official PlayStation Magazine reviewer Tim Clark wrote, [...] "I'm convinced it's {{one of the}} freshest, most exciting, {{and even}} important games on PS3 so far." [...] Clark praised the effective controls of the game, {{as well as the}} pacing of the story, which the reviewer described as key, and perfectly designed to create an [...] "exhausting, exhilarating, and, crucially, involving" [...] experience. He concluded by saying that, [...] "Certainly there's nothing quite like it on PS3, or indeed any other system. Put gaming conventions aside, go in with no expectations other than this is something new and massively good-looking, and you'll be rewarded with a unique experience that lurches between genius and madness, manages to be genuinely emotional, and that you'll be bursting to talk about with your friends." [...] GamesMaster complimented Heavy Rain for being [...] "incredibly original and compelling", as [...] "the atmosphere is incredible – full of driving rain (which becomes central to the plot), fizzing neon lights, dark apartments and warehouses. It's a dark noir game, not a bright adventure." [...] The game was given a GamesMaster Gold Award. IGN's Chris Roper praised the game's [...] "fantastic story that's {{one of the best in}} gaming." [...] However, he pointed out that the game's beginning is very slow, and might turn off some players. GameZone's Michael Lafferty wrote, [...] "There are some flaws, but taken as a package, Heavy Rain is a remarkable achievement in gaming that creates an interactive experience that goes beyond the pages of a good novel or film noir. This is a game that needs to be experienced." [...] Winda Benedetti wrote about the maturity of Heavy Rain as well as Remedy Entertainment's psychological action thriller Alan Wake for MSNBC, praising both titles for being [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] as well as having [...] "said goodbye to the tired alien invasions and over-the-top fantasy stories so often found in video games. Instead, they <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the dark reaches of the very real human heart to deliver stories that are thrilling, chilling and utterly absorbing." ...|$|E
