5|$|Normally shy or {{indifferent}} {{to the presence of}} divers, the Caribbean reef shark has been known to become aggressive in the presence of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous.</b> As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 27 attacks attributable to this species, 4 of them unprovoked, and none fatal.|$|E

As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E

Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear.

5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{qualified}} {{nature of}} this comment, the operation Beatty had in mind was both important and <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous.</b> On 6 February 1918, Battleship Division Nine stood out of Scapa Flow to guard the high value Scandinavian Convoy to and from Norway. Twice in the previous year, this convoy—with its essential cargos of iron ore, nitrates, and other chemicals—had been raided by German cruisers and destroyers, {{with the loss of}} 15 allied freighters. To avoid a repeat of these attacks, the British had taken to escorting the convoys with dreadnought squadrons. Still, the possibility existed that the Germans would send out their entire fleet to cut off and annihilate the overmatched battleship squadron, with severe strategic effect.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> gases {{and would not be}} able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the silky shark {{is regarded as}} <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The silky shark tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E

A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive and bold, {{especially}} {{in the presence of}} food, the silvertip shark is regarded as <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> to humans. Often, several Silvertip sharks will rush up from deep water to inspect divers when they first enter the water, which can be a very intimidating experience, as the sharks may approach quite close. This species has also been known to circle or pursue divers. In one experiment involving bait, a large silvertip shark tore the leg off a dummy dressed in SCUBA gear, demonstrating that this species is capable of inflicting lethal injuries. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed four provoked attacks attributable to this species, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|More {{active at}} night {{than during the}} day when it is usually buried in sediment, the bluntnose {{stingray}} is a predator of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished initially by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by their mother. Females give birth to 1–6 pups every May after a gestation period of 11–12 months, most of which consists of a period of arrested embryonic development. The venomous tail spine of the bluntnose stingray is <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> to unwary beachgoers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is widely distributed, common, and minimally threatened by commercial fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E
5|$|The book {{argues that}} artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, {{as a method}} of {{deflecting}} debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{well-known}} cases are those of Candace Newmaker in 2001 and the Gravelles in 2003 through 2005. Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less <b>potentially</b> <b>dangerous</b> to children. This change may have been hastened by {{the publication of a}} Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy, although these practices continue. In April 2007, ATTACh, an organisation originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting.|$|E
