5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> the warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it {{was connected to the}} Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Like other primates, lemurs groom {{socially}} (allogroom) to ease {{tensions and}} solidify relationships. They groom in greeting, when waking up, when settling in for sleep, {{between mother and}} infant, in juvenile relations, and for sexual advances. Unlike anthropoid primates, who part the fur with the hands and <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> particles with the fingers or mouth, lemurs groom with their tongue and scraping with their toothcomb. Despite the differences in technique, lemurs groom with the same frequency and {{for the same reasons}} as anthropoids.|$|E

40|$|In "Individuals", Peter Strawson {{talks about}} identifying, discriminating and <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> {{particular}} objects, regarding discriminating and <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> as ways of identifying. I object that, strictly speaking, identification means to say {{of two things}} {{that they are the}} same. In contrast, discriminating an object from all others can be done by just ascribing some predicate to it that does not apply to the others. <b>Picking</b> <b>out</b> an object does not even seem to require to distinguish it from all others. The object picked is distinct in that it is the picked one, {{but it is not clear}} - even in the context of sensorily <b>picking</b> <b>out</b> - that I have to be aware of this in order to do the picking...|$|R
5|$|Denning met {{his future}} wife Mary Harvey on 25 October 1914 aged fifteen at his confirmation; she was the {{daughter}} of the Vicar of Whitchurch. Denning attempted to court her for many years, but for a long time his love was unrequited, with Mary wanting them to be only friends. After a dance at Beaulieu on 18 January 1930 she finally admitted her love for him, and he returned to Hampshire with her to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> an engagement ring. Barely six months away from the set date for their wedding Mary was diagnosed with tuberculosis, but she recovered and the couple were married on 28 December 1932, with the wedding officiated by Cecil Henry Boutflower, Bishop of Southampton.|$|E
5|$|Eva {{finds herself}} growing fonder of Albert {{and they have}} lunch with his teenage {{daughter}}, Tess, who, like Eva's daughter Ellen, is {{graduating from high school}} and moving away to attend college. A few days later, Eva goes to her massage appointment with Marianne and realizes that Albert is Marianne's ex-husband after Marianne tells a story about how he manages to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> onions when scooping salsa — the same story Albert had told Eva, but about guacamole. Tess then arrives at the house and Eva's suspicions are confirmed. Marianne tries to introduce Eva to Tess, but Eva hides behind a tree to avoid the meeting. Eva continues seeing Albert, keeping her friendship with Marianne a secret; likewise, she does not tell Marianne that she is seeing him.|$|E
5|$|Hayward credits Besson with {{showing the}} {{collaboration}} between the Burgundians and the English more accurately than previous filmmakers. Many lines during scenes of Joan's trial are taken verbatim from Joan's real trial transcript. Joan is shown receiving both wounds she was given in real life (an arrow above the breast and later an arrow to the leg), and the film includes some of the 15th-century accounts associated with Joan, such as being able to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> Charles VII from {{among a group of}} his courtiers at Chinon. The examining of Joan's virginity was a real test Joan had to complete to prove her merit.|$|E

5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{said that}} the two {{indicators}} assume that [...] "smart" [...] money is traded on quiet days (low volume) and that the crowd trades on very active days. Therefore, the negative volume index <b>picks</b> <b>out</b> days when the volume is lower than on the previous day, and the positive index <b>picks</b> <b>out</b> days with a higher volume.|$|R
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} exert more pressure, {{although}} all their play {{was in front}} of the Milan penalty area, while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball. In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch. Milan had an attack minutes later, but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball. Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan's second goal. With Mascherano substituted, Kaká had the space to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> a pass to Inzaghi, who took the ball {{to the side of the}} Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2–0 to Milan. Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant's corner. However, they were unable to find a second goal and the referee blew for full-time with the score 2–1 to Milan.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fairly}} cagey first 21 minutes, {{the first major}} {{incident}} of the game occurred when Paul Scholes and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid-air, resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose. The first goal of the game came five minutes later, when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw-in on the right flank gave Brown time to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who directed his header past Petr Čech. Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba. United's Rio Ferdinand, under pressure from Michael Ballack, was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one-handed save to deny Chelsea a goal. United {{spent the rest of}} the first half pressing for a second goal, and had two good opportunities to extend their lead, but were denied by a double-save from Čech. Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez, only for Čech to deny him. Chelsea's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side's lead, but Čech was again equal to the task with another save.|$|E
