5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E
5|$|The A Station {{generated}} electricity {{using three}} turbo alternators; two 69 megawatt (MW) Metropolitan-Vickers British Thomson-Houston sets, and one 105MW Metropolitan-Vickers set, totalling 243MW. At {{the time of}} its commissioning, the 105MW generating set was the largest in Europe. The B Station also had three turbo alternators, all made by Metropolitan-Vickers. This consisted of two units which used 16MW high-pressure units exhausting to a 78MW and associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving these units a total rating of 100MW. The third unit consisted of a 66MW machine associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving the unit a rating of 72MW. Combined, these gave the B station a generating capacity of 260MW, making the site's generating capacity 503MW. All of the station's boilers were made by Babcock & Wilcox, fuelled by <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> from pulverisers also built by Babcock & Wilcox. There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station. The B station's boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time. The B station also had the highest thermal efficiency of any power station in the country for the first twelve years of its operation.|$|E

40|$|Large-scale mills {{are used}} to <b>pulverise</b> <b>coal</b> for {{combustion}} in heat and steam raising plants in many manufacturing and ore processing industries, and in particular in power generating utilities. The cost of mill maintenance attributable to wear of pulverising elements typically ranges from 0. 1 to 1. 0 A/t of <b>coal</b> <b>pulverised,</b> depending {{on the characteristics of}} the mill, the properties of the wearing alloys, and the properties of the coal. Abrasiveness of coal is usually assessed by any of a number of empirical indices, none of which have been related to wear in large-scale mills in any detail. The selection or evaluation of alloy materials for pulverising elements is based on field experience, or on measurement of certain properties in the laboratory. This research has been undertaken to establish a simulative test for wear in <b>coal</b> <b>pulverising</b> mills, and to gain a more fundamental understanding of the mechanistic processes associated with abrasive wear interactions in comminution systems...|$|R

25|$|Initially, {{such studies}} {{were limited to}} simple flow {{configurations}} as pointed out by Hoomans, however, Chu and Yu demonstrated that the method {{could be applied to}} a complex flow configuration consisting of a fluidized bed, conveyor belt and a cyclone. Similarly, Zhou et al. applied the CCDM approach to the complex geometry of fuel-rich/lean burner for <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> combustion in a plant and Chu et al. modelled the complex flow of air, water, coal and magnetite particles of different sizes in a dense medium cyclone (DMC).|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{throughout}} 1922 a {{study was}} conducted regarding the installation of boilers number 7 and 9, {{and the possibility of}} these operating with <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal,</b> which ended up proving unsuccessful, since in boiler number 6 the tests carried out to implement this process produced unsatisfactory results. Nonetheless, <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> would still be used in boiler number 11.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, C16 was {{modified}} with Fuller-Lehigh equipment {{to run on}} <b>Pulverised</b> Brown <b>Coal</b> (PBC), a potentially abundant fuel in Victoria given the large brown coal reserves in the Latrobe Valley.

25|$|In 1949, the VR {{was faced}} with dwindling {{supplies}} of black coal due to industrial action on NSW coalfields and Victorian black coal reserves becoming exhausted. Large numbers of locomotives were converted to fuel oil operation, but as a further step X32 was experimentally fitted with German 'Stug' (Studiengesellschaft) equipment in a specially modified tender for the burning of <b>Pulverised</b> Brown <b>Coal</b> (PBC), a fuel in potentially abundant supply in Victoria.|$|R
50|$|The final wagons {{were built}} in 1923, {{numbered}} O334 through O388. Of those, 334-338 and 345 were built to a modified design to transport <b>pulverised</b> brown <b>coal</b> for locomotive trials; a single locomotive, C16, was modified to burn PBC, and the tender was fitted with a pressurised tank for storage. That tender was later transferred to engines DD1022 and A2800 to give data on consumption and efficiency with different types of work.|$|R

50|$|It {{was evident}} that Stone's oil shale plant did not work. The cement plant was changed from oil firing to <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> firing. The first cement was {{produced}} in 1926 and supplied to Hume Pipe Company of Melbourne.|$|E

25|$|After the 1951-52 {{financial}} year, the Victorian Railways {{were almost}} £6 million pounds in deficit. Freight rates and passenger fares were increased, but the VR {{still did not}} expect to make ends meet. The program of works for 1952-53 was intended to be £12.5 million, and was intended to cover the duplication of the Alamein line between Camberwell and Ashburton, track amplification between Flinders Street and South Yarra, a new Richmond station, importation of 1500 precut houses from England for railway staff, and the purchase of equipment for the use of <b>pulverised</b> brown <b>coal</b> in steam locomotives.|$|R

5000|$|Pulverised {{fuel ash}} (PFA), is a {{by-product}} of <b>pulverised</b> fuel (typically <b>coal)</b> fired power stations. The fuel is pulverised into a fine powder, mixed with heated air and burned.

Foxleigh currently produces a low volatile <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> injection (PCI) coal product for use in steelmaking applications around the world. Foxleigh coal is taken from the Middlemount, Tralee, Roper and Pisces seams from within the Rangal coal measures in the southern Bowen Basin. Annual Production: Foxleigh produces approximately 2.5 million tonnes per annum of <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> injection (PCI) coal for the steelmaking industry. The mine’s production capacity is 3.3 million tonnes per annum of product coal.

50|$|Government {{has decided}} to scrap the coal fired power {{stations}} which are more than 25 years old to reduce the pollution. Instead of scrapping old <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> fired units, NTPC should replace coal with torrefied crops waste/biomass as fuel in these units (nearly 11,000 MW) to make them profitable and productive assets without contributing to pollution.|$|E

5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by <b>pulverised</b> {{bituminous}} <b>coal.</b> Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|R
50|$|After {{dealing with}} coal {{shortages}} through the World War II era, the Victorian Railways reactivated earlier experiments with <b>Pulverised</b> Brown <b>Coal.</b> Locomotives X32 and R707 were modified {{to take the}} fuel, which was prepared at special plants and railed to depots as required in a small fleet of seven CK-class wagons. These vehicles {{were based on a}} standard four-wheel underframe, with two pressurised drums fitted for air discharge directly into the engine tenders. The first two were built in 1949, and a further five, CK3-CK7, entered service in 1952. At the time it was thought that a further fifteen X Class would be built or converted to run with PBC, justifying the extra expense, but the early diesel locomotives were more economic to operate on grounds of higher utilisation.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the Soviet Union looked for {{new methods of}} using coal sludge for power generation. Coal-water slurry fuel was made in a Ball mill which <b>pulverised</b> the <b>coal</b> or coal sludge. This was done near a coal mine in Belovo, Siberia. The coal-water slurry fuel was transported through a {{pipeline}} to Novosibirskaya TEC-5, Novosibirsk, a distance of 262 km. The pipeline had three intermediate pumping stations. The Belovo Novosibirsk project used coal-water slurry fuel in steam boilers {{at a rate of}} 1340 tonnes per hour. There was a further project at Belovo Novosibirsk between 1989 and 1993 and development of coal-water slurry fuel technology for district heating stations and power stations. In 2004, a coal water slurry fuel production plant was opened at Enskiy village, Murmansk.|$|R
50|$|The later 'B' Station, a {{modified}} {{product of the}} Electricity Commission of New South Wales, had three 60 MW Parsons units. Steam was supplied by 3 Babcock & Wilcox boilers that burnt <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal.</b> Steam pressure was 950PSI and steam temperature was 950 deg F. It was unit type plant and each boiler supplied 550,000 lb/h of steam to one turbine only.|$|E
50|$|Huge {{quantity}} of imported coal {{is being used}} in pulverised coal-fired power stations. Raw biomass is not suitable {{for use in the}} <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to caking problem. However 100% biomass can be fired after Torrefaction in the <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> mills for replacing imported coal. Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal-fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source. Cofiring dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing caking problem. North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems. As traditional use of biomass is being replaced by LPG at faster pace, biomass burning in agriculture fields would become major source for causing higher level air pollution.|$|E
50|$|In early designs {{the coal}} {{would still be}} shovelled by the fireman into a hopper which would feed into a crusher and then a screw or bucket {{elevator}} would lift the <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> to a position where it could be mechanically scattered across the burning coals of the furnace by a spreader.

50|$|A crash at Callington SA in 1929 claimed three E type carriages, 5AE, 9BE and 2D. The {{surviving}} {{parts from}} those cars were recycled {{in the construction}} of the shared V&SAR Dynamometer car, for the purpose of evaluating locomotive performance. This had previously been achieved with the Dynagraph car, but that did not have the capacity or strength to handle the power output from more modern locomotives. The new car entered service in 1932 for use on both the Victorian and South Australian Railways, and was initially used to test rolling resistance differences between four-wheeled wagons against bogie wagons. Following that, the car was used to test the strength of the S Class locomotives, particularly with loaded freight trains between Wallan and Seymour, and the efficiency of <b>Pulverised</b> Brown <b>Coal</b> (PBC) with engines X32 and later R707. It was also used in tests comparing the performance of Tait and Harris electric trains. Over the life of the vehicle, nearly 1,000 tests were performed.|$|R

Based on the observed trends, in the present paper a reaction mechanism is proposed for the glass phase which accounts for the oxide composition of the fly ash (and that is applicable to slags as well). Finally, using the reaction product, the following thermodynamic properties of the studied fly ashes are derived: the free energy, enthalpy and entropy of reaction.
