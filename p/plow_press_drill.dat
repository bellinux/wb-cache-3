40|$|Since {{interest}} in winter wheat growing has revived in some sections of Iowa considerable merit has been claimed for the <b>press</b> <b>drill</b> over other grain drills and other methods of seeding. The Hoosier <b>Press</b> <b>Drill</b> Co., of Richmond, Ind., furnished the Iowa Experiment Station a drill free of charge, and we deemed it {{of interest to}} test its value for sowing winter wheat. Accordingly, on October 2, 1893, {{a small piece of}} ground, that had grown a crop of oats and vetches, was plowed to a depth of five inches and disced and harrowed thoroughly, and one-half of the piece sown with Turkish Red winter wheat with the Hoosier <b>press</b> <b>drill,</b> and the remainder with the same variety of wheat, at the same rate per acre, with a common grain drill. The principal point of difference in these machines is that the <b>press</b> <b>drill</b> has runners like a corn planter, that may be forced down to a depth of four or five inches, 2 ̆ 7 and each runner is followed by a narrow wheel that firms the earth over the grain and leaves the soil between the rows standing up in ridges, by reason of which snow falling upon the field during winter lodges first in these tracks and protects the plants. The common drill also leaves the ground ridged, but does not press the soil over the seed, and the ridges are less marked. The soil of both plats was uniform, and all conditions were the same except the method of seeding. The depth of seeding was about four inches on each plat. The crop came on well, both plats coming up about the same time and going through the winter in similar condition. But little if any difference was noticed {{in the early stages of}} growth. Some difference was noticeable through May and June, but it was not until the wheat was in shock that any marked contrast was apparent. Then it was clear that the <b>press</b> <b>drill</b> plat had the heavier crop, though the stand was good on each. Both pieces ripened at the same time, and were harvested July 19 th and handled alike. When threshed the <b>press</b> <b>drill</b> plat, containing 85 square rods, gave 25 bushels and 30 pounds of wheat that tested 61 1 / 2 pounds to the bushel; and the common drill plat of the same area gave 16 bushels that made the same test. The first was at the rate of 48 bushels per acre and the second 30 bushels, a difference of 18 bushels per acre in favor of the <b>press</b> <b>drill.</b> In hauling the grain a mile and a half to the threshing machine one load from the <b>press</b> <b>drill</b> plat fell off and in the extra handling some grain shattered out, but not enough to make any material difference, though whatever it was came from the heavier yield. The test in its details and execution was satisfactorily conducted, and the comparison a fair one so far as could be determined by a single trial, and the result is given as such for what immediate service it may be to those interested; though a comparison of this kind needs to be repeated several times, and under varying conditions, in order to safely establish conclusions...|$|R

50|$|Recent {{improvements}} to drills allow seed-drilling without prior tilling. This means that soils subject to erosion or moisture loss are protected until the seed germinates and grows {{enough to keep}} the soil in place. This also helps prevent soil loss by avoiding erosion after tilling. The development of the <b>press</b> <b>drill</b> was one of the major innovations in pre-1900 farming technology.|$|R

50|$|A geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{in which}} power {{transmission}} from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head. No friction elements (e.g., belts) {{of any kind}} are used, which assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements. Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.|$|R
50|$|For most drill presses—especially those {{meant for}} {{woodworking}} or home use—speed change {{is achieved by}} manually moving a belt across a stepped pulley arrangement. Some <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> add a third stepped pulley {{to increase the number}} of available speeds. Modern <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system. Medium-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> such as those used in machine shop (tool room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt. This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running. Heavy-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.|$|R
5000|$|In 1869, John Stoddard {{then began}} the {{manufacture}} of agricultural implements in partnership with John Dodds, under the firm name of John Dodds & Company. The Farmers Friend Manufacturing Company was incorporated as a stock company in 1871 as producers of high class agricultural implements constituting a complete line of planting, harvesting and tilling machinery under the Farmers Friend, Excelsior, Monarch brands. This was succeeded by J. W. Stoddard & Company and in turn, in 1884, was incorporated as the Stoddard Manufacturing Company, of which Stoddard was the president and principal stockholder. Their distinctive brand of [...] "Tiger" [...] was a mark of excellence in agricultural machinery the world over. The chief implements made by the Stoddard Manufacturing Company were mowers, hay rakes, <b>press</b> <b>drills,</b> and disc harrows. The best known of these were the famous Tiger Rake, Tiger Harrow, and Havana <b>Press</b> <b>Drill.</b> More than 200,000 of the Tiger Rake had been sold by 1890. In the mid-1890s, they diversified {{to take advantage of}} the bicycle craze then sweeping the United States, manufacturing the Tiger (and Tigress), Cygnet, and Tempest lines of bikes until 1898.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{machine tool}} spindles, and many power tool spindles, have a taper {{as their primary}} method of {{attachment}} for tools. Even on many <b>drill</b> <b>presses,</b> handheld <b>drills,</b> and lathes, which have chucks (such as a drill chuck or collet chuck), the chuck is attached by a taper. On <b>drills,</b> <b>drill</b> <b>presses,</b> and milling machines, the male member is the tool shank or toolholder shank, and the female socket is integral with the spindle. On lathes, the male may belong to the tool or to the spindle; spindle noses may have male tapers, female tapers, or both.|$|R

50|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> (also {{known as}} a {{pedestal}} drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they <b>drill.</b> A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> has an 8 in throat distance.|$|R
50|$|Geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are {{commonly}} found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or {{in the event of}} excessive travel. Some gear-head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger gear head <b>drill</b> <b>presses.</b> A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.|$|R
40|$|Construction workers {{frequently}} perform overhead drilling into concrete, {{which is}} associated with a high frequency of pain and disability, presumably due to high shoulder loads and awkward neck postures. My thesis involved the design and evaluation of an Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press,</b> an ergonomic intervention device for overhead drilling. In Study 1, I designed a new Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> based on feedback from focus groups. I then conducted field tests to evaluate the intervention on construction sites and compare it to conventional overhead drilling. Results showed reduced fatigue, improved usability, and improved neck posture with the intervention. Elevated shoulder postures and drilling speed were not improved and reflected areas where the Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> could be refined. In Study 2, I conducted biomechanical modelling to compare shoulder torques during drilling and to identify the optimal placement for the crank on an Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> in order to minimize shoulder torque...|$|R

50|$|A third type also exists, {{a lighter}} machine, called a mill-drill, {{which is a}} close {{relative}} of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but equipped with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{to deal with the}} lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation. A mill drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed vertical, where a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> where a larger vertical or knee mill has a vertically fixed milling head, and changes the X-Y table elevation. As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.|$|R

5000|$|A {{radial arm}} <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{is a large}} geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial arm drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The Radial Arm Drill pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|R
