It is also highly important for the heritage value of the <b>peat</b> <b>grassland</b> landscape. The availability of suitable land is a key issue, particularly in relation to soil subsidence and attempts to reduce this through reducing the level of drainage. Agriculture requires substantial drainage. Reasonably dry soil is important for access to the land (e.g. heavy machines), {{as well as for the}} cows and grass. Agriculture also effects soil quality, water quality and biodiversity.|$|E
40|$|Results were {{discussed}} of experiments on watertable with permanent grassland and arable crops on river clay and on <b>peat</b> soil (<b>grassland</b> only). It is concluded that plant growth {{is affected by}} watertable in two ways: through the water supply and through the nitrogen supply. These factors derive from the water and air contents of the soil, which depend on watertable. A high moisture content promotes water supply of the plant but limits air content, thus promoting the bacterial denitrification of mineral nitrogen in the soil. Grassland may respond to watertable in different ways. During drought water supply may be the determining factor and the highest gross yield will occur with high watertable. But with abundant rainfall the highest yields will occur with a low watertable since nitrogen supply is then the determining factor. Through changeable weather an optimum watertable could only be found during brief periods. In the long run the best results (also through risk of poaching) for clay grassland can be expected with a low watertable (100 cm or more) and with surface irrigation during drought...|$|R

40|$|Large {{uncertainties}} {{persist in}} estimates of soil-atmosphere exchange of important trace gases. One {{significant source of}} uncertainty is the combined effect of wind and pressure on these fluxes. Wind and pressure effects are mediated by surface topography: few surfaces are uniform and over scales of tenths of a meter to tens of meters, air pressure and wind speed at the ground surface may be very variable. In this paper we consider how such spatial variability in air pressure and wind speed affects fluxes of trace gases. We used a novel nested wind tunnel design, comprising a toroidial wind tunnel in which wind speed and pressure may be controlled, set within a larger, linear wind tunnel. The effects of both wind speed and pressure differentials on fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 within three different ecosystems (forest, <b>grassland,</b> <b>peat</b> bog) were quantified. We find that trace gas fluxes are positively correlated with both wind speed and pressure differential near the surface boundary. We argue that wind speed is the better proxy for trace gas fluxes because of its stronger correlation and because wind speed is more easily measured and wind speed measurement methodology more easily standardized. Trace gas fluxes, whether into {{or out of the}} soil, increase with wind speed within the toroidal tunnel (+ 55 % flux per m s- 125), while faster, localized surface winds that are external to the toroidal wind tunnel reduce trace gas fluxes (- 13 % flux per m s- 126). These results are consistent for both trace gases over all ecosystem soil types studied. Our findings support the need for a revised conceptualization of soil-atmosphere gas exchange. We propose a conceptual model of the soil profile that has a 'mixed layer', with fluxes controlled by wind speed, wind duration, porosity, water table, and gas production and consumption...|$|R

Both the fen soil isolates and the clean room strain revealed versatile physiological capacities in N-transformation processes by performing heterotrophic nitrification, respiratory ammonification and denitrification activity. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the investigated isolates belonged to the genus Paenibacillus. Sequence similarities lower than 97 % in comparison to established species indicated a separate species position. Except for the peptidoglycan type (A 4 alpha L-Lys–D-Asp), chemotaxonomic features of the isolates matched the genus description, but differences in several physiological characteristics separated them from related species and supported their novel species status. Despite a high 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the clean room isolate ES_MS 17 ^T and the representative fen soil isolate N 3 / 975 ^T, DNA–DNA hybridization studies revealed genetic differences at the species level.

40|$|The {{release of}} {{dissolved}} organic matter (DOM) from agricultural land can have a large impact on the transport of N and phosphorus (P) to surface waters leading to water quality impairment. The speciation of DOM in agricultural grassland soils has received little attention thus far. Quantification of DOM speciation can improve our knowledge of its fate in these soils. Furthermore, the influence of temperature on DOM concentration and composition is still ambiguous. In this study, we determined the concentration and composition of water-extractable organic carbon (EOC), water-extractable organic N (EON), and water-extractable organic P (EOP) before and after incubation of sand, <b>peat,</b> and clay <b>grassland</b> soils at different temperatures (1. 5 °C, 10 °C, and 20 °C) for 35 days. Extracted organic compounds were fractioned in three operationally defined fractions: humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and hydrophilic (Hy) compounds using a recently developed batch fractionation method. Both EON and EOP formed a major fraction of total N and P. Concentrations of EOC, EON, and EOP were different among the sand, peat, and clay soils, but their speciation was remarkably similar. The EOC and EON were mainly present in the hydrophobic form (HA and FA), whereas EOP was mainly present in the Hy fraction. An increase in temperature generally resulted in a decrease of the total EOC, EON, and EOP concentrations, whereas the speciation remained constant. The effect of temperature on the dynamics of DOM is not necessarily related to net changes in pool size of the HA, FA, and Hy fractions. Insight into the influence of incubation temperature on the dynamics of EOC, EON, and EOP can only be achieved when the processes responsible for the consumption {{and the production of}} dissolved organic nutrients are quantifie...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Farklı ekosistemlerin karbon bütçelerini belirlemek küresel karbon döngüsünü anlayabilmek açısından oldukça önemli bir konudur. Özellikle küresel ısınmanın en büyük sebebinin insan kaynaklı sera gazlarının (karbondioksit ve metan başta olmak üzere) atmosferik konsantrasyonlarının artışı olduğu düşünülünce, bu konuda yapılan bilimsel araştırmaların artış göstermesi yadsınamaz. FLUXNET (Akı Ağı) projesi kapsamında dünya üzerindeki farklı ekosistemlerin karbon bütçesini belirleyebilmek için altı kıtada karbondioksit akıları ölçülmektedir. Akı Ağında ölçüm alanları başta ormanlar olmak üzere, tarım alanları ve çayırlardır. Türkiye ise, bu akı ağı projesine hala dahil değildir. FAO’ya göre Avrupa’nın 1 / 3 ’ünü tarım alanları oluşturmaktadır. Bu sebeple toplam karbon döngüsündeki etkileri küçük de olsa tarım alanları üzerinde yapılan ölçümler, farklı tarım ürünleri ekilmesinin ve farklı tarımsal faaliyetler yürütülmesinin karbon bütçesi üzerindeki etkilerini belirleyebilmek için oldukça gereklidir. Bu ölçümlerin uzun dönemler devam ettirilmesi elde edilecek sonuçların güvenilirliği açısından oldukça önemli bir husustur. Bu çalışmada, Kırklareli’nde bulunan Atatürk Toprak Su ve Tarımsal Meteoroloji Araştırma İstasyonu Müdürlüğü’ne ait deneme alanında eddy kovaryans ölçüm sistemi kurularak 2009 - 2010 ve 2010 - 2011 gelişme dönemleri için buğday bitkisinin karbondioksit akıları ölçülmüştür. Ölçülen verilere frekans tepki düzeltmeleri, Webb-Pearman-Leuning düzeltmesi ve koordinat düzeltmesi yapılmıştır. Yapılan düzeltmelerden sonra elde edilen verilerden yağış, rüzgar yönü, yetersiz türbülans sebebiyle hatalı kabul edilen veriler atılmış ve eksik veriler uluslararası çalışmalarda kabul görmüş tamamlama yöntemleriyle doldurulmuştur. Bu ölçüm sonuçlarından bitkinin ne kadar karbonu atmosferden aldığını ve ne kadarını atmosfere tekrar geri verdiğini gösteren NEE (Net Ekosistem Değişimi), GPP (Brüt Fotosentez) ve Reco (Ekosistem Solunumu) değerleri hesaplanmıştır. Yapılan çalışma sonucunda kışlık buğdayın toplam NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri 2009 - 2010 gelişme döneminde sırasıyla - 354. 9, 1142. 2 ve 788. 6 g C m- 2 olarak bulunmuştur. Bu dönem için ortalama günlük GPP 4. 21 g C m- 2, Reco 2. 91 g C m- 2 ve NEE - 1. 31 g C m- 2 olmuştur. 2010 - 2011 gelişme döneminde toplam NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri sırasıyla - 441. 3 g C m- 2, 1046. 8 g C m- 2 ve 605. 5 g C m- 2 olmuştur. Bu dönem için ortalama günlük NEE, GPP ve Reco değerleri ise sırasıyla - 1. 72 g C m- 2, 4. 09 g C m- 2 ve 2. 37 g C m- 2 ’dir. Bu çalışmada ayrıca karbon akıları ile meteorolojik faktörler ve yine karbon akıları ile vejetasyon dinamikleri (NDVI, LAI, sPRI, biyokütle) arasında ilişki olup olmadığı incelenmiştir. Karbon akıları ile meteorolojik faktörler arasındaki ilişkiler incelendiğinde, özellikle bitkinin fotosentez aktivitesinin arttığı zaman aralığında PPFD ile GPP arasında doğrusal olmayan iyi bir ilişki olduğu görülmektedir. Reco daha çok toprak sıcaklığıyla bağlantılı çıkmıştır. Ayrıca vejetasyon dinamikleri ile karbon akıları arasında da oldukça yüksek belirlilik katsayısına sahip ilişkiler tespit edilmiştir. One of {{the most}} {{important}} research subjects of agricultural meteorology is evaluating the possible effects of agriculture on climate change. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, especially anthropogenic carbon dioxide, is seen as the most significant reason of global warming. Therefore, determination of the carbon dioxide released to and captured from the atmosphere within the components of global carbon cycle is still being searched by scientists. Terrestrial ecosystems are among the most important components of global carbon cycle on earth because they capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release it to the atmosphere again. Hence, evaluation of the effect of plants in these terrestrial ecosystems on the carbon cycle must be done carefully. Additionally, searching the agricultural activities that affect the amount of captured and released carbon (dioxide) is a scientifically supported issue and long-term flux measurements of different ecosystems are required {{to be able to do}} all related researches. For this reason, flux networks are established to measure carbon dioxide, water vapor and energy fluxes between different terrestrial ecosystems (forests, croplands, <b>grasslands,</b> <b>peat</b> lands etc.) and the atmosphere across five continents. Most of the micrometeorological systems are installed first in forests then in croplands. The amount of micrometeorological tower sites is increasing in order to measure mass and energy fluxes above canopies. In Turkey, there are limited studies about these issues. To fulfill this lack,, changes in carbon dioxide fluxes during the two growing periods of winter wheat were measured and determined in the Thrace Region using a micrometeorological method called Eddy Covariance for the first time in Turkey in the frame of the TÜBİTAK project named “Determination of Carbon Dioxide, Water Vapor and Energy Fluxes for Winter Wheat”. The research field was located at Atatürk Soil Water and Agricultural Meteorology Research Station, Kırklareli. An eddy covariance measurement system that consists of a 3 -dimensional sonic anemometer, open path infrared CO 2 /H 2 O gas analyzer, temperature, humidity sensors and data logger was used to calculate fluxes. Additionally, an agrometeorological station measuring air temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction (at different heights), precipitation, global radiation and photosynthetically active radiation etc. was installed in the research field. Furthermore, spectral measurements have been done periodically. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and scaled photochemical reflectance index (sPRI) have also been calculated from spectral measurements. Additional Leaf area index (LAI) measurements have been done once in a two-week period. General principle of eddy covariance measurements is the covariance between concentration of interest and vertical wind speed in eddies. Eddy covariance is a widely used micrometeorological method to calculate turbulent fluxes within the atmospheric boundary layer. Complexity of the method, high cost of the system, correction issues etc. are some disadvantages of this technique. Moreover; experimental knowledge, micrometeorological and agrometeorological background are needed to apply the method correctly. Being a direct measuring method and having no need to empirical constants are the main advantages of this method. In this study; frequency response corrections, WPL (Webb, Pearman, Leuning) correction and coordinate rotation (tilt correction) have been applied to 10 Hz time series of eddy covariance data after de-spiking. Heavy precipitation and low turbulent exchange conditions affect the eddy covariance measurements so that the system produces bad data. Hence, the data gaps caused by the above conditions must be filled. Here, international standard procedures have been followed. Finally, flux partitioning was done and the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) values were calculated during 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 growth period of winter wheat. NEE is positive (+) when carbon dioxide flux is from winter wheat ecosystem to atmosphere and negative when carbon dioxide flux is from atmosphere to winter wheat ecosystem. In the 2009 - 2010 growth period, winter wheat was planted on 9 October 2009 and harvested on 6 July 2010. The eddy covariance flux measurements showed that cumulative NEE, GPP and Reco were - 354. 9, 1142. 2 and 788. 6 g C m- 2 respectively for the whole growing period. Daily means of NEE, GPP and Reco for the whole growth period are - 1. 31, 4. 21 and 2. 91 g C m- 2, succesively. During the 2010 - 2011 growth period, the crop was sown on 25 October 2010 and harvested on 8 July 2011. For this growth period, cumulative NEE, GPP and Reco have been determined as - 441. 3, 1046. 8 and 605. 5 g C m- 2, respectively. Similarly, succesive daily means of NEE, GPP and Reco for 2010 - 2011 of winter wheat were obtained as - 1. 72, 4. 09 and 2. 37 g C m- 2. A further step was taken by the analysis of possible relationships between winter wheat NEE, GPP and Reco and some meteorological factors such as air temperature, soil temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PPFD). These relationships were examined by taking different winter wheat growing seasons into account. The first period was between sowing and tillering, the second period was between tillering and bolting, whereas the third period was between bolting and flowering and finally the fourth one was between flowering and harvest. In 2009 - 2010 growth period, the highest value of the determination coefficient (r 2 = 0. 7) between GPP and air temperature has been determined for the third period. Determination coefficient between GPP and soil temperature for the third period was also 0. 7. In the other three periods, GPP was less or even not related to air or soil temperature. There were nonlinear relationships between GPP and PPFD during the first (r 2 = 0. 72) and the third periods (r 2 = 0. 6). For the second and the last periods, no significant relationship could be obtained. The results have shown that NEE was not related to air and soil temperature at all. The relationship between NEE and PPFD was the best (r 2 = 0. 82) during the first period. There were strong nonlinear correlations (determination of coefficients are between 0. 89 and 0. 99) between Reco and both air and soil temperatures during the first and the third periods. Similar relationships between carbon fluxes and meteorological factors have also been determined for the 2010 - 2011 winter wheat growth period. However, the relationships are not appreciable when compared with these during the previous growth period. Another goal of this study was to evaluate the possible interactions between cumulative carbon fluxes and vegetation indices (NDVI, sPRI, LAI and biomass). To achieve this, the relationships between cumulative NEE, GPP, Reco and NDVI have been determined for the whole 2009 - 2010 growth period. Determination coefficients were 0. 86 for NEE and Reco and 0. 95 for GPP. Same relationships have been investigated for two separated periods in case of the 2010 - 2011 growth season. The first period was the one during which NDVI is continuously rising whereas NDVI was continuously decreasing in the second period. There were strong nonlinear relationships between cumulative carbon fluxes (NEE, GPP and Reco) and NDVI. The determination coefficients between cumulative GPP and NDVI were 0. 74 when NDVI was continuously rising and 0. 91 when NDVI was continuously decreasing. r 2 values for the correlation between cumulative NEE and NDVI were 0. 7 while NDVI was continuously rising and 0. 99 while NDVI was continuously decreasing. Strong nonlinear relationships have also been found (r 2 values are 0. 79 while NDVI was rising and 0. 997 while NDVI was decreasing) between cumulative Reco and NDVI. Furthermore, it has been found that cumulative carbon fluxes were strongly correlated with LAI both for 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 growing seasons. During the 2009 - 2010 growth season, the coefficients of determination (r 2) between cumulative GPP, NEE, Reco and LAI were 0. 97 for the period in which the LAI values were continuously rising (0 <LAI< 3. 7). The determination coefficients between carbon fluxes and LAI varied from 0. 0. 87 to 0. 98 while LAI values were decreasing. In addition, strong linear correlations have also been specified between all cumulative carbon fluxes and LAI values in 2010 - 2011 growth season. Associations between cumulative carbon fluxes and biomass values have been investigated for the whole growth period. In this context, determination coefficients between cumulative NEE, GPP, Reco and biomass were obtained as 0. 97, 0. 99 and 0. 97, for the 2009 - 2010 growth period, respectively. Also in 2010 - 2011 growth period, strong relationships (0. 93 < r 2 < 0. 97) between cumulative carbon fluxes and biomass values have been determined. The relationships between carbon exchange parameters and sPRI were evaluated by using all the data within the growing period. Consequently, good nonlinear relationships (0. 86 &# 8804; r 2 &# 8804; 0. 87) have been obtained between these parameters. For the whole growth period, a good nonlinear relationship (r 2 = 0. 87) has been obtained between cumulative GPP and sPRI. Consequently, the results of this study showed that carbon exchange parameters of winter wheat plant are affected by many meteorological and environmental factors. Clarification of the effects of these factors by making related studies would enable the researchers to define, explain and model the carbon exchange of winter wheat. Onthe other hand, evaluation of long term eddy covariance measurements is necessary for the reliability of the model results. After that, carbon budget of winter wheat can be estimated for wide areas. In addition to these, it is a clear need to measure and observe fluxes, meteorological factors, vegetation dynamics such as NDVI, sPRI, LAI, biomass for different plant varieties. Modeling by associating the carbon flux measurements with meteorological factors and vegetation dynamics gives the opportunity to use the results for wider areas. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

More information about the nitrifier and denitrifier contribution in non-agricultural systems may increase the accuracy of global NO and N 2 O emission estimates. We assessed the contributions of nitrification and denitrification to NO and N 2 O emissions from three different ecosystems: an acid forest soil; a river sediment in the intertidal zone; and a fertilized <b>peat</b> <b>grassland,</b> using intact soil cores. Samples were taken {{in the spring of}} 1993 and the autumn of 1994. Intact soil cores (5 cm deep) were incubated at field temperature in the laboratory and the accumulation of NO and N 2 O during 24 h was measured. The nitrification and denitrification contribution was determined by specific inhibition of nitrification. The highest mean N 2 O production was in the same range for all sites. Nitrification dominated N 2 O production in spring at all sites. In contrast, denitrification was the main source of N 2 O in the acid forest soil and grassland soil in the autumn. However, the tight coupling of nitrification and denitrification in the river sediment could have resulted in an over-estimation of the contribution of nitrification to N 2 O and NO production. A large part of denitrified N in the acid forest soil was emitted as N 2 O, whereas in the river sediment, except for the autumn, the denitrification N 2 O-to-N- 2 ratio was low, which coincided with a low nitrate content. Nitrification was the dominant NO source in spring at all sites. In autumn, high contributions of both nitrification and denitrification were observed.

Liming proved to be beneficial for earthworm performance and grassland productivity. A higher soil pH and earthworm density resulted in a higher soil biological activity measured as soil respiration. The combined application of lime and earthworms increased herbage apparent N recovery from SCM by 83 % compared to SCM only. In the manured treatments, herbage N uptake was positively correlated with earthworm density (R 2 = 0. 92). N 2 O emissions increased by 37 % when SCM was applied compared to the unfertilised control. Following SCM application, the cumulative increase in herbage N uptake was almost ten times greater than the measured total N 2 O losses. No relationship was observed between earthworm density and level of N 2 O emission.

40|$|Correlative {{studies have}} shown a 'hump-backed' {{relation}} between the vegetation N:P ratio and plant species diversity with the highest diversity at balanced N:P ratios (between 10 and 14). We tested the hypothesis that adding growth-limiting nutrients to mesotrophic grasslands that were in shortage of either N (N:P ratio 14) would {{lead to an increase}} of plant diversity. Thereto, we studied the effects of long-term (11 yr) experimentally increased N and/or P supply on soil nutrient pools, vegetation nutrient dynamics and biodiversity in a riverine grassland in the Netherlands with a low soil N:P ratio (N shortage) and a <b>peat</b> <b>grassland</b> with a high soil N:P ratio (P shortage), respectively. Eleven years of nutrient addition hardly had any effects on the total stocks of C, N and P in the soils of both sites, due to the large size of the soil nutrient pools already present and to the management at both sites (annual hay-making and -removal). However, in the riverine grassland the treatments increased the cycling of the small pool of labile N and P compounds resulting in large increases in annual fluxes of especially N. In the unfertilised controls, species establishments balanced more or less species losses during an 11 year period, thus leading to a dynamic equilibrium of the species pool. However, contrary to our hypothesis, addition of the growth-limiting nutrient led at both sites to a reduction of species diversity even when total biomass remained below critical levels. Species diversity and species evenness were strongly determined by N mineralisation {{and to a lesser extent}} by total soil N and extractable P, respectively. Total above-ground biomass of the vegetation was determined by total soil N. Our study shows that patterns found in correlative studies of the relation between plant diversity and soil and vegetation N:P ratio can not be translated into successful experimental manipulations to enhance biodiversity. The most likely explanation is that colonization limitation occurred in the fertilized plots and that not sufficient diaspores of potentially new species could reach and/or colonize the plots to compensate for the species extinctions as a result of increased nutrient supply...|$|E
