Other bloggers are media professionals who are publishing online, rather than via a TV station or newspaper, either as an add-on to a traditional media presence (e.g., hosting a radio show or writing a column in a paper newspaper), or as their sole journalistic output. Some institutions and organizations see blogging {{as a means of}} [...] "getting around the filter" [...] of media [...] "gatekeepers" [...] and pushing their messages directly to the public. Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs—well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list. The first known use of a blog on a news site was in August 1998, when Jonathan Dube of The Charlotte Observer published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.|$|E

It was published in a special issue of Telematics & Informatics (30 : 3, 232 - 241) themed, ‘Radio and New <b>Participatory</b> <b>Journalisms</b> around the World: Understanding Convergence in News Cultures’, edited by Dr Last Moyo of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. The study sought to explore new media uses by ‘pirate’ radio stations and their audiences, and the potential impact such uses have in democratizing citizen participation in radio news and storytelling. It contributes to my wider ongoing research into media-based storytelling in the digital age., As an empirically driven study (using qualitative in-depth interviews with audiences in Zimbabwe), the paper contributes towards the ‘de-Westernisation’ of scholarly accounts of how audiences are adapting to processes of convergence and digitisation and also offers insights for cross-cultural comparative research. The study offers alternative insights and perspectives into the question of radio reception in the era media convergence. It empirically demonstrates that any meaningful critique of emerging digital ‘storytelling’ techniques and cultures in radio must be grounded in particular socio-political and economic contexts. It is this point that radio stations broadcasting into Africa will need to take into consideration if their digital transmission platforms are to make significant qualitative inroads in the African communicative space., The findings of this study were initially presented at two international events: at the ‘Joburg Radio Days Annual Conference’, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa (27 - 29 July 2011), and at a roundtable on ‘Putting Communication for Development Research into Use’ organized by the University of Sussex’s Institute of Development Studies (2 - 5 March 2012), where I was an invited speaker...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of abusing {{the opportunity of}} <b>participatory</b> online <b>journalism</b> {{through the use of}} offensive speech has generally been neglected in scholarly research. This study tries to fill this research gap by uncovering the characteristics of offensive speech in comments under online news items as well as journalists’ and editors’ opinions on offensive speech. A textual analysis of comments containing offensive speech posted under nine news items, written by influential Slovenian journalists in the nine most-visited Slovenian online news media, was combined with semi-structured interviews with journalists and editors. Offensive comments mostly included general attacks on human dignity, attacks based on the supposed political orientation of a journalist, attacks based on the supposed belonging of journalists to social minorities, and attacks based on the political orientation of a media company. Journalists and editors did not share homogenous views on the use of offensive speech in comments. The majority of interviewed journalists cited commentators’ anonymity as the main reason for offensive speech. The crucial conclusion of this study was that editors abused the idea of participatory journalism; with the excuse of audience participation, they allowed personal attacks on journalists in comments under news items, as their actual goal was to maximize profits. The reasons for the relatively frequent occurrence of offensive speech commentary in online news media {{can be attributed to the}} market orientation of media companies, the low level of common political culture in Slovenia and a general dissatisfaction with the political, economic and wider social situation...|$|R

These unique characteristics explain the success and impact of ISNA on the media scene in Iran, providing the key to its early development and survival.

This article explores three different non-profit organisations that have used collaborative photography to enable locals to empower themselves. Written by Alice Baroni a volunteer with the Education, Research and Policy Unit of Volunteering Qld. Alice is undertaking a PhD at the Queensland University of Technology, exploring (photo) <b>journalism,</b> <b>participatory</b> content creation and community photography in Brazil’s low income suburbs. She {{is part of the}} ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation, and a Brazilian research group ‘Storytellers and Narratives: Contemporary Journalism’. Two of the initiatives explored in this publication are Viva Favela and Imagens do Povo that are ideologically and physically supported by, respectively, Viva Rio and Observatório de Favelas, based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ‘Favela’ is often translated simply as ‘slum’ or ‘shantytown’, but these terms connote negative characteristics such as shortage, poverty, and deprivation, which end up stigmatising these low-income suburbs. Fotografi Senza Frontiere (FSF) (Photographers Without Borders) is an Italian non-governmental organisation that gathers together a group of photographers who aim to provide youth from extreme regions in Nicaragua, Algeria, Argentina, Panama, Uganda, and Palestine with skills to photograph and document their own reality by establishing permanent photo laboratories. This idea, which {{is similar to that of}} Viva Favela and Imagens do Povo, is to enable youth to become professional photographers as a means of self-representation and self-empowerment. Afterwards, students become educators in established photographic labs so as to pass on what they have learnt through FSF’s photographic courses...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{is rooted in}} our observation of the new duality in the current media landscape. On the one hand, the growing impact of commercialisation within the media sector can be demonstrated by {{the increasing use of}} institutional, official sources and pre-packaged information – especially press releases (Buijs et al. 2009; Davies, 2008; Lewis, Willliams & Franklin, 2008; McManus, 1994). The Internet and more specifically Web 2. 0 applications have yet re-opended the debate on the emancipatory potential of media use. Some scholars witness a shift from individualistic top-down monomedia <b>journalism</b> to <b>participatory</b> multimedia <b>journalism</b> characterised by networked communication, a synthesis of interpersonal and mass communication where audiences and mass media producers are connected in one, networked media matrix. These authors state that Web 2. 0 applications such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube invite a more diverse use of journalistic sources that might lead to more balanced media access for a wider range of actors. Therefore, actors in the civil society, individual citizens and alternative news sources may develop into more important, although non-institutional, information sources for journalists (Brundidge, 2010; Castells, 2010; Dahlgren, 2005; Habermas, 2006; Heinrich, 2011; Hermida, 2010; Papathanassopoulos, 2011). Considering these divergent perspectives, we want to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the news production process by identifying the prominent sourcing practices in the newsrooms of seven Belgian newspapers. More specifically, we focus our research on quantitative content analysis of the prominent sources and actors in the foreign news output over a period of 15 years (1995 - 2010). We focus on foreign coverage because this is an important touch stone for the networked media matrix. The focus on international news should also reflect the impact of cost-cutting in newsrooms, foreign coverage often being one of the first victims. From a longitudinal methodological perspective we match our results with reflexions about possible impacts on the mediated public sphere. The results will also be analyzed in a comparative perspective facing popular and quality newspapers. Finally, we will compare French and Dutch language newspapers, which offers the promising possibility to include journalism culture as an explaining variable in the analysis. Preliminary results indicate that politicians and political organisations – {{and to a lesser extent}} government actors, companies and experts – are indeed dominating foreign coverage. Although their news access has not increased through time, it seems nonetheless that citizens also play an important role in the Belgian press. We are also optimistic about the observed balance between copy-paste pieces and in-depth news coverage. In contrast, the first results indicate that the new possibilities for information gathering offered by Web 2. 0 applications have not yet penetrated in Belgian newsrooms...|$|R

50|$|Alternative {{media are}} also created by <b>participatory</b> <b>journalism</b> as {{citizens}} {{play an active}} role in collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information.

It engages in journalistic practices but is driven by goals other than profit making, has different ideals, and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 s {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} about the increasing commercialisation of the media. Numerous scholars state that the economic rationale prompts news organisations to stress cost-cutting and efficiency considerations. It is often argued that foreign coverage {{is one of the}} first victims of this ‘market-driven journalism’, for instance because news media no longer can or want to pay correspondents on the spot. As a consequence foreign news desks, for their information gathering, are increasingly dependent on the international news wires and international news media, whose information they merely domesticate for their own national public. The result is a world view that is mainly dominated by official and powerful actors’ interpretation of events (Berglez, 2008; Buijs et al. 2009; Davies, 2008; Lewis, Willliams & Franklin, 2008; McManus, 1994). The Internet and more specifically Web 2. 0 applications or social media have yet re-opened the debate on the emancipatory potential of media use. Some scholars witness a shift from individualistic top-down monomedia <b>journalism</b> to <b>participatory</b> multimedia <b>journalism</b> characterised by networked communication, a synthesis of interpersonal and mass communication where audiences and mass media producers are connected in one, networked media matrix. These authors state that Web 2. 0 applications such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube invite a more diverse use of journalistic sources that might lead to a more balanced media access for a wider range of actors, including civil society organisations and individual citizens. This ‘network journalism’ offers possibilities for a global outlook in international news that approaches world events from various – not only national and/or official - perspectives (Brundidge, 2010; Castells, 2010; Dahlgren, 2005; Habermas, 2006; Heinrich, 2011). Several studies indicate how the importance of social media might especially hold true in times of breaking news and media restrictions, f. i. during the Iranian elections in June 2009, and less in everyday news production (Chua et al., 2011; Hermida, 2010; Lenatti, 2009; Messner & South, 2011; Morozov, 2009; Papathanassopoulos, 2011). Therefore, a case study approach of certain news events with an important role awarded to Web 2. 0 might increase our understanding of how social media as a news source can contribute to international reporting. In this context, we set up a quantitative content analysis of the prominent sources and actors in the Belgian news coverage on the Arab Spring (data collection February 2012 to June 2012). More specifically, we focus on three different cases - the revolts in Tunisia, Egypt and Syria – in four newspapers (two popular and two quality dailies) and two broadcasters (the public broadcaster VRT and the commercial channel VTM). The central research questions are: To what amount are social media sources used in coverage on the Arab Spring? Do social media sources especially represent Arab citizens’ views on the revolts? In other words, can social media sources add a layer to the official government information that is mainly communicated through the ‘traditional’ information channels (f. i. spokesmen, press conferences) ? Do social media sources contribute to the establishment of a ‘global outlook’ in foreign coverage on the Arab Spring...|$|R
40|$|Transparency {{and media}} {{accountability}} have gained more prominence in Finland recently {{with regard to}} two main factors: Firstly, the news media have become whistle-blowers with regard to a few political scandals over recent years, which have triggered public debate over the power of media and ethical conduct of journalism. Secondly, controversies have risen {{with regard to the}} ‘ownership’ of opinions published on online discussion boards and whether or not these should be submitted to the responsibility of journalists. Even though these themes have captured a lot of public attention, in the context of surveys, the future of journalism and public trust in the news media are not seriously in peril. While citizens in general do not merely use the media but also tend to discuss the news, their role in shaping media accountability practices on the Internet seems limited. Despite the majority of Finns using the Internet on a daily basis, the volume and prominence of media watch-blogs and also attempts to create <b>participatory</b> forms of <b>journalism</b> online have remained scarce. In the absence of a ‘bottom-up’ movement, issues related to media accountability have been taken by traditional institutions of self-regulation: the press council (CMM) and professional organizations supporting the CMM. As a result of their actions, the guidelines of journalists and institutional procedures of the CMM have been updated in order to meet with new challenges. While these attempts tend to draw support from most journalists and citizens in general, there are some signs of differences of opinion about how the Internet is expected to shape journalism and public communication. There is, on the one hand, a strong line of thought that seeks to incorporate online news to the domain of professionalism and self-regulation. On the other hand, the interviews conducted among the Finnish experts signal that the consensus over forms and norms of journalism is not completely harmonious. Rendering news organizations transparent, and enhancing dialogue between producers and users, is endorsed as a principle but the enactment of such practices is not among the primary priorities for media organizations. Nonetheless, relative optimism prevails in that as online journalism {{is on its way to}} redeem its status economically as well culturally, this would enable media organizations to launch new practices, including those related to media accountability. This optimism may not be warranted on the basis that online news practices are developed in a strongly competitive market. In this environment, ethical values such as accountability and trust may appear incompatible with short-term economic goals...|$|R
40|$|The  main  objective  of  the  present  thesis  „The {{usage of}} social media among Estonian journalists“  is to {{identify}} {{to what extent}} social media affects the content of professional journalism. New media technologies have influenced journalists work. Traditional skills and roles of journalists have remained, but tools have changed (International Labour Organisation 2004). Current research examines how much Estonian journalists use social media in their everyday work. The focus is on journalists and editors of Estonian newspapers with the largest readership. First the quantitative analysis aims to identify the most active social media users. Total 259 Estonian online and print media journalists were examined about the presence and usage of social media channels. Ten interviews with most active social media users, based on quantitative analysis, were performed. Interviews explored the usage of major social media channels (blog, Twitter, Facebook) as the news promoting medium and source of information, in addition journalists had to evaluate the future of social  media  as  journalist’s  everyday  working tool. The results showed that 81 % of examined Estonian journalists use at least one social media channel,   with   Twitter   found   to   be   most   popular   channel   in   journalist’s work. However, results revealed that there are far less actively posting users. The main topic of social media posts is personal life, which shows that very few journalists are using social media as the news promoting channel. Only ten of examined Estonian journalists are using social media for promoting news, referring to the articles to provoke discussions and thereby including readers to news production process. Facebook,   because   it’s   wider   network, is rather seen as a marketing channel. More journalists are using social media as source of information, to which are prescribed both Twitter and Facebook. Using social media raises several ethical issues: quality of information and lack of privacy protection. Estonian journalists do not see social media as a major tool in the future, rather as an optional feature that will accelerate the availability of information. Journalists see greater benefits of social media on online journalism and publications of social life. Because of cultural and historical background Estonian media consumers are not ready for being members of participatory media. Therefore Estonian journalists are passive involving readers into the news production process. Social media affects the content of professional journalism in Estonia only slightly, because journalists are more active using social media as source of information instead promoting debate of important issues. At present Estonian press is in the progressive developement, {{on the basis of}} foreign practices and the need to establish rules of social media by the Estonian Newspapers Association - journalists can become acquainted with the new possibilities and solutions.
