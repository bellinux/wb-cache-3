50|$|Metal Foil Deep Etching is a <b>plastograph</b> {{print in}} which {{aluminium}} foil {{is used to}} draw the engraved images. The thin foil is cut and placed on an engraved plate and then the embossed sheet is removed, turned over and filled with resin to stabilise the relief. The resin filled foil is then laminated on plywood or no any other surface. Onobrakpeya first started experimenting with foils and from the experiments transformed the foils into a print medium in the 1980s. He used already printed plates to try out the technique. Metal Foil Relief Print is a three-dimensional metal foil print drawn on a plastocast plate. A fairly thick foil is cut and placed over a plate and hand pressed to transfer {{the shape of the}} picture on the plate. The foil is then removed and filled from behind. It is then laminated onto a plywood and coloured {{in the same way as}} the metal foil deep etching print process already discussed above. Note that while the metal foil deep etching print is drawn from <b>plastograph</b> plates, the metal foil relief print is hand embossed on a <b>plastograph</b> plate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plastograph</b> {{is a term}} {{given by}} Onobrakpeya to {{describe}} his deep etching technique which he innovated in 1967 through what he {{referred to as the}} Hydrochloric Acid Accident. It is an engraving on a low relief surface made of zinc or similar surface material and printed in the intaglio style.|$|E
50|$|In baking, a {{farinograph}} measures specific {{properties of}} flour. It was first developed and launched in 1928. The farinograph {{is a tool}} used for measuring the shear and viscosity of a mixture of flour and water. The primary units of the farinograph are Brabender Units, an arbitrary unit of measuring the viscosity of a fluid. The farinograph is {{a variation of the}} Brabender <b>Plastograph</b> that has been specialized for the baking industry, and it is used around the world for the objective measurement of a variety of flours.|$|E
50|$|Additive <b>Plastograph</b> {{is another}} {{technique}} that involves making of print images {{on a sheet}} of sand paper, using glue as a drawing medium. This is glued to the sand paper using intensive solar heat. Ink is then applied to the resultant images by the intaglio inking process. any link in excess is wiped off with a dry cloth. This is later taken to the press to register the relief already created by the glue on a soaked and semi-dried cartridge printing paper. Finally, the registered impressions are painted, using pastel oil to achieve the desired forms by the artist.|$|E
50|$|Plastocast Relief is {{a painted}} low-relief design that was cast with resin. The idea started as an {{extension}} of the bronzed lino relief. The used <b>plastograph</b> plates (like used lino blocks) have sculptural low relief effects which make them unique as art works. An attempt to retain the original used plates, and at the same time give collectors a chance to possesses and share the beauty of the original, led Onobrakpeya to develop a method of creating other original plates from existing used plates through the use of plaster of Paris. Sometimes, small plates with the same or similar themes are arranged together and cast to form a larger picture. A further development in plastocast relief is carving directly on abandoned or congealed plaster of Paris then applying resin on the cast and pulling out a positive. However for a deep engraving on plaster of Paris to produce bold relief, depends on the nature of the plaster of Paris. This is known as plastocast plate. It is painted or tinted plastocast plate that becomes a plastocast relief.|$|E
40|$|Polyamide {{samples were}} heated under vacuum or mixed in a Brabender <b>plastograph.</b> UV absorbance, chain end concentration, and {{molecular}} weight were studied. Postcondensation was observed for polyamide heated under vacuum. For polyamide samples mixed in the <b>plastograph,</b> atmosphere, shear rate, and temperature changed. Melt viscosity and intrinsic viscosity {{are in good}} correlation in a log-log plot. Oxidation effect on molecular weight and amine chain end concentration could be well related to UV absorbance. The oxygen diffusion into the molten polyamide is a critical parameter. The oxygen concentration in the polyamide mixed under air is ca. 20 times higher than when mixed under nitrogen. The introduction of preoxidized material in the molten polyamide or mixing {{in the presence of}} oxygen have similar effects. Postcondensation and oxidation strongly influence the melt behavior of polyamides...|$|E
40|$|PAmXD, 6 [poly(m-xylylene adipamide) ] was {{processed}} using a Brabender <b>plastograph</b> at 30 rpm and at 265 +/- 5 degrees C. The {{evolution of}} the M(n) versus mixing time determined from solution viscosity and chain end concentrations measurements shows that PAmXD, 6 undergoes hydrolysis or condensation reactions depending on its initial molecular mass. Lower masses undergo condensation while higher masses undergo hydrolysis. The determination of water concentration in the melt during mixing time confirmed that this behavior is related to an equilibrium constant which was estimated at 500 +/- 100. For a mixing period shorter than 20 min, a good correspondence was observed between M(n) values determined either by chain end concentrations or by solution viscosity. However, for a mixing period longer than 20 min, discrepancy between M(n) values using both methods witnesses the probable appearance of oxidative degradation of PAmXD, 6. Mechanisms adapted from the established oxidation reactions of PA 6 and PA 6, 6 are proposed to justify the PAmXD, 6 behavior. Those reactions could explain the slight yellowing of PAmXD, 6 during its processing. It was also shown that the PAmXD, 6 Brabender <b>plastograph</b> mixing torque (30 rpm, 265 +/- 5 degrees C) is linearly related to M(n) in a log/log diagram.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. As an aid to understanding the mechanics of mixing in an internal mixer laboratory scale trials {{have been carried out}} using a mixer having a transparent plastics chamber. The use of a transparent rubber and coloured 'markers' then permitted direct viewing of the characteristic flow patterns deriving from the use of three fill factors. These mixing trials have indicated the rheological properties which must be measured in order to predict the mixing behaviour of a rubber. Also considerable information is contained in the visualisations which will aid further work into control and instrumentation strategies and into fundamental design/mathematical modelling studies. A laboratory Banbury mixer and Brabender <b>Plastograph</b> are used to prepare the rubber compounds which are then characterised for the dispersion of compounding ingredients. For carbon black dispersion studies several techniques are employed. Capillary rheometry is used to study their stress-strain rate relationships and to obtain die swell, shear and tensile properties. Creep and elongational tests are also carried out on uncured mixes. In addition measurements on Mooney viscometer, Monsanto rheometer and analysis of bound rubber are made. These tests for filler dispersion are supported by microscopic examination of microtomed sections. Work is also geared to examine properties that are not only sensitive to changes in levels of carbon black dispersion but also that which are readily measured and can be used in industry. Measurements of mechanical phase angle and electrical resistivity are considered. Dispersion of non-black compounding ingredients is studied by X-ray microradiographic technique and the analysis of vulcanisate properties. To relate the performance of the <b>Plastograph</b> and Banbury mix the concept of mixing energy per unit volume of material is used...|$|E

The {{rheological}} {{behaviors of}} the Micro Metal Injection Molding feedstock are important for {{the stability of the}} feedstock during micro injection molding process and quality of the final micro-components. Homogeneous feedstocks are preferable for MIM process to ensure the dimensional consistency of molded components and prevent the defects of powder-binder separation or particle segregation. In this work, feedstocks with various formulations of 316 L stainless steel and binder system were prepared by using Brabender <b>Plastograph</b> EC Plus mixer. The binder system comprises of palm stearin, polyethelene (PE) and stearic acid.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{molecular}} characterization of maleic anhydride melt-functionalized polypropylene (PP-g-MA). The functionalization mechanism, the nature, the concentration, {{and the location of}} grafted anhydride species onto the polypropylene chain are discussed. The polypropylene functionalization was performed using a pre-heated Brabender <b>Plastograph</b> (190 degrees C, 4 min of mixing time). Several concentrations of maleic anhydride and organic peroxide were used for this study. In those experimental conditions, the organic peroxide undergoes an homolytic rupture and carries out a polypropylene tertiary hydrogen abstraction. The resulting macroradical undergoes a beta-scission leading to a radical chain end which reacts with maleic anhydride. When a termination reaction occurs at this first step a succinic type anhydride chain end is obtained. However, oligomerization of maleic anhydride is found to occur more frequently leading to poly(maleic anhydride) chain end. Concentration of both anhydride types and minimal length of the grafted poly(maleic anhydride) were determined. A fraction of maleic anhydride does not react with polypropylene or homopolymerize leading to nongrafted poly(maleic anhydride). (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} phase {{inversion}} phenomenon in blends of poly(m-xylylene adipamide) and maleic anhydride functionalized polypropylene (PAmXD, 6 /PP-g-MA blends) processed in a Brabender <b>plastograph</b> at 265 +/- 5 degrees C and 45 rpm. The viscosity of the components has been modelized by the Brabender torque and the phase inversion composition was determined by means of a solvent dispersion technique (SDT). The compatibilization, i. e., the amount of copolymer in the blend, does not modify the phase inversion location. The phase inversion composition is determined early during the process and is weakly or even not at all affected by further modification of viscosity ratio of the components versus mixing time. This work demonstrates that the only key parameter of the phase inversion composition is the viscosity ratio of the components at the first stage of the mixing process. An empirical equation linking volume fraction ratio for the phase inversion composition and the square root of the viscosity ratio of the components is proposed.

An organic peroxide/sulfur mixture and tetramethylthiuram disulfide as an activator for sulfur were used to functionalize Na-MMT; on the other hand, the PAfs surface was treated using stearic acid.

Before compres sion moulding the blends are prepared by melt mixing in a Brabender <b>plastograph.</b> Model experiments are developed to analyse {{the influence of the}} processing conditions and {{of the nature of the}} moulding surface on the surface and bulk morphologies. Films are prepared under different shear conditions with PI as the moulding surface. At low shear rates the bulk and surface morphologies (size and composition) are very similar. At high shear rates and when the PET is the dispersed phase, the nodules at the surface are highly deformed in the how direction while the PET nodules remaining in the bulk are undeformed. The PET concentration at the surface increases above the bulk concentration. When PP is the dispersed phase, the surface concentration is much lower than the bulk concentration. The observed {{surface morphology}} for samples prepared with high shearing can be explained by an interplay between the flow field and the affinity of the dispersed phase for the moulding surface.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the study of PAmXD, 6 /PP-g-MA blends [poly(meta-xylylene adipamide] and (maleic-anhydride-functionalized-polypropylene) blends. Compatibilization occurs during the {{blending}} of the components in a Brabender <b>plastograph</b> at 265 +/- 5 degrees C and at a mixing rate of 45 rpm. Kinetic data from the literature indicate {{that the rate of}} amine/anhydride reaction is much faster than the rate of amide/anhydride reaction. This interpretation is confirmed by the use of model systems constituted of PAmXD, 6 and pyromellitic dianhydride or of PP-g-MA and meta-xylylene diamine. Infrared analyzes of extracted nodules of PAmXD, 6 /PP-g-MA blends also confirm the extent of the imidization and show that the length of the PAmXD, 6 blocks is lower than the free PAmXD, 6 one. Segregation mechanisms during the compatibilization are discussed to explain this observation. The structure of the copolymers was deduced from those results and from the previous characterizations of PP-g-MA and PAmXD, 6. It consists in a block of PP linked with some blocks of PAmXD, 6. The average number of PAmXD, 6 blocks depends on the average length of the poly(maleic anhydride) functionality carried on by PP-g-MA. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} {{of environmental and}} energy problems has promoted greater governmental interest in selected waste collection and consequently has attracted the interest of several research groups {{to the challenge of}} converting recovered plastics into useful materials. The reactive blending of postconsumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with different polyolefins (PO) was studied in attempts to obtain a new material with enhanced properties with respect to the starting materials. The success of the project depends mainly on the possibility of obtaining a compatibilized blend between two starting polymers that, from chemical and thermomechanical viewpoints, are very different. This was approached by employing polyolefins bearing functional groups capable of specific interaction or chemical reaction with PET end groups. Ternary blends of very low density polyethylene (VLDPE) /PET/ functionalized polyolefin (FPO) in a weight composition of 70 / 20 / 10 and binary blends of FPO/PET in a weight composition of 90 / 10 were prepared and studied to obtain reinforced polyolefin thermoplastic materials.

The blends were processed in a Brabender <b>plastograph</b> at a temperature of 265 +/- 5 degrees C and at 45 rpm. The characterization of the microstructure was carried out through SEM analysis after microtome leveling and chemical etching. The melt viscosity of the components and of the blends {{was measured by the}} Brabender torque. It was found that the copolymers concentration controls the dimension of the dispersed phase. The composition of the blend (dispersed phase weight percent) has a more limited influence. Variations of the components viscosity ratio during the mixing time have little, if any influence on the dimension of the dispersed phase. A Linear relation between the Brabender torque and the specific interfacial area was found. The determination of the copolymer weight fraction leads to the establishment of a close relation between the copolymer concentration and the specific interfacial area. For blends containing from 0 to 7. 5 wt % of copolymer, this relation is Linear and consequently the concentration of copolymer at the interface is constant at about one copolymer macromolecule per 16 nm(2).

A previous morphological, chemical and mineralogical identifications of different waste disposal batches guaranteed its reproducibility and revealed {{that in some cases}} they should be suitable to be treated by those conformation processes. Different tests regarding the chemical and structural evolution with temperature were performed with uniaxial pressed samples, which revealed that in all the cases there are formation of mullite and glassy phases. The presence of these phases contributes to a good physical and chemical behaviour of the fired parts. Moreover, the tests performed in a <b>plastograph</b> equipment to evaluate the rheological characteristics of different mixtures of waste powders with a commercial binder (function of temperature and applied load) show a good performance of these feedstocks to be injected. The typical thickness of injected products were less than 4. 8  mm. After injection moulding or uniaxial pressing followed by sintering the final products present density and porosity values close to the theoretical ones. The Weibull modulus obtained with waste products is in the range of those of technical ceramics. These wastes have chemical and structural characteristics after firing that are interesting to the manufacturing of different ceramic products. [URL]...|$|E

The copolymers were characterised by FTIR and NMR. The crystalline properties was analysed using DSC and X-ray diffraction The large difference in polarity between PE and MPEO result in strongly amphiphilic and surface active copolymers. The copolymers exhibited a micro-phase-separated morphology with two crystalline phases. The surface activity of the PE-PEO graft copolymers was utilised for surface modification of PE. Films of PE and PE-PEO blends, prepared by solvent casting and by compression moulding of melt-mixed blends, had high accumulation of copolymers in the surface region. The surfaces were characterised by water contact angles and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The compatibilizing effect of PE-PEO graft copolymers in blends of PE and PA- 6 was investigated. The copolymers are useful as compatibilizers, in this system, due to the partial miscibility of PEO in PA- 6. Blends were prepared by extrusion in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder and by melt mixing in a Brabender <b>Plastograph.</b> The morphology of the blends was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The addition of the graft copolymer PE-PEO 2000 to the blends reduced the size and narrowed the size distribution of the dispersed phase. The adhesion between the phases was also significantly improved. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the PE/PA blends increased upon the addition of copolymers. In contrast, the copolymer PE-PEO 750, with shorter MPEO grafts and higher grafting density, had no effect of the blend morphology...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The fusion and rheologica 1 behaviour of PVC compounds play a dominant role in the processing operations and {{in the development of}} physical properties in the processed material. These phenomena are governed by the complex morphological structure of PVC resin, compound composition and processing-conditions which in turn affect the physical properties of the final product. The fusion process of flexible PVC compounds was investigated by a combination of several techniques. Samples with varying states of fusion were prepared using shear-and temperature as the processing variables in extrusion, Brabender <b>Plastograph</b> and compression moulding. The degree of fusion of processed compounds was characterized by rheology, thermal analysis, acetone test, optical microscopy, tensile strength and extrudate appearance. The formulation of a PVC compound has a strong influence on the rheological properties of the melt. Hence several plasticizers were chosen from a wide activity range and compounded at three plasticizer concentrations of 30, 50 and 70 phr. These compounds were processed at five different temperatures (150 - 20 QOC) in a Banbury mixer. They were further processed in an extruder or on a two-roll mill followed by compression moulding. In assessing the state of fusion a universal method was found which could define the fusion state adequately for a given PVC sample wbich had undergone any processing condition. Rheometer studies were found useful in assessing state of fusion of samples from specific formulation and processing conditions with processing temperature as the variable. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that more understanding was needed to interpret the results. However, it proved to be a versatile method in determining the maximum temperature a sample would have reached, irrespective of its formulation or processing history. Higher speed mixing data proved to be useful commercially since increased plasticizer concentration gave decreased blending times. Davenport extrusion pressure, tensile properties, morphology and extrudate surface texture showed significant differences between' plasticizers. An identical trend for ease of smooth extrudate formation and its glossy texture was observed...|$|E
