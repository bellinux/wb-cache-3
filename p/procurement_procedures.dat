25|$|A {{number of}} reforms were also {{carried out to}} the armed forces, as characterised by a {{reduction}} in basic military training from 18 to 15 months, a reorganisation of education and training, and personnel and <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures.</b> Education for the troops was improved, a personnel reshuffle of top management in the Bundeswehr was carried out, academic education was mandated for officers beyond their basic military training, and a new recruiting policy for Bundeswehr personnel was introduced {{with the intention of}} building an army that reflected West Germany’s pluralistic society. Defense Minister Helmut Schmidt led the development of the first Joint Service Regulation ZDv 10/1 (Assistance for Innere Fuehrung, classified: restricted), which revitalized the concept of Innere Fuehrung while also affirming the value of the “citizen in uniform.” According to one study, {{as a result of this}} reform, “a strong civil mindset displaced the formerly dominant military mindset,” and forced the Bundeswehr’s elder generation to accept a new type of soldier envisioned by Schmidt. In addition, the Federal Cost of Moving Act increased the relocation allowance (with effect from 1 November 1973), with the basic allowances raised by DM 50 and DM 100 respectively, while extra allowances for families were raised to a uniform amount of 125 DM.|$|E

2500|$|As the Pacific war progressed, the {{air force}} {{increasingly}} needed a bomber capable of reaching Japan from its bases in Hawaii, {{and the development of}} the B-36 resumed in earnest. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, in discussions with high-ranking officers of the USAAF, decided to waive normal army <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures,</b> and on 23 July 1943 — some fifteen months after the Germans' Amerika Bomber proposal's submission made it to their RLM authority — the USAAF submitted a [...] "letter of intent" [...] to Convair, ordering an initial production run of 100 B-36s before the completion and testing of the two prototypes. The first delivery was due in August 1945, and the last in October 1946, but Consolidated (by this time renamed Convair after its 1943 merger with Vultee Aircraft) delayed delivery. The aircraft was unveiled on 20 August 1945 (three months after V-E Day), and flew {{for the first time on}} 8 August 1946.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil’s public {{research}} institutes {{and universities}} follow rigid rules {{that tend to}} make them difficult to manage. States may opt {{to develop their own}} research institutes and university systems but, as all laws and regulations are adopted at federal level, they all have to follow the same rules and regulations. Thus, they all come up against the same hurdles. These include extensive bureaucratic structures, an obligation to recruit staff, academic or otherwise, from among public servants, analogous career ladders and salary systems, an irregular flow of funds, overly complex <b>procurement</b> <b>procedures</b> and powerful unions in the civil service. A structural alternative was developed in 1998, with the creation of social organizations. These private, non-profit entities manage public research facilities under contract to federal agencies. They have the autonomy to hire (or fire) staff, contract services, buy equipment, choose the topics and objectives of scientific or technological research and sign research contracts with private companies. The flexibility accorded to these social organizations and their management style have made them a success story in Brazilian science. As of 2015, there were six such organizations: ...|$|E

We propose a new <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure</b> that is based on a reverse auction. Shares are allocated endogenously, depending on the suppliers 4 bids. The procedure obtains dual sourcing by assigning positive shares to the two most competitive bids and uses discarded bids to endogeneize the reserve price. In equilibrium the two most competitive suppliers are awarded contracts. Surprisingly, when discarded suppliers are competitive enough, the procedure not only allows taking advantage of dual sourcing but also generates lower procurement expenditures than a standard auction for sole sourcing. We also show that providers reveal their costs truthfully and that the <b>procurement</b> <b>procedure</b> can be used in different scenarios concerning what providers know about each others 4 costs, provided the assumption of private values holds...|$|R
