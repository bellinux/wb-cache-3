5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} a run for city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the city}} during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and <b>program</b> <b>coordinator</b> of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf <b>Program</b> <b>Coordinator.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the ethics of social media use in {{rehabilitation}} counselor education <b>programs.</b> <b>Program</b> <b>coordinators</b> from 81 U. S. education programs accredited by the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE) were solicited to complete a survey regarding the ethical dilemmas or problems they encountered with respect to social media used by graduate students, faculty, and administrative staff. Of the 81 <b>program</b> <b>coordinators,</b> 28 (34. 56 %) completed the survey. The survey asked <b>program</b> <b>coordinators</b> to report whether their program, department, or university had a social media policy, as well as whether they had encountered any social media-related ethical dilemmas. Finally, the survey asked <b>program</b> <b>coordinators</b> about their ethical beliefs regarding the use of social media in rehabilitation counselor education. The results found that 13 (46. 43 %) of the <b>program</b> <b>coordinators</b> had encountered at least one ethical dilemma related to graduate students' misuse of social media in the past year. The most frequently cited dilemma was students' "befriending" of faculty members on social networking sites such as Facebook. An examination of the data revealed no association between the type of social media policy employed and the probability of reporting an ethical dilemma. <b>Program</b> <b>coordinators</b> reported that the ethical use of social media will continue to be a challenge in the future, and the results of the present study could thus be used by rehabilitation counseling educators to develop policies and practices to better promote and regulate the appropriate use of social media in rehabilitation education programs...|$|R

Susana Herrera, the <b>program</b> <b>coordinator</b> for Houston's Truancy Reduction Demonstration Project, said that truancy was {{a major issue in}} Gulfton education and language barriers, a lack of supervision by parents and guardians, [...] "high mobility," [...] lack of familiarity with United States laws, and familial norms act as [...] "barriers to attending school."

Jaime de la Isla, the assistant superintendent of the Houston Independent School District, said in 2000 that it was possible that the district lost significant amounts of money because residents of Gulfton were not counted in the 1990 United States Census, and that the district receives federal funds for bilingual programs, free and reduced lunch, and special education based on numbers in the U.S. census. Steve Murdock, a demographer for the state of Texas, said that [...] "he major problem in an undercount is not an immigration issue. It's always difficult to count any population that is highly mobile, poor and living in a diversity of households." ...|$|E

Second, to what extent are AVID <b>program</b> <b>coordinators</b> able to mobilize their social capital to convey information, resources, and opportunities to minority and low-status youth in the context of program implementation? Third, what factors facilitate or constrain the accumulation of accessible social capital and agency-oriented mobilization of social capital (on behalf of program participants and/or program implementation) ? Finally, to what extent does AVID training identify the underpinning theoretical concepts and processes of social capital theory; thus do AVID <b>program</b> <b>coordinators</b> understand their role relative to the help-seeking and network-seeking orientations of institutional agency?; This study incorporated both inductive and deductive methodologies within the qualitative research design to accomplish in-depth cross-case analysis of the range, quality, and nature of program coordinators' individual networks and sources of support. Furthermore, this methodology also determined their proclivity to excess their individual networks and sources of support to convey essential resources, information, and opportunities to minority or low-status youth; thus facilitating their academic and social mobility, and, hence, fostering their empowerment.; The study revealed insight and answers as it relates to the primary research questions, and articulated the findings into (3) thematic summaries and discussion. First, the study revealed that <b>program</b> <b>coordinators</b> have critical deficiencies in their personal networks relative to the status of their positional contacts. Second, it revealed that <b>program</b> <b>coordinators</b> are not engaged in active (institutional) agency as counterstratification mechanism.
