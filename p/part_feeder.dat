40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss a linear {{vibratory}} <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> for handling brake liners, typical sector-shaped components. Part feeders have been used in the industries for a long time to present the parts in a desired orientation. Berretty et al. (1999) discussed a class of mechanical filters that are capable of removing polygonal sections from the track of the feeder which are referred to as traps. The traps eliminate or reorient the parts until they reach the final desired orientation. A <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. The desired orientation was the most probable natural resting orientation. The trap was mounted on a linear vibratory feeder. The adaptive <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part and adjust the trap to accommodate that. This set-up eliminates the use of different traps for different-sized sector-shaped parts and wastage of productive time in changing the traps for different sizes. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity of part on the feeder. Design/methodology/approach A <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> was developed using traps, to reorient the sector-shaped part to desired orientation. Acrylic material was found to be suitable for trap compared to aluminium. The adaptive <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> developed was capable of identifying the size of the incoming part using proximity sensors. Depending on the size of the incoming part, the track width was adjusted dynamically with the help of a stepper motor, rack and pinion arrangement. A regression model was developed to predict the conveying velocity. Findings Typical brake liners in the size range of 40 - 60 mm (radius) were considered for developing the adaptive <b>part</b> <b>feeder.</b> Based on performance studies, the acrylic trap was found better than aluminium traps. The appropriate frequency and amplitude of vibration for maximum conveying velocity of the adaptive <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> were found experimentally. Regression equation was developed to determine the conveying velocity based on input frequency and amplitude. The regression results were found to be in close agreement with the experimental results. Research limitations/implications The developed <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> is suitable for handling sector-shaped parts only. Originality/value This paper demonstrates an inexpensive adaptive part feeding device for handling sector-shaped parts which can be extended for handling other asymmetric parts also...|$|E

30|$|Moreover, in the {{commercial}} pneumatic tube conveyor combined with a parts feedersystem, parts are supplied via the pushing force of a parts feeder system. However, as mentioned, Au grains must be aligned before the treatment, and cannot be supplied by the pushing force of a <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> system during the treatment. Therefore, a special pneumatic tube conveyor needs to be designed to shoot Au grains. The shooting subdevice that we developed satisfies the requirement for shooting Au grains.|$|E

40|$|A common task in {{automated}} {{manufacturing processes}} is to orient parts prior to assembly. We consider sensorless orientation of a polygonal {{part by a}} sequence of fences. We show that any polygonal part can be oriented by a sequence of fences placed along a conveyor belt, thereby settling a conjecture by Wiegley et al.

We also show how to compute an orienting sequence of push actions. We propose a three-dimensional generalization of conveyor belts with fences consisting of a sequence of tilted plates with curved tips; each of the plates contains a sequence of fences.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{aspects of}} an innovative method towards {{the development of}} a hybrid part orienter. Focusing on the principle of minimalism, we investigate the use of overhead pins of various classes over a slow moving conveyor to orient polygonal planar parts. We implement a simple planner that yields sequences of static passive pins to orient a given part from a random initial state to a final orientation set. We also encounter cases in which a single final orientation is not found, and thus, we introduce the use of a force/torque sensor (static active pin) to help distinguish between the possible orientations and be able to tell which results. Limitations in orienting parts with overhead pins exist due to the complexity of the problem. Therefore, the purpose of our work is to serve as an initial study towards developing a <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> that uses a new class of orienting devices, such as overhead pins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> is a {{mechanism}} that receives {{a stream of}} identical parts in arbitrary orientations and outputs them �oriented the same way. Various sensorless part feeders have been proposed in the literature. The feeder we consider consists of a sequence of fences that extend partway across a conveyor belt; a polygonal part carried by the belt is reoriented by each fence it encounters. We present an-time algorithm to compute a sequence of fences that uniquely orients, if one exists, where is {{the total number of}} vertices and is the number of stable edges of. As in [3], we reduce the problem to searching for a path in a state graph that has edges. By exploiting various geometric properties of the state graph, we show that it can be represented implicitly and a desired path can be found in time. Our technique is quite general and is applicable to other part manipulation problems. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a hierarchical approach {{for the analysis}} and design of systems with multiple frictional contacts, {{with a focus on}} applications to the design of part feeding and assembly processes. The simplest model in the hierarchy is the geometric model described by a set of non-penetration constraints that depends only on the geometry of the design. The model with the highest fidelity is one that incorporates rigid body dynamics, joint constraints, and frictional contacts. Our approach is based on a scheme that first uses Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) to explore and prune the feasible set of design parameters. The next step is to redesign the system iteratively with the pruned parameter set using a model with higher fidelity. This process is repeated with improved models, until an optimal design is obtained with the model of desired fidelity. We illustrate the models, the design process, and the feasibility of this hierarchical approach by applying it to the design of a simple <b>part</b> <b>feeder...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{automated}} assembly lines, part feeders often {{impose a}} bottleneck that restricts throughput. To facilitate {{the design of}} parts and assembly lines, we'd like to estimate feedrates based on CAD models of parts. A previous paper [7] described how to predict throughput for a visionbased robotic <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> given the distribution of part poses when parts are randomly dropped on a conveyor belt. Estimating this distribution is also useful {{for the design of}} traditional feeders such as vibratory bowls. In this paper, we describe three algorithms for estimating pose distributions. We review the quasi-static estimate reported in [20] and introduce a refinement that takes into account some measure of dynamic stability. The "quasi-dynamic" estimate can be computed very rapidly and is more accurate than the quasi-static.

40|$|The {{vibratory}} bowl feeder {{is used in}} automated assembly to sort and orient variety of parts. To design a <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> the engineer needs knowledge related to the tendency of the parts to fall in different positions or aspects {{as well as the}} complexity of the feeder, and the number of parts. Currently, the design of a feeder is based in heuristics rather than sound manalytical models. The investigation proposes the development of a model that predicts the influence or the effect of the vibration amplitude in the orientation efficiency. For that reason, the model will be based on the identified parameters, such as part’s geometry and part’s orientation {{at the end of the}} bowl feeder, to optimize the design and performance of the {{vibratory bowl}} feeder.

40|$|Abstract [...] - Modern {{production}} techniques demand {{high degree of}} automation in feeding and handling of individual components. Where the amount of production equipment has allowed machining times to be reduced in many processes, at the same time, feeding operations are still manually carried out {{which means that the}} handling of components accounts for a greater proportion of overall working cycle time. Mechanized part feeding has thus become an indispensable part of today’s automated assembly lines where feeding of small parts in a preferred orientation is of paramount importance. The conventional vibratory bowl feeder used in the industry is capable of feeding a variety of parts but is usually used for feeding one particular type of component to a particular assembly line. Situations occur where there are multiple assembly lines running in parallel carrying different components. Each line has a dedicated feeding system supplying components to the same. In case the variety of parts to be fed is large then this system of having different feeders for different parts is not feasible. The aim of our work is to design, fabricate and analyze the performance of an agile feeding system, which eliminates the need for multiple feeding systems and replaces it by a single unit. Our system consists of a vibratory bowl <b>part</b> <b>feeder</b> and a pneumatic programmable system integrated with it for identifying the different parts, sorting them and feeding them to their desired locations.

The key idea is that, for almost any part (1) there exists a single field that induces a unique stable equilibrium for the part, and (2) when the part is placed under the field, it is essentially driven to-ward the associated stable equilibrium configuration. It has been proven recently that there exists a combi-nation of the unit radial field and a constant field that induces a unique stable equilibrium for almost any part. However, the work focuses mainly on an existential proof and fails to address how to compute the field for a given part.

When a part is placed on our devices, the programmed vector field induces a force and moment upon it. Over time, the part may come to rest in a dynamic equilibrium state. By chaining together sequences of vector fields, the equilibria may be cascaded to obtain a desired final state. By analyzing and constraining the equilibria of programmable vector fields, we can generate and execute plans to orient and sort parts. These plans require no sensing. This paper describes new manipulation algorithms using the tools developed in Part I BohringerDonaldMacDonald 96 b.
