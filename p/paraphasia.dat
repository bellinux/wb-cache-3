2500|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} is {{characterized}} as a fluent aphasia. Fluency is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient’s speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, rhythm, melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech. Transcortical sensory aphasia is a disorder {{in which there is}} a discrepancy between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic processing, which is impaired. Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke’s area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient would like to go for a walk, he or she would respond [...] "go for walk." [...] Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, transcortical sensory aphasia is further characterized based on deficits in naming and <b>paraphasia.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{various types of}} neologistic paraphasias. They can be phonologically related to a prior word, a {{following}} word, the intended word, or another neologism. The neologistic <b>paraphasia</b> shares phonemes or the position of phonemes with the related word. This most often occurs when the word and neologistic <b>paraphasia</b> {{are in the same}} clause. Neologistic paraphasias have a less stringent relationship with the target word than phonological paraphasias - where a phonological <b>paraphasia</b> has {{more than half of the}} target word’s phonemes, a neologistic <b>paraphasia</b> has less than half.|$|E
50|$|Perseverative <b>paraphasia</b> {{is a type}} of <b>paraphasia</b> {{in which}} the {{previous}} response persists and interferes with retrieval of new responses. (See the experimental case study D.L.A published by Dennis in 1976.) It is associated with lesions in the left caudate nucleus.|$|E
5000|$|Wild <b>paraphasias</b> are {{the most}} {{infrequent}} of the phonemic <b>paraphasias,</b> and occur when an unrelated error occurs - [...] "supei" [...] for toothbrush.|$|R
50|$|Subordinate {{semantic}} <b>paraphasias</b> are {{the opposite}} of superordinate semantic <b>paraphasias</b> and replace the target word with one that is more specific - rose, for flower, for example.|$|R
50|$|Verbal <b>paraphasias</b> are confusions {{of words}} or the {{replacement}} of one word by another real word; another definition {{is that of a}} contextually inappropriate English word or an English word of a syntactically incorrect class - the wrong part of speech, for example. Verbal <b>paraphasias</b> do not often preserve length, although the gender of the target word was preserved in {{more than half of the}} errors in one case study. It is hypothesized that verbal <b>paraphasias</b> are not the result of a random process but from a precise deficit in a single area. Verbal <b>paraphasias</b> are the only type of <b>paraphasias</b> that can also be linked to nonfluent aphasias, and they are mainly caused by lesions to the posterior temporal region of the brain, the head of the caudate nucleus, or both.|$|R

5000|$|Phonemic <b>paraphasia</b> - Mispronunciation; syllables out of sequence. e.g. [...] "I {{slipped on}} the lice and broke my arm." ...|$|E
5000|$|Phonemic <b>paraphasia,</b> also {{referred}} to as phonological <b>paraphasia</b> or literal <b>paraphasia,</b> refers to the substitution of a word with a nonword that preserves {{at least half of the}} segments and/or number of syllables of the intended word. This can lead to a variety of errors, including formal ones, in which one word is replaced with another phonologically related to the intended word; phonemic ones, in which one word is replaced with a nonword phonologically related to the intended word; and approximations, an attempt to find the word without producing either a word or nonword. These types of errors are associated with Wernicke's aphasia, among others. Phonemic paraphasias are often caused by lesions to the external capsule, extending to the posterior part of the temporal lobe or internal capsule. This type of <b>paraphasia</b> also occurs in other languages as well. For example, case studies have been performed with German speakers, which demonstrated that 30.8% of paraphasias occurred at the beginning of the word in patients with Wernicke's aphasia and 22.6% for patients with Broca's aphasia. In English speakers this tendency to create errors at the beginning of the word remained.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine whether Jakobson's claim that Broca's aphasic patients emit chiefly semantic <b>paraphasias</b> of the similarity type, whereas Wernicke's aphasic patients produce mainly paraphasic substitutions of the contiguity type, can be supported by data gathered for clinical purposes under controlled conditions. Semantic <b>paraphasias</b> produced by 96 aphasic patients on a standard test of visual naming were taken into account. Three independent judges, blind to aphasia type, classified all responses retained as semantic substitutions {{into one of the}} following four categories: those having 1) a strong similarity, 2) a strong contiguity, 3) a mild similarity, and 4) a mild contiguity relation to the correct word. No relationship was found between type of semantic <b>paraphasias</b> and clinical form of aphasia. Furthermore, irrespective of the clinical form of aphasia, aphasics tend to give more similarity substitutions than contiguity substitutions...|$|R

50|$|Neologistic paraphasias, a {{substitution}} with a non-English or gibberish word, follow pauses indicating word-finding difficulty. They {{can affect}} {{any part of}} speech, and the previously mentioned pause {{can be used to}} indicate the relative severity of the neologism; less severe neologistic paraphasias can be recognized as a distortion of a real word, and more severe ones cannot. The hypothesized source for these neologisms is “a device which quasirandomly combines English phonemes in a phonotactically regular way.” A neologistic <b>paraphasia</b> {{can be thought of as}} a neologism resulting from aphasia, rather than any other of the sources with which they are associated. Neologistic <b>paraphasia</b> is often associated with receptive aphasia and jargon aphasia.|$|E
5000|$|Paragrammatism is the {{confused}} or incomplete use of grammatical structures, found in {{certain forms of}} speech disturbance. Paragrammatism is the inability to form grammatically correct sentences. It is characteristic of fluent aphasia, most commonly Receptive aphasia. Paragrammatism is sometimes called [...] "extended paraphasia," [...] although it is different from <b>paraphasia.</b> Paragrammatism is roughly synonymous with [...] "word salad," [...] which concerns the semantic coherence of speech rather than its production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Paraphasia</b> is {{associated}} with fluent aphasias, characterized by “fluent spontaneous speech, long grammatically shaped sentences and preserved prosody abilities.” Examples of these fluent aphasias include receptive or Wernicke’s aphasia, anomic aphasia, conduction aphasia, and transcortical sensory aphasia, among others. All of these lead to a difference in processing efficiency, which is often caused by damage to a cortical region in the brain (in receptive aphasia, for example, the lesion is in or near Wernicke’s area); lesion location {{is the most important}} determining factor for all aphasic disorders, including <b>paraphasia</b> - the location of the lesion can be used to hypothesize the type of aphasic symptoms the patient will display. This lesion can be caused by a variety of different methods: malfunctioning blood vessels (caused, for example, by a stroke) in the brain are the cause of 80% of aphasias in adults, as compared to head injuries, dementia and degenerative diseases, poisoning, metabolic disorders, infectious diseases, and demyelinating diseases. Lesions involving the posterior superior temporal lobe are often associated with fluent aphasias.|$|E
40|$|This study {{utilized}} fMRI {{to examine}} neurological activity associated with picture naming in twelve persons with chronic aphasia.

Semantic <b>paraphasias</b> recruited a wide-spread cortical network including, among others, the bilateral inferior temporal lobule as well as spared cortical areas in the left frontal lobe.

50|$|<b>Paraphasia</b> {{is a type}} of {{language}} output error commonly associated with aphasia, and characterized by the production of unintended syllables, words, or phrases during the effort to speak. Paraphasic errors are most common in patients with fluent forms of aphasia, and comes in three forms: phonemic or literal, neologistic, and verbal. Paraphasias can affect metrical information, segmental information, number of syllables, or both. Some paraphasias preserve the meter without segmentation, and some do the opposite. However, most paraphasias affect both partially.|$|E

40|$|When {{submitted}} to confrontation naming tasks, aphasic patients show {{different types of}} naming errors: phonetic, phonemic and verbal-semantic <b>paraphasias,</b> neologisms and anomia, but it is generally difficult to decide whether these errors are mainly due to {{a breakdown of the}} semantic systems or to post-lexical phonological disorders. In order to clarify this issue, 118 aphasic patients were given 3 tests of confrontation naming and 3 tests of semantic-lexical discrimination. Naming errors on confrontation were used to classify aphasic patients in various subgroups (according to the prevalence of a given type of naming error), whereas performances obtained on tests of semantic-lexical discrimination were taken as an index of disorganization of the semantic systems. The performances on semantic discrimination tests of patients showing a prevalence of phonetic, phonemic and verbal-semantic <b>paraphasias,</b> neologisms and anomia on confrontation naming tasks were compared. A very small number of semantic discrimination errors was obtained by patients showing a prevalence of phonetic and phonemic transformations on confrontation, whereas a much larger number of semantic discrimination errors was obtained by patients showing a prevalence of verbal-semantic <b>paraphasias,</b> neologisms and anomia...|$|R
50|$|A 1988 {{study by}} Mary Boyle {{proposed}} a method focused on oral reading to treat phonemic <b>paraphasias</b> was partially successful, resulting in fewer phonemic <b>paraphasias</b> but a slower rate of speech. Treatments lasted for 50 minutes and occurred once a week. During these treatment sessions, {{the patient was}} instructed to look at twenty different phrases -each of these phrases consisted of one to three syllables - then read the phrase. If the patient failed to read the phrase, the process was repeated. If the patient failed to read the phrase again, the process was abandoned. To progress from a set of one syllable phrases to two syllable phrases and two syllable phrases to three syllable phrases, an 80% success rate was necessary. This treatment was partially successful. Although fewer phonemic <b>paraphasias</b> were produced due to this treatment, speaking efficiency was not improved by this study. This is partially because {{the focus of the}} treatment was on sound production rather than semantic content. Improvements lasted for six weeks before the patient regressed.|$|R
50|$|These errors can be semantic, {{in which}} {{the meaning of the}} word is related to that of the {{intended}} word (car for van, for example). Semantic <b>paraphasias</b> can be further subdivided into six different types.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a speaker}} makes an {{utterance}} they must translate their ideas into words, then syntactically proper phrases with proper pronunciation. The speaker must have prior world knowledge {{and an understanding}} of the grammatical rules that their language enforces. When learning a second language or with children acquiring their first language, speakers usually have this knowledge before they are able to produce them. Their speech is usually slow and deliberate, using phrases they have already mastered, and with practice their skills increase. Errors of linguistic performance are judged by the listener giving many interpretations if an utterance is well-formed or ungrammatical depending on the individual. As well the context in which an utterance is used can determine if the error would be considered or not. When comparing [...] "Who must telephone her?" [...] and [...] "Who need telephone her?" [...] the former would be considered the ungrammatical phrase. However, when comparing it to [...] "Who want telephone her?" [...] it would be considered the grammatical phrase. The listener may also be the speaker. When repeating sentences with errors if the error is not comprehended then it is performed. As well if the speaker does notice the error in the sentence they are supposed to repeat they are unaware of the difference between their well-formed sentence and the ungrammatical sentence.An unacceptable utterance can also be performed due to a brain injury. Three types of brain injuries that could cause errors in performance were studied by Fromkin are dysarthria, apraxia and literal <b>paraphasia.</b> Dysarthria is a defect in the neuromuscular connection that involves speech movement. The speech organs involved can be paralyzed or weakened, making it difficult or impossible for the speaker to produce a target utterance. Apraxia is when there is damage to the ability to initiate speech sounds with no paralysis or weakening of the articulators. Literal <b>paraphasia</b> causes disorganization of linguistic properties, resulting in errors of word order of phonemes. Having a brain injury and being unable to perform proper linguistic utterances, some individuals are still able to process complex sentences and formulate syntactically well formed sentences in their mind.Child productions when they are acquiring language are full of errors of linguistic performance. Children must go from imitating adult speech to create new phrases of their own. They will need to use their cognitive operations of the knowledge of their language they are learning to determine the rules and properties of that language. The following are examples of errors in English speaking children's productions.|$|E
50|$|Many {{language}} impairments, including paraphasic errors, {{are reduced}} in number through spontaneous recovery of neurological function; this occurs most often with stroke patients {{within the first}} three months of recovery. Lesions associated with ischemic strokes have a shorter spontaneous recovery time, within the first two weeks, and lesions associated with hemorrhagic strokes, on the other hand have a longer period for spontaneous recovery, four to eight weeks. Whether spontaneous recovery occurs or not, treatment must begin immediately after the stroke. A traditional approach requires treatment beginning at the level of breakdown - in the case of <b>paraphasia,</b> at the level of the phoneme. There are commercially available workbooks that provide various activities such as letter, word-picture, or word-word matching, and sentence completion, among other things. The difficulty of these activities varies with the level of treatment. However, these treatments have not been proven to be clinically productive. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is the most widely used technique to study treatment-induced recovery, looking at activation of particular areas of the brain. There are many different ways to process fMRI scans, beginning with the pre-scanning process. Data must be normalized. There is also no consensus on whether or not single subject scans are more helpful than group scans to determine a general pattern of treatment. However, fMRI scans have a few disadvantages.|$|E

40|$|Although phonemic <b>paraphasias</b> {{are common}} in aphasic disorders, {{including}} Broca 2 ̆ 7 s aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia, selective phonemic speech production impairment, or phonemic disintegration, is unusual.
