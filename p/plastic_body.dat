40|$|International audienceIn <b>Plastic</b> <b>Bodies</b> Emilia Sanabria {{examines}} how sex hormones are enrolled to create, mold, and discipline social relations and subjectivities. She shows how hormones have become central to contemporary {{understandings of the}} body, class, gender, sex, personhood, modernity, and Brazilian national identity. Through interviews with women and doctors; observations in clinics, research centers and pharmacies; and analyses of contraceptive marketing, Sanabria traces the genealogy of menstrual suppression, from its use in population control strategies in the global South to its remarketing as a practice of pharmaceutical self-enhancement couched in neoliberal notions of choice. She links the widespread practice of menstrual suppression and other related elective medical interventions to Bahian views of the body as a malleable object that requires constant work. Given this bodily plasticity, and its potentially limitless character, the book considers ways to assess the values attributed to bodily interventions. <b>Plastic</b> <b>Bodies</b> will {{be of interest to}} all those working in medical anthropology, gender studies, and sexual and reproductive health...|$|R

Created by William Schaper in 1948, the game was launched in 1949 and sold millions in its first years. [...] In 1973, Cootie was acquired by Tyco Toys, and, in 1986, by Hasbro subsidiary Milton Bradley. [...] The game was given a new look and continued to enjoy commercial success. [...] Several companies published cootie games in the first half of the twentieth century but only Schaper's featured a free-standing, three-dimensional cootie.

500|$|The {{object of}} the {{original}} 1949 game {{is to be the}} first player to build a [...] "cootie" [...] piece by piece from various <b>plastic</b> <b>body</b> parts that include a beehive-like body, a head, antennae, eyes, a coiled proboscis, and six legs. [...] Body parts are acquired following the player's roll of a die, with each number on the die corresponding to one of the body parts. The body corresponds to one, the head to two, three to the antennas (feelers), four to the eye, five to the proboscis (mouth), and six to the leg. The first part to be acquired must be the body, and then the head. All other body parts may then be acquired in any order. When a player acquires a part, an additional throw of the die is allowed in an attempt to acquire another part. [...] The winner is the first player to completely assemble a cootie.|$|E

[...] He severely criticized the old racing technology: [...] "It's not even '60s technology, from a frame point of view, it's '50s twin-tube technology, not even a spaceframe.
