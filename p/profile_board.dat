[...] Epoxies come in both insulator and conductor formulations The specs need to be checked otherwise an insulator can play a negative role in the collection of profile data. The ability to apply this adhesive in similar quantities and thicknesses is difficult to measure in quantitative terms. This decreases reproducibility. If epoxy is used, properties and specifications of that epoxy must be checked. Epoxy functions within a wide range of temperature tolerances.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 32 - 36) Niche {{relationships and}} coexistence of ten species of rodents occurring in southern California chaparral were studied from October 1975 through September 1976. Habitat selection and utilization were investigated {{to determine the}} extent to which the fundamental niche of each species was reduced in size because of effective competitors. A 2. 2 hectare study plot with 96 trap stations was used to census rodents regularly. Vegetation at each trap site was quantified using the <b>profile</b> <b>board</b> technique. Neotoma fuscipes selected habits of heavy chaparral cover and socially dominant to N. lepida, which was relegated by fuscipes to the chaparral edges. Peromyscus californicus also preferred dense chaparral and the presence of three congeners did not alter its selection of the preferred habitat. Distributions of P. truei and P. boylii were microparapatric within the chaparral and riparian woodland habitats. This distribution is maintained by direct interaction. Peromyscus maniculatus was found occasionally at the shrub-grassland interface but more often in the grassland habitat. It was excluded from the richer habitats by socially dominant congeners. It coexists in the grassland habitat with Microtus californicus and Reithrodontomys megalotis by being socially subordinate to M. californicus and dominant to R. megalotis. Dipodomys agilis was trapped at chaparral edges, open areas between chaparral shrubs and in grassland areas. Its negative pair-wise association with N. fuscipes represents fundamental differences in habitat requirements for these two species. Perognathus californicus coexists with the cricetids in the chaparral by being the most socially subordinate and by filling the interstices among species already present...|$|E

40|$|Many {{species of}} {{wildlife}} use roadside vegetation as habitat. The ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) utilizes roadsides {{for all types}} of cover. Because pheasants are nonmigratory and generally live their entire lives within a 1 - to 2 -mile radius, pheasants are excellent indicator species to predict both quantity and quality of roadside wildlife habitat. Pheasants were introduced to Utah in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s. Populations climbed until pheasant habitat occupied 2 - 4 percent of the total land area in Utah. Populations began to decrease in the 19502 ̆ 7 s. Since 1962, pheasant populations in Cache County, Utah have dropped 2. 71 percent annually. Experts believe the decline in pheasants is directly related to decreased habitat. They attribute the decrease to land use changes. Cache County roadsides currently support 3, 643 acres of wildlife habitat and have the potential to support over 15, 000 acres. To evaluate roadside habitat in Cache County, a roadside vegetation inventory was conducted. This was done by conducting a windshield survey of Cache County roadsides in agricultural areas. Next, vegetation density was measured along roadside transects using a Daubenmire frame and vertical <b>profile</b> <b>board.</b> The results showed Cache County roadsides did not support quality wildlife habitat. The exception was wetlands that contained significant stands of cattail. The evaluation found current maintenance practices of mowing and spraying roadside vegetation has degraded the plant communities and created dense monocultures of a few grass species. A questionnaire was completed by county weed supervisors throughout the state of Utah as well as Utah Department of Transportation personnel and other people associated with the managment of roadside vegetation. The questionnaire provided information about current roadside maintenance practices and attitudes. As a result of the roadside vegetation data and the questionnaire, the study determined that healthier roadside plant communities are possible if current maintenance practices and standards are modified. These modifications should include 1) spot spraying herbicide to eradicate weed species, 2) mowing only 10...|$|E

40|$|DendroLight {{is a novel}} wood {{material}} primarily used as {{core material}} for furniture industry. The manufacturing of this material was started at the year 2010 in Ventspils. It is made from profiled/perforate wood boards stacked in perpendicular layers and then sliced once more in plates perpendicularly to the board’s layers. The main advantage of such a solution is significant reduction of structural weight (up to 40 %) comparing to conventional timber. Material properties are not fully assessed jet, however first experimental test runs demonstrate that it has sufficient stiffness for the use as core material in wood sandwich panels in load bearing structures like walls and floors[1]. For further development of load bearing structures with DendroLight core, reliable design methodology is needed, able to assess detailed geometry component (like <b>profiled</b> <b>board</b> web thickness) influence over the stiffness for large scale structure. In current research several numerical modeling techniques have been compared including numerical models from shell and solid elements in ANSYS and ABAQUS software.

Precision of numerical model is estimated comparing displacements of experimentally tested small scale specimens in compression and bending with mechanical responses of numerical model...|$|R

In modern construction, spurred by the high costs of hardwoods, manufacturers have been adopting this approach to achieve a high quality finishing wrap covering over a standard MDF board.

40|$|Strength {{grading methods}} are {{normally}} based on relationships between one measured value of {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE), regarded as being valid for the whole board, and bending strength. Studies have shown, however, that with a detailed knowledge of local variation of MOE within boards, a highter coefficient of determination (R 2) with respect to bending strength can be obtained. Measurements of fiber angles from laser scanning has {{shown to be a}} powerful tool to establish MOE <b>profile</b> along <b>boards</b> in a speed that cooresponds to the production speed at a sawmill. The present study aims at investigating the accuracy of the local MOE profile determined on basis of fiber angles from laser scanning.

40|$|Abstract. Massively {{multiplayer}} online games (MMOGs) offer {{a unique}} laboratory for examining large-scale patterns of human behavior. In par-ticular, {{the study of}} guilds in MMOGs has yielded insights about the forces driving the formation of human groups. In this paper, we present a computational model for predicting guild membership in MMOGs and evaluate the relative contribution of 1) social ties, 2) attribute homophily, and 3) existing guild membership toward {{the accuracy of the}} predictive model. Our results indicate that existing guild membership is the best predictor of future membership; moreover knowing the identity of a few influential members, as measured by network centrality, is a more power-ful predictor than a larger number of less influential members. Based on these results, we propose that community detection algorithms for virtual worlds should exploit publicly available knowledge of guild membership from sources such as <b>profiles,</b> bulletin <b>boards,</b> and chat groups...|$|R
