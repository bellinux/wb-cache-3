5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a <b>parity</b> <b>relationship</b> among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

Its edge pieces come in visually identical pairs, because of the duplicated colors of opposite faces. However, although visually indistinguishable, they are nevertheless mathematically bound in a <b>parity</b> <b>relationship.</b> In any legal position (reachable from the solved state without disassembling the puzzle), there is always an even number of swapped pairs of edges. However, since swaps may be between visually identical edges, one may find that having solved almost the entire puzzle, one is left {{with a pair of}} swapped (distinct) edges that seems to defy all attempts to exchange them. The solution is to swap a single pair of 'identical' edges to resolve the parity issue, and then restore the rest of the puzzle.|$|E

40|$|In an open economy, {{the scope}} for activist {{stabilization}} policy {{depends on the}} nature of the linkages between domestic and international markets for goods and assets. Two important relationships [...] purchasing power parity and uncovered interest-rate parity [...] have received extensive empirical attention in recent years and are fundamental building blocks of several empirical ex-change rate models. This paper reviews and extends recent econometric findings on these two classical <b>parity</b> <b>relationships</b> and on their corollary, the international equality of expected real interest rates. Econometric tests assuming rationality of expectations are on the whole unfavorable to the classical parity relationships: with few exceptions, they are strongly rejected. A central theme in the review of empirical work is the conditional heteroskedasticity of inflation and exchange rate forecast errors and the bias this statistical problem may impart to tests of inter-national <b>parity</b> <b>relationships.</b> The paper proposes and implements a test for conditional heteroskedasticity which in many cases produces strong evidence that the problem is indeed important...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{financial}} globalization has expanded and developed increasingly fast in recent years, the international <b>parity</b> <b>relationships</b> have been extensively studied {{due to their}} importance in international trade and investment. This paper investigates purchasing power parity (PPP), interest rate parity (IRP) and unbiased expectation hypothesis by analyzing three main currencies; UK sterling, Japanese Yen and US dollar during 2008 to 2010. Further, forward premium or discount is calculated and interpret in the study with time series data and ordinary least square (OLS) regression methodologies. It was found that, the unbiased expectation hypothesis and international interest parity holds for Japan-US case but does not hold for Japan-UK case. Finally, the purchasing Power Parity (PPP) holds for both two cases, which is varies with most previous literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{current high}} {{exchange}} rate volatility {{in the face of}} globalization, underpinned by growing trade and financial and commodity markets liberalization has attracted the resurgence of considerable interest from both financial economists and policy makers, into the validity of international <b>parity</b> <b>relationships.</b> Using multivariate cointegration framework and long run structural modelling, this paper investigates the evidence in support of two of the <b>parity</b> <b>relationships</b> that underpin either implicitly or explicitly much of international macroeconomics. The first is the purchasing power parity (PPP) hypothesis or the theorem that there exists an invariable long-run equilibrium real exchange rate. The second is the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) theorem, a hypothesis, which implies that yields of domestic and foreign financial assets (real interest rates) can differ only by the expected change in the price of foreign exchange. These tests are conducted on 8 of the 14 SADC economies using South Africa and United States as numeraires for the post- Bretton era; for the intra-continental and the intercontinental approaches respectively. All tests generally suggest that regardless of the approach used, there is significant evidence supporting cointegration, when the PPP is tested in its simple form and when the joint PPP and UIP hypothesis is tested. Except for a few countries, results are less favourable when the simple UIP is tested. We are therefore able to conclude that the simple PPP and joint PPP and UIP variables are cointegrated or that they do move together in the long-run for most countries indicating that the propositions are valid. However, most of the estimated cointegrating vectors rejected the restrictions of symmetry and proportionality implied by the PPP and UIP theories. With the simple UIP our conclusion is that support is sample dependent as the UIP generally holds only for those countries with very strong economic ties and whose currencies are pegged one to one...|$|R
