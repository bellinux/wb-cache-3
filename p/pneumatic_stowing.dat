The following techniques, such as containerized deposition, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>stowing,</b> pumped filling, and bulk material stowage are investigated for the types of remainders specified in the catalogue of the working group 'Waste' of the Laender (Laenderarbeitsgemeinschaft Abfall). The investigations cover the techniques and remainders used for backfilling purposes to reduce subsidence or to prevent rock bursts, respectively. Furthermore, they include the disposal of waste in an underground deposit. (orig.)
