5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen</b> Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; {{in fact it is}} so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species for the presence of the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen</b> that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a toxic protein and an RNA antitoxin. The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the ToxIN system from the bacterial <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen</b> Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E
40|$|Water {{used for}} the {{irrigation}} of plants {{has the potential to}} harbour and spread <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> yet little research is conducted within this field. This review was undertaken to critically review our understanding of water-borne fungal and oomycete <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> in open irrigation systems, particularly in the context of plant biosecurity. It was determined that very limited data exists on these <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens,</b> with the majority of previous studies only recording pathogen presence. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of pathogen survival and spread, and very limited information on their ability to cause disease when contaminated irrigation water is applied to crops. This review has highlighted the need for new research on the epidemiology and pathogenicity of putative <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> isolated from water, in order to determine their risk to crops. The importance of regular monitoring of irrigation systems for the early detection of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> is also discussed...|$|R
30|$|Currently {{available}} commercial cellulases and xylanases {{have been}} sourced mostly from saprophytic organisms. It {{is well established}} that <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> produce array of diverse extracellular hydrolytic and cell wall degrading enzymes which serve as important key virulence factors and help <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> in invading the plant tissues and {{play an important role}} in pathogenesis. Recently, King et al., [43] screened and identified 348 unique isolates representing 156 species of plant pathogenic fungi with hydrolytic profile more active than Trichoderma. There is genomic evidence of lignocellulosic cell wall degrading enzymes in <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and full genome sequencing of a number of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> has revealed often large complex and redundant enzyme systems for degradation of cell walls.|$|R
40|$|The rise in {{international}} trade of plants and plant products has increased the risk of introduction and spread of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and pests. in addition, new risks are arising from the implementation of more environmentally friendly methods of biodegradable waste disposal, such as composting and anaerobic digestion. As these disposal methods do not involve sterilisation, there is good evidence that certain <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and pests can survive these processes. The temperature/time profile of the disposal process {{is the most significant}} and easily defined factor in controlling <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and pests. In this review, the current evidence for temperature/time effects on <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and pests is summarised. The advantages and disadvantages of direct and indirect process validation for the verification of composting processes, to determine their efficacy in destroying <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and pests in biowaste, are discussed. The availability of detection technology and its appropriateness for assessing the survival of quarantine organisms is also reviewed. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Urnula craterium is {{a species}} of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It is {{parasitic}} on oak and various other hardwood species; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on dead wood after it has fallen to the ground. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have earned it the common names devil's urn and the gray urn. The distribution of U.craterium includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U.craterium is a <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen</b> known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a canker disease of oak and several other hardwood tree species.|$|E
5|$|Several pivotal {{discoveries in}} biology {{were made by}} {{researchers}} using fungi as model organisms, that is, fungi that grow and sexually reproduce rapidly in the laboratory. For example, the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis was formulated by scientists using the bread mold Neurospora crassa to test their biochemical theories. Other important model fungi are Aspergillus nidulans and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, each of which {{with a long history}} of use to investigate issues in eukaryotic cell biology and genetics, such as cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and gene regulation. Other fungal models have more recently emerged that address specific biological questions relevant to medicine, plant pathology, and industrial uses; examples include Candida albicans, a dimorphic, opportunistic human pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea, a <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen,</b> and Pichia pastoris, a yeast widely used for eukaryotic protein production.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen</b> infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E

40|$|Insects {{and other}} {{arthropods}} {{are the most}} important vectors of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens.</b> The majority of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> are disseminated by arthropod vectors such as aphids, beetles, leafhoppers, planthoppers, thrips and whiteflies. Transmission of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and the challenges in managing insect vectors due to insecticide resistance are factors that contribute to major food losses in agriculture. RNA interference (RNAi) was recently suggested as a promising strategy for controlling insect pests, including those that serve as important vectors for <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens.</b> The last decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in the functional analysis of insect genes, especially those whose silencing results in mortality or interference with pathogen transmission. The identification of such candidates poses a major challenge for increasing the role of RNAi in pest control. Another challenge is to understand the RNAi machinery in insect cells and whether components that were identified in other organisms are also present in insect. This review will focus on summarizing success cases in which RNAi was used for silencing genes in insect vector for <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens,</b> and will be particularly helpful for vector biologists...|$|R

25|$|In plants, {{nitric oxide}} can be {{produced}} by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase, (although the existence of animal NOS homologs in plants is debated), (ii) plasma membrane-bound nitrate reductase, (iii) mitochondrial electron transport chain, or (iv) non-enzymatic reactions. It is a signaling molecule, acts mainly against oxidative stress and also {{plays a role in}} <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen</b> interactions.

25|$|Ceratobasidium cornigerum is {{a species}} of fungus in the order Cantharellales. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are thin, spread on the {{substrate}} out like a film (effused) and web-like. A Rhizoctonia-like anamorphic state, sometimes referred to the genus Ceratorhiza, is frequently obtained when isolates are cultured. Ceratobasidium cornigerum is saprotrophic, but is also a facultative <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen,</b> causing a number of economically important crop diseases, and an orchid endomycorrhizal associate. The species is genetically diverse and is sometimes treated as a complex of closely related taxa.|$|E

40|$|Many {{species of}} fungi and oomycetes are <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> of great {{economic}} importance. Over the past 7 years, the genomes {{of more than}} 30 of these filamentous <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> have been sequenced, revealing remarkable diversity in genome size and architecture. Whereas the genomes of many parasites and bacterial symbionts have been reduced over time, the genomes of several lineages of filamentous <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> have been shaped by repeat-driven expansions. In these lineages, the genes encoding proteins involved in host interactions are frequently polymorphic and reside within repeat-rich regions of the genome. Here, we review the properties of these adaptable genome regions and the mechanisms underlying their plasticity, and we illustrate cases in which genome plasticity {{has contributed to the}} emergence of new virulence traits. We also discuss how genome expansions may have {{had an impact on the}} co-evolutionary conflict between these filamentous <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and their hosts...|$|R
40|$|The {{durability}} of a control method for plant protection {{is defined as}} the persistence of its efficacy in space and time. It depends on (i) the selection pressure exerted by it on populations of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> and (ii) on the capacity of these pathogens to adapt to the control method. Erosion of effectiveness of conventional plant protection methods has been widely studied in the past. For example, apparition of resistance to chemical pesticides in <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> or pests has been extensively documented. The {{durability of}} biological control has often been assumed to be higher than that of chemical control. Results concerning pest management in agricultural systems have shown that this assumption may not always be justified. Resistance of various pests to one or several toxins of Bacillus thuringensis and apparition of resistance of the codling moth Cydia pomonella to the Cydia pomonella granulovirus have, for example, been described. In contrast with the situation for pests, the durability of biological control of plant diseases has hardly been studied and no scientific reports proving the loss of efficiency of biological control agents against <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> in practice has been published so far. Knowledge concerning the possible erosion of effectiveness of biological control is essential to ensure a durable efficacy of biological control agents on target <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens.</b> This knowledge will result in identifying risk factors that can foster the selection of strains of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> resistant to biological control agents. It will also result in identifying types of biological control agents with lower risk of efficacy loss i. e. modes of action of biological control agents that does not favor the selection of resistant isolates in natural populations of <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens.</b> An analysis of the scientific literature was then conducted to assess the potential for <b>plant</b> <b>pathogens</b> to become resistant to biological control agents...|$|R

25|$|The disease triangle, {{consisting}} of host, environment, and pathogen, {{is an important}} concept, {{especially in regards to}} plant pathology. In this case, the pathogen is Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Agrobacteria have the widest host range of any <b>plant</b> <b>pathogen,</b> so the main factor to take into consideration in the case of crown gall is environment. There are various conditions and factors that make for a conducive environment for A. tumefaciens when infecting its various hosts. For example, the bacterium requires the host plant to be wounded, as this is where the invasion occurs. Factors leading to wounds in plants include cultural practices, grafting, freezing injury, growth cracks, soil insects, and other animals in the environment causing damage to the plant. Thus, in exceptionally harsh winters, it's common to have an increased incidence of crown gall due to the weather-related damage. Along with this, there are methods of mediating infection of the host plant. For example, nematodes can act as a vector to introduce Agrobacterium into plant roots.|$|E
