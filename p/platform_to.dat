5|$|The Mundo Perdido is to {{the west}} of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It is the largest {{ceremonial}} complex dating from the Preclassic period at Tikal. The complex was organized as a large E-Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a <b>platform</b> <b>to</b> the east that supported three temples. The Mundo Perdido complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history. By AD 250300 its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, including the use of the talud-tablero form. During the Early Classic period (c. 250600) the Mundo Perdido became one of the twin foci of the city, the other being the North Acropolis. From AD 250 to 378 it may have served as the royal necropolis. The Mundo Perdido complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small <b>platform</b> <b>to</b> the west of it.|$|E
