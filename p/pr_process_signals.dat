The copper lining is produced by periodic current reversal electroforming with a low copper-content acid copper sulfate bath containing the specified amount of chloride ions (<b>PR</b> <b>process).</b> Deposit by <b>PR</b> <b>process</b> has the same value of IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard) as oxygen-free copper, and has higher breakdown field at first breakdown than the deposit by conventional types of electroformings.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{heuristic}} method which {{is applied to}} solving the mixed <b>process</b> <b>signal</b> separation problem is presented. Based on a stochastic searching technique, the proposed method performs simultaneously the estimation of the demixing and corresponding second moment (covariance) matrices so as to separate mixed <b>process</b> <b>signals</b> arising from several original sources. It hinges on one of state-of-theart evolutionary algorithms, termed differential evolution (DE) that is particularly devised for continues optimization. In the context of signal separation, the presented method could seek efficiently and reliably the optimal estimate of the demixing matrix for the mixed <b>process</b> <b>signals,</b> such as including autoregressive (AR) series, step change in process mean, and Gaussian noises. Following the proposed approach, the blind signal separation framework can be posed as a nonlinear mixed signal problem, where only the demixing matrix appear as unknowns.

30|$|Partial {{reconfiguration}} process {{needs time}} to be achieved which leads to an interruption in the hardware chain. Compared to the parallel implementation design, PR design decreases the overall hardware resources and power consumption. On the other hand, the reconfiguration time {{must be considered in}} PR design compared to parallel design one. The additional reconfiguration time is related {{to the size of the}} reconfigurable module. The configuration controller, proposed in our design, handles the data flow during the partial reconfiguration process as explained above. FIFOs implemented between the reconfigurable modules buffer the data flow during the <b>PR</b> <b>process</b> without causing an interruption at the upper layers. In case of switching between multiple wireless standards, there are two possible designs as explained before. In MRBA, the system is formed by multiple small reconfigurable blocks. However, in ORBA, the system includes only one large reconfigurable block. In both designs, the reconfiguration time is acceptable since the handover between multiple wireless standards depends also on signaling from the upper layers. To avoid losing any data, a FIFO buffers data from the upper layer until the <b>PR</b> <b>process</b> is achieved.|$|R

Students were guided through the collaborative inquiry process to develop research questions and a hypothesis, design research methods and materials, conduct data collection and analysis, and present their findings.

40|$|AbstractThe pattern {{recognition}} (<b>PR)</b> <b>process</b> uses {{a large number}} of labelled patterns and compute intensive algorithms. Several components of a <b>PR</b> <b>process</b> are compute and data intensive. Some algorithms compute the parameters required for classication directly for each test pattern using a large training set. Most algorithms have a training step, the results of which are used by a computationally cheap classication step. In this paper, we present high-performance {{pattern recognition}} algorithms using a commodity Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Our algorithms exploit the high-performance SIMD architecture of GPU. We specically study the Parzen windows scheme for density estimation and the Articial Neural Network (ANN) scheme for training and classication in this paper. We present fast implementations of these on a NVIDIA 8800 GTX GPU. Our implementation of Parzen windows can simultaneously estimate probability values for 1 K test patterns in about 14 ms based on an input data set of 16 K patterns. Our ANN can run an epoch of batch-training on the NIST data set with 56 K 484 -dimensional patterns and 10 output categories in less than 200 milliseconds. The speedup is more than 300 times for Parzen windows and 100 times for ANN over the CPU implementations using a commodity GPU that costs about $ 400. I...|$|R
40|$|Drivers' perception-cognition-response {{mechanism}} {{before the}} hazards developing into actual crashes {{is a key}} issue of driving safety. Previous explanations on this topic are generally based on the perception-response (<b>PR)</b> <b>process</b> or risk-homeostasis (RH) mechanism. However, a micro-description and related evidences as the bridge between the existing theoretical frameworks are limited. In order to generate {{a better understanding of}} crash development, the present study examined the visual perception, electrodermal activity and behavioral responses in a uniformed hazardous situation during simulator driving. Ninety-seven drivers were recruited to complete a pre-defined driving task containing a baseline scenario and a paired hazard scenario. The results demonstrated that the crash and no-crash drivers showed similar performances in terms of PR time. However, two driver groups showed differed hazard anticipation (indicated by aroused electrodermal activity) and demonstrated distinguishable driving behaviors (measured by gas pedal, velocity and time-to-collision) before the hazard was visually detected. These findings evidenced the anticipatory risk perception and the subsequent concurrent functions of the RH mechanism and <b>PR</b> <b>process</b> at the critical moment before the occurrence of possible crashes. Therefore, a fused RH/PR framework was proposed to describe the drivers' control loop during crash avoidance. Accordingly, several interventions were suggested to reduce crash risk.

40|$|Thesis (M. Psyc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. This study {{engaged in}} a micro-genetic {{analysis}} (Wertsch, 1984) of facilitation in participatory research (PR). The research conducted in this study explored the facilitation process of two facilitators using two participatory techniques (a 'road of life' technique and a ranking exercise) with children in a rural context. The facilitators' perceptions of facilitation and their experiences of facilitating a PR technique were examined {{through the use of}} individual interviews, and were analysed using a reading guide method (Mergendollar, 1989). Of particular concern was that in PR, there is no account of the mechanisms which bring about successful facilitation. This study exposed how some PR techniques, like the ranking exercise can simply be implemented through using a set of instructions, but other kinds of techniques such as the 'road of life' technique are inherently embedded in the principles of PR and are more difficult to implement. A lack of an understanding of the PR principles has major consequences for the implementation of <b>PR</b> <b>processes,</b> and whether or not <b>PR</b> <b>processes</b> achieve their aim i. e. critical reflection. The importance of training in PR was thus emphasised, and the importance of providing a theoretical framework of the facilitation <b>process</b> in <b>PR</b> was accentuated...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to explore {{possibilities}} of implementing low-cost instruments such as spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes by applying Digital Alias-free Signal Processing (DASP) techniques. For most of signal processing tasks where traditional DSP is applied the information of bandwidth of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is required to be known. Here the sampling rate is decided {{to be at least}} twice the actual bandwidth of the signal. However, there are cases where the exact bandwidth information of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is unknown or the reconstructibility of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is not needed. Then this demand on sampling rates leads to oversampling of the analysed signal. Review of literature shows that application of DASP is an ideal solution on this issue. In comparison with traditional DSP, DASP does not require the exact bandwidth information of the signal and can still <b>process</b> the analysed <b>signals</b> for different signal processing tasks at lower sampling rates such as sub-Nyquist, even sub-Landau rates. Therefore the work reported in this thesis concentrates on the investigation of DASP techniques for reducing the costs of contemporary instruments.

EMD is a data-driven approach that does not use a fixed set of basis functions, but is self-adaptive according to the <b>processed</b> <b>signal.</b> It decomposes a signal into finite, well-defined, low-frequency and high-frequency components known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) or modes.|$|R
