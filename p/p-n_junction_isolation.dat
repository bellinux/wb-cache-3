40|$|With the {{anticipation}} of increasing system demands, the need to integrate multiple functions (e. g. digital, analog, high voltage, etc.) on a single chip has become apparent. PICs (power integrated circuits), which combine high-voltage, high-current output devices with low-voltage logic and control elements, have provided better performance and reliability, and reduced cost and system size compared to the discrete approach. A major issue {{for the design of}} this kind of circuits is the substrate cross-talk between adjacent power and CMOS devices, which prevents normal operation of the circuits. The issue becomes more severe in automotive applications, in which a high temperature environment is usually involved. The commonly used isolation techniques in PICs are the traditional <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> <b>isolation</b> (JI) and the dielectric isolation (DI). But JI still requires large silicon area, and the electrical isolation is rather poor.

In this thesis, a novel isolation structure with ultra-deep trench and backside etching is proposed. It can achieve complete isolation with low wafer cost, reduced isolation area, and high heat dissipation capability. First, the design and operation of the novel isolation structure as well as the 2 -D device and thermal simulation results is discussed. Then, the layout design and fabrication process for experimental characterization of the novel isolation structure are presented. Finally, experimental techniques for characterizing the electrical and thermal performance of the devices in both the novel isolation structure and SOl are presented. The simulation and experimental results show that the novel isolation structure can provide complete isolation as that of the SOl isolation structure, but with an average of 26 % improvement on heat capability during the power device turn-off transient with short gate pulse duration. After the system is heated more, the heat capability of the novel isolation structure is not as good as that of the SOI isolation structure due to the low thermal conductivity of the air gap underneath the power device.

Thin monocrystalline silicon solar cell could be reduce the cost but lost the absorption efficiency. Surface texturing help to enhance absorption.

In first step we concentrate on <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> position impact by modeling. Approach: The effect of position of <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> on the output current for both micro rectangular texturing and planer surface in solar cell has been investigated by ray tracing. Modeling of nine pairs solar cells with the same texture and planer surfaces but with different <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> position are done by using Atlas software.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical investigation of recombination at grain boundaries in both bulk and <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> regions of silicon solar cells. Previous models of grain boundaries and grain boundary properties are reviewed. A two dimensional numerical model of grain boundary recombination {{is presented in}} this paper. This numerical model is compared to existing analytical models of grain boundary recombination within both bulk and <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> regions of silicon solar cells. This analysis shows that, under some conditions, existing models poorly predict the recombination current at grain boundaries. Within bulk regions of a device, the effective surface recombination velocity at grain boundaries is overestimated {{in cases where the}} region around the grain boundary is not fully depleted of majority carriers. For vertical grain boundaries (columnar grains), existing models are shown to underestimate the recombination current within <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depletion regions. This current has an ideality factor of about 1. 8. An improved analytical model for grain boundary recombination within the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depletion region is presented. This model considers the effect of the grain boundary charge on the electric field within the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> depletion region. The grain boundary charge reduces the <b>p-n</b> <b>junction</b> electric field, at the grain boundary, enhancing recombination in this region. This model is in agreement with the numerical results over a wide range of grain boundary recombination rates.

The class of solar cells based on a <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> {{is the first of}} its evolution and, therefore, are typically called first-generation solar cells [11, 12]. Semiconductors, either elemental such as Si or Ge or compounds such as GaAs or InP, are materials of choice to build <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> solar cells. Photoexcited carriers in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> are separated into mobile carriers by the built-in-electric field, or band bending, at the junction between the p- and the n-type semiconductors [12, 13, 14]. The photovoltage in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> is the difference in quasi-Fermi levels (i.e., the band bending) of n-type and p-type regions. A typical device consists of a 5  μm-long n-type semiconductor and 300  μm-long p-type ones, i.e., the minority carriers in the <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> are expected to travel ~ 300  μm for efficient charge collection, which requires rigorous control on their chemical purity [12, 15]. Requirement of such extreme purity of the semiconductors {{is one of the major}} cost limiters of the first-generation solar cells. The <b>p–n</b> <b>junctions</b> are typically built on single crystalline and polycrystalline platforms. The latter polycrystalline overcomes the cost limitations on chemical purity, however, at the expense of the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) [14, 16]. Whether or not a <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> is made from single or polycrystals, inherent limitations between the absorption and electron emission in those crystals put a theoretical limit on the photovoltaic conversion efficiency in <b>p–n</b> <b>junction</b> solar cells, known as a Schokely–Queisser limit.

The photocurrent exhibits a strong polarization dependence and is explained by electric rectification in <b>p-n</b> <b>junctions...</b>|$|R
