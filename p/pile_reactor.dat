At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick pressed for resources {{to build a nuclear}} reactor at what is now known as the Chalk River Laboratories. Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project, but the United States had to supply the heavy water. At that time, the United States controlled, by a supply contract, the only major production site on the continent, that of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company at Trail, British Columbia.

Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required, but with certain restrictions. The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor would they be given any information about plutonium.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of composting as disposal practice of husk mixed with olive mill wastewaters (OMW) was {{studied in the}} present research. The process was investigated with regards to some reliable and easy to be determined microbial activity parameters such as the ATP content, the activity of a pool of enzymes and the viable counts, keeping in mind the well known bias of this last technique. Two different composting technologies were compared: static <b>pile</b> and <b>reactor</b> by studying the cured composts obtained. Among the bioindicators tested, the composting process trend was described better by the ATP content and the activity of some enzymes. In fact, the ATP content showed an increase during the thermophilic phase in both the <b>pile</b> and the <b>reactor,</b> and decreased {{at the end of}} the process, it was also higher in the bioreactor-pile technology than in the pile. With regard to the enzymatic activity, with the reactor technology experiment, two peaks were evidenced in the thermophilic phase and during the curing phase in pile, and a drop during the transfer of material from the <b>reactor</b> to the <b>pile.</b> The quality of the cured product obtained using the reactor technology has been evaluated considering phytoxicity and hygienic features: the stabilised compost resulted to have neither phytoxical effect, nor faecal indicator contaminants...|$|R
50|$|The Nuclear {{industry}} (as {{distinct from}} the uranium industry) in Canada dates back to 1942 when a joint British-Canadian laboratory {{was set up in}} Montreal, Quebec, under the administration of the National Research Council of Canada, to develop a design for a heavy-water nuclear reactor. This reactor was called National Research Experimental and would be the most powerful research reactor in the world when completed. In the meantime, in 1944, approval was given to proceed with the construction of the smaller ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental <b>Pile)</b> test <b>reactor</b> at Chalk River, Ontario and on September 5, 1945 at 3:45 p.m., the 10 Watt ZEEP successfully achieved the first self-sustained nuclear reaction outside the United States.

50|$|In 1971, {{after the}} Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Chaudhry {{returned}} to Pakistan and joined Government College University. In January 1972, Salam sent a telegram to Chaudhry {{asking him to}} come to Multan in a shortest time possible. Chaudhry represented the HTL's delegation at the Multan Meeting, convened by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. During the meeting, Chaudhry spoke, as he said: I was perhaps the only one among the scientists who had seen an actual atom bomb. Chaudhry was immediately posted at PINSTECH institute, where he was made director of Radiation Physics Division (RPD). Chaudhry was among one of the senior scientists that built the first nuclear <b>pile</b> PARR-II <b>reactor</b> at Pinstech. Under Chaudhry, the RPD scientists engaged in research in radiation physics.|$|R
5000|$|Articles from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{indicate}} that the term stands for [...] "safety cut rope axe man", referring in that case to the early neutronic safety mechanism of using a person equipped with an axe to cut the rope suspending the control rods over the Chicago <b>Pile</b> nuclear <b>reactor,</b> {{at which point the}} rods would fall by gravity into the reactor core, shutting the reactor down. Specifically, Wallace Koehler, a technician working for the Manhattan Project at Chicago Pile 1, under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, and later a research physicist at ORNL, reportedly said that Enrico Fermi coined the term as this acronym. Although Koehler did not serve as a rope-cutting control rod axe-man, he was responsible for dumping a bucket of aqueous cadmium solution into the reactor if reactor period entered into the sub-optimal range.|$|R
50|$|The {{form and}} {{location}} of the moderator can greatly influence the cost and safety of a reactor. Classically, moderators were precision-machined blocks of high purity graphite with embedded ducting to carry away heat. They were in the hottest part of the reactor, and therefore subject to corrosion and ablation. In some materials, including graphite, {{the impact of the}} neutrons with the moderator can cause the moderator to accumulate dangerous amounts of Wigner energy. This problem led to the infamous Windscale fire at the Windscale <b>Piles,</b> a nuclear <b>reactor</b> complex in the United Kingdom, in 1957.|$|R
50|$|The reactor was unsalvageable; where possible, {{the fuel}} rods were removed, and the reactor bioshield was sealed and left intact. Approximately 6,700 fire-damaged fuel {{elements}} and 1,700 fire-damaged isotope cartridges {{remain in the}} <b>pile.</b> The damaged <b>reactor</b> core was still slightly warm {{as a result of}} continuing nuclear reactions. Windscale Pile 2, though undamaged by the fire, was considered too unsafe for continued use. It was shut down shortly afterwards. No air-cooled reactors have been built since. The final removal of fuel from the damaged reactor was scheduled to begin in 2008 and continue for a further four years.|$|R
500|$|On 24 August 1944, the {{decision}} was taken to build a small reactor {{in order to test}} the Montreal Laboratory's calculations relating to such matters as lattice dimensions, sheathing materials, and control rods, before proceeding with the full-scale NRX reactor. This was named ZEEP, for Zero Energy Experimental <b>Pile.</b> Building <b>reactors</b> in downtown Montreal was out of the question; the Canadians selected, and Groves approved, a site at Chalk River, Ontario, on the south bank of the Ottawa River some [...] north west of Ottawa. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945, becoming the first operating nuclear reactor outside the United States. The larger NRX followed on 21 July 1947. With five times the neutron flux of any other reactor, it was the most powerful research reactor in the world. Originally designed in July 1944 with an output of 8 MW, the power was raised to 10 MW through design changes such as replacing uranium rods clad in stainless steel and cooled by heavy water with aluminium-clad rods cooled by light water.|$|R

At the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology, {{he was assigned}} to the Nuclear Chemistry Division led by Iqbal Hussain Qureshi. In 1974, Majeed was a part of Munir Ahmad Khan's team that had supervised the criticality of second nuclear <b>pile</b> —PARR-II <b>reactor.</b> After the construction of the third nuclear pile—PARR-III, also known as The New-Labs; Majeed was the first technical director, and was part of a team that supervised the reactor's criticality. An expert plutonium technology, Majeed, as junior scientist, is known for his contribution in plutonium reprocessing plant and the plutonium nuclear fuel cycle technology. Majeed was also a part of a team at the New Labs that had succeeded to attain the fresh supplies of weapon-grade plutonium isotopes, produced by the reactor. In 1990, Majeed was promoted and was made Director-general of Nuclear Chemistry Division (NCD) by Munir Ahmad Khan. Throughout the 1990s, Majeed was responsible for underground work of nuclear reactors Khushab-I and CHASNUPP-I commercial nuclear power plant. There, he was the director of Radiation and Nuclear Safety Division and was omitted from the weapons development teams.|$|R

It was later reconfigured for the dismantlement of the Argonne National Laboratory Chicago <b>Pile</b> No. 5 <b>reactor</b> vessel as the crane-deployed dual arm work platform. Development staff worked along side operations staff during {{a significant part of the}} deployment to provide training, maintenance, and tooling support.

5000|$|The entire reactor {{assembly}} {{was placed}} in a large pressure vessel. Due {{to the size of the}} <b>pile,</b> only the <b>reactor</b> core itself was placed within the steel pressure assembly, which was then surrounded by a concrete confinement building (or [...] "biological shield"). As there was no water in the core, and thus no possibility of a steam explosion, the building was able to tightly wrap the pressure vessel, which helped reduce construction costs. In order to keep the size of the confinement building down, the early Magnox designs placed the heat exchanger for the CO2 gas outside the dome, connected through piping. Due to suspended particles of the reactor fuel and moderator in the gas, this causes the system to [...] "shine" [...] with gamma rays and neutrons.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} and flow rate are estimated of chimney gases emitted from the accidental {{fire in the}} <b>Pile</b> 1 nuclear <b>reactor</b> at the Windscale Works in October 1957. These {{are used in the}} study of the atmospheric dispersion of the chimney plume and of the radionuclides in it. The accident was one of great physical complexity, compounded by the fact that the number of installed sensors was, by modern standards, rather limited. Sophisticated computer modelling (CFD) is now available. However, the scope for validation in a one-off accident is limited. The mathematical simulation of the accident presented here is based on physically acceptable assumptions, chosen to represent a realistic worst case. These give a chimney gas temperature of 577 °C and a corresponding flow rate of 416 kg s- 1. The uncertainties in these quantities are assessed in a sensitivity study...|$|R

40|$|Microbial biofilm {{development}} was followed under growth {{conditions similar to}} those of a projected salinity power plant. Microscope glass cover slips were <b>piled</b> in biofilm <b>reactors</b> to imitate the membrane stacks in such a plant. A staining technique closely correlating absorbance values with biofilm dry weight was used for the study. Generally, the biofilms consisted of solitary and filamentous bacteria which were evenly distributed with considerable amounts of various protozoa and entrapped debris of organic origin. Protozoa predation was shown to decrease the amount of biofilm produced. The biofilm development lag phase was longer at lower temperatures. The subsequent growth phase was approximately arithmetic until stationary phase appeared. Adaptation of a hyperbolic saturation function gave curves that agreed well with the logarithm of the amount of biofilm as a function of time. Increased flow velocity, temperature, and nutrient concentration increased the biofilm production rate. An exponential relationship was shown between biofilm production rate and flow velocity within the range of 0 to 15 cm s− 1. Intervals in which the biofilms were exposed to fresh water decreased the biofilm production rate more than four times. If the cover slips were inoculated with untreated seawater for 24 h, subsequent UV treatment had an insignificant effect on the biofilm formation...|$|R

Following shutdown of the reactor in 1968, the ducts and fue l transfer canal collected water and were a potential source of contamination to the soils beneath the facility. Thus, thorough subsurface soil characterization is required to determine the location and extent of potential contamination to facilitate appropriate remedial action planning for the below grade facilities and surrounding soils. The characterization approach used in this project integrates several innovative technologies to provide improved characterization and data interpretation. The innovative technologies {{include the use of}} a small footprint Geoprobe to install sampling ports in the soil and beneath the buildings, perfluorocarbon gas tracers (PFTs) to define the leak pathways, three-dimensional (3 -D) visualization tools to investigate the data, the In Situ Object Counting System (ISOCS), for rapid field gamma surveys of soil samples, and BetaScint, for beta surveying of soil samples. A Frisch chamber alpha-spectroscopy device will be used for alpha-emitting radionuclides. Initial data and analysis from the PFT leak detection study are presented. The outcome of the data analysis is a three-dimensional (3 -D) visualization of the potential leak pathways from the below grade ducts. The information from the PFT study will be used to optimize subsurface soil data collection in the second phase of this program. In addition, subsurface soil characterization data beneath the Fuel transfer Canal House are presented...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} the laboratory scale thermal oxidation of nuclear graphite, as a proof-of-concept {{for the treatment}} and decommissioning of reactor cores on a larger industrial scale. If showed to be effective, this technology could have promising international significance with a considerable impact on the nuclear waste management problem currently facing many countries worldwide. The use of thermal treatment of such graphite waste is seen as advantageous since it will decouple {{the need for an}} operational Geological Disposal Facility (GDF). Particulate samples of Magnox <b>Reactor</b> <b>Pile</b> Grade-A (PGA) graphite, were oxidised in both air and 60 % O 2, over the temperature range 400 - 1200 °C. Oxidation rates were found to increase with temperature, with a particular rise between 700 - 800 °C, suggesting a change in oxidation mechanism. A second increase in oxidation rate was observed between 1000 - 1200 °C and was found to correspond to a large increase in the CO/CO 2 ratio, as confirmed through gas analysis. Increasing the oxidant flow rate gave a linear increase in oxidation rate, up to a certain point, and maximum rates of 23. 3 and 69. 6 mg / min for air and 60 % O 2 respectively were achieved at a flow of 250 ml / min and temperature of 1000 °C. These promising results show that large-scale thermal treatment could be a potential option for the decommissioning of graphite cores, although the design of the plant would need careful consideration in order to achieve optimum efficiency and throughput...|$|R
40|$|The BGRR was the world's first {{nuclear reactor}} {{dedicated}} to the peaceful exploration of atomic energy. The <b>reactor</b> <b>pile</b> consisted of a 700 -ton, 25 -foot cube of graphite fueled by uranium. A total of 1, 369 fuel channels were available with roughly half in use at any given time. Insertion and removal of boron steel control rods controlled reactor power levels. One or more of five fans powered air-cooling. Air was brought in through two filtered plenums, flowed through and around the reactor core, through an exhaust duct containing filters, and finally out through the 320 -foot high exhaust stack. Spent fuel was temporarily stored in the spent-fuel canal, and then sent to the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS). Access to the canal for removing spent fuel was through the Canal House (Building 709). The BGRR ceased operation in 1968 and {{was placed in a}} shutdown mode in which all fuel was removed and sent to SRS. Penetrations in the biological shield around the graphite cube and fuel channels were sealed. The final decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) process was initiated in 1999 and is scheduled for completion in 2005. An accelerated schedule was developed that combines characterization with removal actions for the various systems and structures.
