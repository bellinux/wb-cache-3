25|$|Jumping {{is a very}} strenuous {{activity}} that places high physical demands on the horse. The <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> affect the suspensory apparatuses of the hind legs during take-off and the forelegs during landing, though the galloping and turning associated with jumping also place torque on the joints. Most injuries, chronic or acute, begin with strain; as structures in the horse's body absorb the shock of take-off and landing, they acquire small amounts of damage. Over time, this damage leads to inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and ligaments (desmitis). The most common injuries in the forelimb occur to the interosseous ligaments and the superficial digital flexor tendons and less commonly, the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon. Strain on the superficial digital flexors is greater when jumping higher fences, so horses {{may no longer be}} suitable for competitive jumping after damaging that apparatus.|$|E

40|$|If {{the load}} is not {{relieved}} as a structure starts to yield, the induced stress {{is defined as}} primary stress. If the load relaxes, as a structure begins yield the induced stress is defined as secondary stress. In design {{it is not uncommon}} to give more weight to <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> than to secondary stresses. However, knowing when this is good design practice and when it is not good design practice represents a problem. In particular, the fuel plates in operating reactors contain both <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> and secondary stresses and to properly assess a design there is a need to assign design weights to the stresses. Tests were conducted on reactor fuel plates intended for the Advanced Neutron Source (ANS) to determine the potential of giving different design weights to the primary and secondary stresses. The results of these tests and the conclusion that the stresses should be weighted the same are given in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{pressure}} vessel {{is one of}} a large number of plant components for which stress analyses must be performed. A {{pressure vessel}} experiences mainly two types of stresses, <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> and secondary stresses. <b>Primary</b> <b>stresses</b> are because of pressure inside pressure vessel and secondary stresses are because of thermal loading. Thermal loading is considerable in a pressure vessel which handles hot fluid. Typically liquid metal reactors (LMR) have thermo-mechanical loadings. Analytically, induced stresses are calculated using pressure vessel theory or ASME codes. In this project induced stresses are calculated using ANSYS coupled field analysis for thermo-mechanical loading. The results are then compared with analytical results. This work demonstrates usage of commercial FEA tool over analytical approach. Analytical solutions such as ASME and Japanese Code give empirical relationships to calculate thermal stress. Use of FEA tools is not very popular in pressure vessel industries. FEA of this kind of loading requires coupled field analysis. In the work ANSYS is used to perform coupled field analysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Masonry is {{a complex}} {{multicomponent}} composite consisting of dissimilar materials (brick / stone and mortar). Masonry deformation process under loading depends on the mechanical characteristics of the basic composite materials, {{as well as of}} the parameters of the elements defining binding between brick and mortar being the interface elements. Traditional methods of masonry modeling are based on the use of generalized ("effective") mechanical properties of the composite as a continuant homogeneous continuant medium. This paper presents an overview and analysis of continuant masonry models adequately reflecting the process of elastic, and in some cases elastic-plastic masonry deformation within the composition of stone structural elements. The paper provides analysis of the experimental research results of masonry behaviour in a biaxial stress state at <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> of opposite signs; identifies masonry destruction mechanisms complying with the conditions of stress state. The work demonstrates the key role played by interface elements in the formation of masonry destruction processes. Based on destruction mechanisms deduced from experiments, there was developed a discrete model of masonry. A system of masonry strength criteria was proposed corresponding to the biaxial stress state conditions at <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> of opposite signs. For purposes of studying the elastic-plastic deformation and destruction of masonry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The life of any living {{organism}} {{can be defined}} as a hurdle due to different kind of stresses. As with all {{living organism}}s, plants are exposed to various abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, extreme temperatures and chemical toxicity. These <b>primary</b> <b>stresses</b> are often interconnected, and lead to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants, which are highly reactive and toxic and cause damage to proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and DNA, which ultimately results in oxidative stress. Stress-induced ROS accumulation is counteracted by enzymatic antioxidant systems and non-enzymatic low molecular weight metabolites, such as ascorbate, glutathione and α-tocopherol. The above mentioned low molecular weight antioxidants are also capable of chelating metal ions, reducing thus their catalytic activity to form ROS and also scavenge them. Hence, in plant cells, this triad of low molecular weight antioxidants (ascorbate, glutathione and α-tocopherol) form an important part of abiotic stress response. In this work we are presenting a review of abiotic stress responses connected to these antioxidants...|$|E

The specimens consisted in sheets of steel and CFRP as substrates on which the newly developed patches with embedded piezo electric foils and fibres were glued (Fig. 4). In the quasistatic bending tests the performance of each sensor was characterised by measuring the sensor signal (charge) as a function of strain before and after cycling.

These design choices were made after considering a number of alternative structural concepts {{and a variety of}} conductor materials. FIRE's high elongation and double null plasma results in high overturning moments. The use of a large compression ring and the large centering forces provides adequate frictional wedging pressures to support the inner leg out-of-plane (OOP) forces.
