25|$|If the {{government}} {{agrees that the}} changes are worthwhile, a Bill is drafted, usually by <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Counsel.</b> The Bill is read and debated {{in both houses of}} parliament before it is either rejected, changed, or approved. An approved Bill must then receive the assent then handed down to either the Governor (State) or the Governor-General (Commonwealth). And then it must be put to the people through a Referendum and only a majority vote of all the States will ensure that law will be passed. Parliament often delegates legislation to local councils, statutory authorities and government departments, for sub or minor statute laws or rules such as Road Rules, but all law is answerable to the Commonwealth Constitution.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, the Attorney-General is {{the chief}} law officer and primary legal advisor of the New Zealand government. Historically, the post could be held either by a {{politician}} or by a senior jurist, but today, it is invariably held {{by a member of}} Parliament. The Attorney-General attends Cabinet, but the post {{is not the same as}} the Minister of Justice. The Attorney-General has departmental responsibility for the Crown Law Office, the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Counsel</b> Office, and the Serious Fraud Office. By tradition, persons appointed to the position of Attorney-General have almost invariably been lawyers. Only two former Attorneys-General have not been lawyers, most recently Dr Michael Cullen who held the post in 2005, and again from 2006. Cullen's appointment was controversial at the time because of his non-legal background.|$|E
25|$|To {{guarantee}} {{the continuity of}} multiple states sharing the same person as monarch, the preamble of the Statute of Westminster 1931 laid out a convention that any alteration {{to the line of}} succession in any one country must be voluntarily approved by the parliaments of all the realms. This convention was first applied to the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936. For expediency and to avoid embarrassment, the British government had suggested that the Dominion governments automatically regard the monarch of the UK, whoever this may be, as their monarch also. But the Dominions rejected this: Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King pointed out that the Statute of Westminster required Canada's request and consent to any legislation passed by the British parliament before it could become part of Canada's laws and affect the line of succession in Canada. Sir Maurice Gwyer, first <b>parliamentary</b> <b>counsel</b> in the UK, reflected this position, stating that the Act of Settlement {{was a part of the}} law in each Dominion. Though today the Statute of Westminster is law only in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, the convention of approval from the other realms was reasserted by the Perth Agreement of 2011, in which all 16 countries agreed in principle to change the succession rule to absolute primogeniture, to remove the restriction on the monarch being married to a Catholic, and to reduce the number of members of the Royal Family who need the monarch's permission to marry. These changes came into effect on 26 March 2015. Alternatively, a Commonwealth realm may choose to cease being such by making its throne the inheritance of a different royal house or by becoming a republic, actions to which, though they alter the country's royal succession, the convention does not apply.|$|E

500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Counsel</b> at the Office of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Counsel,</b> has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There are risks of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Letters Patent dated 27 May 1937 re-conferred the [...] "title, style, or {{attribute}} of Royal Highness" [...] upon the Duke of Windsor, but specifically stated that [...] "his wife and descendants, if any, shall not hold said title or attribute". Some British ministers advised that the reconfirmation was unnecessary since Edward had retained the style automatically, and further that Simpson would automatically obtain {{the rank of}} wife of a prince with the style Her Royal Highness; others maintained {{that he had lost}} all royal rank and should no longer carry any royal title or style as an abdicated king, and be referred to simply as [...] "Mr Edward Windsor".

The street's central portion is dominated by military buildings, including the Ministry of Defence, with the former headquarters of the British Army and Royal Navy, the Royal United Services Institute, the Horse Guards building and the Admiralty, on the opposite side. Government buildings on Whitehall, from north to south, include The Admiralty Buildings (Foreign and Commonwealth Office, others), the Department for International Development at No.22, the Department of Energy and Climate Change at No.55, the Old War Office, the Office of the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Counsel</b> at No.36, the Horse Guards, the Ministry of Defence main building, Dover House (containing the Scotland Office), Gwydyr House (containing the Wales Office), the Cabinet Office at No.70, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Government Offices Great George Street (HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and parts of the Cabinet Office).|$|E

If the regulations are agreed upon this will result in significant changes to customs procedures of the Caricom countries. The first meeting in February 2015 was successful, with consensus and sign-off on the harmonized customs regulations expected for the next meeting in March. If finally agreed upon then, the harmonized customs laws will be forwards for approval by the relevant Caricom bodies and then adopted for implementation by each member state.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in 1865, the son of Henry Liddell, the Dean of Christ Church; his older sister, Alice, would become famous as [...] "Alice in Wonderland". He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he {{graduated}} in 1888 with first-class honours. On leaving Oxford, he was appointed the private secretary to Sir Arthur Gordon, the Governor of Ceylon; after two years, when Gordon's tenure as governor expired, he returned home. In 1891 he became a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, a position he would hold until 1906. He won the Eldon Scholarship in 1892 and was called to the Bar in 1894. He entered Charles Sargant's chambers at Lincoln's Inn, and a year later, on Sargant's advice, joined the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Counsel's</b> Office, then led by Henry Jenkyns and Courtenay Ilbert.|$|R
50|$|The {{project team}} started by {{examining}} the road traffic rules that were in place in each jurisdiction. Detailed public consultations were also {{a feature of the}} policy development process. By 1996, arguably most of the policy basis for the Australian Road Rules was settled. Yet there was still widespread dissatisfaction with the state of the draft Rules at that point. Many thought the document was unenforceable and therefore useless as a template or model law. And so, the group worked very intensively through 1997 and 1998 to ensure that the Rules were not only satisfactory in a policy sense but crucially were drafted {{in such a way that}} they were enforceable. In effect, the Rules were completely redrafted using the dedicated resources of the Commonwealth Office of Legislative Drafting who liaised with the national <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Counsel’s</b> Committee as the representatives of State, Territory and Commonwealth parliamentary drafters.|$|R

60|$|If {{we could}} but get {{the history of}} a single day as it passed in any one of those four-storied houses in the dingy court where our friends Pen and Warrington dwelt, some Temple Asmodeus might furnish us with a queer volume. There may be a great <b>parliamentary</b> <b>counsel</b> on the ground floor, who drives off to Belgravia at dinner-time, when his clerk, too, becomes a gentleman, and goes away to {{entertain}} his friends, and to take his pleasure. But a short time since he was hungry and briefless in some garret of the Inn; lived by stealthy literature; hoped, and waited, and sickened, and no clients came; exhausted his own means and his friends' kindness; had to remonstrate humbly with duns, and to implore the patience of poor creditors. Ruin seemed to be staring him in the face, when, behold, a turn of the wheel of fortune, and the lucky wretch in possession of one of those prodigious prizes which are sometimes drawn in the great lottery of the Bar. Many a better lawyer than himself does not make a fifth part of the income of his clerk, who, a few months since, could scarcely get credit for blacking for his master's unpaid boots. On the first floor, perhaps, you will have a venerable man whose name is famous, who has lived for half a century in the Inn, whose brains are full of books, and whose shelves are stored with classical and legal lore. He has lived alone all these fifty years, alone and for himself, amassing learning, and compiling a fortune. He comes home now at night alone from the club, where he has been dining freely, to the lonely chambers where he lives a godless old recluse. When he dies, his Inn will erect a tablet to his honour, and his heirs burn a part of his library. Would you like to have such a prospect for your old age, to store up learning and money, and end so? But we must not linger too long by Mr. Doomsday's door. Worthy Mr. Grump lives over him, who is also an ancient inhabitant of the Inn, and who, when Doomsday comes home to read Catullus, is sitting down with three steady seniors of his standing, to a steady rubber at whist, after a dinner at which they have consumed their three steady bottles of Port. You may see the old boys asleep at the Temple Church of a Sunday. Attorneys seldom trouble them, and they have small fortunes of their own. On {{the other side of the}} third landing, where Pen and Warrington live, till long after midnight, sits Mr. Paley, who took the highest honours, and who is a fellow of his college, who will sit and read and note cases until two o'clock in the morning; who will rise at seven and be at the pleader's chambers as soon as they are open, where he will work until an hour before dinner-time; who will come home from Hall and read and note cases again until dawn next day, when perhaps Mr. Arthur Pendennis and his friend Mr. Warrington are returning from some of their wild expeditions. How differently employed Mr. Paley has been! He has not been throwing himself away: he has only been bringing a great intellect laboriously down to the comprehension of a mean subject, and in his fierce grasp of that, resolutely excluding from his mind all higher thoughts, all better things, all the wisdom of philosophers and historians, all the thoughts of poets; all wit, fancy, reflection, art, love, truth altogether--so that he may master that enormous legend of the law, which he proposes to gain his livelihood by expounding. Warrington and Paley had been competitors for university honours in former days, and had run each other hard; and everybody said now that the former was wasting his time and energies, whilst all people praised Paley for his industry. There may be doubts, however, as to which was using his time best. The one could afford time to think, and the other never could. The one could have sympathies and do kindnesses; and the other must needs be always selfish. He could not cultivate a friendship or do a charity, or admire a work of genius, or kindle at the sight of beauty or the sound of a sweet song--he had no time, and no eyes for anything but his law-books. All was dark outside his reading-lamp. Love, and Nature, and Art (which is the expression of our praise and sense of the beautiful world of God) were shut out from him. And as he turned off his lonely lamp at night, he never thought but that he had spent the day profitably, and went to sleep alike thankless and remorseless. But he shuddered when he met his old companion Warrington on the stairs, and shunned him as one that was doomed to perdition.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>counsel</b> are {{lawyers who}} prepare {{legislation}} {{that it is}} proposed to pass into law. The terms Parliamentary drafter, Parliamentary draftsman, legislative drafting officer and legislative counsel are also widely used.
