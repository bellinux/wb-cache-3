5|$|The genome of the {{nematode}} worm C. elegans contains 9 serpins, all {{of which}} lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a <b>protective</b> <b>function</b> and guards against stress-induced calpain-associated lysosomal disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 are sensitive to stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable role in determining cell fate.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a <b>protective</b> <b>function</b> against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting <b>protective</b> <b>function.</b> As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

25|$|Some devices {{require a}} {{connection}} to the mass of earth to function correctly, as distinct from any purely protective role. Such a connection is known as a functional earth- for example some long wavelength antenna structures require a functional earth connection, which generally should not be indiscriminately connected to the supply protective earth, as the introduction of transmitted radio frequencies into the electrical distribution network is both illegal and potentially dangerous. Because of this separation, a purely functional ground should not normally be relied upon to perform a <b>protective</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several drug therapies {{are being}} {{developed}} based on p53, the tumour suppressor gene that protects the cell in response to damage and stress. It is analogous to deciding {{what to do with}} a damaged car: p53 brings everything to a halt, and then decides whether to fix the cell or, if the cell is beyond repair, to destroy the cell. This <b>protective</b> <b>function</b> of p53 is disabled in most cancer cells, allowing them to multiply without check. Restoration of p53 activity in tumours (where possible) has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and can even shrink the tumour.|$|E
25|$|Absorption of food vitamin B12 thus {{requires}} an intact and functioning stomach, exocrine pancreas, intrinsic factor, and small bowel. Problems with {{any one of}} these organs makes a vitamin B12 deficiency possible. Individuals who lack intrinsic factor have a decreased ability to absorb B12. In pernicious anemia, {{there is a lack of}} IF due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis, in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B12 <b>protective</b> <b>function.</b> Due to the complexity of B12 absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B12 deficiency. This results in 80–100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30–60% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.|$|E

25|$|Bitterness is of {{interest}} to those who study evolution, as well as various health researchers since {{a large number of}} natural bitter compounds are known to be toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds is considered to provide an important <b>protective</b> <b>function.</b> Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, yet even amongst leaf-eating primates, {{there is a tendency to}} prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves. Amongst humans, various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable. Furthermore, the use of fire, changes in diet, and avoidance of toxins has led to neutral evolution in human bitter sensitivity. This has allowed several loss of function mutations that has led to a reduced sensory capacity towards bitterness in humans when compared to other species.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like the}} {{cornified}} layer of epidermis and of any mammalian nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by mitotic activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a <b>protective</b> <b>function,</b> saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E

There are also sand dune belts which are managed for their <b>protective</b> <b>function</b> {{and as a}} wildlife habitat. There are some concerns that the proposed Severn Barrage could leave some sites high and dry, and others permanently under water. The Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result, in 2002 The Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future.|$|E

2500|$|Many early {{theories}} {{suggested that}} self-esteem {{is a basic}} human need or motivation. American psychologist Abraham Maslow included self-esteem in his hierarchy of human needs. He described two different forms of [...] "esteem": the need for respect from others {{in the form of}} recognition, success, and admiration, and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love, self-confidence, skill, or aptitude. Respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem. According to Maslow, without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need, individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization. Maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem [...] "is the one which manifests in respect we deserve for others, more than renown, fame and flattery". [...] Modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves. Sociometer theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one's level of status and acceptance in ones' social group.
