25|$|In 1953, Shure {{introduced}} {{their first}} wireless microphone system for performers, and in 1959, they introduced the Unidyne III Microphone, {{which was the}} predecessor to the SM57, which would be introduced, along with the SM58, six years later. Shure also produced portable equipment for broadcast field recording like Vocal Master, the M67 <b>Portable</b> <b>Mixer,</b> and the FP31 <b>Portable</b> <b>Mixer.</b> In 1990, Shure entered the wireless microphone market with the L-Series.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Shure {{introduced}} the M68, a <b>portable</b> <b>mixer</b> {{capable of being}} battery powered along with available accessories like a carry case and battery power supply specifically designed {{to address the needs}} of broadcast journalists and field recording personnel. The following year, the Shure M67 mixer added an illuminated VU meter and a line level output transformer for connecting the mixer to a telephone line. In August, 1969, Eddie Kramer recorded the 4-day Woodstock Festival using three Shure M67 mixers. Shure's <b>portable</b> <b>mixer</b> line later included other models such as the M267 and 268.|$|E

[...] In 1953, Frohring patented a neurological research device known as a biothesiometer, used to determine a patient’s sensitivity to vibration. Other patents include a formula for hypo-alergic milk, a process of making liquid malted milk, and a method for determining vitamin A deficiency, and a method for extracting carotene.|$|R

50|$|A typical <b>portable</b> {{concrete}} <b>mixer</b> uses a small {{revolving drum}} {{to mix the}} components. For smaller jobs the concrete made at the construction site has no time lost in transport, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens.|$|R

5|$|The {{trucking}} industry {{serves the}} American economy by transporting {{large quantities of}} raw materials, works in process, and finished goods over land—typically from manufacturing plants to retail distribution centers. Trucks are also used in the construction industry, as dump trucks and <b>portable</b> concrete <b>mixers</b> move the large amounts of rocks, dirt, concrete, and other building materials used in construction. Trucks in America {{are responsible for the}} majority of freight movement over land and are tools in the manufacturing, transportation, and warehousing industries.|$|R

50|$|A {{concrete}} mixer (often mistakenly called a cement mixer) is {{a device that}} homogeneously combines cement, aggregate such as sand or gravel, and water to form concrete. A typical {{concrete mixer}} uses a revolving drum to mix the components. For smaller volume works <b>portable</b> concrete <b>mixers</b> are often used so that the concrete can be made at the construction site, giving the workers ample time to use the concrete before it hardens. An alternative to a machine is mixing concrete by hand. This is usually done in a wheelbarrow; however, several companies have recently begun to sell modified tarps for this purpose.|$|R
40|$|An on-farm mixer {{uniformity}} {{study was}} conducted to determine if feed could be properly mixed and maintained as it went through a bulk bin and conveying equipment over a distance of 180 ft. in a grower-finisher facility. A <b>portable</b> vertical <b>mixer</b> was tested and found to produced a uniformly mixed feed. Uniform feed was then conveyed from a bulk storage bin to feeders inside the facility. Samples were obtained from three different feeders and were tested for uniformity. Results indicate that feed remains uniform as it is conveyed and deposited in feeders over distances of 20, 80, and 180 ft...|$|R
50|$|Under O'Donnell's direction, Alesis {{expanded}} into new product {{categories such as}} electronic drums, <b>mixers,</b> <b>portable</b> PA speakers, and other recording equipment. Some time-tested Alesis products remain, including the SR-16 drum machine, still a current product more than 20 years after its introduction. Today, Alesis is the fastest-growing brand in drums, and it continues expansion into new product categories in mobile music-making, recording, video, and live sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of amenities, general purpose buildings, and school buildings occupied {{the lives of}} the building missionaries during their working hours. However, when concrete had to be poured into foundations or in other parts of buildings, there wasn't the ready mixed concrete technology that there is today, so it was poured by hand. That meant that a <b>portable</b> concrete <b>mixer</b> was loaded by hand with the correct mix of sand and concrete, mixed with the right amount of water and then poured into wheelbarrows which the building missionaries wheeled to wherever it was needed. Concrete has to be poured continuously until completed, so that meant that the building missionaries had to sometimes work around the clock. The whole of the project was usually mobilized for a cement pour, and the sisters always provided refreshments for the workers throughout the night.|$|R
5000|$|On May 27, 1947, the USACE {{held the}} {{groundbreaking}} ceremony for Pine Flat Dam, which {{was attended by}} more than 2,000 people. Governor Earl Warren set off the first blast at the dam site with the turn of a switch, detonating forty charges of dynamite {{on the south side}} of the Kings River gorge. In order to bring construction materials to the site, a temporary railroad was constructed along the Kings River. Concrete was brought to the dam site by a pair of <b>portable</b> concrete <b>mixers</b> on a flatcar, and pumped into place via a 48 ft long tunnel also mounted on a train car. In November 1950, floodwaters tore through the construction site, contributing to a serious late-season flood event that caused $20-25 million of damage in the San Joaquin Valley. This was the last major flood event on the Kings River before the completion of Pine Flat Dam, which would have [...] "prevented much damage… had it been completed".|$|R
50|$|The video assist gear often {{includes}} a portable editing system (usually a laptop with a digitizing box and an editing software), so rough cuts {{can be made}} by the VA operator right on set. A <b>portable</b> video <b>mixer</b> is useful to check out key, blends or pre-visualize visual effects. A video printer is often used to print out pictures or hard copies of sets, camera angles or faces for art designers, make-up artists, and storyboard artists. Sound engineers and make-up usually requests a separate, live-only feed to know what's happening {{in front of the cameras}} and so don't need to continuously pop in and out of set. 2nd units or splinter units shooting extra shots or b-roll can take away small VA recorders to record their own footage, which is then loaded into the main unit archive so it can be watched and checked against main unit footage. Video assist operators on separate units or remote locations are routinely asked to upload the feed real-time onto satellite or internet stream so the agency or the director can watch it half the world away.|$|R
5000|$|In 1957, Kolbe {{returned}} to Switzerland and in 1960 {{he founded the}} Phonag Record Company in Winterthur, with the label Helvetia. The company mainly produced Swiss folklore records. In Winterthur, Kolbe recorded at the Kirchgemeindehaus, which had a room with very good acoustics. From 1962, Kolbe's second engineer and apprentice was Robert Lattmann. In April 1966, Kolbe improved his equipment from three small <b>portable</b> microphone <b>mixers</b> without equalizers, dual meters and a ReVox tape recorder to a portable 3-channel tube mixing console, designed and manufactured by Hans Leonhard (Leonhard Electronics, Zürich). This console, which had switchable equalizers co-designed by Kolbe, was used in his studios in Winterthur and Lindau and on most on-location recordings for CBS and Phonag. In October 1966, at the Kirchgemeindehaus in Winterthur Kolbe recorded the Isaac Stern Trio playing the Beethoven Piano Trios, Op. 97, the [...] "Archduke".On 29 June 1970, Kolbe opened a recording studio in Lindau canton, Zürich, Switzerland. The studio measured 161 square meters over two floors. It had a small stage used as storage area. The technical facilities were in a control room with a double-glass window to the studio. Kolbe's first recording console was the modular portable Leonhard valve mixing desk and he used Tannoy integrated concentric coaxial speakers and Studer tape recorders. In 1975, the studio was upgraded to a 16 track transistorised MCI desk and Studer A80 8-16 track recorders. Between 1972 and 1975 Jimmy Duncombe, later co-founder of the Powerplay recording studio in Maur, Switzerland, was the studio manager and recording engineer.|$|R
