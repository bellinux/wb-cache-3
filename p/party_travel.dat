6000|$|Dried Meat.--When more game is shot {{than can}} be eaten before the <b>party</b> <b>travel</b> onwards, it is usual to jerk a part of it.

Dried meat is a poor {{substitute}} for fresh meat; it requires long steeping in water, to make it tender, and then it is tasteless, and comparatively innutritious. [...] "Four expert men slice up a full-grown buffalo in four hours and a-half." [...] (Leichhardt.) The American buccaneers acquired their name from boucan--which means jerked meat, in an Indian dialect; for they provisioned their ships with the dried flesh of the wild cattle that they hunted down and killed.|$|E
