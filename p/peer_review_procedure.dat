The article examines {{the extent to which}} reviewers feel that they have learnt and whether they consider any aspects of the programmes they have examined to be transferable. Whilst there is evidence at EU level of policy convergence through the adoption of certain labour market targets, there is little evidence either of systematic learning or of significant efforts at emulation. Some explanations for failure on the first count might be found in more general impediments to organizational learning.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to open up the black box of <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> and to {{increase}} its transparency, understanding, and credibility. To this end, two arguments will be presented: First, epistemic and social aspects of <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> are inseparable and mutually constitutive. Second, a content analysis of written reviews indicates that certain elements of peer culture from the 17 th century are still active in the scientific community. These arguments are illustrated by a case study on the <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> practices of a national funding institution, the Swiss National Science Foundation. Based on the case study and the two arguments it will be concluded more generally that <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> show a distinctive specificity to the reviewed objects (e. g. papers or proposals), the organisational format (e. g. panels or external reviewers), or the surrounding context (e. g. disciplinary or interdisciplinary). Scientists, administrators, and the public may conclude that appraising <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> should not be done by way of general principals but should be based on concrete factual knowledge on the specific process under discussion...|$|R

40|$|One {{mechanism}} that scholars have suggested {{for improving the}} quality of regulatory analysis is to increase the use of <b>peer</b> <b>review.</b> This analysis addresses some of the particular <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> discussed in 'OMB's Proposed Bulletin on <b>Peer</b> <b>Review</b> and Information Quality.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedure</b> {{of a national}} science funding organization (Swiss National Science Foundation) {{by means of the}} three most frequently studied criteria reliability, fairness, and validity. The analyzed data consists of 496 applications for project-based funding from biology and medicine from the year 1998. Overall reliability is found to be fair with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 41 with sizeable differences between biology (0. 45) and medicine (0. 20). Multiple logistic regression models reveal only scientific performance indicators as significant predictors of the funding decision while all potential sources of bias (gender, age, nationality, and academic status of the applicant, requested amount of funding, and institutional surrounding) are non-significant predictors. Bibliometric analysis provides evidence that the decisions of a public funding organization for basic project-based research are in line with the future publication success of applicants. The paper also argues for an expansion of approaches and methodologies in peer review research by increasingly focusing on process rather than outcome and by including a more diverse set of methods e. g. content analysis. Such an expansion will be necessary to advance peer review research beyond the abundantly treated questions of reliability, fairness, and validity...|$|E

In this paper we compare benchmarking and <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> as used by the EU with those used by the OECD. Different types of benchmarking and <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> are distinguished and pitfalls for (international) benchmarking are discussed.

40|$|All {{relations}} between persons require their reciprocal acceptance as legal subjects, {{which is only}} possible if they trust that the law will bind them together. One cannot have a democratic and legitimate EU if the Rule of Law is absent or fading. The Rule of Law {{is more than a}} rule or even a principle (which can be balanced against other principles). Article 2 TEU rightly calls it a founding value. National and international political credibility and social cohesion depend on the acceptance of this principle. The Rule of Law in the EU is however continuously challenged by tensions between the realisation of the values enshrined in Article 2, as well as the human rights norms and principles confirmed in Article 6, and ‘contemporary understandings of “law as a means to an end”’. In view of its relationship with reciprocal respect among institutions and citizens for human dignity, the close relationship between the Rule of Law and human rights should also become a part of our understanding of the Rule of Law. In other words: what counts is not the rule of any ‘law’, irrespective of its content, but law in a democratic constitutional framework which contributes to the realisation of human rights. The Rule of Law is not only a condition for trust among citizens, but also for trust in economic life. Strengthening and upholding the trust of the citizens requires much more than the enforcement of European law in the courts, and breaching their trust cannot wait to be cured until the conditions for application of Article 7 TEU are met. It is, as Article 2 TEU rightly says, a question of values: ‘the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the Rule of Law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities’. The question of how a public authority can promote its values – such as the Rule of Law – has been discussed in different contexts. This paper discusses a number of initiatives and proposals that the EU has put forward for the promotion of the Rule of Law, including the ‘Justice Scoreboard’, a <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedure,</b> a ‘pre-Article 7 procedure’ and the Council Conclusions on the Rule of Law of December 2014 proposing a ‘political dialogue’ on the matter. The Rule of Law initiative is meant to prevent situations of serious shortcomings or disregard for the foundational values of the EU by Member States, but is no alternative to political or legal sanctions. Once a political system has drifted away from the Rule of Law, it is too late to rely on dialogue between justice systems representatives. However, if we wish to prevent such situations and reverse negative developments, it remains worthwhile to strive for the enculturalisation of Rule of Law principles in the attitudes and practices of professionals and officials. Ultimately, these professionals and officials are those who can make a difference, for the citizens of their own state but also for other European citizens who – {{as a result of the}} mutual recognition of judicial decisions and arrest warrants, or when they avail themselves of the economic freedoms of the Union – have to rely on the Rule of Law in other Member States. Bringing a value to life is first a matter of developing attitudes and virtues. The Rule of Law depends on reciprocal respect and mutual trust, which could very well start with how we promote it...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{significance}} of the research assessment exercises (RAEs) does not reside primarily in their rationalisation of resources for research or in securing improvements in accountability for their expenditure, but, rather, in their contribution to legitimising the restructuring of higher education, which has included the withdrawal of research funding from an increasing proportion of academics and departments. Through a selective application of <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures,</b> the exercises have facilitated a simultaneous expansion of higher education with a reduction in unit costs. In turn, these reductions have further stimulated pressures and competition to attract privately funded projects as a way of supporting or maintaining resource flows into universities.

In 1934 Popper published The Logic of Scientific Discovery, which repudiated the by then traditional observationalist-inductivist account of the scientific method. He advocated empirical falsifiability as the criterion for distinguishing scientific work from non-science. According to Popper, scientific theory should make predictions (preferably predictions not made by a competing theory) which can be tested and the theory rejected if these predictions are shown not to be correct. Following Peirce and others, he argued that science would best progress using deductive reasoning as its primary emphasis, known as critical rationalism.

SETTING [...] Five district general hospitals and one district health authority. SUBJECTS [...] 159, 421 inpatient discharges, deaths, and day cases and 861, 370 outpatient attendances under the care of 722 consultants from 25 clinical specialties. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Monitoring of x ray examination referrals per 100 inpatient discharges, deaths, and day cases and per 100 new outpatient attenders after establishment of a computerised data collection system. RESULTS [...] Referral rates for all x ray examinations varied between firms in the same specialty or sub-specialty by as much as eightfold for inpatients and 13 -fold for outpatients, and for chest x ray examination by as much as ninefold for inpatients and 25 -fold for outpatients. There was no consistent relation between high referral and teaching status of the centre or specialty or subspecialty.

40|$|Interdisciplinarity of {{research}} is a hot topic because of new developments occurring at frontiers of disciplines (e. g. nanoscience), {{but also because of}} the urge for societal relevance {{of research}}. A lot has been written on interdisciplinarity, however, relatively little empirical research has been carried out. In this thesis the value of quantitative, in particular bibliometric methods in research on interdisciplinarity is investigated and these methods are applied in a number of case studies. Methods are applied in three ways: {{in order to determine the}} interdisciplinary character of research; to validate evaluation processes in science, in particular with respect to interdisciplinary research; and to investigate knowledge flows between disciplines. The results show that bibliometric outcomes can offer a test, but also may offer additional information for <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> in science. It also appears that the assumption that <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> is biased in case of interdisciplinary research, is not universally true. An analysis, with the aid of bibliometric methods, of the outcomes of a nation wide research assessment of physics showed no bias in <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> judgements in case of interdisciplinary research programs. In this study a more clear distinction is advocated between interdisciplinarity and societal relevance of research, and furthermore between top down stimulation and bottom up development of interdisciplinarity. This distinction helps to gain more insight into contributions to interdisciplinary developments from within basic research in disciplines. Citation analysis gives indications for the significance of such processes. E. g. citation analysis shows a relatively large knowledge flow from disciplines like basic life sciences and physics to other disciplines. Promotor: A. F. J. van RaanWith summary in Dutc...|$|R

30|$|Although {{citation}} counts are universally {{acknowledged as}} the indicator of academic prestige, they are loosely {{correlated with the}} future scientific impact of scientists [16]. Previous research admits their biases associated with (1) negative or ceremonial citations [13], (2) geographical gravity laws in citation practices [17], (3) incomparability of citation counts across fields [10] and bibliographical databases [13, 18 – 20]. Finally, subject to delays caused by publishing and <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures,</b> citation counts accumulate slowly and lag behind by several years. Along with citation counts, public engagement is another factor essential for scientists’ future funding, promotions, and academic visibility [5, 21]. Increasingly often, this engagement is happening online through different social media, and can be measured {{with the number of}} ‘likes’, clicks, comments, downloads, ‘retweets’, etc., which have been labeled altmetrics (alternative metrics) [22]. There is a wide scope of ongoing research exploring the role of social media and altmetrics in providing alternatives to the traditional research evaluation [3, 23, 24], primarily, exploring how much altmetrics data exist [25] and whether they can be used in evaluating academic impact [26]. For example, a recent study has found that earlier article [23] download metrics can be used for predicting the future impact of academic papers, and some researchers even suggest that academics should include altmetrics in their CVs [21] as an innovative indicator of academic importance.|$|R

40|$|No {{university}} teacher {{likes to}} be reminded of discussions of appointments, for they are seldom agreeable. And yet I may say that in the numerous cases known to me there was, without exception, the good will to allow purely objective reasons to be decisive. However, the decision over academic fates is too often largely a 'hazard'”. In his well-known lecture Wissenschaft als Beruf (1918), Science as a Vocation, Max Weber underlined the limitations of an appointment procedure based on building consensus among peers. However, his reflection can also be interpreted as a specific instance of the more general problem of the relationship between objectivity and evaluation. In his lecture, Weber sees Science as both a vocation and a profession. His analysis starts from the differences and analogies of the career and retirement system in German and American universities, which he considers respectively “plutocratic” and bureaucratic. This presentation isn't focused on studying appointment procedures but rather scholarly <b>peer</b> <b>review.</b> Hence, the link with the arguments of the German sociologist, may not appear so evident at a first sight. However, it suddenly becomes visible if we consider the topic from a philosophical and sociological point of view. From this perspective, <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> are clearly connected both to the role of science within the academia and its influence on the society in general. A reflection on evaluation procedures involves scientific and moral issues concerning knowledge production and its dissemination. It also involves careers, funding and the basic structure of the “Republic of Science” itself. The <b>reviewing</b> <b>procedures</b> used today are almost exclusively based on the good will of the reviewers to keep the evaluation on an objective ground. A premise that I consider, like Weber does, largely insufficient and hazardous. This presentation has three objectives: – Firstly, it aims at clarifying the motivations and the historical context that led to the birth of <b>peer</b> <b>review.</b> – Secondly, it aims at reflecting, from a political philosophy perspective, on the impact of evaluation procedures on the government of the Republic of Science. To put it in simple terms: Is the Republic of Science a proper Republic? Which form of government should be chosen for an Open Scholarly Community on the web? – Thirdly, it aims at proposing a novel approach to <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> that could be adopted in Open Scholarly Communities on the Web. I call this approach “open soft peer review”...|$|R
50|$|Today, the Journal of Politics & Society, {{with its}} {{particular}} focus on undergraduates and interdisciplinary coverage, {{is the only}} scholarly publication of its kind. Now in its twenty-seventh year, the Journal only considers academic papers submitted by undergraduates. In a process comparable to the <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> and editing <b>procedures</b> of professional academic journals, selected papers are rigorously edited by the Editorial Board, itself composed exclusively of undergraduates. Alone among undergraduate periodicals in the United States, the Journal is commercially distributed nationwide.|$|R
40|$|The term “peer review” often elicits a {{negative}} response from {{teachers and students}} alike. The process involves numerous challenges; anyone who has used the technique knows that students often feel awkward giving feedback to their peers and even more uncomfortable accepting the advice of peers in a classroom setting. They hesitate to voice negatives about performance, possibly because they doubt their own reaction to the material presented or fear that, in retaliation, they will be rated poorly as well. In addition, when teachers fail to establish and communicate clearly defined expectations, student authors do not produce high-quality drafts, and student reviewers often believe that even a lackluster analysis should result in a high grade on the assignment. However, once students understand that <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> is a necessary component of the professional environments they will soon join, are trained {{in the use of}} peer evaluation, and accept the potential benefits of well-constructed reviews by others at their ability level, their individual performances improve on compositions, speeches, projects, and original research papers. They also become better listeners and editors, are more supportive of others’ endeavors, and become more confident about their own work. These benefits are perhaps most visible in the honors classroom, where smaller class sizes allow for closer, more detailed interactions between student groups and where students can demonstrate and improve on their high-level skills of critical thinking and analysis by learning to evaluate the work of others. With some preparation for the process and some experimentation in its implementation, teachers in every discipline can provide a supportive and positive learning experience using this helpful feedback technique. In this article, teachers of honors courses in the humanities disciplines of English, speech, art history, and history at South Dakota State University hope to show that—in addition to reducing faculty workload (Stowell) —using innovative and carefully crafted <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures</b> creates a win-win situation for every student involved in the process as both author and reviewer...|$|R
3000|$|For the {{patterns}} of interactional feedback exchanges, the iterative coding process resulted into many codes that were categorized into two main categories: the language functions of interactional feedback and nature and focus areas of interactional feedback. The language functions of interactional feedback were also clustered into three sub-categories: exploratory, procedural and social. Regarding the second main category, the nature and focus areas of interactional feedback, it has two sub-categories: revision-oriented and non-revision-oriented. The revision-oriented sub-category comprises: global and local which are all discussed in [...] "Findings and discussion" [...] section. Clustering the different patterns of feedback exchanges {{in terms of the}} language functions and the nature and focus areas of such feedback patterns allowed us to make a synthesis of the various patterns of learners’ feedback in the form of main categories. Another reason for such clustering of {{the patterns}} of feedback into main categories is to obtain an understanding of whether the learners as reported in previous studies engage highly in the task of <b>peer</b> <b>review,</b> the <b>procedure</b> itself or social aspects and whether their feedback exchanges targets global issues or local issues of written texts in <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> of writing.|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{neoplasm}} {{rates were}} determined for control Fischer 344 (F 344) rats and B 6 C 3 Fl mice from 2 -yr rodent carcinogenicity studies {{carried out by}} the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The most frequently occurring neoplasms in untreated male F 344 rats were testicular adenoma (89. I 56). mononuclear cell leukemia (50. 5 %), adrenal gland pheochromocytoma (3 1. 9 %). and pituitary gland neoplasms (30. 4 %). For untreated female F 344 rats, the most frequently occurring neoplasms were pituitary gland neoplasms (54. 2 %). mammary gland fibrondenoma (41. 2 %). and mononuclear cell leukemia (28. 1 8). The most frequently occurring neoplasms in untreated male B 6 C 3 Fl mice were liver adenomdcarcinoma (42. 2 %). lung adenomdcarcinoma (20. 5 %), and malignant lymphoma (8. 3 %). For untreated female B 6 C 3 F, mice, the most frequently occurring neoplasms were liver adcnomdcarcinomn (23. 68). malignant lymphoma (20. 9 %). and pituitary gland adenomdcarcinoma (14. 8 %). The tumor rates observed in feeding study (untreated) and inhalation study (chamber) control rats were generally similar. The major exceptions were pituitary gland tumors and testicular adenoma in male F 344 rats. The overall incidence of testicular adenoma was much lower in chamber controls (69. 4 %) than in feeding study controls (89. 1 %). whereas pituitary gland neoplasms showed the opposite trend (60. 7 % vs 30. 4 %). The most likely explanation for this difference is related to the individual housing of chamber controls and the group housing of feeding study controls. Differences in diagnostic criteria may influence reported tumor rates. To ensure consistency and comparability of tumor diagnosis from study to study, the NTP uses rigorous histopathology quality assurance and <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>procedures.</b> Biological factors such as body weight may also affec...|$|R
