40|$|The <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> {{public space}} is an {{important}} part of the analysis of contemporary urban spaces. The apparent spatial progression <b>of</b> <b>privatisation</b> is being emphasised by more and more sources, along with the many forms it can take. Given the scant level of interest shown so far in defining either privatisation or the various ongoing processes, a study such as this seems pertinent. The article is split into three sections. An initial look at the concept of public space leads to the identification of three areas which are relevant to the study <b>of</b> <b>privatisation</b> processes: property, access to and regulation of space. The article then lists three themes underlying the different forms <b>of</b> <b>privatisation</b> that shape discussion on the subject: the longing for security, the desire to take part in a community, and the improvement <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> Recognising these factors allows us to formulate a typology of the various forms the <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> public space can take, illustrated with concrete examples.

40|$|The massive {{interests}} of economic literature about the privatisation gave a notable impulse {{to the discussion}} about this theme in the pre and post privatisation firms performance. Basically in every case after <b>privatisation</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> increases. Does this mean that privatisation is certainly able to increase efficiency? In this field {{a large part of}} the literature leave out the complex problem that public firms usually are subject to objectives and constraints that differently from private firms can affect the overall economic efficiency. Unfortunately many authors ignore the effects of taxation during the process <b>of</b> <b>privatisation,</b> but in real term there are significant tax issues that must be considered by public and private decision maker. In this paper we concentrate the attention on the efficiency measures with the purpose to identify and measure sources of successful performance that can be used in policy planning and allocation of resources. Several techniques to calculate these frontier functions have been used, some of them parametric, others non-parametric to empirically investigate the relationship between taxation on firm’s income and efficiency in the period pre and post-privatisation. In this work we use both econometric and mathematical programming approaches for measuring efficiency. The econometric tool provide maximum likelihood estimates of a stochastic production and cost functions to distinguish noise from inefficiency. Instead, the mathematical programming approaches are nonstochastic and they do not make strict assumptions on the functional form of production and the statistical properties o...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} airport {{shopping}} behaviour of travellers in a departure lounge {{with the major}} aim of providing a basis for future airport marketing activities. Due to the increasing number <b>of</b> <b>privatisations</b> <b>of</b> airports <b>profit</b> maximization has been gaining in importance. This can be more easily achieved by concentrating on nonaeronautical income than aeronautical income, as these are more manageable by an airport itself. One main source of income {{is made up of}} airport retailing. Customers need to get a business’ full attention. Airport managers thus need to concentrate on their passengers in order to improve non-aeronautical revenues. Understanding their needs and desires helps to effectively develop marketing strategies, which help to increase commercial income. The dissertation focuses on main influences on airport shopping behaviour including purchase involvement levels, impulse buying as the main purchasing behaviour at an airport as well as tourist behaviour at an airport. A review of the literature on airport development and airport shopping behaviour will be supported by data gained from primary research in terms of intercept surveys in the departure lounge of Birmingham Airport. The findings revealed that most purchases made at the airport were of a low involvement nature. Furthermore, most purchases were also made due to impulse buying including planned impulse purchases. It is however, debatable in how far impulse buying behaviour and involvement levels relate to each other. A special tourist behaviour at an airport could not be exposed. Nevertheless, it is still an important topic that should be further examined as most of the leisure travellers were already in a holiday mood before they arrived at their destination. If tourist behaviour has an influence on airport shopping airport marketing managers should focus on making their holidays already start at the airport. Another issue to elaborate on is the effective use of the tool of sales promotion in an airport in order to reach consumers and increase non-aeronautical income...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} interrelationship between accounting, {{international}} financial institutions and the <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> water services in the economic management of a developing country. The paper theorizes that <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> social services {{is part of the}} globalization process and {{international financial institutions}} are key agents for the diffusion of this economic policy in the developing world. It then argues that pressures from these “agents of globalization ” are driving the <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> water services in Ghana. Accounting and financial technologies are used as convenient tools for legitimizing this “imposed ” economic policy. The paper concludes that while the <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> social services might be achieving contestable results in some developed nations, the implementation of such an economic management policy in the water sector of developing nations may have serious consequences for socio-economic development in these countries...|$|R

Ongoing privatisations lasted {{from the end of}} the 1970s, through the 1980s until 1990 with the <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> British Rail. After the Hatfield rail crash accident, the British government decided to intervene and renationalised Railtrack (which was responsible for the maintenance of railway tracks and signals) into Network Rail. The impact <b>of</b> the <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> British Rail is much debated today, with increased passenger numbers and better safety offset by concerns about the cost to taxpayers.|$|R

The main proposition is that <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> public enterprises will not achieve successful outcomes unless sound and comprehensive provisions are established and followed. Public enterprises have different structures, objectives and degrees of {{obligation to the}} public interest and demand different tools to implement <b>privatisation</b> effectively. Knowledge <b>of</b> the modalities <b>of</b> <b>privatisation</b> and selection <b>of</b> the right modalities are contributing factors to successfully developing policies for privatisation.

An examination of the US case reveals the risks posed by the <b>privatisation</b> <b>of</b> intelligence and the need for governments to plan and control their reliance on the private sector...|$|R
