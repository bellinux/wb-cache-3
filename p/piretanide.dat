50|$|<b>Piretanide</b> (INN, {{trade names}} Arelix, Eurelix, Tauliz) has been {{synthesized}} in 1973 at Hoechst AG (Germany) as a loop diuretic compound {{by using a}} then-new method for introducing cyclic amine residues in an aromatic nucleus {{in the presence of}} other aromatically bonded functional groups. Studies of <b>piretanide</b> in rats and dogs in comparison with other high-ceiling diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide found a more suitable dose/response rate (regression line) and a more favourable sodium/potassium excretion ratio. These findings led eventually to clinical studies in man and finally to the introduction as a saluretic and antihypertensive medication in Germany, France, Italy and other countries.|$|E
40|$|Antibiotics and diuretics {{are often}} {{prescribed}} concomitantly for humans. We compared {{the effects of}} two potent loop diuretics, furosemide and <b>piretanide,</b> with those of water loading on the urinary excretion of cefazolin. During a continuous infusion of inulin and cefazolin (10 mg/kg per h), six healthy male volunteers received a single intravenous injection of furosemide (0. 3 mg/kg) or <b>piretanide</b> (0. 1 mg/kg) or again an oral water load of 15 ml/kg over a 20 -min period. In vitro, furosemide at all concentrations tested significantly reduced by about 10 % the percentage of cefazolin bound to serum proteins. <b>Piretanide</b> exhibited such an effect only at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. Furosemide, <b>piretanide,</b> and water loading significantly and similarly increased the ratio of excreted to infused cefazolin up to 2 h after the injection of diuretic or after oral water intake. In {{each of the three}} parts of the experiment, the increase of the urinary flow rate was similar when compared with the control values. Furosemide significantly increased the cefazolin filtered load during the same time. <b>Piretanide</b> significantly enhanced the absolute rate of net cefazolin tubular secretion. Water loading increased the urinary excretion of cefazolin, probably through a reduction in tubular reabsorption. These results suggest that (i) furosemide and <b>piretanide</b> as well as water loading are capable of enhancing renal excretion of cefazolin by different complex mechanisms; (ii) cefazolin undergoes a bidirectional tubular transport; (iii) <b>piretanide</b> might act on the proximal tubule in addition to its main site of action on Henle's loop; and (iv) the effects of both diuretics and of water loading are unlikely to affect in vivo antibiotic activity in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>piretanide,</b> a new loop diuretic, {{were studied}} in four patients with GFR 4. 7 - 14. 8 ml/min. An oral dose of <b>piretanide</b> 18 mg was given at 08. 00 h in two patients and at 08. 00 h and 14. 00 h in two. Blood samples were drawn after 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h. Serum concentrations of <b>piretanide</b> were estimated by radioimmunoassay. The peak serum concentration of <b>piretanide</b> (1 - 2 h after drug administration) was 510 - 880 ng/ml, independent of renal function. Elimination half life (t 1 / 2) was 1. 2 - 4. 1 h, area under the curves (AUC(0, 24)) 1. 63 - 2. 44 micrograms ml- 1 h, volume of distribution (Vz) 0. 30 [...] 0. 741 #kg, total plasma clearance (CL) 122. 8 - 184. 0 ml/min and renal clearance (CLR) 1. 5 - 5. 2 ml/min. The clinical effects of oral treatment with <b>piretanide</b> 18 mg twice daily {{were compared with}} bumetanide 3 mg twice daily in eight patients with renal failure (GFR 2. 2 - 24. 5 ml/min). Both drugs equally increased the 24 h output of urine (delta V), sodium (delta UNaV), chloride (delta UC 1 V), potassium (delta UKV) and calcium (delta UCaV). Fractional excretion of sodium (ENa%) was doubled by <b>piretanide</b> in patients with GFR less than 8 ml/min while a five fold increase was found in patients with GFR greater than 8 ml/min. The onset of effect was the same for both drugs, but the duration exceeded 6 h only for <b>piretanide.</b> Both drugs were most effective {{on the first of}} two consecutive treatment days. Delta UC 1 V was always greater than delta UNaV and urinary phosphate excretion was unchanged, as expected of a loop diuretic without significant proximal effects. Metabolic or clinical side effects were not noticed...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with cirrhosis and ascites but no renal failure were given <b>piretanide,</b> a new loop diuretic, {{in order to}} investigate its efficacy and to relate the diuretic response with the pretreatment plasma aldosterone concentration. Eleven patients responded to <b>piretanide</b> 12 mg/day (equivalent in potency to 80 mg furosemide); {{there was no response}} in nine patients. Both groups were similar with regard to liver function, plasma urea, serum creatinine, plasma electrolytes, urine volume, and urine potassium concentration. The basal urinary sodium excretion was significantly higher in those patients who responded (23. 6 +/- 5. 7 mmol/day vs. 4. 3 +/- 1. 42 mmol/day; P < 0. 01) (M +/- SE). Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were normal or only slightly increased in patients who responded to <b>piretanide</b> (PRA = 1. 22 +/- 0. 20 ng/ml/h; PAC = 12. 25 +/- 2. 20 ng/ 100 ml) and very high in patients who did not respond (PRA = 8. 71 +/- 1. 18 ng/ml/h; PAC = 84. 6 +/- 16. 2 ng/ 100 ml) (P < 0. 001). Patients unresponsive to <b>piretanide</b> 12 mg/day also failed to respond when the dose was increased to 24 mg/day. However, the addition of spironolactone, 150 mg/day, to <b>piretanide</b> was followed in these patients by a marked increase in diuresis and natriuresis. These results strongly suggest that the pre-treatment level of aldosterone is an important factor influencing the response to loop diuretics in {{patients with}} non-azotaemic cirrhosis and ascites...|$|E
40|$|Inhaled {{furosemide}} {{prevents the}} obstructive response to several bronchoconstrictor stimuli in asthma. To verify whether this protective effect is also shared by other loop diuretics, we investigated {{the effect of}} inhaled <b>piretanide</b> on the bronchial obstructive response to ultrasonically nebulized distilled water (UNW) in ten patients with moderate, stable asthma. In a randomized, single-blind dose-response study, each subject performed an UNW test immediately after nebulization of different doses of <b>piretanide</b> between 12 and 48 mg or placebo. The effect of a single 40 -mg dose of inhaled furosemide was also investigated in six subjects. <b>Piretanide</b> caused a significant, dose-dependent increase in UNW PD 20 with respect to placebo, corresponding to 0. 6 +/- 0. 2 doubling doses (mean +/- SE) after 12 mg, 1. 3 +/- 0. 2 after 24 mg, and 2. 0 +/- 0. 2 after 48 mg, and had a remarkable diuretic effect; 40 mg of furosemide increased UNW PD 20 by 2. 3 +/- 0. 3 doubling doses (p < 0. 01), but showed only a modest diuretic activity. These data indicate that inhaled <b>piretanide</b> is as effective as furosemide in preventing UNW-induced asthma, and this effect is unrelated to their diuretic potency...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose Loop diuretics {{are widely}} used to inhibit the Na+, K+, 2 Cl- co-transporter, but they also inhibit the cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl - channel. Here, we investigated the mechanism of CFTR inhibition by loop diuretics and explored the effects of chemical structure on channel blockade. Experimental Approach Using the patch-clamp technique, we tested the effects of bumetanide, furosemide, <b>piretanide</b> and xipamide on recombinant wild-type human CFTR. Key Results When added to the intracellular solution, loop diuretics inhibited CFTR Cl- currents with potency approaching that of glibenclamide, a widely used CFTR blocker with some structural similarity to loop diuretics. To begin to study the kinetics of channel blockade, we examined the time dependence of macroscopic current inhibition following a hyperpolarizing voltage step. Like glibenclamide, <b>piretanide</b> blockade of CFTR was time and voltage dependent. By contrast, furosemide blockade was voltage dependent, but time independent. Consistent with these data, furosemide blocked individual CFTR Cl- channels with 'very fast' speed and drug-induced blocking events overlapped brief channel closures, whereas <b>piretanide</b> inhibited individual channels with 'intermediate' speed and drug-induced blocking events were distinct from channel closures. Conclusions and Implications Structure-activity analysis of the loop diuretics suggests that the phenoxy group present in bumetanide and <b>piretanide,</b> but absent in furosemide and xipamide, might account for the different kinetics of channel block by locking loop diuretics within the intracellular vestibule of the CFTR pore. We conclude that loop diuretics are open-channel blockers of CFTR with distinct kinetics, affected by molecular dimensions and lipophilicity...|$|E
40|$|In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial, we {{compared}} the efficacy and safety of the fixed combination of 5 mg ramipril and 6 mg <b>piretanide</b> and the respective component monotherapies in hypertensive patients [supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 100 - 114 mm Hg]. After a single-blind run-in period on placebo, 611 patients were randomized to ramipril (n = 209), <b>piretanide</b> (n = 201), or the combination therapy (n = 201). At randomization, the three groups had the same characteristics (51 % men, age 55 +/- 10 years, BP 165 +/- 18 / 104 +/- 6 mm Hg). At 4 weeks, BP decreased more with combined therapy than with monotherapy. As compared with <b>piretanide</b> monotherapy, the gain in the antihypertensive effect in the supine position averaged 2. 1 mm Hg [90 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 8 - 5. 0 mm Hg; p = 0. 07] systolic BP (SBP) and 1. 9 mm Hg (CI 0. 3 - 3. 5 mm Hg, p = 0. 02) DBP and, as compared with ramipril monotherapy, these differences were 4. 2 mm Hg (CI 1. 3 - 7. 0 mm Hg, p = 0. 008) and 2. 0 mm Hg (CI 0. 5 - 3. 6 mm Hg, p = 0. 009). The incidence of adverse events (AE) and the changes in biochemical measurements were similar in the three treatment groups {{with the exception of}} spontaneously reported polyuria and serum uric acid concentration. Polyuria was reported more frequently (p < 0. 001) with <b>piretanide</b> therapy (n = 23) and combined therapy (n = 19) than with ramipril therapy (n = 1).

40|$|Abstract. In {{response}} to chronic treatment with furosemide, collecting ducts adapt their function {{to the initial}} loss of Na � to prevent further Na � loss and extracellular volume decrease. This adaptation, which includes the overexpression of Na �,K �-ATPase, is thought to account {{for most of the}} kaliuretic effect of furosemide. Because <b>piretanide</b> is reported to be less kaliuretic than equidiuretic doses of furosemide, the authors compared the effects of 1 -wk treatment with the two loop diuretics on urinary potassium excretion and on Na �,K �-ATPase activity in the collecting duct. At equidiuretic and equinatriuretic doses, furosemide increased urinary potassium excretion as well as collecting duct Na �,K �-ATPase activity, whereas <b>piretanide</b> had no effect on either parameter. These effects of furosemide were curtailed by concomitant administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril...|$|E
40|$|Relaxing {{effect of}} loop diuretics, <b>piretanide</b> and {{furosemide}} {{in comparison with}} acetylcholine (ACh) was investigated in guinea-pig isolated mesenteric resistance arteries. Concentration-response curves to ACh (0. 001 – 10 [*]μM) and diuretics (0. 0001 – 1 [*]μM) were constructed in noradrenaline (10 – 30 [*]μM) -precontracted arteries incubated either in normal physiological salt solution (PSS) or in 30 [*]mM KCl PSS (K-PSS). In PSS, maximal relaxations (Rmax) and pD 2 to ACh were 87 ± 2 % and 7. 1 ± 0. 1 (n= 10). L-NG-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 [*]μM) reduced Rmax by 20 % (P< 0. 01, n= 7) and pD 2 by 10 % (P< 0. 01). In contrast, indomethacin (10 [*]μM) increased Rmax by 19 % (P< 0. 01, n= 8) and pD 2 by 10 % (P< 0. 05). Combination of L-NAME+indomethacin reversed the effect observed with either of these inhibitors used alone. In K-PSS, Rmax was attenuated by 40 % (P< 0. 001, n= 6) compared to PSS. L-NAME reduced Rmax by 65 % (P< 0. 01, n= 5) and increased pD 2 by 15 fold. L-NAME+indomethacin suppressed the resistant relaxation. In PSS+L-NAME+indomethacin, inhibitors of small (SKCa; apamin, 0. 1 [*]μM) and large (BKCa; iberiotoxin and charybdotoxin, 0. 1 [*]μM) conductance Ca 2 +-sensitive K−-channels used alone {{had little effect on}} the ACh-response. Combination of apamin+iberiotoxin reduced Rmax by 40 % (P< 0. 05, n= 7) while apamin+charybdotoxin fully abolished the resistant relaxation. In PSS, <b>piretanide</b> and furosemide induced relaxation with Rmax: 89 ± 3 % vs 84 ± 5 % and pD 2 : 8. 5 ± 0. 1 vs 7. 7 ± 0. 2 (P< 0. 01) for <b>piretanide</b> (n= 11) and furosemide (n= 10), respectively. Endothelial abrasion suppressed relaxation to diuretics. L-NAME and indomethacin used alone or in combination did not significantly modify the response to diuretics. In K-PSS, piretanide-induced relaxation was abolished whereas that to furosemide was reduced by 70 % (P< 0. 001, n= 9) compared to PSS and was suppressed by L-NAME+indomethacin. In PSS+L-NAME+indomethacin, apamin slightly reduced relaxation to diuretics whereas charybdotoxin or iberiotoxin abolished the response. These results indicate that ACh-evoked relaxation is mediated by both NO/PGl 2 -dependent and -independent mechanisms. The EDHF-dependent component relies on activation of Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, is sensitive to a combination of apamin+charybdotoxin and to a smaller degree to a combination of apamin+iberiotoxin. Loop diuretic-induced relaxation is endothelium-dependent, appears to be mediated by NO, PGl 2 and EDHF for furosemide and EDHF only for <b>piretanide.</b> For the two diuretics, opening of BKCa channels may be involved in the relaxation...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the effect of a}} single dose {{challenge}} of naproxen (500 mg) and sulindac (200 mg) on renal function in five volunteers, and the effect of a single dose challenge of the thiazide, hydrochlorothiazide (100 mg), and loop diuretic, <b>piretanide</b> (6 mg) on renal function when the diuretics were given alone or when superimposed on chronic therapy of either naproxen or sulindac. None of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or diuretic exposures significantly influenced glomerular filtration rate, as measured by creatinine clearance. Over the first 4 h of the study, both naproxen and sulindac reduced fractional excretion of sodium by approximately 50 %. Sulindac also caused a significant uricosuria whilst naproxen promoted urate retention. Similar changes were observed over 8 h. Superimposition of either hydrochlorothiazide or <b>piretanide</b> on top of chronic sulindac therapy resulted in a blunting of the natriuresis by approximately 30 % compared to when these diuretics were given alone: the action of the diuretics was unchanged by naproxen. Sulindac pretreatment did not alter the urinary excretion of either hydrochlorothiazide or piretanide; naproxen did not alter hydrochlorothiazide excretion. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that NSAIDs exert direct tubular effects that do not necessarily interfere with the delivery of diuretics to their sites of action within the nephron...|$|E

40|$|Nervous or {{hormonal}} stimulation of salivary secretion in vivo {{is associated with}} a pronounced efflux of K+ from the secretory, acinar cells into the blood. This K+ efflux is followed in the post-stimulus period by a reuptake of K+ into the glandular tissue. In the present study we monitor the changes in [K+] of physiological solutions perfusing a flow chamber containing isolated segments of mouse submandibular glands. Nervous stimulation or the application of exogenous acetylcholine (ACh, 10 (- 5) M) to the isolated glandular tissue results in characteristic changes in the [K+] of the superfusate, indicating net K+ release followed by K+ reuptake. The post-stimulus reuptake of K+ is shown to be susceptible to blockade by either ouabain (10 (- 3) M) or <b>piretanide</b> (10 (- 4) M). The reuptake was markedly attenuated if Cl- in the superfusate was replaced by either NO 3 - or SO 4 (2 -). The K+ uptake was, however, unaffected when Br- replaced Cl- in the superfusate. Similar effects were observed in the unstimulated glandular tissues. The introduction of Cl-(-) free media containing either NO 3 - or SO 4 (2 -) resulted in a loss of K+ from the tissue which was followed, upon reintroduction of Cl-, by a pronounced uptake of K+. When Br- was substituted for Cl- there was very little change in [K+] upon removal or reintroduction of Cl-. The uptake of K+ induced by reintroduction of Cl- after a period of NO 3 - or SO 4 (2 -) superfusion was blocked by both ouabain and <b>piretanide.</b> This uptake of K+ was also dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+. Both Cl- and Na+ had to be present in the superfusing medium for K+ uptake to be fully manifest. These findings indicate that the K+ uptake observed in both the resting and stimulated submandibular gland cannot be explained as solely due to the activity of the Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+-K+-ATPase). The demonstrated anionic selectivity, dependence on extracellular Na+ and susceptibility to blockade by the diuretic <b>piretanide</b> would strongly suggest that a coupled Na+-K+-Cl- co-transport system operates in submandibular glands as it does in other transporting epithelia to achieve K+ uptake...|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} local peripheral {{and spinal}} (intrathecal) antinociceptive effect of Na+–K+– 2 Cl− cotransporter (NKCC) inhibitors {{was investigated in}} the rat formalin test. Nociceptive flinching behavior induced by formalin (1 %) injection in the hind paw was assessed following administration of cotransporter inhibitors. Local peripheral pretreatment in the ipsilateral paw with bumetanide (ED 30, 27. 1 ± 12. 7 μg/paw), <b>piretanide</b> (ED 30, 109. 2 ± 21. 6 μg/paw) or furosemide (ED 30, 34. 3 ± 5. 0 μg/paw), but not vehicle (DMSO 100 %), produced dose-dependent antinociception in phase 2 of the test. Local bumetanide had the greatest effect (∼ 70 % antinociception). Bumetanide also inhibited formalin-induced flinching behavior during phase 1 (ED 30, 105. 6 ± 99. 1 μg/paw). Spinal intrathecal pretreatment with bumetanide (ED 30, 194. 6 ± 97. 9 μg), <b>piretanide</b> (ED 30, 254. 4 ± 104. 9 μg) or furosemide (ED 30, 32. 0 ± 6. 9 μg), but not vehicle (DMSO 100 %), also produced antinociception in phase 2. In this case, only intrathecal furosemide reduced flinching behavior during phase 1 (ED 30, 99. 4 ± 51. 4 μg) and had the maximal antinociceptive effect in phase 2 (∼ 65 % antinociception). The opioid receptor-antagonist naloxone (2 mg/kg, s. c.) did not reverse antinociception induced by either peripheral or spinal administration of NKCC blockers.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the role of extracellular chloride in the mast cell secretion process. The immunologically-directed ligand, antibody to IgE (anti-IgE) required extracellular chloride ions for optimum secretion from rat peritoneal mast cells. In contrast, replacement of extracellular chloride did not alter the mast cell secretory response to compound 48 / 80, calcium ionophore A 23187 or substance P. Anti-IgE-stimulation of mast cells evoked a significant uptake of chloride ions compared to non-stimulated cells. The magnitude of chloride uptake correlated with the magnitude of stimulated histamine secretion. Compound 48 / 80, substance P and A 23187 did not alter the rate of chloride ion uptake, although these agents caused significant histamine secretion. The Na+/K+/ 2 Cl− cotransport inhibitor, furosemide, reduced the rate of anti-IgE-stimulated chloride uptake at a relatively high concentration (700 [*]μM). However, the more potent Na+/K+/ 2 Cl− cotransport inhibitors, bumetanide (100 [*]μM) and <b>piretanide</b> (100 [*]μM) {{had no effect on}} the stimulated chloride uptake. Furosemide inhibited anti-IgE-induced histamine secretion, bumetanide potentiated the response and <b>piretanide</b> had no effect. This suggests that their respective action on histamine secretion are unrelated to inhibition of the Na+/K+/ 2 Cl− carrier. The chloride channel blocker, 5 -nitro- 2 -((3 -phenylpropyl) -amino) -benzoic acid (NPPB), reduced both anti-IgE-stimulated chloride uptake and the corresponding histamine secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of the inhibitory action of the drug on these two cellular processes was comparable, implying that chloride channel activity is related to the mechanism of histamine secretion. It is concluded that chloride uptake has a role in the control of FcεRI-mediated histamine secretion from rodent mast cells...|$|E
40|$|In cultured {{spinal cord}} neurons, {{we found that}} {{blockers}} of chloride transport (furosemide, a widely used loop diuretic, and the related compounds <b>piretanide</b> and bumetanide, as well as niflumic and flufenamic acids, used as antiinflamatory agents) prevented N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in a dose-dependent manner and are specific for this class of gluta-mate receptor. Antagonism of NMDA-mediated currents by chlo-ride transport blockers was voltage independent and showed fast on-off kinetics. The action was noncompetitive with NMDA and did not arise from interaction with the Zn 2 inhibitory site, because blockade of NMDA-induced responses by furosemide and Zn 2 was additive.

N-dipropyl substitution to yield probenecid or ring-substitution to yield furosemide and <b>piretanide</b> augment the inhibitory potency. However, hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide exert only a moderate inhibitory potency. Succinate transport was inhibited by furosemide only. Sulfate transport was inhibited by furosemide and 3 -sulfamoyl- 4 -phenoxybenzoate as well as by probenecid, <b>piretanide,</b> hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide. 2.) Phenoxy acetate, -propionate, and -butyrate exert increasing inhibition against PAH transport. The weed-killers 2, 4 -dichloro-, and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetate (2, 4 D and 2, 4, 5 T) had a similar inhibitory potency, while ethacrynic acid showed a lower and the uricosuric tienilic acid a higher inhibitory potency. None of the compounds of this group interact with contraluminal succinate transport, and only the multiring-substituted compounds 2, 4 D, 2, 4, 5 T, ethacrynic and tienilic acid interact slightly with the sulfate transporter. 3.) The monocarboxy-lic penicillins benzylpenicillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin as well as the dicarboxylic ticarcillin interact with the contraluminal PAH transport. The aminopenicillin ampicillin had a lower, and apalcillin a higher inhibitory potency than monocarboxylic penicillin. Benzylpenicillin showed small inhibition against succinate transport and ticarcillin against sulfate transport. 4.) The monocarboxylic cephalosporine, 6315 S Shionogi, and the aminocephalosporines, cephalexin and cefadroxil, showed an app. Ki PAH aS the comparable penicillins.

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies {{have been}} carried out on human {{erythrocytes}} to examine the alterations of K transport induced by swelling or shrinking the cells by osmotic and isosmotic methods. Hypotonic swelling of erythrocytes (relative cell volume, 1. 20) resulted in a striking, four- to fivefold augmentation in the ouabain-resistant K influx over the value obtained at a normal cell volume. Shrinking the cells in hypertonic media resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction in K influx. Three different methods of varying cell volume gave similar results. These include the addition of sucrose and of NaCI to hypotonic media and the isosmotic (nystatin) method. The major fraction of the K influx in swollen cells is specific in its requirement for CI or Br and is not supported by thiocyanate, iodide, nitrate, methylsulfate, or acetate.

Hydrochlorothiazide and <b>piretanide</b> also inhibit the flux with a similar potency, whereas bumetanide, a more potent diuretic, is much less potent. To understand the molecular basis of this inhibition, effects of furosemide on the glucose-sensitive cytochaslasin B binding activities of adipocytes were studied. Furosemide inhibits the glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding of both microsomal and plasma membrane preparations. For both preparations, the inhibition is time dependent and only slowly reversible, is saturable with an increasing concentration of furosemide, shows a noncompetitive type of kinetics with apparent Ki (the inhibitor concentration that gives the half-maximum effect) of 3. 5 and 0. 7 mM after 2 and 18 h incubation, respectively, and is essentially identical between the basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes. The inhibition develops with a first-order rate constant of approximately 0. 12 /h at 4 degrees C. These results indicate that furosemide inhibits glucose transport in adipocytes by directly inactivating transport carriers of both plasma membranes and microsomal reserve pool. This inactivation of glucose carrier may {{play a part in}} the diuretic-induced glucose intolerance frequently observed during diuretic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Ion-sensitive microelectrodes {{were used}} to measure Cl− and H+ {{activities}} in the cytoplasm of the unicellular green alga Eremosphaera viridis de Bary. In the light, cytoplasmic Cl− activity was 2. 2 millimolar at most and cytoplasmic H+ activity was about 5. 4 · 10 − 8 molar (pH 7. 3). Darkening resulted in a permanent increase of the Cl− activity to 3. 2 millimolar and in a transient acidification, which was compensated within 3 to 5 minutes. Switching light on again decreased the Cl− activity to the light level (2. 2 millimolar). Simultaneously, a transient alkalization of the cytoplasm was observed. The transient character of the light-dependent pH changes was probably caused by pH-stat mechanisms, whereas the light-dependent Cl− activity changes were compensated to a much smaller degree. Studies with different inhibitors (3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea, <b>piretanide,</b> venturicidin) indicated a direct relation between the light-driven H+ flow across the thylakoid membrane and the observed light-dependent Cl− and H+ activity changes in the cytoplasm. It is suggested that light-driven H+ flux across the thylakoid membrane was in part electrically compensated by a parallel Cl− flux. The resulting Cl− and H+ activity changes in the stroma were compensated by Cl− and H+ fluxes across the chloroplast envelope giving rise to the observed Cl− and H+ activity changes in the cytoplasm...|$|E
40|$|On the {{addition}} of isoprenaline to an isotonic suspension of red blood cells of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), the cell volume increases. This increase in volume {{is the result of}} net uptake of Na+ and osmotically obligated water. Two different pathways are involved in the salt uptake. The minor component of Na+ entry (about 20 %) corresponds to a Na+ uptake independent of Cl- and is inhibited by amiloride, yet is insensitive to DIDS, furosemide and niflumic acid. It could result from Na+/H+ countertransport. The major component of salt uptake is due to Na+ entry which requires Cl- as anion, and is electroneutral, independent of extracellular K+, sensitive to amiloride, DIDS, niflumic acid and furosemide, but insensitive to other loop diuretics such as <b>piretanide</b> or bumetanide. These characteristics, as well as the response of valinomycin-treated cells to isoprenaline and some other properties (ionic selectivity, drug sensitivity) of the anion exchange system of volume-static trout red cells, permit the definition of the nature of this Cl [...] dependent pathway. The findings are inconsistent with the electrically silent double antiporter model (proposed in amphibian red cells by Cala, 1980) and with the co-migration of Cl- with Na+ through parallel conductive pathways, but strongly suggest a symport mechanism. Striking differences, mainly pharmacological, exist between this NaCl co-transport and the duck red blood cell Na+/K+/ 2 Cl- co-transport (Kregenow, 1977, 1978; McManus & Schmidt, 1978) ...|$|E
40|$|Tubular {{action of}} diuretics: Distal effects on {{electrolyte}} transport and acidification. We used clearance and free-flow micropuncture techniques {{to evaluate the}} influence of several diuretic agents, given both individually and in various combinations, on transport of sodium, potassium, and fluid, and on acidification and ammonium transport, within the distal tubule of the rat kidney. The loop diuretics, furosemide and <b>piretanide,</b> sharply increased fractional delivery of fluid, sodium, and potassium into the distal tubule, and, as a result, sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion were enhanced in this nephron segment. These two drugs also stimulated urinary acidification and increased urinary phosphate, titratable acid, and ammonium excretion. These effects took place both within theloop of Henle and along the distal tubule. Amiloride and triamterene alone inhibited distal tubular sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, and, when given {{with one of the}} loop diuretics, suppressed both the kaliuresis and the increased acid and ammonium excretion induced by the latter agents. Hydrochlorothiazide and tizolemide inhibited sodium reabsorption within thedistal tubule, and were associated with a stimulation of potassium secretion within this segment. Addition of one of these two latter distally acting agents to either of the loop diuretics led to a further augmentation of sodium excretion, but to a reduction of potassium excretion, compared to the responses seen after the loop diuretics alone...|$|E
40|$|Colonic epithelia from rats {{infected}} with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis have been studied under short circuit conditions {{and in response to}} challenge with worm antigen. Challenge from the serosal but not the mucosal side with antigen caused a transient increase in inwardly directed short circuit current. No effects were observed in comparable tissues from noninfected animals. Simultaneous measurements of short circuit current and of the fluxes of sodium or chloride ions showed there was an increase in electrogenic chloride secretion and an inhibition of electroneutral sodium chloride absorption, associated with antigen challenge. This result, together with the inhibitory effects of <b>piretanide</b> on the response to antigen challenge, indicate that chloride ions are a major carrier of the short circuit current response. However, the equivalence of the biophysical response to ion fluxes was not established, there being an excess of chloride secretion. The mast cell stabilizing agent, FPL 52694, significantly inhibited the current responses to antigen, while cromoglycate and doxantrazole were ineffective. Mepyramine, an H 1 -receptor antagonist, and indomethacin, an inhibitor of fatty acid cyclo-oxygenase, were without effect on the responses to antigen challenge. Anti-rat IgE produced qualitatively similar responses to antigen in both normal and sensitized colonic epithelia. However, the responses were significantly greater in tissues derived from infected animals. Maximally effective antigen concentrations prevented subsequent responses to anti-rat IgE in sensitized tissues, while anti-rat IgE only attenuated the responses to antigen. The ways in which antigen challenge modifies epithelial function is discussed, particularly in relation to its possible role in promoting rejection of the nematodes during secondary infection...|$|E
40|$|Mouse {{pancreatic}} segments were superfused with {{physiological saline}} solutions and the K+ {{concentration in the}} effluent was measured by flame photometry. Acetylcholine (ACh) evoked a dose-dependent and transient increase in the K+ concentration in the effluent (K+ release). The removal of calcium (Ca 2 +) from the superfusing solution and addition of 10 (- 4) M-EGTA (ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-amino-ethylether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid) caused {{a significant reduction in}} the ACh-elicited K+ outflow. Pre-treatment of pancreatic segments with the 'loop diuretics' (furosemide, <b>piretanide</b> and bumetanide; all 10 (- 4) M) resulted in uptake of K+ into the tissue segments. The diuretics also caused a marked reduction in the ACh-induced K+ release. Replacement of chloride (Cl-) in the physiological salt solution by nitrate (NO 3 -), sulphate (SO 42 -) or iodide (I-) caused K+ uptake and a significant reduction in the ACh-evoked K+ release. However, when Cl- was replaced by bromide (Br-) the response to ACh was virtually unaffected. When sodium (Na+) was replaced by lithium (Li+) ACh did not evoke K+ release but instead K+ uptake was observed. However, when Tris+ was substituted for Na+ ACh evoked a very small K+ release. Pre-treatment of pancreatic segments with 10 (- 3) M-ouabain resulted in a marked sustained K+ release. In the continuing presence of ouabain ACh induced a further increase in K+ outflow. Pre-treatment of the preparation with 10 mM-tetraethyl-ammonium (TEA) caused a small transient increase in K+ efflux, but TEA had virtually no effect on the secretagogue-evoked changes in effluent K+ concentration. The results suggest the presence of a diuretic-sensitive Na+-K+-Cl- co-transport system in the mouse pancreatic acinar membrane...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial sheets from rat jejunum and {{descending}} colon {{have been shown}} to respond to angiotensin II (AII) when studied under short-circuit conditions and bathed on both sides with Krebs-Henseleit solution. The octapeptide AII elicited increases in short-circuit current (SCC) in preparations of jejunum and decreases in SCC in the {{descending colon}}; both responses occurred when the peptide was applied to the basolateral surface, but not when applied to the apical solution. Responses in both tissues were highly specific, being inhibited by a range of AII antagonists with the following order of potency: [Sar 1. Thr 8]-AII greater than [Sar 1. Leu 8]-AII greater than [Sar 1. Ile 8]-AII greater than [Sar 1. Ala 8]-AII greater than [Des,Asp 1. Ile 8]-AII in rat jejunum. AII responses were not affected by alpha- or beta- adrenoceptor antagonists, atropine or tetrodotoxin. AII responses were totally inhibited by the chloride channel blocker, diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylate (DPC) while cotransport inhibitors e. g. <b>piretanide</b> and frusemide significantly reduced the size of AII responses in colon and jejunum. These patterns of activity suggest that in the jejunum the responses result from electrogenic chloride secretion. Although AII responses in colon were sensitive to DPC the transporting ions have not yet been identified. Both piroxicam and indomethacin inhibited the increase in SCC elicited by AII in the jejunum, and the reduction in SCC caused by AII in the colon. Taken together these results indicate that eicosanoids are involved in AII responses in both tissues. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct, electrogenic effect for AII on transporting epithelia from the gastrointestinal tract. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVolume {{regulation}} {{during a}} hypoosmotic challenge (RVD) in vestibular dark {{cells from the}} gerbilline inner ear has previously been shown {{to depend on the}} presence of cytosolic K+ and Cl−, suggesting that it involves KCl efflux. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize hypoosmotically-induced KCl transport under conditions where a hypoosmotic challenge causes KCl influx via the pathways normally used for efflux. Net osmolyte movements were monitored as relative changes in cell volume measured as epithelial cell height (CH). A hypoosmotic challenge (298 to 154 mosM) in the presence of 3. 6 or 25 mM K+ and loop-diuretics (<b>piretanide</b> or bumetanide) caused an increase in CH by about a factor of 1. 2 presumably due to the net effect of primary swelling defined as osmotic dilution of the cytosol and RVD involving KCl efflux. A hypoosmotic challenge in the presence of 79 mM K+ and loop-diuretics, however, caused CH to increase by a factor of over 2. 4. Presumably, this large increase in CH was due to the sum of primary and secondary swelling. Secondary swelling depended on the presence of extracellular K+ and Cl− suggesting that it involved KCl influx followed by water. The ion selectivity of secondary swelling was K+ = Rb+>Cs+ ⪢ Na+ = NMDG+ and Cl− = NO 3 − = SCN− ⪢ gluconate−. Secondary swelling was not inhibited by Ba 2 +, tetraethylammonium, quinidine, lidocaine, amiloride, 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid, 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid, 4, 4 ′-dinitrostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid, 5 -nitro- 2 (3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid, acetazolamide, or ethoxyzolamide. These data define a profile of the hypoosmotically-induced KCl transport pathways. The ion selectivity and the blocker insensitivity are consistent with the involvement of the apical slowly activating K+ channel (IsK or minK channel) and the basolateral 360 pS Cl− channel. The involvement of these channels, however, remains to be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Three stable {{epithelial}} cell lines (HCA- 7, HCA- 7 -Col 1 and HCA- 7 -Col 3) all {{derived from the}} same human adenocarcinoma have been cultured on collagen-coated Millipore filters. These epithelial monolayers {{have been used to}} record short circuit current (SCC) in response to of secretagogues. Similar monolayers, but grown on plastic dishes, were used for measurements of tissue cyclic AMP. Lysylbradykinin, applied to either side of the monolayers, increased SCC in HCA- 7 cells but had little effect on the other two lines. The responses showed rapid desensitization, which could be prevented by cooling to 4 degrees C. Responses to kinin were not significantly attenuated by piroxicam, an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase. Other secretagogues, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and carbachol also increased SCC in monolayers. The responses to VIP were greatest in HCA- 7 -Col 1 monolayers while responses were virtually absent in HCA- 7 -Col 3. A similar profile was seen with carbachol except that responses of HCA- 7 and HCA- 7 -Col 1 monolayers were more equal. With one exception the responses to VIP and carbachol showed sidedness, acting only from the basolateral side. The effects of the secretagogues were inhibited by <b>piretanide,</b> a loop diuretic, applied basolaterally. It is presumed that SCC responses represent electrogenic chloride secretion. Treatment with forskolin increased SCC in HCA- 7 and HCA- 7 -Col 1 monolayers with little effect in HCA- 7 -Col 3. Nevertheless cyclic AMP levels were elevated most in HCA- 7 -Col 3 and least in HCA- 7 -Col 1 monolayers, in reciprocal relationship to the functional response. A 23187 increased SCC when applied to HCA- 7 and HCA- 7 -Col 3 monolayers with little effect on HCA- 7 -Col 1. The differential responses of the three human cell lines provide unique opportunities to discover the functional responsibilities of entities involved in the chloride secretory process. HCA- 7 -Col 3 cells which generate high levels of cyclic AMP in response to forskolin but which fail to show a substantial chloride secretory response may be a useful model of some disease conditions...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have been}} carried out on human {{erythrocytes}} to examine the alterations of K transport induced by swelling or shrinking the cells by osmotic and isosmotic methods. Hypotonic swelling of erythrocytes (relative cell volume, 1. 20) resulted in a striking, four- to fivefold augmentation in the ouabain-resistant K influx over the value obtained at a normal cell volume. Shrinking the cells in hypertonic media resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction in K influx. Three different methods of varying cell volume gave similar results. These include the addition of sucrose and of NaCl to hypotonic media and the isosmotic (nystatin) method. The major fraction of the K influx in swollen cells is specific in its requirement for Cl or Br and is not supported by thiocyanate, iodide, nitrate, methylsulfate, or acetate. Bumetanide (0. 1 mM), MK- 196 (0. 2 mM), and <b>piretanide</b> (1 mM) are poorly effective in suppressing K uptake in swollen cells, but at higher concentrations, bumetanide (1 mM) inhibits 80 % of the Cl- dependent K influx in swollen cells. The bumetanide concentration required to inhibit 50 % of the Cl-dependent K influx is 0. 17 mM. The volume-sensitive K influx is independent of both extracellular and intracellular Na, so that the (Na + K + 2 Cl) cotransport pathway is not a likely mediator of the volume-sensitive K transport. A variety of inhibitors of the Ca-activated K channel are ineffective in suppressing swelling-induced K influx. Like K uptake, the efflux of K is also enhanced by cell swelling. Swelling-activated K efflux is Cl dependent, is independent of extracellular and intracellular Na, and is observed with both hypotonic and isosmotic methods of cell swelling. The activation of K efflux by cell swelling is observed in K-free media, which suggests that the volume-sensitive K transport pathway is capable of net K efflux. The addition of external K to hypotonic media resulted in an increase in K efflux compared with the efflux in K-free media, and this increase was probably due to K/K exchange. Thus, hypotonic or isosmotic swelling of human erythrocytes results in the activation of a ouabain-resistant, Cl-dependent, Na-independent transport pathway that is capable of mediating both net K efflux and K/K exchange...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular Cl {{activity}} (aiCl), and intracellular pH (pHi) {{were measured}} in isolated sheep cardiac Purkinje fibres using a liquid ion exchanger Cl-selective micro-electrode {{and a glass}} recessed-tip, pH-selective micro-electrode. Removal of external Cl (glucuronate substituted) produced a fall in aiCl from about 20 to about 4 mmol/l: the residual level is probably caused by intracellular interference on the Cl-sensitive electrode. Re-exposure of the fibre to increased levels of external Cl produced, in the steady state, increased levels of aiCl. The dependence of steady-state aiCl upon external Cl activity, aoCl, was roughly hyperbolic with 50 % recovery occurring at an aoCl of about 9. 5 mmol/l. At all levels of external Cl tested, Cl was accumulated to a level much higher than that predicted for passive electrochemical equilibrium. Exposure of a Cl-depleted fibre to various levels of external Cl produced an exponential rise with time in aiCl. The initial rate-of-rise in aiCl {{was estimated to be}} a saturating function of aoCl, with a half-maximal effect occurring at an aoCl of about 33 mmol/l. The rate-of-rise was about 10 -fold greater than that predicted from constant-field theory using published values for PCl, the Cl permeability coefficient. Steady-state aiCl was essentially insensitive to changes in external HCO 3 concentration, [HCO 3]o, if these changes were made at a constant external pH, pHo, i. e. when a reduction in [HCO 3]o was accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in the partial pressure of CO 2, PCO 2. In contrast, if PCO 2 was maintained constant, then a change in [HCO 3]o (thus producing a change in pHo) resulted in an inverse change in aiCl. This change in aiCl was also accompanied by a change in pHi: when aiCl increased, pHi decreased and vice versa. The anion-exchange inhibitor, DIDS (4, 4 -diisothiocyanato-stilbene disulphonic acid) abolished the effect on aiCl of changes in [HCO 3]o and pHo (at constant PCO 2). Furthermore DIDS reduced the influence of pHo upon pHi. Both the fall of aiCl in Cl-free solution and the subsequent reuptake of Cl following re-exposure to Cl-containing solution were slowed by a reduction in [HCO 3]o (constant pHo, reduced PCO 2). Both reuptake and wash-out of Cl were saturating functions of [HCO 3]o with half-maximal effect occurring at an [HCO 3]o of 1 - 1. 3 mmol/l. The reuptake of Cl was little affected by removal of external Na (bis, 2 -hydroxy ethyl, dimethyl ammonium substituted). The reuptake of Cl was unaffected by amiloride (1 mmol/l) but slowed by <b>piretanide</b> (1 mmol/l). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
