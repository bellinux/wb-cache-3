5|$|Various {{proposals}} {{have been put}} forward to construct a Severn Barrage for tidal electricity production from Brean Down to Lavernock Point in south Wales. The proposals, which go back over 100 years, have never been successful so far, however Peter Hain and others are still working on further <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> trying to persuade the government to fund either the barrage or tidal lagoons.|$|E
5|$|Airline {{customers}} were uninterested in the 767-X <b>proposals,</b> <b>and</b> instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E

5|$|An {{underground}} station to serve Euston station was first {{proposed by the}} Hampstead, St Pancras & Charing Cross Railway in 1891. The company planned a route to run from Heath Street in Hampstead to Strand in Charing Cross with a branch diverging from the main route to run under Drummond Street to serve Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross stations. Following parliamentary review of the <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> a change in name to the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE), permission was granted for the route in 1893, although the branch line was only permitted as far as Euston.|$|E
5|$|By the 21st century, Highway 82 {{had grown}} to four lanes. It was easier for traffic to get to Aspen but did not resolve the {{congestion}} that developed when it got there. Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth, some involving ballot initiatives decided by the voters of the city and/or county. In 1998 CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), after considering all the <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> taking public input, released a Record of Decision. The preferred alternative combined highway and intersection improvements, mass transit and incremental transportation management.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> delays, {{construction}} began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would have been very costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, the PAP {{formed a}} workgroup, headed by Phua, to explore {{initiatives}} {{to improve the}} financial security of disabled and special needs children. Phua also led a committee that drew up a five-year plan to improve services for special needs children. The PAP studied their <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> later implemented some, such as a National non-profit Special Needs Trust Fund. Laws were also drafted to prohibit abuse of the mentally disabled and to allow parents to appoint someone to look after their special needs children after they die.|$|E

5|$|McCain {{clinched}} enough delegates for {{the nomination}} and his focus shifted toward the general election, while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination. McCain introduced various policy <b>proposals,</b> <b>and</b> sought to improve his fundraising. Cindy McCain, who accounts {{for most of the}} couple's wealth with an estimated net worth of $100million, made part of her tax returns public in May. After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest, causing five top aides to leave.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{uses for}} the land {{included}} a soccer stadium, an indoor tennis facility for Belmont University, public tennis courts, rodeo grounds, a Kroger grocery store, and a neighborhood park. In {{a letter to the}} editor of The Tennessean, former Sounds owner Larry Schmittou expressed his interest in Greer becoming an amateur baseball park, citing its amenities and several Metro high schools that lack baseball diamonds of their own. Two public meetings were held in September 2016 to discuss these and other <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> ideas for the space.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees {{consisting}} of 25 to 71 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up {{of the whole}} Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative <b>proposals</b> <b>and</b> reports to {{be presented to the}} plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} the Capitols went 28–20 but were {{eliminated}} from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach {{felt he had to}} rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his <b>proposals,</b> <b>and</b> Auerbach resigned.|$|E
5|$|When Parliament {{convened in}} January, the Liberals {{introduced}} no major <b>proposals,</b> <b>and</b> proposed nothing controversial. Diefenbaker turned over his parliamentary duties to British Columbia MP Howard Green and {{spent much of}} his time on the road making speeches across the country. Diefenbaker toured a nation in which Liberal support at the provincial level had slowly been eroding. When the Liberals gained Federal power in 1935, they controlled eight of the nine provincial governments, all except Alberta. By early 1957, the Liberals controlled the legislatures only in the tenth province, Newfoundland, and in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock {{that his father had}} {{received}} from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's <b>proposals,</b> <b>and</b> Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E
5|$|By May 1985, {{three months}} behind schedule, the review board narrowed the tenders {{down to two}} contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The Walrus and Type 2400submarine designs were {{considered}} to be too expensive to manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system tenders had been narrowed down by unjustified development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti <b>proposals,</b> <b>and</b> the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided that six submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.|$|E
5|$|By late January 2006, campaigning {{was under}} way for the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, 2006 {{scheduled}} to take place for the Westminster constituency in which {{the north end of}} the bridge is situated. The by-election, scheduled for 9 February, was contested by – in addition to the major political parties in Scotland – an Abolish Forth Bridge Tolls Party. It was won by Liberal Democrat candidate Willie Rennie, overturning a large Labour majority on a 16% swing. In the aftermath of the by-election defeat, media speculation suggested the Executive had turned against the <b>proposals,</b> <b>and</b> Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their rejection and the retention of the existing toll structure on 1 March 2006. FETA condemned the decision, while local opposition MSPs charged the minister that his tolling review short-changed Fifers as tolls were axed on the Erskine Bridge leaving tolls on only the Forth and Tay Road Bridge.|$|E
