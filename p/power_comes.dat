5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice {{gives way to the}} epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in {{exchange}} for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world {{and learn how to}} confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him {{as a member of the}} League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternate}} take on Robby Reed and Dial H For Hero {{was used}} in Teen Titans Go #52. This version of the character unknowingly drew his powers from other heroes who were close by. As a result of discovering his power source, Robby gave up his dial and signed up for Cyborg's new Teen Titans Training program. His identities in the issue were Changeling (the <b>powers</b> <b>came</b> from Beast Boy), Lagoon Boy (the <b>powers</b> <b>came</b> from Aqualad), Jesse Quick (the <b>powers</b> <b>came</b> from Kid Flash), Power Boy (the <b>powers</b> <b>came</b> from Wonder Girl), and Protector (the <b>powers</b> <b>came</b> from Robin). In Teen Titans Go #55, Robby Reed returned in a nightmare sequence of Cyborg's (caused by the villainous Phobia). In the dream after having had his H-Dial taken away, he joined the [...] "New Teen Titans" [...] program {{under the guise of}} Protector.|$|R

25|$|Every mafioso knows {{perfectly}} well, {{when all}} is said and done, where his <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from. People are scared of being physically hurt, and, more than that, no one wants to risk being killed.|$|E
25|$|Adam Warlock {{also has}} the power to devolve the {{followers}} of Man-Beast into the animals from which they evolved, as well as revert the Brute into Counter-Earth Reed Richards. This <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from his soul gem.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{power and}} natural gas are {{provided}} by NV Energy, formerly Sierra Pacific. <b>Power</b> <b>comes</b> from multiple sources, including Tracy-Clark Station to the east, and the Steamboat Springs binary cycle power plants {{at the southern end}} of town.|$|E

25|$|The FCX Clarity {{electrical}} <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from a 100kW Honda Vertical Flow (V Flow) {{hydrogen fuel}} cell stack whereby electricity is supplied on demand. In common with many electric vehicles, the car has regenerative braking and uses a separate battery to store energy recovered during braking.|$|E
25|$|The Mafia's <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> {{from its}} {{reputation}} to commit violence, particularly murder, against virtually anyone. Through reputation, mafiosi deter their enemies and enemies of their clients. It allows mafiosi {{to protect a}} client without being physically present (e.g. as bodyguards or watchmen), which in turn allows them to protect many clients at once.|$|E
25|$|Most of Burbank's current <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> {{from the}} Magnolia Power Project, a 328-megawatt power plant located on Magnolia Boulevard near the Interstate 5 freeway. The {{municipal}} power plant, jointly owned by six Southern California cities (Burbank, Glendale, Anaheim. Pasadena, Colton and Cerritos), began generating electricity in 2005. It replaced a 1941 facility that had served the customers of Burbank for almost 60 years.|$|E

25|$|Water is used {{in power}} generation. Hydro{{electricity}} is electricity obtained from hydropower. Hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemistry is {{the direct}} {{transformation}} of chemical energy into electricity, as in a battery. Electrochemical electricity generation {{is important in}} portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from batteries. Primary cells, such as the common zinc-carbon batteries, act as power sources directly, but many types of cells are used as storage systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as fuel cells, {{can be used to}} extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. Osmotic power is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merges.|$|E
25|$|Its rural {{hinterland}} {{yields a}} variety of agricultural and pastoral products, including meat and hides, wool, rice, beans, cashews, avocados, wheat, grapes, and tobacco. From the forests comes lumber. The city's industries are chiefly concerned with processing these products and include meat-packing, lard refining, leather tanning, shipbuilding, and the manufacturing of textiles, metallurgic goods, electrical and communications equipment, plastics, pharmaceuticals, perfume, beer, and chemicals. There are also steel mills, an oil terminal, and a petrochemical complex. <b>Power</b> <b>comes</b> from coal mined at nearby São Jerônimo and from a hydroelectric plant at Salto. The city has many business and financial institutions and is also an educational centre.|$|E

25|$|<b>Power</b> <b>comes</b> from {{overhead}} valve (two per cylinder), pushrod, naturally aspirated, carbureted 358 cubic inch (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules {{allow for the}} use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as supercharging or turbocharging is strictly prohibited in all classes. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.|$|E
25|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{the island}} has a land area of 59,558 square meters, or 14.717 acres, {{which is the}} {{property}} of the federal government. A pact between New York and New Jersey states that New York has control of the Island, but taxes go to New Jersey, and the <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from Jersey City. Liberty Island is located in the Upper New York Bay surrounded by the waters of Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey. Liberty Island is one of the islands {{that are part of the}} borough of Manhattan in New York. The historical developments which led to this construction created the rare situation of an exclave of one state, New York, being situated in another, New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|Second, it {{is assumed}} that while faster than light starships produce prodigious amounts of energy just for the needs of propulsion, there is not enough energy {{available}} to perform every possible function simultaneously. Therefore, each ship has to fill out an Energy Allocation form {{at the beginning of a}} turn, and 'pay' for all the functions (such as movement, shields and weapons) that it can then use during the turn. This procedure forces players to plan their actions for the following game turn, because systems left unpowered during the Energy Allocation Phase cannot be used during the turn (there is a rule for Reserve Power which a player can use to power up a ship system mid-turn, but this <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from the ship's batteries which are few).|$|E
50|$|The Severin L20 {{was offered}} as a 5-passenger model for $1135 and a touring car for $3550. <b>Power</b> <b>came</b> from a Continental Motors Company six-cylinder engine.|$|R

25|$|The antenna {{converts}} {{the energy}} in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which {{is connected to the}} tuning coil. Since in a crystal radio all the <b>power</b> <b>comes</b> from the antenna, {{it is important that the}} antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM broadcast band waves are 182-566 m or 597–1857ft. long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip antennas or ferrite loopstick antennas used in modern radios.|$|E
