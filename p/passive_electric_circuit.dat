A Faculty of Medicine has been funded in 2004 {{to alleviate the}} local dramatic lack of doctors; the theme of teacher education has been addressed in 2005, via activities in Science Education to help preparing science teacher for Uganda secondary schools. The Science Education collaboration program has started in the Physics Bachelor curriculum. The {{goal is to help}} the teachers-to-be to build competences {{that will allow them to}} implement good quality class activities, even in the contexts of poor and remote locations. The rationale has been that of compact activities lasting for about 2. 5 months, in Spring and Fall 2006. The authors have worked all day long, with about 50 freshmen, integrating presentation and lab-work and implementing a full immersion, peer-learning approach, where the main results of Physics Education Research (PER) have been adapted to the local context. The main aim is to favour a transition from a mnemonic study, using essentially lectures notes, to a learning approach based on active participation, peer learning, critical thinking, comparison between common sense and disciplinary knowledge and taking up of one’s own responsibility. The main features can be summarized as: a) critical analysis of common-robust learning difficulties; b) construction of a personal portfolio; c) lab-work based on low or no cost materials (e. g. hydrostatic via experiments using transparent plastic containers of physiological solution and syringes recycled from the local hospital; harmonic free and dumped oscillations via pendula realized with small unripe fruits and tree bark fibres; <b>passive</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> via bulbs/batteries of the local markets; etc [...] ); research based questionnaires. The lack of lab-work is most always attributed to missing traditional and costly apparatuses.

A possible realization of the plate analog network is also proposed under the form of a circuit constituted by capacitors, inductors and transformers only.

40|$|An {{intelligent}} control system {{has the ability}} to learn about its environment, process the information to reduce uncertainty, plan, generate and execute actions to either control or reduce to a minimum the undesired motion of all or some of its parts. It generally incorporates sensors, actuators, a controller and a power supply unit. Most of the previous work has focused on active control in which electric power is supplied to the actuators that exert actions on the host structure to suppress its vibrations. Alternatively, undesired mechanical energy of a host structure could be converted into electrical energy that can be dissipated through a set of resistor. This does not require an external power unit and is a more economical means of controlling vibrations of a structure, but an effective transduction of mechanical energy into electric energy has to be guaranteed. Such an effective transduction can be achieved imposing to the electric controller to be resonant at all the mechanical resonance frequencies, and to mimic all the mechanical modal shapes, i. e. to be the analog of the host structure. In this paper we synthesize a completely <b>passive</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> analog to an Euler beam, aimed for distributed vibration control...|$|E
30|$|The {{first and}} main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is introducing the exponential reproducing windows into Gabor sampling scheme and reducing the time domain modulation functions, constructed by appropriately weighted window sequences, to simple exponential functions. The time domain modulation functions of this study can avoid holding complicated function structures and intricate system functions, which are difficult to realize in real world. Any time domain response function from E-spline system could be defined as exponential reproducing function, the simplest one being E-spline itself [18]. Interestingly, with appropriate weighting coefficients, the exponential reproducing window sequences can be synthesized to a simple exponential function. It could be viewed as the impulse response representation of an exponential filter, which can be carried out with simple <b>passive</b> <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> [19, 20]. For this study, we deduced the representation of the filter form of the time domain modulation functions in Gabor sampling scheme and chose the appropriate E-spline parameter vector α for guaranteeing the window positive real functions. Then, we constructed the measurement matrix for CS recovery and calculated each entry and proved that such measurement matrix has better coherence than that of DFT matrix. Hence, the measurement matrix satisfies the RIP, making it possible to recover the sparse Gabor coefficient matrix perfectly.|$|E
