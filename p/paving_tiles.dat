50|$|The {{unglazed}} clay Furo {{coated with}} black lacquer was preferred for formal use. It {{was placed on}} a lacquered board to prevent heat damage. The iron type was set on a <b>paving</b> <b>tile.</b> On {{the edge of a}} Furo a fire window or cut-out opening provided the necessary draft to keep the Sumi burning properly. A bed of ashes Hai was laid inside the Furo and the Sumi placed on top was lighted. The Kama was then set directly on the bronze or iron brazier, but a trivet was used for a clay brazier. Kama for portable ranges is slightly smaller than those used for fixed hearths Ro (Sen, 1979, p. 22).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, the {{increase}} in production, consumption causes the shortage {{of the natural resources}} and {{the increase}} in waste disposal. In order to build up a sustainable society, the input and the output of the natural system should be reduced by the recirculation of materials and energy. We have tried to develop high performance building materials by solidification technology at low temperature. The starting materials were the inorganic wastes or soil. These solidified inorganic waste and solidifying soil have good mechanical strength for <b>paving</b> <b>tile.</b> Solidifying soil called as Tataki works has good performance of mitigating urban heat islands. Numerical simulation method based on heat transfer model was studied to estimate performance of mitigating urban heat islands of solidifying soil. Numerical model was calculated by the surface temperature changes in the outside with air temperature changes. Simulation result was compared with experimental measurement...|$|R

40|$|What are {{the reasons}} that led to Gaudí’s {{hexagonal}} tile becoming a reference point in industrial design with international dissemination? Its origins as an encaustic tile lie {{in the era of}} splendour of Catalan Modernisme, in the early 20 th century. It was recognised as a solution for modernity in the 1960 s, with the process of emerging design culture in Catalonia, which prompted its transformation into an emblematic <b>paving</b> <b>tile</b> for Barcelona’s public spaces. Finally, in the late 1990 s, the tile was restored to its original format, acquiring the connotation of urban icon. Since it first appeared, Gaudí’s famous tile has not only demonstrated its versatile nature and easy adaptation to changes of use, it has also played a fundamental role in constructing the cultural, urban and touristic identity of the city of Barcelona. These two factors already form part of the object’s memory and are responsible for its singularity. The analysis proposed here places emphasis on the processes that, from the start of its production, distinguished the tile as a true object of industrial design, thanks to the innovative correlation it established between artistic creativity, technical research and business strategy, together with the evolution of demand and cultural changes.

A new east window was inserted in the chancel. The floor of the chancel was raised and laid with encaustic tiles interspersed with bands of stone. The rest of the church was <b>paved</b> with <b>tiles</b> and new heating was installed. The organ {{was moved to the}} south aisle, and the old pews were replaced with oak seating.

5000|$|In 1337, William II the Hardy, succeeded {{his father}} as Count of Hainault. The Hundred Years War began and being a vassal state of the Holy Roman Empire, the Count was led to take sides with the Flemish and the King of England against France, despite the family ties binding it to the latter. Therefore, 22 May 1340, Le Quesnoy was besieged by John, Duke of Normandy (son of Philip VI of France with the royal troops; the Duke and his father did not accept that Count of Hainaut had rallied to the English. The {{inhabitants}} of the town defended themselves. Fortunately, they were well equipped with soldiers, weapons and artillery they had previously equipped the town walls with cannon ("batons of fire"), machinery and small cannons mounted on carriages which were used against the French attackers led by Marshal Mirepoix. The [...] "Chronicles of Jean Froissart" [...] mention the siege as follows:(1340) [...]. Those of the town (= the besieged Le Quesnoy) unleashed against them (= the French troops) guns and machinery that threw large <b>paving</b> <b>tiles.</b> These tiles were generally made of iron, but could be also be made of stone and tourniquets fire as they could find at very short notice in places under siege. The horses of the attackers were scared by {{the noise of the}} artillery which scattered iron and stone projectiles against them that could cause serious injury (equally to the riders), so they in this case against such weapons {{had no choice but to}} withdraw. The French, angry at having been repulsed by the artillery of the town, moved out of spite on the surrounding villages, which they then burned such as Gommegnies, Frasnoy, Château de Potelle, Wargnies-le-Grand, Wargnies-le-Petit.. (Notes 1.) Historians speak of the war machines without surprise, because they were more embarrassing than effective, and that no one foresaw the revolution that would make the discovery of gunpowder. In Europe around the year 1326 in Italy the first weapons loaded with powder were encountered. 2.) This siege is also interesting by the fact that there was no hand to hand combat and a new conception of the war by means of firearms was about to emerge : Artillery will quickly become indispensable to all wars and/or sieges.) ...|$|E

The study utilized sludge-cement replacement percentages of 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %. Produced tiles were tested for water absorption and breaking (bending) strength. Leaching of sludge metals from tiles was assessed using TCLP. The study showed that all produced tiles exhibited a water absorption ratio of around 10 %. The study concluded that produced tiles, except for 50 % sludge-cement replacement, comply with the breaking strength requirements of 2. 8 MPa for tiles for external use. The TCLP results indicated that metal leaching from tiles is negligible...|$|E
