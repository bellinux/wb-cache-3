5000|$|During Summer, 1942 Gilbert (as {{were many}} {{manufacturing}} companies) was compelled by Federal wartime restrictions to cease manufacturing (and even servicing!) its electric train and other metal consumer products. It did not again publish American Flyer catalogs until 1946. The manufacturing hiatus offered the company {{the opportunity to}} further differentiate the products {{from those of the}} market leaders (by sales volume) Marx and Lionel. By Summer, 1945 it was able to resume limited manufacturing of the 3/16s scale O gauge trains. While it did so, the same sized products were re-engineered to run on much more realistic two rail (with a [...] "T" [...] <b>profile</b> <b>rail)</b> track. The fine detail of the diecast engines, tenders and cars that had debuted in the '39 catalog reappeared. The engines and tenders continued to be made of diecast metal, but the cars' bodies were made out of plastic. Two pages of the spectacular 1946 catalog emphasize the running advantages of the lighter cars. Ironically, they soon realized that they had to add weight. Metal car bottoms & chassis were necessary to prevent the too-light cars from tipping over. The 'link & pin' automatic couplers that had been introduced on the 3/16s O products were reduced in size, with plastic replacing the sintered metal of the originals. They too, later had metal weights added because they would fail to descend to the locking position needed for cars to couple. The chugging mechanisms of the premium O gauge tenders were redesigned to also generate smoke, which was conveyed to the engines' smokestacks via a black rubber tube that protruded out of the rear of the cab so that it could connect {{to the front of the}} tender.|$|E

50|$|The {{grinding}} {{quality index}} (GQI) is a software-based template {{used to measure}} the <b>profile</b> of a <b>rail.</b> This allows the desired <b>rail</b> <b>profile</b> to be compared to the actual <b>rail</b> <b>profile.</b> GQI software makes use of laser-based hardware mounted to the front and rear of the rail grinder. The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allow workers and contractors take precise measurements of the <b>rail</b> <b>profile</b> before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the <b>rail</b> <b>profile.</b> The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate assessments of rail grinder effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} test rig aimed to characterize a pneumatic tyre, {{together with the}} first experimental results, is presented. The objective is to determine some tyre mechanical characteristics useful to physically model its behaviour; in particular: the normal interaction characteristic, the radial stiffness, the total stiffness and the longitudinal hysteretic cycles. To this aim two different kind of tests have been executed: radial and longitudinal tests. In the radial test the load is statically applied, along the vertical direction, to the tyre {{by means of an}} hydraulic press and it is measured together with the consequent radial deformation, so allowing the estimation of the tyre normal interaction characteristic and of its radial stiffness. Different radial tests can be conducted for an assigned tyre varying the inflation pressure. The longitudinal tests are conducted applying, under an assigned constant vertical load, a variable horizontal strain to the tyre by means of a linear actuator, two <b>profile</b> <b>rail</b> guides and a system to transfer the horizontal motion to the contact patch of the tyre, opportunely placed on a moving steel plate placed on the two linear guide rails. During the tests the horizontal load and the resulting deformations are measured and acquired so allowing the estimation of tyre total stiffness and of its longitudinal hysteretic cycles. Longitudinal tests can be conducted varying the assigned vertical load, the horizontal displacement law in terms of frequency and amplitude, the tyre inflation pressure.

40|$|The {{increase}} in passengers and tramcars will wear down existing rail structures faster. This is forcing the rail infrastructure asset owners to incorporate asset management strategies to reduce {{total operating cost}} of maintenance whilst improving safety and performance. Analyzing track geometry defects is critical to plan a proactive maintenance strategy in short and long term. Repairing and maintaining the appropriate number, types and combination of geo-defects can effectively reduce the capital cost of maintenance operations. The main objective {{of this research is}} to explore maintenance needs regarding tram track geometry defects based on formulating the following two sets of data driven models: (1) non-parametric track deterioration models that are used to compare and capture the deterioration process of different track types, i. e. straight track, curved track, H-crossing and crossover. (2) Semi-parametric track deterioration models to assess probability of maintenance needs in the most critical segments as a function of explanatory variables such as: track surface, rail <b>profile,</b> <b>rail</b> type, rail support, maintenance, and traffic condition. In this paper, the proposed models are applied to geometry defects from inspection runs occurring seven times, from December 2009 to November 2013. In the first step, among Melbourne tram network routes, three routes are selected as case study. Non-parametric deterioration models shows curve type tracks and H-crossing have the highest probability of failure. This analysis shows that curved tracks are the most critical segments of the network. In the next step, the Cox regression procedure is used for modeling the time to exceeding the failure limits for curved tracks. The covariates that are used to estimate the probability of failure consists of curve radius, rail support (concrete/sleeper), rail type (Grooved or T-shapes), rail profile, track surface (asphalt/concrete), and traffic conditions...|$|E

40|$|Rail {{grinding}} {{is used by}} {{rail infrastructure}} owners to remove rail corrugations, rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks and for re-profiling the rail. In North America, the standard practice is Preventive and Preventive-Gradual grinding strategy which uses high production rail grinders to complete a single pass on most track locations at high grinding speed. These practices have been proven in field tests {{to be the most}} cost effective grinding strategies. To plan rail grinding on Queensland Rail a Rail Inspection Vehicle (RIV) is used to gather data of <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> and <b>rail</b> surface photos. This inspection technology generates a Grinding Quality Index. This paper proposes the standards utilised in accepted best practices [13] as a standard for Australian railways and their challenges and drawbacks to implementation as well as a better method of addressing RCF defects. Grinding Quality Index (GQI) is estimated by comparing the measured <b>rail</b> <b>profile</b> with the target <b>rail</b> <b>profile</b> template for the area of material to be removed for a particular grinding pass. Based on the rail surface photos taken by the RIV, the operator decides the additional depth of cut and number of passes based on experience with that track. GQI is currently estimated based on profiles and do not consider RCF. Current GQI does not show any relationship with the RCF cracks and can be very good from a profile perspective, but still can have RCF cracks on the surface. Close monitoring of pre and post grind <b>rail</b> <b>profiles</b> for compliance and inclusion of RCF factor has been proposed as an enhancement to the current GQI for effective assurance on the quality of grinding.

40|$|Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) is {{a problem}} for most railways, heavy or light axle load, slow or high speed. A {{practical}} strategy for controlling RCF is discussed based on a multi-pronged approach of increasing component resistance to initiation and propagation of RCF, reducing applied stresses that cause RCF, and providing a maintenance regime for both controlling RCF and managing the risk associated with rail or wheel failure due to RCF. RCF is influenced by, and can be controlled by improvements to, the wheel <b>profiles,</b> <b>rail</b> <b>profiles,</b> wheel and <b>rail</b> metallurgy, gauge-face and top-of-rail friction coefficients, track geometry standards, and rolling stock characteristics. Mitigation can include wholesale changes to one parameter or selective and more modest changes to several parameters. Since RCF is a threshold phenomena, even a small reduction in the stresses, or modest increase in the strength of the component, can dramatically reduce the number of contact cycles that promote fatigue. For any given railway, the most appropriate approach to controlling fatigue will depend on its specific operating and maintenance strategies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
