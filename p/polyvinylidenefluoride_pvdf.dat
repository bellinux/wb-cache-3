40|$|<b>PVDF</b> (<b>polyvinylidenefluoride)</b> {{membranes}} {{are widely}} used in microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) due to their excellent processability, chemical resistance, well-controlled porosity, and good thermal properties [1]. Moreover this polymer is also frequently adopted in bio-medical devices owing to its good biocompatibility [2]. On the other hand, the use of PVDF membranes in biomedical applications is limited to some extent by the hydrophobicity of their exposed area, which mainly arises from {{the nature of the}} pore surface. Prompted by these considerations in the present work we have studied the modification of PVDF nanoparticles with hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) thus obtaining a modified macromolecular material {{that could be used in}} the preparation of more hydrophilic membranes. The nanoparticles modification is carried out by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in supercritical carbon dioxide as reaction medium. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) allows to perform the modification process in the absence of any toxic solvent and without dissolution of the polymer matrix thus preserving its original morphology. scCO 2 has been object of relevant interest as a medium for polymer processing. The origin of such a plethora of research efforts is the capability of CO 2 to swell and plasticize amorphous domains of macromolecular materials. As a consequence of this attitude the free volume of the amorphous domains of the polymer is increased and this leads to enhancement of the diffusion rate of low molecular weight molecules in the matrix. Owing to the aforementioned mass transfer acceleration effect scCO 2 has been extensively studied as a solubilizing and carrier agent to transport small molecules inside polymer materials [3]. If the solute is a reactive monomer, the scCO 2 assisted infusion can be followed by polymerization and through this route it is possible to prepare a massive composite, a surface modified organic polymer compound or to induce grafting of suitable polar monomers onto the polymer backbone [4]. The ATRP procedure has been used to prepare graft copolymers with regularly-spaced polymer chains from polymeric macroinitiators that have pendant chemical groups containing radically transferable halogen atoms [5]. The halogen atom serves as initiation site for the polymerization of side chains and the reaction is often catalyzed by a suitable coordination complex of the redox couple CuII/CuI. Our research has been designed and carried out to find the operative conditions that allows the operator to have high degree of grafting. To this purpose we have studied the effect of the nature of the ligand, of the copper salt, of the temperature and time of reaction in the ATRP experiments. According to collected data the best results in scCO 2 were obtained using Cu(I) Cl / 4, 4 ′-dimethyl- 2, 2 ′-dipyridyl as catalytic complex at 65 °C, in the presence of benzoyl peroxide with reaction time of 16 hours. Additionally, we used electrochemical techniques in polar organic solvents to investigate the effectiveness of the fluorinated polymer as ATRP macroinitiator and to monitor the relative concentration of the components of the redox couple Cu(I) /Cu(II) during the graft copolymerization.

This study concentrates on the characteristics of single sensors manufactured with this method.

Although slow reactivation of these chains by PVDF• radicals (in contrast to general belief) was recentlydemonstrated, slow radical exchange leads to progressive loss of chain growth control. This article dealswith the possibility of synthesizing block copolymers from PVDF-XA macroCTAs by sequential addition. The investigations show that only PVDFH-XA (chains terminated with the head end of regularly addedVDF) can be reactivated by PNVP• (poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)) radicals and that PVDFT-XA chains are completelyunreactive in the presence of PNVP•, PB• (poly(butylacrylate)) or PDM• (poly(N,N’-dimethylacrylamide)). However, both PVDFH-XA and PVDFT-XA can be reactivated by PVAc• (poly(vinyl acetate)) radicals. The reactivation of the PVDFT-XA, albeit slower than that of the PVDFH-XA, is sufficiently fast toallow the synthesis of unprecedented well-defined PVDF-b-PVAc block copolymers with relatively highend-group fidelity. DFT calculations rationalize this behavior on the basis of faster radical exchange in theorder PVDFH-XA/VAc > PVDFH-XA/NVP > PVDFT-XA/VAc ≫ PVDFT-XA/NVP. The success of the chainextension also relies on faster activation relative to homopropagation of the chain extending monomer, aswell as fast addition of the released PVDF•H and PVDF•T to the monomer...|$|E

However, not much work has been reported {{on the influence of}} the PVDF's orthotropic behavior, particularly the effect of the orientation of the PVDF fihn in the host structure, on the performance of the system. In the present study, the effect of the piezoelectric PVDF fihn orientation on the output voltage, the actuation force, and the dynamic response ofthe integrated structures has been studied using the finite element method. In the sensory mode, the difference between the output voltages obtained from the biaxial piezoelectric PVDF fihn and uniaxial one, when the orientation of the fihn varies from 0 to 90 degree, is investigated. In each case the proportion contnbutions. of the involved piezoelectric coefficients including d 31, dn and d 33 are studied. Alternatively, in the actuation mode, the effect of orthotropic behavior of the actuator on the nodal displacements has been taken into consideration. The influence ofthe material orthotropic property ofthe transducer onthe free undamped response of the system is also investigated. Moreover an effective Young's modulus and effective Poisson ratio for the uniaxial PVDF fihn has been introduced using an optimization procedure to minimize the error caused by isotropic assumption ofuniaxial PVDF fihn...|$|E
40|$|The {{discrimination}} {{induced by}} variable amplitude minipulses (DIVAM) filter can be tuned to select for signals {{from a particular}} domain, therefore {{it is possible to}} obtain signals specific to different domains using only one experiment. An early description of the DIVAM sequence, where the filter terminates with cross-polarization, explains this tune ability using a simple one-spin-relaxation model, thereby limiting the selection mechanism to incoherent processes. Recently, a more complete description of the selection behaviour was offered for the DIVAM filter, when it was directly applied to the observed nucleus (direct DIVAM), taking into account both the incoherent and coherent terms. Direct DIVAM experiments on <b>poly(vinylidenefluoride)</b> (<b>PVDF)</b> show significant phase distortions when large excitation angles were used. The signal from the amorphous domain is seen to nutate in a normal fashion with respect to the excitation angle, while those from the crystalline and defect units did not. The refocused DIVAM sequence is introduced to restore normal nutation for all signals. The selection behaviour is investigated using SIMPSON (simulation program for solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) simulations. These illustrate that the isotropic shift terms have been effectively removed and the dipolar term attenuated, such that the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) leads to domain selection; however, in a different manner than seen in direct DIVAM. Therefore, this sequence provides a method to select {{on the basis of the}} CSA term in the presence of both strong dipolar couplings and a large range of isotropic shifts...|$|E
40|$|Microfiltration {{membranes}} of <b>polyvinylidenefluoride</b> (<b>PVDF)</b> {{are promising}} {{materials for the}} development of functional polymeric membranes. The aim of this work is the investigation of typical plasma processes such as continuous plasma, pulse plasma and plasma graft polymerisation concerning their effect of functionalisation with primary amino groups using a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen, ammonia, allylamine and diaminocyclohexane. The relative amounts of surface-incorporated nitrogen and primary amino groups are determined using electron spectroscopy and the binding of a selective fluorescent probe (Atto Tag FQ). No correlation of the relative amount of surface-bound nitrogen, determined by ESCA, and the relative amount of primary amino groups, determined with Atto Tag FQ, is found. The interpretation of the chemical shift of nitrogen with ESCA is limited. This is due to the unknown ionisation states of the primary amino groups resulting in peak shifts and their overlap with various other nitrogen compounds. The comparison of experiments performed with the same electric energy input but different powers show that the formation of primary amino groups on the surface of PVDF is higher, the lower the power of the plasma is. The formation of primary amine groups is maximised when a grafting method is applied. We explain this phenomenon as a fragmenting plasma effect. This results in an increased abstraction of hydrogen at higher plasma intensities and an augmented formation of a greater variety of nitrogen compounds. Furthermore the effectiveness of diaminocyclohexane as precursor is higher than allylamine, resulting in a higher grafting density...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{development}} of robust but economical hollow fiber ultrafiltration systems {{that could be}} operated with or without electric power to treat polluted surface water. A diverse experimental study was carried out to synthesize novel hollow fiber membranes based on polyphenylsulfone (PPSu) and <b>polyvinylidenefluoride</b> (<b>PVDF)</b> fibers for surface water treatment. A manual hollow fiber spinning machine incorporated with an inexpensive spinneret was designed to fabricate hollow fibers from dope compositions of 20 wt% PVDF in DMAc and 20 wt% PPSu in NMP by phase inversion technique. Isothermal ternary phase diagrams of PVDF or PPSu/solvent/non-solvent systems were established using three different solvents such as N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with water being the non-solvent. The indigenous fibers had an approximate outer diameter of 1. 5 mm and the wall thickness of 0. 25 mm and were housed in inexpensive PVC and UPVC tubes using epoxy resin and nylon end connectors. PVDF hollow fibers (HF) exhibited 94. 8 % turbidity rejection, whereas PPSu fibers exhibited 91 % rejection with 5 log E-Coliform reduction from surface water at a low hydraulic pressure of 1 bar with high flux values of 125 Lm- 2 h- 1 and 73 Lm- 2 h- 1, respectively at a substantial water recovery of 80 %. A water purification device capable of generating 25 Lh- 1 purified water flow at an overhead tank pressure of 0. 5 bar was designed and fabricated for households along with a hand pump operated submerged ultrafiltration (UF) system for treatment of surface water in flood prone regions. Detailed economic estimation of the indigenously designed water purification device for household purpose is presented which shows a low operating cost of 0. 02 US $ per liter of purified water obtained...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OF ATRP PROCESS FOR THE GRAFTING OF VINYL MONOMERS ON PVC AND PVDF Sonia Lanzalaco, Onofrio Scialdone, Alessandro Galia, Rosalia Mauro, Flavia Lazzano Dipartimento di Ingegneria Chimica, Gestionale, Informatica, Meccanica, Viale delle Scienze, Palermo e-mail: sonia. lanzalaco@unipa. it ATRP (atom {{transfer}} radical polymerization) {{has been}} recently used to prepare graft copolymers with regularly-spaced polymer chains from polymeric macroinitiators that have pendant chemical groups containing radically transferable halogen atoms [1]. The halogen atom serves as initiation {{site for the}} polymerization of side chains. Furthermore, Matyjaszewsky and Gennaro showed that an externally applied electrochemical potential can reversibly activate the copper catalyst for this process and demonstrated the dynamic modulation of polymerization rates through electrochemical means, fostering precise temporal control over initiation, cessation, and rejuvenation of the living process [2]. Our group has recently studied the atom transfer radical graft copolymerization by using halogen macroinitiators (<b>polyvinylidenefluoride</b> (<b>PVDF)</b> and polyvinylchloride (PVC)) in organic media and used electrochemical approach to investigate the polymer effectiveness as ATRP macroinitiator and to detect the relative population of the redox couple Cu(I) /Cu(II) during the copolymerization. In particular {{in order to achieve}} preliminary information on the grafting of polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate on PVC and PVDF catalyzed by copper complexes, a study on the behavior of the various components of the system, such as halogenated polymer (PVC or PVDF), copper catalyst (CuCl or CuBr), ligand (TPMA or Me 6 TREN), was carried out by cyclic voltammetric, chronoamperometric and spectrophotometric experiments. Some grafting experiments were also carried out in the more promising operative conditions. [1] J. F. Hester, P. Banerjee, Y. Y. Won, A. Aktakul, M. H. Acar, A. M.
