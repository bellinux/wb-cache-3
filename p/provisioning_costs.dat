Cloud providers are charge for these computing resources based on cloud resource usage. The provided resource plans are reservation and on demand. The computing resources are provisioned by cloud resource provisioning model. In this model resource cost is high due to the difficulty in optimization of resource cost under uncertainty. The resource optimization cost is dealing with an uncertainty of resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>cost.</b> The uncertainty of resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>cost</b> consists: on demand cost, Reservation cost, Expending cost.

Consider a number of groups of machines, for each of which a target aggregate fill rate or target average response time (waiting time) should be met. Between groups, commonality exists, i. e., some parts occur in the material breakdown structure of machines in multiple groups. Instead of using separate stocks per group of machines, we study {{the potential benefits of}} exploiting commonality by using a shared stock for all groups together. For this purpose, we formulate a multi-item single-site spare parts inventory model, with the objective to minimize the spare parts <b>provisioning</b> <b>costs,</b> i. e., inventory holding and transportation costs, under the condition that all service level constraints are met. We develop a heuristic solution procedure using a decomposition approach as in Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, in order to obtain both a heuristic solution and a lower bound for the optimal costs. In a case study and a numerical experiment, we show that significant reductions in spare parts <b>provisioning</b> <b>costs</b> can be obtained by using shared stocks.

However, virtualization raises certain additional challenges, {{and one of them}} is lack of power metering for virtual machines (VMs). Power management requirements in modern data centers have led to most new servers providing power usage measurement in hardware and alternate solutions exist for older servers using circuit and outlet level measurements. However, VM power cannot be measured purely in hardware. We present a solution for VM power metering, named Joulemeter. We build power models to infer power consumption from resource usage at runtime and identify the challenges that arise when applying such models for VM power metering. We show how existing instrumentation in server hardware and hypervisors can be used to build the required power models on real platforms with low error. Our approach is designed to operate with extremely low runtime overhead while providing practically useful accuracy. We illustrate the use of the proposed metering capability for VM power capping, a technique to reduce power <b>provisioning</b> <b>costs</b> in data centers. Experiments are performed on server traces from several thousand production servers, hosting Microsoft’s realworld applications such as Windows Live Messenger. The results show that not only does VM power metering allow virtualized data centers to achieve the same savings that non-virtualized data centers achieved through physical server power capping, but also that it enables further savings in <b>provisioning</b> <b>costs</b> with virtualization...|$|E

In the forwarding service, requests of end users from different regions arrive in real-time to gain live video streams of IP cameras from inter-connected video data centers. A fundamental scheduling problem is how to assign resources with the global optimal resource cost and forwarding delay to forward live video streams. We introduce the resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>cost</b> as the combination of media server cost, connection bandwidth cost, and forwarding delay cost. In this paper, a multi-objective resource provisioning (MORP) approach is proposed {{to deal with the}} online inter-datacenter resource provisioning problem.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to correctly allocate resources in data centers, such that SLA violations and energy consumption are minimized. Our approach first analyzes historical workload traces to identify long-term patterns that establish a “base ” workload. It then employs two techniques to dynamically allocate capacity: predictive provisioning handles the estimated base workload at coarse time scales (e. g., hours or days) and reactive provisioning handles any excess workload at finer time scales (e. g., minutes). The combination of predictive and reactive provisioning achieves a significant improvement in meeting SLAs, conserving energy, and reducing <b>provisioning</b> <b>costs.</b> We implement and evaluate our approach using traces from four production systems. The results show that our approach can provide up to 35 % savings in power consumption and reduce SLA violations {{by as much as}} 21 % compared to existing techniques, while avoiding frequent power cycling of servers.
