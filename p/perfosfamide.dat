50|$|<b>Perfosfamide</b> is an oxazaphosphorine compound, {{similar to}} {{mafosfamide}} and cyclophosphamide. Like those compounds it, is metabolized to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which eventually {{gives rise to}} the two directly cytotoxic metabolites — phosphoramide mustard and acrolein.|$|E

40|$|Loss of DNA {{mismatch}} repair {{is a common}} finding in many types of sporadic human cancers {{as well as in}} tumors arising in patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, The effect of the loss of DNA {{mismatch repair}} activity on sensitivity to a panel of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents was tested using one pair of cell lines proficient or deficient in mismatch repair due to loss of hMSH 2 function and another due to loss of hMLH 1 function, 6 -Thioguanine and N-methyl-N 2 ̆ 7 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, to which these cells are known to be resistant, were included in the panel as controls, The results were concordant in both pairs of cells, Loss of either hMSH 2 or hMLH 1 function was associated with low level resistance to cisplatin, carboplatin, and etoposide, but there was no resistance to melphalan, <b>perfosfamide,</b> 5 -fluorouracil, doxorubicin, or paclitaxel, The results are consistent with the concept that the DNA mismatch repair proteins function as a detector for adducts produced by 6 -thioguanine, N-methyl-N 2 ̆ 7 -nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, cisplatin, and carboplatin but not for melphalan and <b>perfosfamide,</b> They also suggest that these proteins play a role in detecting the DNA damage produced by the binding of etoposide to topoisomerase II and propagating signals that contribute to activation of apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Background Damage of the {{blood-brain barrier}} and {{invasion}} of immunocompetent cells {{into the central}} nervous system represent key events in the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride reduces progression of disability and clinical exacerbations in patients with multiple sclerosis. Its precise mode of action is unclear. Objective To investigate the effects of mitoxantrone on the migratory capacity of immunocompetent cells ex vivo and in vitro. Design Case-control study. Setting Department of Neurology, Heinrich Heine University, D, Germany. Participants Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 11 patients with multiple sclerosis before and after intravenous mitoxantrone treatment; PBMCs from 5 healthy control donors were treated with mitoxantrone in vitro. Main Outcome Measures The migratory capacity was studied in an in vitro Boyden chamber assay; cells and their rates of migration were analyzed by light microscopy and flow cytometry. To determine the specificity of our findings, PBMCs were treated with <b>perfosfamide</b> in vitro. Results Mitoxantrone decreased the migratory capacity of CD 14 + monocytes and (to a lesser degree) of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes. These observations were confirmed when control PBMCs were treated with an equivalent dose of mitoxantrone in vitro. Similar effects were seen when PBMCs were preincubated with <b>perfosfamide.</b> The inhibitory effects of mitoxantrone on the migratory capacity of PBMCs were mediated by reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity, as demonstrated by zymography, polymerase chain reaction, and inhibitory studies. Conclusion Mitoxantrone may inhibit the migration of inflammatory cells into and within {{the central nervous system}}...|$|E
40|$|Loss of DNA {{mismatch}} repair {{is a common}} finding in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer {{as well as in}} many types of sporadic human tumours. We compared the effect of loss of DNA {{mismatch repair}} on drug sensitivity as measured by a clonogenic assay with its effect on the ability of the same drug to enrich for mismatch repair-deficient cells in a proliferating tumour cell population. Mixed populations containing 50 % DNA mismatch repair-deficient cells constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein and 50 % mismatch repair-proficient cells were exposed to different chemotherapeutic agents. 6 -Thioguanine, to which DNA mismatch repair-deficient cells are known to be resistant, was included as a control. The results in the cytotoxicity assays and in the enrichment experiments were concordant. Treatment with either carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide or 6 -thioguanine resulted in enrichment for mismatch repair-deficient cells, and clonogenic assays demonstrated resistance to these agents, which varied from 1. 3 - to 4. 8 -fold. Treatment with melphalan, paclitaxel, <b>perfosfamide</b> or tamoxifen failed to enrich for mismatch repair-deficient cells, and no change in sensitivity to these agents was detected in the clonogenic assays. These results identify the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and doxorubicin as additional agents for which loss of DNA mismatch repair causes drug resistance. The concordance of the results from the two assay systems validates the enrichment assay as a rapid and reliable method for screening for the effect of loss of DNA mismatch repair on sensitivity to additional drugs...|$|E
