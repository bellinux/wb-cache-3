40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{techniques for}} two (or more) camera geometry structured illumination range nders that eliminates most spurious range values {{that arise from}} specular re ections from shiny (e. g. metallic) parts. The key observation is that specular re ections <b>produce</b> <b>range</b> values that depend on camera position. Hence, by using two cameras, several consistency tests can be applied that eliminate most spurious range data. This paper describes the constraints that underly the tests and shows sample performance. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{benefits}} brought {{by the use of}} fully polarimetric radars is the ability to identify scattering mecha- nisms, which are related to the target physical properties. One of the most critical problems in synthetic range-profile recon- struction is the distortion induced by the target motion. Radial target velocity and acceleration generate second- and third-order phase terms in the received signal, which <b>produce</b> <b>range</b> shift and point-spread-function smearing. The distortions induced by the target motion produce, as a consequence, a signal-to-noise ratio loss. Recently, a method based on contrast maximization has been proposed in order to compensate target radial motions using single-polarization data. In this paper, an extension of such an algorithm is proposed that exploits fully polarimetric data in order to improve the target radial motion compensation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} obtaining accurate dense elevation and appearance models of terrain using a single camera on-board an aerial platform, which has many applications including geographical information systems, robot path planning, immersion and visualization, and surveying for scientific purposes such as watershed analysis. When given geo-registered images, the method can compute terrain maps on-line in real time. This algorithm, called the Recursive Multi-frame Planar Parallax algorithm, is a recursive extension of Irani et al. ’s multi-frame planar parallax framework and in theory, with perfectly registered imagery, it will <b>produce</b> <b>range</b> data with error expected to increase between linearly and with the square root of the range, depending on image properties and whether other constants such as framerate and vehicle velocity are held constant. This is an improvement over stereo systems whose expected errors are proportional to {{the square of the}} range. We show experimental evidence on synthetic imagery and on a real video sequence taken in an experiment for autonomous helicopter landing. ...|$|E
40|$|Results from {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to investigate whether centrifugal compressor stability could be improved by injecting air through the diffuser hub surface are reported. The research was conducted in a 4 : 1 pressure ratio centrifugal compressor configured with a vane-island diffuser. Injector nozzles were located just upstream of {{the leading edge of the}} diffuser vanes. Nozzle orientations were set to produce injected streams angled at 8, 0 and + 8 degrees relative to the vane mean camber line. Several injection flow rates were tested using both an external air supply and recirculation from the diffuser exit. Compressor flow range did not improve at any injection flow rate that was tested. Compressor flow range did improve slightly at zero injection due to the flow resistance created by injector openings on the hub surface. Leading edge loading and semi-vaneless space diffusion showed trends similar to those reported earlier from shroud surface experiments that did improve compressor flow range. Opposite trends are seen for hub injection cases where compressor flow range decreased. The hub injection data further explain the range improvement provided by shroud-side injection and suggest that different hub-side techniques may <b>produce</b> <b>range</b> improvement in centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in developing}} stratosphere troposphere (ST) and mesosphere stratosphere troposphere (MST) radars for higher resolution to study small-scale turbulent structures and waves. At present most ST and MST radars have resolutions of 150 meters or larger, and {{are not able to}} distinguish the thin (40 - 100 m) turbulent layers that are known to occur in the troposphere and stratosphere, and possibly in the mesosphere. However the antenna beam width and sidelobe level become important considerations for radars with superior height resolution. The objective {{of this paper is to}} point out that for radars with range resolutions of about 150 meters or less, there may be significant range smearing of the signals from mesospheric altitudes due to the finite beam width of the radar antenna. At both stratospheric and mesospheric heights the antenna sidelobe level for lear equally spaced phased arrays may also <b>produce</b> <b>range</b> aliased signals. To illustrate this effect the range smearing functions for two vertically directed antennas have been calculated, (1) an array of 32 coaxial-collinear strings each with 48 elements that simulates the vertical beam of the Poker Flat, Glaska, MST radar; and (2) a similar, but smaller, array of 16 coaxial-collinear strings each with 24 elements...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the last}} Hubble Servicing Mission five years ago, the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (SSCO) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has been {{focusing}} on maturing the technologies necessary to robotically service orbiting legacy assets-spacecraft not necessarily designed for in-flight service. Raven, SSCO's next orbital experiment to the International Space Station (ISS), is a real-time autonomous non-cooperative relative navigation {{system that will}} mature the estimation algorithms required for rendezvous and proximity operations for a satellite-servicing mission. Raven will fly as a hosted payload {{as part of the}} Space Test Program's STP-H 5 mission, which will be mounted on an external ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC) and will image the many visiting vehicles arriving and departing from the ISS as targets for observation. Raven will host multiple sensors: a visible camera with a variable field of view lens, a long-wave infrared camera, and a short-wave flash lidar. This sensor suite can be pointed via a two-axis gimbal to provide a wide field of regard to track the visiting vehicles as they make their approach. Various real-time vision processing algorithms will <b>produce</b> <b>range,</b> bearing, and six degree of freedom pose measurements that will be processed in a relative navigation filter to produce an optimal relative state estimate. In this overview paper, we will cover top-level requirements, experimental concept of operations, system design, and the status of Raven integration and test activities...|$|E
40|$|While at JSC for {{the summer}} of 2011, I was {{assigned}} {{to work on the}} sensor test for Orion relative-navigation risk mitigation (STORRM) development test objective (DTO). The STORRM DTO was flown on-board Endeavor during STS- 134. The objective of the STORRM DTO is to test the visual navigation system (VNS), which will be used as the primary relative navigation sensor for the Orion spacecraft. The VNS is a flash lidar system intended to provide both line of sight and range information during rendezvous and proximity operations. The STORRM DTO also serves as a testbed for the high-resolution docking camera. This docking camera will be used to provide piloting cues for the crew during proximity operations. These instruments were mounted next to the trajectory control sensor (TCS) in Endeavour s payload bay. My principle objective {{for the summer}} was to generate a best estimated trajectory (BET) for Endeavor using the flight data collected by the VNS during rendezvous and the unprecedented re-rendezvous with the ISS. I processed the raw images from the VNS to <b>produce</b> <b>range</b> and bearing measurements. I then aggregated these measurements and extracted the measurements corresponding to individual reflectors. I combined the information contained in these measurements with data from the Endeavour's inertial sensors using Kalman smoothing techniques to ultimately produce a BET. This work culminated with a final presentation of the result to division management. Development of this tool required that traditional linear smoothing techniques be modified in a novel fashion to permit for the inclusion of non-linear measurements. This internship has greatly helped me further my career by providing exposure to real engineering projects. I also have benefited immensely from the mentorship of the engineers working on these projects. Many of the lessons I learned and experiences I had are of particular value because then can only be found in a place like JSC...|$|E
