40|$|Abstract — In future hybrid {{automotive}} applications {{there will}} be multiple voltage systems in a single vehicle. It is desirable to have bi-directional, isolated power flow between these different voltage levels. The three-port power converter is able to achieve full bi-directional power flow by using a high-frequency transformer, with three windings, connected to a full-bridge converter on each winding or port. The normal control of the power flow between the ports is via <b>phase-shift</b> <b>control</b> of the individual full-bridge converters. However in the automotive application, there may be only a single power source for the initial powering up {{of the system and}} in this case, <b>phase-shift</b> <b>control</b> {{can not be used to}} start-up the converter system. This paper presents a start-up method for the three-port converter in which the converter is first operated in a buck-mode, followed by an output voltage boosting mode, and is able to finally operate with normal <b>phase-shift</b> <b>control.</b> Detailed analysis of the buck and boost mode during start-up is presented and verified by simulation.

Unlike a conventional resonant converter, which utilizes a single inverter and a single rectifier, this Impedance Control Network (ICN) resonant converter has multiple inverters and one or more rectifiers. It also utilizes a lossless impedance control network, which provides a differential phase shift in the voltages and currents, whereby the effective impedances seen at the inverter outputs look purely resistive at the fundamental frequency, enabling switching of the inverters at zero current. By modifying the network for slightly inductive loading of the inverters, one can realize simultaneous ZVS and near-ZCS across wide operating ranges.
