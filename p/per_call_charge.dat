50|$|Pay-per-call (PPCall, {{also called}} cost-per-call) is an {{advertising}} {{model in which}} the rate paid by the advertiser {{is determined by the}} number of telephone calls made by viewers of an ad. Pay <b>Per</b> <b>Call</b> providers <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>call,</b> <b>per</b> impression or per conversion. It is similar to online pay per click (PPC) advertising, but induces the viewer to make a telephone call instead of viewing an external website. Both enterprises looking to reach certain locations, or local/regional businesses can benefit from Pay <b>Per</b> <b>Call</b> campaigns, because it allows customers to talk with the seller before buying a product or service. Vendors of pay-per-call advertising attribute the growth of the model to the popularity of smartphones and claim that it reduces the costs of on-line click fraud. Pay-per-call advertising is {{not to be confused with}} premium-rate telephone numbers. Pay-per-call is the inverse of a premium telephone number, in that the advertiser who receives the call, not the caller, is charged for the service. Since it is cost per lead advertising, the rates are higher than for toll-free telephone number service. In general, the advertiser is only billed for calls that last at least one minute.|$|R
5000|$|A 1-900 {{telephone}} number, in the North American Numbering Plan, has {{the form}} 1-900-###-####, {{and is often}} called a 900 number or a 1-900 number ("one-nine-hundred"). Area Code 900 went into service January 1, 1971, but the first {{known to have been}} used in the United States for the [...] "Ask President Carter" [...] program in March 1977, for incoming calls to a nationwide talk radio broadcast featuring the newly elected President Jimmy Carter, hosted by anchorman Walter Cronkite. At that time, the intent for area code 900 was as a choke exchange—a code that blocked large numbers of simultaneous callers from jamming up the long distance network. Numbers with the 900 area code were those which were expected to have a huge number of potential callers, and the 900 area code was screened at the local level to allow only a certain number of the callers in each area to access the nationwide long distance network for reaching the destination number. Also, the early incarnation of 900 was not billed at premium-rate charges, but rather at regular long distance charges based on the time of day and day of week that the call was placed. The number used for the radio program was one that was specially arranged by AT&T Corporation, CBS Radio, and the White House, to be free to the calling party. However, by 1980, the 900 area code was completely restructured by AT&T to be the premium-rate special area code which it remains today. At that time, many evening news agencies conducted [...] "pulse polls" [...] for $.50 <b>per</b> <b>call</b> <b>charges</b> and displayed results on television. One early use was by Saturday Night Live producers for the sketch [...] "Larry the Lobster", featuring Eddie Murphy. The comedy sketch drew nearly 500,000 calls. AT&T and the producers of SNL split the profits of nearly $250,000.|$|R
