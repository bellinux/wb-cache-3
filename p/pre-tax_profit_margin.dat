Lenovo planned significant product releases in those markets in 2013. Yang said Lenovo is pursuing this strategy due to its thin <b>pre-tax</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> of only 2.6%.

5000|$|The {{organization}} stresses four {{principles for}} successful, long-term investing. The last principle was added and {{emphasized in the}} 1980s and '90s. These principles are: 1) invest regularly, regardless of market conditions; 2) re-invest all earnings; 3) invest in growth companies (and growth mutual funds); and 4) diversify to reduce risk. The heart of the NAIC approach to investing is the third principle -- investing in growth companies. The primary tool to evaluate common stocks is a two-page form with a semi-log graph on the front called the Stock Selection Guide (SSG). The SSG dates to {{the founding of the}} organization and was created by George A. Nicholson.

40|$|In the USA, {{prescription}} drug prices are largely unregulated. In most other countries, however, drug prices are regulated. This is typically accomplished directly through price controls (e. g. France and Italy), indirectly through limits on reimbursement under {{social insurance schemes}} (e. g. Germany and Japan), or indirectly through profit controls (e. g. the United Kingdom). Using current data on firm <b>pre-tax</b> pharmaceutical <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> {{and the proportion of}} firm pharmaceutical sales subjected to price regulation (i. e., non-US pharmaceutical sales), it is demonstrated that price regulation may be exerting a substantially negative influence on pharmaceutical price-cost margins. The analysis finds that pharmaceutical price-cost margins in the USA are, on average, approximately four times higher than non-US pharmaceutical price-cost margins. While price regulation may not be the only factor responsible for this striking difference in price-cost margins, {{it is likely to be}} a prominent factor. ...|$|R
