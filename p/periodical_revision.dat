40|$|The Portuguese {{road design}} {{guidelines}} have undergone <b>periodical</b> <b>revisions,</b> aiming at updating {{technical aspects of}} the geometric design of road elements and enlarging the field of their application to various types of roads and intersections. The National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC), through its Transportation Department, has provided scientific and technical support and advice to the road administrations along this process. At the present stage, a proposal made by LNEC points out {{to the need for}} a thorough reformulation of the whole set of documents which are currently being used in Portugal as road design guidelines, in order to introduce a greater integration among them, and new technical advances based on scientific ground. A strategy to carry out that reformulation is being followed, which involves the setting up of an encompassing framework centred in a so called “base document” which contains common concepts and technical indications to which all the guidelines for specific types of roads must comply with. In this paper a presentation is made on the main characteristics of the said “base document” prepared by LNEC, as well as the rationale underlying the introduction of a road safety approach into not only the conceptual frame but also the definition of road geometric design parameters and acceptable limit values, more closely related to the human component, which are derived, for example, from the assessment of driver’s behaviour characterization, using the results {{of a large number of}} measurements in Portuguese and other European road networks...|$|R

5000|$|The {{following}} notes {{appear in}} the Explanatory Statement at start of Return:The greatest difficulty was found as to these columns.The parish lists are prepared only {{for the purposes of}} rating, and the material columns for the purpose of the assessments are those which contain the names of the occupiers and the statements of the gross estimated rental and rateable value of the property in each separate occupation. The latter statements are essential to show the basis upon which the rate is to be assessed and the sums to be paid, whilst the insertion of the names of the occupiers is required to point out the persons who are liable for the several amounts assessed.With regard to the column as to the names of the owners, however, it must be observed that although the prescribed form both of the poor rates and the valuation lists indicates that the name of the owner of the property in each separate occupation should be inserted in it, the overseers who prepare the lists are not empowered, {{as in the case of}} the valuation lists prepared under the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, to require any return of the names of the owners to be made to them, either by the occupiers or any other persons, and probably neither the valuation lists nor the rates would be invalidated if the names of the owners were omitted altogether.Nor is it easy, with the various tenures of property in this country, to lay down a precise rule as to what constitutes ownership.Persons, for instance, holding property under very long leases may fairly be considered as owners; but then the question immediately arises, what length of lease is sufficient for this purpose.There could be no question, as was said in the House of Lords, as to lessees for 999 years; and indeed lessees for shorter terms than that might properly be considered as owners.A more difficult question arose as to lessees for 99 years, the common term of building leases, and also as to some other cases.It was said on the one hand, that the holder of a building lease for 99 years, with occupying tenants under him, especially at the commencement of his term, might fairly be considered as an owner on the other that the holder of such a lease, when his term had nearly expired, could not be so considered. In some parts of England lands are frequently held on leases for lives constantly renewed, though without any right of renewal, and the lessees are generally treated as owners, though liable to be turned out on the expiration of the lives. Other cases of doubtful ownership might easily be suggested, and it became clear that only an arbitrary line could be drawn.After much consideration it was determined that lessees for terms exceeding 99 years, or with a right of perpetual renewal, should be considered as owners, but that lessees for terms of shorter duration, or for lives, without a right of renewal, should not be so considered.Instructions were issued to the Union Clerks to frame their Returns in accordance with this rule; but notwithstanding this direction, it is extremely probable that in several instances where properties have been held for long periods on beneficial leases or for lives, as is the case in some parts of England, the names of the lessees have been entered in the Return as owners, as neither the clerks nor the overseers would have had any reason to suppose that they were not the owners in fee.In some of the Rating Acts the term [...] "owner" [...] means either the immediate lessor of the premises, or the person receiving the rent of the same [...] "for the use of any corporation or any public company, or of any landlord or lessee who shall be a minor or married woman, or insane, or for the use of any person for whom he is acting as agent". It is obvious that such persons are not really the owners of the property, and directions were therefore given, that whenever it was within the knowledge of the clerk or the overseers that the names of trustees, receivers, or other persons not beneficially interested in the property were entered in the owners' column, the names of the actual owners, if ascertainable, should be substituted.In the case of joint owners it is probable that in many cases one name only will have been returned as owner, though the clerks were directed, whenever the name and address of each owner could be ascertained, to insert them.Moreover, the Act does not require any <b>periodical</b> <b>revision</b> of the valuation lists as under the Metropolis Valuation Act of 1869, and a mere change of ownership would not render the preparation of a supplemental valuation list, or the revision of an existing list necessary. In some cases it was found that the names of owners who had died several years ago had been retained. In one instance where a property had been sold in lots, it appeared that the names of the new owners had not been inserted in the valuation list, and the single name of the former owner was still in the list. To obviate the difficulty from this source, the clerks were directed, when they were aware that changes in ownership had taken place, to substitute the names of the present owners in the Returns, and to apply to the overseers or rate collectors to assist in revising the Returns before their final completion.Although the foregoing remarks refer chiefly to the Owners column in the Valuation Lists, it should be stated that this column has been found to be filled up with still less accuracy in the rate books in those parishes where the Union Assessment Committee Act is not in force. This observation applies to several important towns, where, owing to the large number of separate occupations, and the fact that the rents are paid in numerous cases to lessees, trustees, or agents, the difficulties of ascertaining the names of the owners or ground landlords may be said to be almost insurmountable.When the necessary particulars relating to all the Unions in each county had been received by the Local Government Board, it became the duty of that Department to arrange and consolidate the separate parish and union returns into one Return for the whole county, and in doing this a further difficulty arose.To make a correct county Return, the name of each owner ought to appear only once, and all the property belonging to him within the county should be included under his name.When, however, the same name appeared more than once in the several Union lists, the Board in London could not determine whether there were two or more persons with the same name, or whether the name of the same person was repeated.For the purpose as far as possible of identifying the owners, it had been required that their names and addresses, when the latter could be ascertained, should be given in full and as accurately as possible.Where the same name with the same address occurred more than once in the returns, it might be assumed as probable that the entries referred to the same person, but when the same name occurred with a different address, it was probable, though by no means certain, that different persons were intended. In all these cases it became necessary to communicate with the clerks of the several Unions in which the name appeared, to ascertain if it referred to the same or different persons thus, for example, the name of John Smith might appear in a county 12 times, and in as many different Unions, and inquiry had to be made in each Union to ascertain whether the name indicated one and the same person, or whether they were 12 separate persons of that name.A reference to some of the Welsh counties, where there are large numbers of owners of the same Christian and surnames, e.g., the county of Cardigan, where the name David Davies occurs above 53 times, and John Jones above 70 times, will show the labour involved in this branch of the inquiry, and it may be added that, independently of other inquiries, upwards of 300,000 separate applications had to be sent to the clerks to clear up questions in reference to duplicate entries.In some cases it has been found impracticable to discover the addresses of the owners, and whenever there is a single entry in the address column within brackets it must be understood to show the parish in which the [...] property is situate and not the residence of the owner; where there are two entries in the address column, one of them in brackets, it indicates that it has been ascertained that the two persons with the same address are two distinct persons.Where the owners appear to be corporate bodies, or to hold their lands in virtue of a public office, the names are printed in italics; but the Return must not be assumed to be complete in this respect, as there is reason to believe that in many cases the name of an individual is entered instead of the body or office which he represents, and this remark applies especially to glebe lands.Notwithstanding all the care that has been taken, there can be no doubt that in several cases the name of the same person will appear more than once in the county Return, but, on the other hand, there will be many cases in which only one name will appear as owner, although the property is really in several hands.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the creation of the EU Water Framework Directive and its implementation in the jurisprudence of the ECJ. It represents {{one of the most important}} acts in the field of environmental protection in the European Union. Its provisions are related to the establishment of the objectives of the environment quality, for surface waters and groundwater, for regulation of disposal of dangerous substances in those waters or for monitoring and sampling of waters. The Directive extends the objectives of environmental protection over the existing legislation of the EU and it includes and extends the criteria for the control of waste disposal and provides a comprehensive framework for control and reporting in this field. The Directive envisages that Member States would provide the establishment of registers of all areas lying within each river basin which have been designated as requiring special protection under specific EU legislation for the protection of their surface water and groundwater or for the conservation of habitats and species directly depending on water. In order to establish a coherent and comprehensive overview of water status, Member States should provide the establishment of programmes for the monitoring of water status within each river basin district. Monitoring is needed in order to establish the efficiency of planes of management of river basins and to help in the process of their <b>periodical</b> <b>revisions.</b> The ECJ, in its judgments, has insisted on implementation of the Directive although not excessively formalistic.

40|$|Despite {{changes in}} methods of {{transferring}} information, printed publications are still an important means of spreading knowledge {{and have an}} established position among academics.

5000|$|While lecturing in Lahore, Sabhāpati met {{his editor}} Sriṣa Chandra Vasu (Bengali: Basu) (1861-1918), an educated Bengali civil servant and Sanskritist who himself moved in Theosophical circles and {{published}} widely on yoga, including an early {{edition of the}} Śiva-saṃhitā. Mark Singleton points out in his landmark study that Vasu later came to be an icon of early 20th century Hindu revivalism. Together they published Sabhāpati's lectures in English with transliterated Sanskrit terms as early as 1880, over fifteen years before Swami Vivekananda's Rāja Yoga (1896), the publication of which Elizabeth De Michelis convincingly demonstrates as marking the birth of modern yoga. The original title of Sabhāpati's work was Om: a treatise on Vedantic Raj Yoga and Philosophy (1880), and it attracted even the attention of Indologists such as Max Müller, who cites it in his work The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy (1899). Henry Olcott's personal copy of this book has also been located in the library at Adyar, and reviews of it and Sabhāpati's other works populate early Theosophical <b>periodicals.</b> Elaborations and <b>revisions</b> of this 1880 text were later published in various languages, including in Sanskrit, Hindi and a Tamil version that, if the account of Sabhāpati's [...] "admirer" [...] is to be believed, likely contains material that predates the 1880 work in English. One of the most notable versions {{is a much more}} precisely edited and visually stunning two-part volume entitled Om: Cosmic Psychological Spiritual Philosophy and Science, published four years later in 1884. This work combined material published in 1880 with even more practical instructions, visual diagrams and associative correspondences. Another version was published in 1892 in Sanskrit (Devanāgarī script) and Hindi, using the Sanskrit version of the previous work's title, Rājayoga brahmajñānānubhūti saṅgraha veda.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{power storage}} {{as a key}} option to support wind energy integration. The case study is the French power system, whose characteristics rely on high rates of nuclear power and a strong emerging wind energy market. A dynamic optimization dispatching model is used to simulate {{the operation of the}} power system, under two development scenarios of the technology mix by 2030, one scenario documented by European Commission, EC [1], and a second one by French Transmission System Operator, RTE [2]. Both scenarios result in power storage requirements of around 7 TWh for more than 4 GW installed storage capacity of pumped hydro power plants in France as a whole. In this context, it is assessed the profitability of an additional regional project of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) located in the region of Bretagne. It shows how benefits could accrue by avoiding the regional wind curtailment of 59 GWh, by providing ancillary services such as secondary reserve, and by increasing the use of grid assets and the nuclear power output with more than 230 GWh. The profitability of the CAES project remains however negative, around - 70 €/MWh despite the social value and the system benefits that results in. The study assesses possible ways to incentivize the investment in new storage projects, through for instance contracts for difference, which would link the storage operation, its investment cost and stage of development to the power market design via power prices and a pre-defined rate of return. The <b>periodical</b> <b>revision</b> of these regulatory arrangements would enable the storage investor to recover the investment cost and would eliminate the risk of over rewarding generators in the case of windfall profits.
