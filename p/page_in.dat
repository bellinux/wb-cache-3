5|$|A further {{six years}} elapsed before Nine Inch Nails' fourth {{full-length}} album. With Teeth {{was released in}} May 2005, though it was leaked prior to its official release date. The album was written and recorded throughout 2004 following Reznor's battle with alcoholism and substance abuse and legal issues with his former manager, John Malm Jr. With Teeth debuted {{on top of the}} Billboard 200, Nine Inch Nails' second reign at number one with an album. The album's package lacks typical liner notes; instead it simply lists the names of songs and co-producers, and the URL for an online PDF poster with lyrics and full credits. The entire album was made available in streaming audio on the band's official MySpace <b>page</b> <b>in</b> advance of its release date.|$|E
5|$|As a {{guide to}} the {{contents}} of each chapter, musical notations were added before the chapter number. In School Rumble, chapters marked with a sharp sign(♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign(♭). The one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder, which uses the natural sign(♮). School Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one <b>page</b> <b>in</b> length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story.|$|E

Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and <b>Page</b> <b>in</b> tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.|$|E

Despite having committed to die without shedding a tear, she weeps as she realises her father has murdered her husband. She adds poison to the cup containing Guiscardo's heart, and commits suicide by drinking it.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Bradley {{became a}} <b>page</b> <b>in</b> the Kentucky House of Representatives. He studied law under his father, one of Kentucky's leading {{criminal}} defense lawyers. Although Kentucky law required that anyone taking the bar examination {{be at least}} twenty-one years old, Bradley was allowed by a special provision of the state legislature to take it at age eighteen. This arrangement was contingent on Bradley's being judged competent by two circuit judges. Despite having no college education, Bradley passed the exam and was licensed in 1865, joining his father's firm in Lancaster. He later received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Kentucky University (now Transylvania University).|$|E

5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley <b>Page</b> <b>in</b> response to B.35/46 {{was given the}} internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Orion and Oenopion also varies. One source refers to Merope as {{the wife of}} Oenopion and not his {{daughter}}. Another refers to Merope {{as the daughter of}} Minos and not of Oenopion. The longest version (a <b>page</b> <b>in</b> the Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman Cornelius Gallus to make into Latin verse. It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called Aëro or Leiro. Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.|$|E
