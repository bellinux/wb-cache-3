40|$|With the {{increasing}} size of typical 2 D and 3 D data, e cient computational methods {{are becoming increasingly}} crucial for achieving desired levels of interactivity. Computation of isocontours from scalar data is a particularly critical task for comprehensive visualization of volume data. In {{the case that the}} volume is discretized by a mesh of volumetric cells, the extraction of an isocontour consists of two <b>primary</b> phases: <b>triangulation</b> of a particular cell and the search for all intersected cells. In this chapter we will review and contrast the primary algorithmic approaches which have been suggested in the literature. Isocontouring is a widely used approach to the visualization of scalar data and an integral component of almost every visualization environment. Computation of isocontours has applications in visualization ranging from extraction of surfaces from medical volume data [Lor 95] to computation of stream surfaces for ow visualization [van 93]...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the disability support service (DSS) office designs at three varying U. S. postsecondary institutions and their relationship to the experiences of students with a learning disability. The three postsecondary institutions represent a community college, a medium sized university and a large research university all-residing in a single bellwether state. Selection of the cases and postsecondary institutions was carefully done in order to investigate a diverse range of institutional environments potentially influencing the design of their disability services. Conducted at three U. S. postsecondary institutions, participants in this study included federal/state officials, disability support service coordinators, faculty members and students with a learning disability. All participation was conducted via online utilizing Skype and an online questionnaire service (Freeonlinesurveys. com). Using DSS coordinators, faculty members and students as <b>primary</b> sources, a <b>triangulation</b> of responses and experiences contributed to the multi-perspective depiction of the three DSS designs. Adopting a multi-frame theoretical framework on organizations, Bolman and Deal’s four-frame model provided the analytical tool from which the three DSS cases were viewed and their actions supported. The data shows little difference between the three DSS designs at the three postsecondary institutions; instead sharing many similarities between the experiences of DSS coordinators, faculty members and students with a learning disability. Established and culturally accepted on postsecondary campuses over the years as a resource for those seeking information and support for learning disability issues, all three DSS offices have created a similar niche at their respectful institutions. Unanimously regarded as a necessity by postsecondary institutions, coordinators, faculty members and students, the DSS offices are an essential factor in the continuous commitment to provide equal opportunity for students with a learning disability...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The {{integration}} of complementary therapies (CTs) with an emerging evidence base into conventional care services is common, despite limited evidence {{as to the}} clinical effectiveness of comprehensive models delivering such care, i. e. integrative medicine (IM). Low back and neck pain (LBP/NP) {{are two of the}} most common reasons for people to use CTs. The objectives of this thesis were to develop, implement and explore the relevance of IM as a potential health service option in Swedish primary care. Methods: Acknowledging IM as a complex health care intervention, both qualitative and quantitative research approaches were used in this thesis. During the development of the IM model, an action research approach with focus groups and key informant meetings with multiple conventional and CT stakeholders was utilised. The development progressed through iterative cycles of data collection, analysis, refinement of strategies and actions following research group consensus, followed by further data collection (immersion/crystallisation). Perceived facilitators, barriers and strategies were identified and findings were categorised within a public health science framework of IM model structures, processes and outcomes. The feasibility and comparative effectiveness of IM vs. conventional primary care was investigated in a pragmatic pilot randomised clinical trial (RCT) of 80 patients with LBP/NP. Parametric and nonparametric statistics were used to explore outcome changes between groups after four months: SF- 36 (main); self-rated disability, stress and well-being (0 - 10 scales), days in pain and the use of health care resources including analgesics, conventional care and CTs. Perspectives on receiving care were explored through focus group discussions with patients from the RCT and analysed by content analysis. A health economic evaluation was conducted alongside the RCT to explore the likelihood of the IM model being a cost-effective health service option. Results: The developed IM model adhered to standard clinical practice procedures and involved active partnership between a gatekeeping general practitioner collaborating with a team of certified/licensed CT providers (Swedish massage therapy, manipulative therapy/naprapathy, shiatsu, acupuncture and qigong) in a consensus case conference model of care. The implementation of the IM model was feasible and most patients were women with chronic (≥ 3 months) LBP/NP. The conventional care mainly consisted of pain management advice (stay active) and analgesics, occasionally complemented by short-term sick leave or a physiotherapy referral. In addition to this, the IM model integrated seven sessions of two different CTs over 10 weeks on average. It was found that the pilot RCT was underpowered to detect statistically significant differences between groups, and that a full-scale RCT would require a minimum of 120 patients. However, the trend in the clinical quantitative results with an increase in the SF- 36 domain Vitality and a decrease in the use of analgesics favoured IM. In addition, the qualitative findings indicated that the interviewed patients valued the IM combination of conventional biomedical diagnostic procedures with empowering CT self-help strategies. There was a conservative likelihood (67 %) of the IM model being cost-effective at a threshold of EUR 50, 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Conclusion: Identification of IM facilitators, barriers and strategies by the different stakeholders contributed to feasible implementation within Swedish <b>primary</b> care. <b>Triangulation</b> of the various results suggests that IM is at least as effective as conventional care, with potential clinical benefits including empowerment and reduced need for analgesics. To verify the relevance of IM in Swedish primary care, future research should prioritise larger trials considering large variability, chronic pain duration, small to moderate effects, indirect costs and longer-term follow-up while adopting a mixed methods approach considering both general and disease-specific outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} the present study are {{summarized}} as follows; (1) From the results of re-triangulation of the <b>primary</b> <b>triangulation</b> points in the central part of Taiwan, where the destructive earthquake of 1935 occurred, the horizontal strain components are calculated for each triangle having three adjoining triangulation points at their vertices. The geographical distribution of rotation, dilatation, shear, maximum shear, as well as the principal strains, are shown. (2) The mode of deformation is discussed on the basis of two different assumptions. The one that the deformation is continuous in the zone of active faults and the other that the deformation is discontinuous there. (3) In that region where the epicentres of the after-shocks were concentrated, the earth's crust was elevated in a marked manner, as it had already done in other districts. (3) A linear relation between the horizontal and the vertical disturbances was noticed, and its physical meaning considered. In conclusion, the writers wish to express their sincere thanks to Professor Sakuhei Fujiwhara for his suggesting the subject for study, and to Doctor Naomi Miyabe for much information and kind guidance received throughout the course of this study. 昭和 10 年 4 月 21 日の臺中新竹烈震後行はれた復舊測量に依つて地震前後數年間に於ける地殼變動が明らかにされた．本論文はそれを取扱つたものである．今囘は一等三角點と一等水準點との變動に就いて論ずるに止めた．水平の歪の計算に當つては二つの別な方法を取つた．第一は各三角内で變移が連続であると假定して行つたもので，その結果は第 4 圖～第 7 圖に示してある．紙湖斷層附近では，それに垂直な縮みが大きく，屯子脚斷層附近ではそれに略平行な縮みが大きい．垂直變動については紙湖斷層の四側に二つの隆起部分が有り，而もそれが餘震の頻發地域に近接してゐる事が著しい．最後に垂直變動と水平變動とを併せ考へて見た．即ち數學的に假りに定義した「水平のdisturbance」と「垂直のdisturbance」とを色々の地域に就いて比較した所，兩者の間に稍明瞭な關係を得たので之に對する物理的解釋を述べておいた...|$|E

However, the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Office of the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGOF) have set up a surveying infrastructure throughout the country known as the Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS); to replace the traditional geodetic passive networks which are the basic infrastructure for Surveying and Mapping in any country. The eventual purpose is national development, security and defence, which is in line with the government’s endeavour to improve its delivery mechanism.
