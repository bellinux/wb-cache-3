50|$|As {{part of a}} {{promotion}} involving the Chuck Wagon line of dog food, Purina contracted video game distributor Spectravision to create a game themed around dogs and dog food.

50|$|An {{example of}} over-redemption {{insurance}} {{would be if}} a company is running a promotion in which consumers must collect a certain number <b>of</b> <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> from a yogurt lid {{in order to receive}} a $100 prize. The company may predict a 20% response rate (i.e. 20% of all consumers will participate in the promotion and actively collect the yogurt lids).

A company may choose to either purchase coverage for up to the full 100% response rate, from 20-50% response, or coverage as their budget allows.|$|R
50|$|The {{show was}} {{initially}} sponsored by Ovaltine, a flavored milk supplement, and its scripts {{were written by}} Ovaltine's Chicago ad agency staff.

Fans could redeem Ovaltine <b>proofs</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> for a secret decoder badge that decoded brief messages airing in the last moments of the show. Contrary to an urban legend made popular by the film A Christmas Story, the messages were never advertisements for Ovaltine, but were usually related to the following episode. In 1940, Quaker Puffed Wheat Sparkies became the show's sponsor and brought fictional aviator Captain Sparks to the show. Sparks eventually became the star, relegating Annie to secondary player.|$|R
