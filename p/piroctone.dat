40|$|The "half-head " {{technique}} {{can be used}} as {{a suitable}} and reliable method for comparative evaluation of the efficacy of antidandruff agents. Two modes of experimental design which differ in schedule and scoring system are described. Data are given for shampoos and cream rinses containing the new antidandruff agent <b>PIROCTONE</b> OLAMINE [1 -hydroxy- 4 -methyl- 6 -(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) - 2 (1 H) -pyridone ethanolamine salt] in comparison tothe corresponding onmedicated formulations as well as to the same shampoo bases containing ZINC PYRITHIONE as a known efficacious antidandruff agent. <b>Piroctone</b> olamine has been demonstrated to be highly effective in the treatment of dandruff and more effective than zinc pyrithione at the same concentration (p< 0. 05). An appreciable effect on skin lipid regeneration rate could not be measured.

40|$|Dandruff {{is known}} to be {{controlled}} by fungistatic shampoos active against Malassezia spp. These products also remove the loosely attached scales. This study was performed to assess the effect of a 5 -min residence time on the efficacy of antidandruff shampoos. Two commercially available shampoos were used in two groups of 21 panelists with severe dandruff. They contained either 1 % ketoconazole or 1 % <b>piroctone</b> olamine. In each group, intraindividual comparisons were made by a split-scalp design between the effect of a 5 -min residence time versus no residence time. Both shampoos induced significant reductions in scaliness and yeast colonization. The beneficial effects were obvious immediately after one single shampooing and 3 days later as well. The improvement was greater with a 5 -min residence time. The <b>piroctone</b> olamine treatment benefited more than the ketoconazole treatment from the extension of shampoo-exposure time. In conclusion, the benefit of a residence time in treating dandruff is documented. The level of improvement in efficacy may vary according {{to the nature of the}} shampoo. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the effectiveness of a product containing hydroxypropyl chitosan, Climbazole and <b>Piroctone</b> olamine, by monitoring the adherence and the penetration of the molecules in the skin. Confocal microscopy led us to show the persistence of the active compound for a long time in the stratum corneum, thanks to the presence of hydroxypropyl chitosan. This evidence suggests a new protocol of application (a biweekly application, rather than daily) ...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim: Dandruff is {{a common}} scalp problem {{associated}} with flaky and inflamed skin. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a shampoo containing <b>piroctone</b> olamine and climbazole and the combination of this shampoo with a scalp tonic containing <b>piroctone</b> olamine and licochalcone A, derived from G lycyrrhiza inflata root extract, to reduce dandruff. Study Design/Methods: After conditioning, 102 subjects (♂ 56 and 46 ♀) with moderate to very strong dandruff affection underwent a randomized half head study for 4 weeks. The volunteers’ heads were washed regularly either with a placebo or the anti-dandruff shampoo, followed by the anti-dandruff tonic application or no treatment. In a 2 -week post-treatment phase, subjects only applied placebo shampoo. Every two weeks, trained experts assessed dandruff affection based {{on a scale of}} 1 to 6. At study start and after every 2 weeks, cytokine concentrations and anti-fungal activity of test products were determined in scalp wash-ups by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays or a Malassezia colony-forming assay, respectively. Results: Results of expert grading and anti-fungal activity revealed a significant reduction in dandruff affection and Malassezia colony-forming units after treatment with the anti-dandruff shampoo or its combination with the tonic. Dandruff affection even remained reduced in the post-treatment phase when levels of Malassezia colony-forming units had returned to baseline. Cytokine analyses proved a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory dandruff markers after treatment with both anti-dandruff products. For the shampoo/tonic combination, a superior reduction of one scalp inflammatory marker was determined even after the post-treatment phase. Conclusion: Both the rinse-off shampoo as well as its combination with the leave-on tonic excellently alleviated dandruff and its associated micro-inflammation. Both treatments showed anti-fungal activity. The superior benefit, exerted by the combination, is primarily based on the known anti-inflammatory effect of licochalcone A and the improved scalp substantivity of the leave-on application. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background: It was {{recently}} {{confirmed that the}} antifungal agent ciclopirox olamine inhibits Wnt/beta catenin signaling in myeloma. <b>Piroctone</b> olamine (PO) has very similar chemical features to ciclopirox olamine. Materials and Methods: This study investigated the antitumor effect of PO in vitro and in vivo in a murine myeloma model. Results: PO demonstrated a major apoptotic activity in various human and murine myeloma and lymphoma cell lines, {{as well as in}} human primary cells. In vivo, tumor growth, as well as overall survival, was significantly reduced in mice treated with PO as compared to untreated mice. Interestingly, concerning tumor growth and survival of the animals, a significant additive effect was seen by the combination of lenalidomide plus PO as compared to single application. Conclusion: These results reveal a significant selective induction of apoptosis by PO an...|$|E
40|$|Androgenetic {{alopecia}} (AGA) is {{a common}} yet poorly understood condition. In particular, the significance of inflammatory cells close to the infrainfundibulum of transitional hairs remains obscure. This {{study was conducted in}} 20 men who used a lotion containing the antimicrobials, <b>piroctone</b> olamine and triclosan, regularly for 18 months. At entry, mild pruritus and abnormal hair loss were reported by the volunteers. During treatments, pruritus resolved rapidly. Comparison of clinical photographs and trichograms taken at 3 -month intervals suggested signs of hair regrowth with moderate increase in density of transitional hairs. Biopsies taken at 6 -month intervals were processed for immunohistochemistry. There was a decrease in the density of activated T cells in the region of the follicular infrainfundibulum and isthmus over time. UgG deposits found within the epithelial sheaths at entry to the study were absent in the subsequent biopsies. The volume of the sebaceous glands, as assessed by computerized morphometry, was not modified by the treatment. It was concluded that inflammation associated with AGA transitional hairs may be driven by the presence of microorganisms harboured in the infrainfundibulum. They may modulate the severity of AGA and may potentially be controllable. This offers a new possibility of prevention and partial reversal of hair loss in AGA. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Hair {{shedding}} {{and hair}} thinning {{have been reported}} to be affected by dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis. The present study was conducted in 150 men presenting with telogen effluvium related to androgenic alopecia associated with dandruff. They were randomly allocated to three groups receiving each one of the three shampoos in the market containing either 1 % ketoconazole (KTZ), 1 % <b>piroctone</b> olamine (PTO) or 1 % zinc pyrithione (ZPT). Shampoos had to be used 2 - 3 times a week for 6 months. Hair shedding during shampoo was evaluated semiquantitatively. Hair density on the vertex was evaluated on photographs using a Dermaphot. Trichograms were used for determining the anagen hair percentage and the mean proximal hair shaft diameter using computerized image analysis. The sebum excretion rate (SER, mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)) was also measured using a Sebumeter((R)). The three treatments cleared pruritus and dandruff rapidly. At end point, hair density was unchanged, although hair shedding was decreased (KTZ: - 17. 3 %, PTO: - 16. 5 %, ZPT: - 10. 1 %) and the anagen hair percentage was increased (KTZ: 4. 9 %, PTO: 7. 9 %, ZPT: 6. 8 %). The effect on the mean hair shaft diameter was contrasted between the three groups of volunteers (KTZ: 5. 4 %, PTO: 7. 7 %, ZPT: - 2. 2 %). In conclusion, telogen effluvium was controlled by KTZ, PTO and ZPT shampoos at 1 % concentration. In addition, KTZ and PTO increased the mean hair shaft thickness while discretely decreasing the sebum output at the skin surface. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|FUNDAMENTOS: As dermatofitoses apresentam alta prevalência na população em geral e, principalmente, em pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica, necessitando tratamento com antifúngicos tópicos e/ou sistêmicos, cuja eficácia precisa ser avaliada. Estudos {{in vitro}} para avaliar a ação de antifúngicos são raros, especialmente, em fungos filamentosos. OBJETIVO: Avaliar o perfil de suscetibilidade de diferentes espécies de dermatófitos, isolados de pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica, em relação a nove antifúngicos disponíveis comercialmente para o tratamento de dermatofitoses. MÉTODO: Analisaram-se 26 isolados de dermatófitos de pacientes com insuficiência renal crônica em relação a nove antifúngicos (cetoconazol, {{ciclopirox}} olamina, fluconazol, griseofulvina, itraconazol, miconazol, piroctona olamina, terbinafina e tioconazol) pelo método de microdiluição em caldo proposto pelo Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), com modificações para dermatófitos. RESULTADOS: Entre os antifúngicos testados, a terbinafina e o tioconazol obtiveram os melhores resultados de sensibilidade e o fluconazol apresentou baixa atividade, especialmente para as amostras da espécie M. gypseum. O ciclopirox olamina, apesar de menos eficaz que a terbinafina, também mostrou resultados satisfatórios. CONCLUSÕES: De modo geral, o perfil de sensibilidade dos antimicóticos testados seguiu o padrão de resultados mostrados por estudos anteriores, ratificando a necessidade de conhecimento da espécie causadora de dermatofitose, devido à variação do perfil de suscetibilidade entre as espécies. Além disso, nossos resultados demonstram a importância da realização de ensaios de sensibilidade in vitro, pois alguns isolados da mesma espécie apresentaram diferente perfil de sensibilidade BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dermatophytosis {{in the general}} population is high, particularly in patients with chronic renal failure. Treatment requires the use of topical and/or systemic antifungal drugs. The efficacy of antifungal agents for the treatment of dermatophytosis has yet to be evaluated. Studies evaluating the in vitro activity of antifungal agents are rare, particularly in filamentous fungi. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the susceptibility profile of different species of dermatophytes isolated from patients with chronic renal failure to nine antifungal drugs available on the market for the treatment of dermatophytosis. METHODS: Twenty-six isolates of dermatophytes obtained from patients with chronic renal failure were analyzed with respect to their susceptibility to nine antifungal agents (ketoconazole, ciclopirox olamine, fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, miconazole, <b>piroctone</b> olamine, terbinafine and tioconazole), using the broth microdilution method proposed by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and adapted for dermatophytes. RESULTS: Of the antifungal agents tested, the best results in terms of sensitivity were found with terbinafine and tioconazole, while the antifungal activity of fluconazole was found to be weak, particularly against strains of M. gypseum. Ciclopirox olamine, although less effective than terbinafine, also yielded satisfactory results. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the sensitivity profile of the antifungal agents tested in this study was similar to results obtained in previous studies, confirming the need to determine which species is causing the dermatophytosis given that antifungal susceptibility varies from one species to another. Furthermore, the present findings show the importance of conducting in vitro sensitivity tests, since the sensitivity profile may differ among isolates of the same specie...|$|E
