40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} and examine an elasticity of relations between production factors (land, labour, capital) and incomes gained by using the above mentioned factors at farms of four macro-regions FADN, i. e. : <b>Pomorze</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mazury,</b> Wielkopolska and Śląsk, Mazowsze and Podlasie, Małopolska and Pogórze. Production function models of Cobb-Douglas (C-D) were assessed for every macro-region for years: 2010, 2011 and 2012. The survey shows that in all macro-regions as well as in all surveyed years, elasticity coeffi cient of total net added value was higher than 1 which means increasing incomes in scale. Increase of net added value in three among four surveyed macro-regions depended mainly on land factor while labour input (excluding Mazowsze and Podlasie where labour factor was important) and fi xed assets factor appeared to be of least importance...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the concentrations of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) in the liver, kidneys, and muscles of European beavers (Castor fiber) and thus to evaluate the degree of heavy metals contamination in Warmia <b>and</b> <b>Mazury</b> region in Poland. The study was conducted on free-living beavers captured in region of Warmia <b>and</b> <b>Mazury</b> during autumn 2011. Concentrations of the elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The presence of the metals was detected in all individual tissue samples. Mean Pb and Hg concentrations were relatively low. However, the high mean Cd level, especially in the kidneys (7. 933 mg/kg) and liver (0. 880 mg/kg) was demonstrated. Despite the fact that region of Warmia <b>and</b> <b>Mazury</b> is considered to be “ecologically clean”, the conducted studies indicate that systematic monitoring for the presence of heavy metals is necessary not only in industrialised but also in agricultural regions, as well as in natural ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the content of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in livers and breast muscles of mallards obtained in Warmia <b>and</b> <b>Mazury</b> in 1999 - 2000. Samples from 32 mallards hunted in Łężany, Zembrze, Szestno and Nidzica, as well as samples from 7 pheasants and 6 mallards from the area of Śląsk were analyzed. Concentration of all the four metals was higher in the liver than in breast muscles. Mean contents of copper in livers of juvenile and adult mallards from Warmia <b>and</b> <b>Mazury</b> were similar (6. 567 and 8. 632 mg/kg w. w.). Levels of zinc were approximately the same in both age groups (23. 911 mg/kg w. w. in young birds and 25. 418 mg/kg w. w. in adults). As regards lead, older mallards from Warmia <b>and</b> <b>Mazury</b> had twice as much of the metal in the liver (0. 417 mg/kg w. w.). The content of Pb in the liver was similar in both age groups of the birds from Śląsk. The differences in the concentration of cadmium in the mallards from Warmia <b>and</b> <b>Mazury</b> were smaller. Cd in the amount of 0. 128 mg/kg m. m. was found in the young mallards and 0. 171 mg/kg m. m. in the adult mallards. The birds from the area of Śląsk contained much higher concentrations of Cd in their tissues, over 1 mg/kg m. m. in the liver and over 0. 200 mg/kg m. m. in the breast muscles...|$|R
