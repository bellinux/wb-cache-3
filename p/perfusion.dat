5|$|Once dissolved, {{distribution}} of the dissolved gas may be by diffusion, {{where there is no}} bulk flow of the solvent, or by <b>perfusion</b> where the solvent (in this case blood) is circulated around the diver's body, where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration. Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas, the concentration in the tissues stabilizes, or saturates, at a rate that depends on solubility, diffusion rate and <b>perfusion,</b> all of which vary in the different tissues of the body. This process is referred to as in-gassing, and is usually modeled as an inverse exponential process.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{establish}} whether or not cardiovascular responses following noradrenaline <b>perfusions</b> into the lateral cerebral ventricle might be correlated with cationic (Na+, Ca++, K+, Mg++) changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, blood pressure, ECG (Lead II), and heart rate changes were recorded before, during and after <b>perfusions</b> with artificial CSF alone and with added noradrenaline. These {{studies were carried out}} in vagotomized, chloralosed, artificially ventilated cats. Samples of the perfusates were collected at fixed intervals to analyze the cation concentrations. <b>Perfusions</b> with either CSF alone or low I-noradrenaline bitartrate (NA) concentrations produced no significant changes in either blood pressure, ECG or heart rate. <b>Perfusions</b> with higher concentrations of NA significantly increased blood pressure and K+ concentrations in the perfusates. Following pretreatment with various agents (reserpine, tranylcypromine, chlorpromazine and imipramine) similar NA <b>perfusions</b> induced no significant blood pressure changes and blocked the K+ effect seen with NA <b>perfusions</b> alone. Further pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine significantly reduced blood pressure with a concomitant increase in Mg++ concentrations. It is concluded that centrally initiated noradrenaline blood pressure responses appear to involve K+ movements in the CNS and that the blood pressure responses following central pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine involve Mg++ movements in the central nervous system...|$|R

5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel {{and the rate of}} delivery of blood to capillaries (<b>perfusion)</b> are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.|$|E
25|$|Shock is {{a complex}} {{condition}} which leads to critically decreased <b>perfusion.</b> The usual mechanisms are loss of blood volume, pooling of blood within the veins reducing adequate return to the heart and/or low effective heart pumping.

25|$|Variations in <b>perfusion</b> {{distribution}} do {{not necessarily}} affect respiratory inert gas exchange, though some gas may be locally trapped by changes in <b>perfusion.</b> Rest in a cold environment will reduce inert gas exchange from skin, fat and muscle, whereas exercise will increase gas exchange. Exercise during decompression can reduce decompression time and risk, providing bubbles are not present, but can increase risk if bubbles are present.|$|E

In the present study we investigated whether these drugs can protect against hypoxic damage in a whole kidney preparation. Tolbutamide (200 [*]μM) and glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) were applied to the isolated perfused rat kidney prior to changing the gassing from oxygen to nitrogen for 30 [*]min. Hypoxic <b>perfusions</b> resulted in an increased fractional excretion of glucose (FE % glucose 14. 3 ± 1. 5 for hypoxic <b>perfusions</b> vs 4. 9 ± 1. 6 for normoxic <b>perfusions,</b> mean±s. e. mean, P< 0. 05), which could be completely restored by 200 [*]μM tolbutamide (5. 7 ± 0. 4 for tolbutamide vs 14. 3 ± 1. 5 for untreated hypoxic kidneys, P< 0. 01). Furthermore, tolbutamide reduced the total amount of LDH excreted in the urine (220 ± 100 [*]mU for tolbutamide vs 1220 ± 160 [*]mU for untreated hypoxic kidneys, P< 0. 01). Comparable results were obtained with glibenclamide (10 [*]μM). In agreement with the effect on functional parameters, ultrastructural analysis of proximal tubules showed increased brush border preservation in tolbutamide treated kidneys compared to untreated hypoxic kidneys. We conclude that glibenclamide and tolbutamide are both able to reduce hypoxic damage to proximal tubules in the isolated perfused rat kidney when applied in the appropriate concentrations...|$|R

A silastic catheter was implanted in a terminal branch of a jejunal artery, perfusing a 5 - to 10 -cm segment, 45 cm below the ligament of Treitz. Small-bowel motor activity was studied electromyographically with implanted electrodes. Three different doses of tetrodotoxin (166, 333, 500 ng/kg/h) were administered intra-arterially for 5 h. During the 333 - and 500 -ng but not during the 166 -ng/kg/h <b>perfusions</b> ectopic activity fronts started just below the perfused segment.

A way of simplifying the modelling of gas transfer into and out of tissues is to make assumptions about the limiting mechanism of dissolved gas transport to the tissues which control decompression.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the bioavailability of artesunate (ARTS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA). When the single-pass isolated perfused rat liver model was used, the hepatic bioavailability of ARTS (39 M) was 0. 20 and the bioavailability of DHA in ARTS and DHA (35 M) <b>perfusions</b> was 0. 12 and 0. 11, respectively. Thus, the combined bioavailability of ARTS and DHA in the ARTS <b>perfusions</b> (0. 32) was three-fold higher than the bioavailability of DHA. In the human study, eight healthy volunteers were randomized to receive oral ARTS (135 mg; 352 mol) or oral DHA (120 mg; 422 mol). The area under the curve (AUC 0 – 6 hr) of DHA following ARTS (2. 9 mol. hr/L) was higher than the AUC 0 – 6 hr of DHA following DHA administration (1. 2 mol. hr/L; P 0. 005).

40|$|Prednisolone is metabolized in the perfused human placental lobule to prednisone, 20 alpha-dihydroprednisone, 20 beta-dihydroprednisone and 20 beta-dihydroprednisolone.

The pattern of metabolites identified from 6 h samples indicated a reversible formation of prednisone from prednisolone, {{the production of the}} 20 alpha- and 20 beta-hydro metabolites of prednisone from prednisone, the formation of 20 beta-dihydroprednisolone from 20 beta-dihydroprednisone only and no direct formation of 20 beta-dihydroprednisolone from prednisolone. Kinetic analysis at two substrate concentrations confirmed that the formation of three of the four steroid metabolites followed first order kinetics. In <b>perfusions</b> with an initial prednisolone concentration of 1 mug/ml (n = 4) or 100 ng/ml (n = 3), the rate constants obtained were (mean + SD, maternal compartment, h- 1) : prednisone, 1. 97 +/- 0. 49 and 2. 25 +/- 0. 15, P > 0. 1; 20 alpha-dihydroprednisone, 0. 0006 +/- 0. 0004 and 0. 0017 +/- 0. 0006, P 0. 1.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Alpha- 1 antitrypsin, {{secreted}} by the liver, inhibits neutrophil elastase. Its deficiency favours {{the development}} of emphysema. Restoring a "protective" serum level in deficient patients should {{make it possible to}} inhibit {{the development of}} emphysema. STATE OF THE ART: Human plasma-derived alpha- 1 antitrypsin is a blood-derived drug sold in France under the name Alfalastin(®). The recommended posology is an I. V. administration of 60 mg/kg once a week. Human plasma-derived alpha- 1 antitrypsin restores anti-elastase protection in the lower lung and prevents experimental emphysema induced by the elastasis of human neutrophils in hamster. The low number of patients with alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency is one of the difficulties to perform sufficiently powerful randomised studies. However, randomised studies have reported the efficacy of human plasma-derived alpha- 1 antitrypsin <b>perfusions</b> on mortality, FEV 1 decline and the frequency of exacerbations. Randomised control trials have demonstrated the efficacy of human plasma-derived alpha- 1 antitrypsin <b>perfusions</b> on the loss of lung density assessed by CT scan.
