40|$|Summary In some cases, torsion is the {{dominant}} or critical factor contributing {{to the failure of}} a concrete member. This research proposes a novel damage detection method for fiber-reinforced concrete beams subjected to <b>pure</b> <b>torsion</b> loading by statistical analysis of acoustic emission (AE) data. Concrete beams with varying water/cement ratios and different fiber volume fractions were subjected to <b>pure</b> <b>torsion</b> during AE monitoring. It was found that the cumulative AE event with respect to the twist angle correlated well to the mechanical loading. A Weibull rupture probability distribution is introduced to quantitatively predict the mechanical damage behavior under <b>pure</b> <b>torsion.</b> A bi-logarithmic regression analysis is carried out to calibrate the Weibull damage distribution function with the detected AE data in order to characterize the torsion fracture process. Moreover, a quantitative approach by means of b-value results is presented in this article to further analyze damage and fracture process. Torsion fracture properties were correlated to the AE parameters, and it was shown that the magnitudes of AE parameters were influenced significantly by mechanical properties of specimens. Therefore, AE would be suitable to describe the fracture of concrete specimens subjected to torsion...|$|E

40|$|Full {{penetration}} {{butt weld}} joints between a tube and its flange are considered, subjected to pure bending, <b>pure</b> <b>torsion</b> and {{a combination of}} these loading modes. The model treats the weld toe like a sharp V-notch, in which mode I and mode III stress distributions are combined to give an equivalent notch stress intensity factor (N-SIF) and assess the high cycle fatigue strength of the welded joints. The N-SIF-based approach is then extended to low/medium cycle fatigue, considering fatigue curves for pure bending and <b>pure</b> <b>torsion</b> having the same slope or, alternatively, different slopes. The expression for the equivalent N-SIF is justified {{on the basis of the}} variation of the deviatoric strain energy in a small volume of material surrounding the weld toe. The energy is averaged in a critical volume of radius R-C and given in closed form as a function of the mode I and mode III N-SIFs. The value of R-C is explicitly referred to high cycle fatigue conditions, the material being modelled as isotropic and linear elastic. R-C is thought of as a material property, independent in principle of the nominal load ratio. To validate the proposal, several experimental data taken from the literature are re-analysed.

40|$|The problem {{motivating}} {{this investigation}} is that of <b>pure</b> axisymmetric <b>torsion</b> of an elastic shell of revolution. The analysis is carried out {{within the framework of}} the three-dimensional linear theory of elastic equilibrium for homogeneous, isotropic solids. The objective is the rigorous estimation of errors involved in the use of approximations based on thin shell theory. The underlying boundary value problem is one of Neumann type for a second order elliptic operator. A systematic procedure for constructing pointwise estimates for the solution and its first derivatives is given for a general class of second-order elliptic boundary-value problems which includes the torsion problem as a special case. The method used here rests on the construction of “energy inequalities” and on the subsequent deduction of pointwise estimates from the energy inequalities. This method removes certain drawbacks characteristic of pointwise estimates derived in some investigations of related areas. Special interest is directed towards thin shells of constant thickness. The method enables us to estimate the error involved in a stress analysis in which the exact solution is replaced by an approximate one, and thus provides us with a means of assessing the quality of approximate solutions for axisymmetric torsion of thin shells. Finally, the results of the present study are applied to the stress analysis of a circular cylindrical shell, and the quality of stress estimates derived here and those from a previous related publication are discussed. ...|$|R

These exact solutions describe a class of motions possible in closed circular rings possessing a uniform distribution of intrinsic curvature k u and intrinsic torsion. When k u≠ 0, the motions in this class are such that the axial curve of the ring remains stationary while the cross sections rotate about their centers {{in such a way that}} the angle ψ of rotation is independent of axial location and is governed by the nonlinear pendulum equation. When k u= 0, such uniform rotation of cross sections can occur at an arbitrary steady rate. The methods of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics yield the following conclusions for canonical ensembles of rings for which the motion is this type of <b>pure</b> homogeneous <b>torsion.</b> When 1 /k u= 11. 85 nm (i. e., when the intrinsic curvature k u is among the highest observed in naturally occurring, approximately uniformly curved, stress-free DNA segments), if the flexural rigidity is assigned a value usually accepted for duplex DNA, at T= 298 K the root-mean-square value, 1 / 2, of the angle ψ is 11. 2 °.

The transverse shear and normal stresses in the adhesive {{as well as}} membrane stress resultants and bending moments in the adherends are determined using this method. The method utilizes the principle of virtual work in conjunction with nonlinear thin-shell theory to model the adherends and a cylindrical shear lag model to represent the kinematics of the thin adhesive layer between the adherends. The kinematic boundary conditions are imposed by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. In the solution procedure, the displacement components for the tubular joint are approximated in terms of non-periodic and periodic B-Spline functions in the longitudinal and circumferential directions, respectively.

The tube surface morphology observation indicates that, during this gradual change, the A-M interface thickness increases as its evolution is recorded.
