40|$|Rationale: Accurate, early {{identification}} of patients {{at risk for}} developing acute lung injury (ALI) provides the opportunity to test and implement secondary prevention strategies. Objectives: To determine the frequency and outcome of ALI development in patients at risk and validate a lung injury prediction score (LIPS). Methods: In this prospective multicenter observational cohort study, <b>predisposing</b> <b>conditions</b> and risk modifiers predictive of ALI development were identified from routine clinical data available during initial evaluation. The discrimination of the model was assessed with area under receiver operating curve (AUC). The risk of death from ALI was determined after adjustment for severity of illness and <b>predisposing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-two hospitals enrolled 5, 584 patients at risk. ALI developed a median of 2 (interquartile range 1 – 4) days after initial evaluation in 377 (6. 8 %; 148 ALI-only, 229 adult respiratory distress syndrome) patients. The frequency of ALI varied according to <b>predisposing</b> <b>conditions</b> (from 3 % in pancreatitis to 26 % after smoke inhalation). LIPS discriminated patients who developed ALI from {{those who did not}} with an AUC of 0. 80 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 78 – 0. 82). When adjusted for severity of illness and <b>predisposing</b> <b>conditions,</b> development of ALI increased the risk of in-hospital death (odds ratio, 4. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 9 – 5. 7). Conclusions: ALI occurrence varies according to <b>predisposing</b> <b>conditions</b> and carries an independently poor prognosis. Using routinely available clinical data, LIPS identifies patients at high risk for ALI early {{in the course of their}} illness. This model will alert clinicians about the risk of ALI and facilitate testing and implementation of ALI prevention strategies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Community-acquired {{recurrent}} {{bacterial meningitis}} in adults {{is a relatively}} rare disease. All previous data were derived from small retrospective case series. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated episodes of recurrent bacterial meningitis in a nationwide cohort study in The Netherlands. RESULTS: Thirty-four episodes of recurrent bacterial meningitis were identified among 31 patients; 3 patients experienced 2 episodes during the study period. The mean age was 43 years, and 25 (74 %) of 34 episodes occurred in men. <b>Predisposing</b> <b>conditions</b> were involved in 26 (77 %) of 34 episodes; the most common <b>predisposing</b> <b>conditions</b> were remote head injury (17 [53 %] of 32 episodes) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage (9 [32 %] of 28 episodes). Lumbar puncture revealed an individual CSF indicator of bacterial meningitis for almost all episodes (88 %). The outcome was death for 5 (15 %) of 34 episodes; 1 additional patient had a suboptimal score on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. CONCLUSION: We conclude that most patients with recurrent meningitis are male and have <b>predisposing</b> <b>conditions,</b> which, in most cases, are remote head injury or CSF leakag...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The focal {{dystonia}} benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) affects {{as many as}} 40, 000 {{individuals in}} the United States. This dystonia is characterized by trigeminal hyperexcitability, photophobia, and most disabling of the symptoms, involuntary spasms of lid closure that can produce functional blindness. Like many focal dystonias, BEB appears to develop from the interaction between a <b>predisposing</b> <b>condition</b> and an environmental trigger. The primary treatment for blepharospasm is to weaken the eyelid-closing orbicularis oculi muscle to reduce lid spasms. There are several animal models of blepharospasm that recreate the spasms of lid closure in order to investigate pharmacological treatments to prevent spasms of lid closure. One animal model attempts to mimic the <b>predisposing</b> <b>condition</b> and environmental trigger {{that give rise to}} BEB. This model indicates that abnormal interactions among trigeminal blink circuits, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum are the neural basis for BEB...|$|E
