The standard deviation of the Gaussian should be chosen to be small enough that, after this step, the sample points still have nearly-uniform spacing.|$|E

5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|In the 1780s the Royal Humane Society {{installed}} resuscitation kits, including smoke enemas, {{at various}} <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the River Thames, {{and by the}} turn of the 19th century, tobacco smoke enemas had become an established practice in Western medicine, considered by Humane Societies to be as important as artificial respiration.|$|E

5|$|Shorter and quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with less {{attractive}} scenery, begin from several <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the A591 road along {{the west side of the}} mountain. Two of these may be combined to create a circular walk. Incorporating the south ridge in the route can restore much of the scenic interest.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{sections}} of the Kolonnenweg remain in place to serve as farm and forestry access roads, though the accompanying anti-vehicle ditches, fences and other obstacles have been almost entirely removed. Artworks, commemorative stones, memorials and signs have been erected at many <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the former border to mark its opening, to remember its victims and to record the division and reunification of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Defense Communications Planning Group's {{research}} and development program created an advanced technological system. Muscle Shoals would consist of three interdependent parts. First, there were air-dropped, battery-powered acoustic and seismic sensors. The camouflaged sensors were to be dropped in strings at predetermined geographical <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the PAVN logistical network. Once emplaced, they would serve as tripwires to any movement or activity along the system.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Briar Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic region. The top of Lee Mountain forms a drainage divide between the creek's watershed and another watershed.

5|$|Anglers {{will find}} pike {{in excess of}} , with good stocks of chub, dace, roach, bream, tench, perch, rudd, and gudgeon. There are trout in the upper reaches. There are several access <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the river {{suitable}} for canoeing, and the river has been paddled as far up as Bruton, but above West Lydford only after recent rain. There are public footpaths alongside many stretches of the river. There are also areas of the river that serve as desirable spots for wild swimming.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Julian Park, it {{has been}} conjectured that the {{structure}} originally continued to the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of Sleights, based on reports from antiquarians in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries that fragments were visible at numerous <b>points</b> <b>along</b> this course. Hayes and Rutter appear confident of the structure's extent as far as Lease Rigg, but admit that its extent is conjectural from well short of that point, from Dowson Garth Quarry northwards.|$|E

5|$|Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, {{mainly the}} T-55 or its Chinese equivalents, the Type 59 and Type 69. The {{remaining}} 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces {{through a number}} of break <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the front, allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions and the Republican Guard units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the Global Positioning System and other new technologies.|$|E
5|$|OTA {{announced}} plans to include sound barriers at three <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the turnpike in April 1990. The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA, using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers, abatement was not considered at those locations {{because they did not}} meet other criteria, including minimum population density. Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project, it opted to do so anyway.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{contract}} was awarded, {{the start of the}} American Civil War caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the transcontinental telegraph reached Salt Lake City and connected Omaha, Nebraska, and Sacramento, California. Other telegraph lines connected <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.|$|E

50|$|In {{many parts}} of the western United States, the term summit refers to the highest <b>point</b> <b>along</b> a road, highway, or railroad. For example, the highest <b>point</b> <b>along</b> Interstate 80 in California is {{referred}} to as Donner Summit (not to be confused with Donner Pass, which is just to the south) while the highest point on Interstate 5 is Siskiyou Mountain Summit.|$|R
5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E
5|$|The defences at Sedan also lacked any mines. The French Second Army was {{guarding}} a {{front of}} , {{and was given}} only 16,000 mines. Of that number, 7,000 {{were given to the}} cavalry divisions that were intended to delay a German advance through southern Belgium as well as to blockhouse <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the Franco–Belgian border. That left 2,000 for the defence of the river Meuse. Of those, the 55th Infantry Division got 422. Not all of these were laid, and some barriers were moved during the bunker construction in the Sedan sector.|$|E
5|$|They based its grid-like street plan on Philadelphia's, with {{numbered}} north-south streets running inland {{from the}} river after River Street, the city's first commercial center. Lots there, at the time, ran {{all the way to}} the river's waterline, giving their owners the unusual advantage of river and street frontage. The sloping bluff also allowed them to build multi-story warehouses and granaries closer to the unloading <b>points</b> <b>along</b> the river.|$|E
