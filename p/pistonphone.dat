50|$|However, commercially {{available}} pistonphones are not calculable devices and must themselves be calibrated using a calibrated microphone {{if the results}} are to be traceable; though generally very stable over time, there will be small differences in the sound pressure level generated between different pistonphones. Since their output is also dependent on {{the volume of the}} chamber (coupling volume), differences in shape and load volume between different models of microphone will have an influence on the resulting SPL, requiring the <b>pistonphone</b> to be calibrated accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Dosimeters {{are also}} used to collect data for use in legal proceedings, {{development}} of engineering noise controls, and other industrial hygiene purposes. When planning to conduct noise exposure measurements, steps {{must be taken to}} ensure that the dosimeters are calibrated and operated according to manufacturers’ specifications. It is also necessary to understand the properties of the acoustic environment, the main measurement objectives as they relate to determining the risk to hearing damage, and the limitations {{associated with the use of}} dosimeters. Dosimeter manufacturers recommend that the instrument be calibrated with an acoustical calibrator such as a <b>pistonphone</b> before and after each measurement to verify reliable operation. In addition to field calibration routines, the manufacturers recommend periodic comprehensive calibration and certification of the instrument by an accredited laboratory using traceable reference sources. Field calibration of contemporary dosimeters has been mostly automated through PC-based programs that run the calibration routine, document the time and date, and adjust for any offset in levels.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a fiber-optic lever microphone, capable of operating continuously at temperatures up to 538 C (1000 F) are described. The design {{is based on the}} theoretical sensitivities of each of the microphone system components, namely, a cartridge containing a stretched membrane, an optical fiber probe, and an optoelectronic amplifier. Laboratory calibrations include the <b>pistonphone</b> sensitivity and harmonic distortion at ambient temperature, and frequency response, background noise, and optical power transmission at both ambient and elevated temperatures. A field test in the Thermal Acoustic Fatigue Apparatus at Langley Research Center, in which the microphone was subjected to overall sound-pressure levels in the range of 130 - 160 dB and at temperatures from ambient to 538 C, revealed good agreement with a standard probe microphone...|$|E

5000|$|Sound calibrators {{are used}} in an {{identical}} way to <b>pistonphones,</b> providing a known sound pressure field in a cavity to which a test microphone is coupled. Sound calibrators are different from <b>pistonphones</b> in that they work electronically and use a low-impedance (electrodynamic) source to yield {{a high degree of}} volume independent operation. Furthermore, modern devices often use a feedback mechanism to monitor and adjust the sound pressure level in the cavity so that it is constant regardless of the cavity / microphone size. Sound calibrators normally generate a 1 kHz sine tone; 1 kHz is chosen since the [...] A-weighted SPL is equal to the linear level at 1 kHz. Sound calibrators should also be calibrated regularly at a nationally accredited calibration laboratory to ensure traceability. Sound calibrators tend to be less precise than <b>pistonphones,</b> but are (nominally) independent of internal cavity volume and ambient pressure.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] is an {{acoustical}} calibrator (sound source) {{that uses}} a closed coupling volume to generate a precise sound pressure for the calibration of measurement microphones. The principle relies on a piston mechanically driven to move at a specified cyclic rate, pushing on a fixed volume of air to which the microphone under test is coupled. The air {{is assumed to be}} compressed [...] adiabatically and the sound pressure level in the chamber can, potentially, be calculated from internal physical dimensions of the device and the adiabatic gas law, which requires that PVγ is a constant, where P is the pressure in the chamber, V is the volume of the chamber, and γ is the ratio of the specific heat of air at constant pressure to its specific heat at constant volume. <b>Pistonphones</b> are highly dependent on ambient pressure (always requiring a correction to ambient pressure conditions) and are generally only made to reproduce low frequencies (for practical reasons), typically 250 Hz. However, <b>pistonphones</b> can be very precise, with good stability over time.|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{controlling}} aircraft noise {{is one of}} the major research topics of the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program. One of the measurement technologies used to acquire noise data is the microphone directional array (DA). Traditional direction array hardware, consisting of commercially available condenser microphones and preamplifiers can be too expensive and their installation in hard-walled wind tunnel test sections too complicated. An emerging micro-machining technology coupled with the latest cutting edge technologies for smaller and faster systems have opened the way for development of MEMS microphones. The MEMS microphone devices are available in the market but suffer from certain important shortcomings. Based on early experiments with array prototypes, it has been found that both the bandwidth and the sound pressure level dynamic range of the microphones should be increased significantly to improve the performance and flexibility of the overall array. Thus, in collaboration with an outside MEMS design vendor, NASA Langley modified commercially available MEMS microphone as shown in Figure 1 to meet the new requirements. Coupled with the design of the enhanced MEMS microphones was the development of a new calibration method for simultaneously obtaining the sensitivity and phase response of the devices over their entire broadband frequency range. Over the years, several methods have been used for microphone calibration. Some of the common methods of microphone calibration are Coupler (Reciprocity, Substitution, and Simultaneous), <b>Pistonphone,</b> Electrostatic actuator, and Free-field calibration (Reciprocity, Substitution, and Simultaneous). Traditionally, electrostatic actuators (EA) have been used to characterize air-condenser microphones for wideband frequency ranges; however, MEMS microphones are not adaptable to the EA method due to their construction and very small diaphragm size. Hence a substitution-based, free-field method was developed to calibrate these microphones at frequencies up to 80 kHz. The technique relied on the use of a random, ultrasonic broadband centrifugal sound source located in a small anechoic chamber. Phase calibrations of the MEMS microphones were derived from cross spectral phase comparisons between the reference and test substitution microphones and an adjacent and invariant grazing-incidence 1 / 8 -inch standard microphone...|$|E
