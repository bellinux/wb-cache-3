40|$|Many {{types of}} sensors using liquid {{crystals}} {{have been investigated}} for applications of liquid crystals, for example, sensors of photo, magnetics, ultrasonic, pressure, etc. Some properties of <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> of nematic liquid crystals are reviewed by S. Kurita and S. Sato et al. For application studies of the photo sensor of nematic liquid crystals mixed with dyes, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> in reference to wave length of incident light. In this paper, the <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> of nematic liquid crystals, each of which was mixed with its own dyes, were examined in reference to the wavelength of ultra violet rays. The dyes used in this study were sudan Ⅱ, methyl red and nitrophenol. A period of 60 to 300 seconds was taken for each measurements. The main results are as follows. The value of the <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> increased with the light of shorter wavelength. The rise response time for incident lights to cells was shorter with the light of shorter wavelength. Liquid crystal cells including dye of the mixture ratio of 3 % by weight had the highest maximum value of the <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> and shorter rise response time to incident light in this study...|$|E

In this report, <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> of nematic liquid crystal cells is examined in regard to doping with the combination of one or two kinds of dyestuffs. Methyl red, methyl yellow, sudan Ⅰ, sudan Ⅱ and sudan Ⅲ are used as the kinds of dyestuffs in this examination. Measurement was performed about the <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> generated across the cell when an incident light of ultraviolet ray was illuminated to the cell. As the value of <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> varies with elapsing time, the value was continually recorded in a period of 60 to 120 seconds, from the start of illumination. Main results are as follows. The cells doped with two kinds of dyestuffs have higher maximum values of <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> and shorter time of rise and decay response on incident light of shorter wavelength in comparison with the cells doped with one kind of dyestuffs. Besides, on longer wavelength, the cells doped with a dyestuff have higher maximum values of <b>photoelectromotive</b> <b>force</b> with the exception of some cells...|$|E

The system has two light-harvesting subunits connected electrically in series. Each subunit {{is made of}} a multimolecular layer of Zn(II) -tetraphenylporphyrin deposited on a clean aluminum surface and immersed in an aqueous mixture of potassium ferri- and ferrocyanide.

The bismuth oxide films have been prepared by thermal oxidation, in an oxygen-reach atmosphere, at ∼ 800 K, of vacuum evaporated Bi films. From the spectral curves of photoconduction in respective structures, the energy gap values, Eg, of bismuth oxide films have been determined, by using the Moss criterion.
