5|$|Salts of {{germanium}} {{are potentially}} harmful to {{humans and animals}} if ingested on a prolonged basis. There is interest in the <b>pharmacological</b> actions of germanium compounds but no licensed medicine as yet.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} <b>pharmacological</b> effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{testing has}} also {{included}} {{the use of}} placebo testing. In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no <b>pharmacological</b> effect, but is administered {{in order to determine}} any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered, and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound.|$|E
5|$|Microdosing {{is another}} {{alternative}} {{to the use of}} animals in experimentation. Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its <b>pharmacological</b> affects without harming the volunteers. Microdosing can replace the use of animals in pre-clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing.|$|E
5|$|Multiple <b>pharmacological</b> therapies for DVT were {{introduced}} in the 20th century: oral anticoagulants in the 1940s, subcutaneous LDUH in 1962 and subcutaneous LMWH in 1982. Diagnoses were commonly performed by impedance plethysmography in the 1970s and 1980s, {{but the use of}} Doppler ultrasound techniques, with their increased sensitivity and specificity, largely superseded this method.|$|E
5|$|Non{{benzodiazepine}}s also bind to the benzodiazepine {{binding site}} on the GABAA receptor and possess similar <b>pharmacological</b> properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common pharmacophore (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pharmacological</b> {{treatment}} {{can help to}} manage psychiatric or behavioral problems. Medication {{is also used to}} control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|The {{anonymous}} fourth-century compilation Medicina Plinii {{contains more}} than 1,100 <b>pharmacological</b> recipes, {{the vast majority of}} them from the Historia naturalis; perhaps because Pliny's name was attached to it, it enjoyed huge popularity in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in <b>pharmacological</b> and non-pharmacological ways. <b>Pharmacological</b> methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders. The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include <b>pharmacological,</b> behavioral and psychological therapies. While <b>pharmacological</b> intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E
5|$|Three stages may be distinguished: {{an initial}} stage {{in which the}} {{individual}} with PD has already developed some disability requiring <b>pharmacological</b> treatment, a second stage associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a <b>pharmacological</b> approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major <b>pharmacological</b> drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known <b>pharmacological</b> activity of these substances in {{medicinal plants}} is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where medicinal plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them.|$|E
5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It {{is a product of}} the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor <b>pharmacological</b> activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require <b>pharmacological</b> treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
5|$|While {{lanthanum}} has <b>pharmacological</b> {{effects on}} several receptors and ion channels, its specificity for the GABA receptor is unique among trivalent cations. Lanthanum acts {{at the same}} modulatory site on the GABA receptor as zinc, a known negative allosteric modulator. The lanthanum cation La3+ is a positive allosteric modulator at native and recombinant GABA receptors, increasing open channel time and decreasing desensitization in a subunit configuration dependent manner.|$|E
25|$|Food intolerances can {{be caused}} by enzymatic defects in the {{digestive}} system, can also result from <b>pharmacological</b> effects of vasoactive amines present in foods (e.g. Histamine), among other metabolic, <b>pharmacological</b> and digestive abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone {{is in the}} cyclopyrrolone {{family of}} drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include suriclone. Zopiclone, {{although}} molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical <b>pharmacological</b> profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone's <b>pharmacological</b> properties. In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine <b>pharmacological</b> properties, it also has some barbiturate-like properties.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{evidence}} of its <b>pharmacological</b> effect, if known.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{medicine}} can use {{the concept}} of the transmutation of natural substances, using <b>pharmacological</b> or a combination of <b>pharmacological</b> and spiritual techniques. In Ayurveda, the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.|$|E

25|$|Numbers of {{benzodiazepine}} prescriptions {{have been}} declining, due primarily to concerns of dependence. In the short term, benzodiazepines {{can be effective}} drugs for acute anxiety or insomnia. With longer-term use, other therapies, both <b>pharmacological</b> and psychotherapeutic, become more effective. This is {{in part due to}} the greater effectiveness over time of other forms of therapy, and also due to the eventual development of <b>pharmacological</b> benzodiazepine tolerance.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapy and <b>pharmacological</b> {{treatments}} {{have been}} shown to be helpful interventions for patients with impulsive-compulsive buying disorder.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pharmacological</b> {{effects of}} {{triazolam}} {{are similar to}} those of most other benzodiazepines. Triazolam does not generate active metabolites. Triazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine, is lipophilic, and is metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main <b>pharmacological</b> effects of triazolam are the enhancement of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABAA receptor. The half-life of triazolam is only 2 hours making it a very short acting benzodiazepine drug. Triazolam has anticonvulsant effects on brain function.|$|E

25|$|Transplatin, the trans {{stereoisomer}} of cisplatin, has formula trans- {{and does}} not exhibit a comparably useful <b>pharmacological</b> effect. Two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the reduced anticancer effect of transplatin. Firstly, the trans arrangement of the chloro ligands is thought to confer transplatin with greater chemical reactivity, causing transplatin to become deactivated before it reaches the DNA where transplatin exerts its <b>pharmacological</b> action. Secondly, the stereo-conformation of transplatin is such that it is unable to form the characteristic 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) adducts formed by cisplatin in abundance.|$|E
25|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} {{are classified as}} type A (intrinsic or <b>pharmacological)</b> or type B (idiosyncratic). Type A drug reaction accounts for 80% of all toxicities.|$|E
