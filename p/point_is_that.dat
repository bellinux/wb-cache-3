5|$|The whole <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{we are the}} song. The self {{is coming}} from a state of pure awareness, {{from the state of}} being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of general relativity is that it {{can be applied to the}} universe as a whole. A key <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> on large scales, our universe appears to be constructed along very simple lines: all current observations suggest that, on average, the structure of the cosmos should be approximately the same, regardless of an observer's location or direction of observation: the universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. Such comparatively simple universes can be described by simple solutions of Einstein's equations. The current cosmological models of the universe are obtained by combining these simple solutions to general relativity with theories describing the properties of the universe's matter content, namely thermodynamics, nuclear- and particle physics. According to these models, our present universe emerged from an extremely dense high-temperature state –the Big Bang– roughly 14 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Community-Embedded Reproductive Health Care for Adolescents (CERCA) Project was {{implemented}} in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua (2011 – 2014) {{to test the}} effectiveness of interventions preventing teenage pregnancies. As the outcome evaluation showed limited impact, a post-hoc process evaluation was carried out to determine if and how CERCA’s design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation affected the results. We did a document analysis and conducted 18 in-depth interviews and 21 focus group discussions with stakeholders and beneficiaries. Transcripts were analyzed using directed content analysis. Data showed that CERCA sensitized stakeholders and encouraged the discussion on this sensitive issue. In terms of design, a strong <b>point</b> <b>was</b> the participatory approach; a weak <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the detailed situation analysis was completed too late. In terms of implementation, a strong <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> multifaceted activities <b>were</b> implemented; a weak <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the activities <b>were</b> not pilot tested for feasibility/acceptability and evolved substantially throughout the Project. In terms of monitoring, strong <b>points</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> regular monitoring kept the Project on track administratively/financially; a weak <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> monitoring indicators did not change as the intervention package changed. In terms of evaluation, weak <b>points</b> <b>were</b> the substantial attrition rate and narrow focus on adolescents. This study provides recommendations for future projects...|$|R
30|$|The {{speciality}} of coupled proximity <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they provide}} for {{the realization of the}} minimum distance in two ways simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|According {{to some of}} {{the latest}} {{scientific}} discoveries, one of the structure's functions, at a certain <b>point,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of storing water.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} between being uniformly continuous, and being simply continuous at every <b>point,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in uniform continuity the value of δ depends only on ε {{and not on the}} point in the domain.|$|E
25|$|The concept's {{starting}} <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{individuals or}} organizations seldom learn from experience, unless {{the experience is}} assessed and then assigned its own meaning in terms of individual and/or the organization's own goals, aims, ambitions, and expectations. From these processes come insights and added meaning, which is then applied to new circumstances. The end product is better decision-making.|$|E
25|$|The <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the idea}} of space {{vehicles}} shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place. It didn't take much stretching for the first observers of UFOs {{to assume that the}} unknown objects hovering in the sky had the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Governor Rick Snyder {{described}} the continuing cuts as intentional: [...] "The <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that's</b> why {{this needs to}} get approved," [...] he said.|$|R
5000|$|Meadow, giving {{evidence}} for the prosecution, listed four indications of Patel's guilt. One was the injuries suffered by the third child to die. Patel's explanation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the rib fractures had resulted from attempts at resuscitation. The second and third <b>points</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the children had undergone several medical examinations, and all had been well until shortly before their deaths. The fourth <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> three consecutive children had died, and that, according to Meadow, [...] "in general, sudden and unexpected death does not run in families." ...|$|R
50|$|A further rule {{regarding}} clearing <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they cannot <b>be</b> modified once a train has <b>been</b> accepted, and <b>that</b> {{they must}} <b>be</b> locked for passenger train movements.|$|R
25|$|There exist {{alternative}} physical pictures {{which give}} the Hawking radiation {{in which the}} trans-Planckian problem is addressed. The key <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> similar trans-Planckian problems occur when the modes occupied with Unruh radiation are traced back in time. In the Unruh effect, {{the magnitude of the}} temperature can be calculated from ordinary Minkowski field theory, and is not controversial.|$|E
25|$|In this example, the key <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{kinetic energy}} is {{quadratic}} in the velocity. The equipartition theorem {{shows that in}} thermal equilibrium, any degree of freedom (such {{as a component of}} the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of kBT and therefore contributes kB to the system's heat capacity. This has many applications.|$|E
25|$|The <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> after 4.d4 g5 5.h4 g4 White cannot {{continue}} with 6.Ne5 {{as in the}} Kieseritzky Gambit, 6.Ng5 is unsound because of 6...f6! trapping the knight, and 6.Nfd2 blocks the bishop on c1. This leaves the move 6.Ng1 as the only option, when after six moves neither side has developed a piece. The resulting slightly odd position (diagram) offers White good attacking chances.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To you, poor Robin, {{who lived}} gratefully on the crumbs of our advantages! The <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> to you they were crumbs, while {{we had a}} surfeit.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I say it--but hasn't {{my whole}} <b>point</b> <b>been</b> <b>that</b> I don't ask you to. Therefore," [...] she demanded--but {{smiling at him}} now-- [...] "where's the logic?" ...|$|R
50|$|My <b>point</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that...</b>|$|R
25|$|Ptolemy {{begins by}} stating he has briefly {{reviewed}} the important principles and will now develop {{the details of}} astrology in the appropriate order. His <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> astrological assessment of any 'particular' individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the 'general' temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community.|$|E
25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this is because he wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get people talking about their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release. An important <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the album essentially evolved during 1981 and wasn't written from a single conceptual starting point.|$|E
25|$|Reciprocity. It {{reflects}} both {{a desire}} to limit the scope of free-riding that may arise because of the MFN rule, and {{a desire to}} obtain better access to foreign markets. A related <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for a nation to negotiate, it is necessary that the gain from doing so be greater than the gain available from unilateral liberalization; reciprocal concessions intend to ensure that such gains will materialise.|$|E
30|$|A noise <b>point</b> <b>is</b> any <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not a core {{point or}} a border point.|$|R
50|$|What my <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>is</b> <b>that...</b>|$|R
25|$|The central {{assertion}} of these <b>points</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> God saves every person upon {{whom he has}} mercy, and <b>that</b> his efforts <b>are</b> not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.|$|R
25|$|Fourth, these inhumations {{tend to be}} {{oriented}} on a west-to-east direction. Fifth, some of {{the graves}} are located in, or under, barrows. Sixth, {{there is a high}} proportion of graves with few or no grave goods. Seventh, those items that are featured are predominantly relating to utilitarian clothing or represent small personal tokens. The final <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some of the grave goods, notable the cross forms, have Christian symbolic significance.|$|E
25|$|Genetics and the Origin of Species has {{two main}} points to make. The {{first is that}} {{speciation}} is a genuine problem that must {{be explained by the}} theory of evolution. In nature, {{there is not a single}} population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all the variations can be explained by the principles of genetics.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{derivative}} of gramicidin, {{produced by the}} gram-positive bacterium Bacillus brevis. Gramicidin S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail, formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another interesting <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: ornithine {{as well as the}} atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by gramicidin S synthetase.|$|E
5000|$|Fulton {{also tried}} to avoid the {{argument}} saying <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> about semantics, and <b>that</b> the real <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Canada <b>was</b> founded by [...] "two races, two cultures, two peoples".|$|R
5000|$|Assuming {{that the}} first two spheres {{intersect}} {{in more than one}} <b>point,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ...|$|R
50|$|A {{noteworthy}} <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> 13% of {{the young}} women lacked effective contraception at last intercourse (compared to 11% nationally), which may indicate a need to increase sexual-health education in the region.|$|R
25|$|Garuda Vyuha is worshiped in Tantra for Abhichara and {{to protect}} against Abhichara. However, the {{interesting}} thing is that Garuda is the Sankarshna form of the lord who during creation primarily possesses the knowledge aspect of the lord (among Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha forms). The important <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Garuda represents the five vayus within us : prana, apana, vyana, udana, samana through his five forms Satya, Suparna, Garuda, Tarkshya, Vihageshwara. These five vayus through yoga can be controlled through Pranayama which can lead to Kundalini awakening leading to higher levels of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Resonant {{vibrational}} modes due to {{vertical loads}} (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design. In {{the case of}} the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this at exactly the same time.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{political}} unit {{of ancient}} Ireland was the tuath. All “freemen” who owned land, all professionals, and all craftsmen, {{were entitled to}} become members of a tuath. Each tuath’s members formed an annual assembly which decided all common policies, declared war or peace on other tuatha, and elected or deposed their “kings.” An important <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in contrast to primitive tribes, no one was stuck or bound to a given tuath, either because of kingship or of geographical location. Individual members were free to, and often did, secede from a tuath and join a competing tuath.|$|E
5000|$|The key legal <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> [...] "The {{testator}} {{purported to}} make a trust for such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his own discretion shall most approve of." ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{distinguishable}} <b>points</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> no cupola and no {{rear mounted}} machine {{gun on the}} turret. A machine gun was placed protruding from the forward {{left side of the}} turret.|$|R
50|$|Worthington {{picked up}} 16 yellow {{cards in the}} 2005-06 season. Another other low <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> through injury he missed Huddersfield Town's {{high-profile}} FA Cup tie against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 2008.|$|R
