Evidence is accumulating on the role of polymorphic genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could influence normal tissue response after radiation. The most studied SNPs include those in genes involved in DNA repair (single- and double-strand breaks, and base excision) and those active in the response to oxidative stress. Case report: We present the case report of a 60 -year-old woman with early breast cancer who underwent adjuvant hormone therapy and conventional radiotherapy, and subsequently developed unacceptable cosmetic toxicities of the irradiated breast requiring a genetic test of genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms. The patient was found to be heterozygous for G 28152 A (T/C) and C 18067 T (A/G) mutations in X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC 1) and 3 (XRCC 3), respectively, homozygous for A 313 G (G/G) mutation in glutathione S transferase Pi 1 (GSTP 1), and wild-type for A 4541 G (A/A) in XRCC 3 and G 135 C (G/G) in RAD 51 recombinase. Conclusion: The role of SNPs should be taken into account when a severe phenomenon appears in normal tissues after radiation treatment, because understanding the molecular basis of individual radiosensitivity may be useful for identifying moderately or extremely radiosensitive patients who may need tailored therapeutic strategies.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of material and}} energy flows, passing through the different sectors in an economic system, {{is a type of}} methodology, today quite utilized, capable of quantifying the exchanges between the tecnosphere (different economic sectors) and biosphere. In this way it is possible to construct indicators in physical units as Gross Material Product (GMP), which can integrate the information obtained by the traditional system of monetary accounting. The economic indicators expressed in <b>physic</b> <b>units</b> provide more detailed information, which could be the base for each economic decision making. Considering these preliminary assumptions and the previous authorâ€™s papers, this note analyses the Italian animal sector, a good example for its economic and material implications. This analysis is another step to complete the accounting in physical units of the whole Italian economic system...|$|R
