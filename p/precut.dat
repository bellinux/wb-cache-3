The style {{developed in the}} Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula. Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with <b>precut</b> stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.|$|E

40|$|Many factors affect forage quality, {{including}} {{moisture level}} at baling, compaction, bulk density, and maturity at harvest. Losses of dry matter and nutrient value occur during field curing. Hay baled {{at or above}} 18 % moisture should have less nutrient loss in the field. However, hay baled at these moisture levels {{has the potential to}} heat during storage, causing dry matter loss and nutrient degradation. Also, as particle length of forage decreases, packing ability of forage and bulk density of bales increase. Although particle length is reduced by grinding baled forage, this can result in nutrient losses. Also, when cattle are fed free choice in a ring feeder, <b>precutting</b> forage may help reduce waste because the smaller particles fall within the ring and are not pulled out by the animals and lost on the ground.

500|$|Black tea: The {{tea leaves}} {{are allowed to}} {{completely}} oxidize. Black tea is first withered to induce protein breakdown and reduce water content (68-77% of original). The leaves then undergo a process known in the industry as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", which through bruising or cutting disrupts leaf cell structures, releasing the leaf juices and enzymes that activate oxidation. The oxidation process takes between 45–90 minutes to 3 hours and is done at high humidity between 20-30 degrees Celsius, transforming much of the catechins of the leaves into complex tannin. Orthodox processed black teas are further graded according to the post-production leaf quality by the Orange Pekoe system, while crush, tear, curl (CTC) teas use a different grading system. Orthodox tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically on a cylindrical rolling table or a rotorvane. The rolling table consists of a ridged table-top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are pressed down onto the table-top. The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves, and particles which are then sorted, oxidized, and dried. The rotovane consisted of an auger pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder [...] which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves. Crush, tear, curl is a production method developed by William McKercher in 1930 which uses machines with contra-rotating rotors with surfaces patterning that cut and tear the leaves producing a product popular for use in tea bags.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to answer the {{following}} questions: 1) Does the administration of pentoxifylline prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis? 2) Is transpancreatic septοtomy a safe and effective pre cut method or is it a risk factor for pancreatitis? 3) Which is the variation of TNF-α and IL- 6 levels the first hours after ERCP and is it influenced by pentoxifylline administration or pancreatitis development? 4) Is procalcitonin a reliable prognostic index of the severity of post-ERCP pancreatitis? We studied 306 patients who underwent 320 ERCPs. Pentoxifylline was administered in 158 procedures while 162 were the control group. Nine (5. 6 %) patients in the pentoxifylline group and 5 (3 %) in the control group developed pancreatitis (p= 0. 28). Two (1. 2 %) patients in the pentoxifylline group and 7 (4. 3 %) in the control group developed hemorrhage (p= 0. 17). Bile duct cannulation was successful by the standard procedure in 250 (81. 7 %) of the 306 patients. Conventional sphincterotomy was performed in 242 patients. A total of 55 patients underwent attempted <b>precutting</b> techniques. In 40 (13. 1 %) transpancreatic septotomy was attempted with initial success in 29 (72. 5 %) and eventual success in 30 (75 %) after a second attempt. Needle-knife sphincterotomy was attempted in six of the 10 transpancreatic septotomy failures, with eventual successful cannulation in four patients. In 15 patients, needle-knife sphincterotomy was performed primarily, with initial and final success rates of 53 % and 73 %, respectively. Including the patients who underwent attempted needle-knife sphincterotomy following failure of transpancreatic septotomy (n = 6), the needle-knife technique was carried out in a total of 21 patients (6. 8 %), with initial success in 11 (52. 4 %) and eventual success in 15 (71. 4 %). The overall success rate of <b>precutting</b> using both techniques alone or in combination was 45 / 55 (82 %). Two (5. 8 %) patients with transpancreatic septotomy developed complications (one pancreatitis and one hemorrhage). Two (13. 3 %) patients with needle-knife sphincterotomy developed pancreatitis. One (16. 6 %) with the combined technique developed pancreatitis. In patients who underwent conventional pull-type sphincterotomy (n = 242), 6. 2 % developed complications (nine { 3. 7 %} pancreatitis and six { 2. 4 %} hemorrhage). The values of TNF-α and IL- 6 in the 6 th hour and 24 th hour were significantly different in patients with pancreatitis compared to patients without pancreatitis. Two related samples test showed that IL- 6 increased significantly in patients with pancreatitis (p< 0. 001) in contrast to TNF-α, which did not present significant elevation. IL- 6 increased significantly in patients with pancreatitis who received pentoxifylline (6 th and 24 th hour, p< 0. 002) and octreotide (6 th hour, p= 0. 02) and TNF-α in the 24 th hour decreased in patients who received octreotide (p= 0. 04). ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the clinical outcome of double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) -assisted {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (DB-ERCP) in patients with altered gastrointestinal anatomy. METHODS: Between September 2006 and April 2011, 47 procedures of DB-ERCP were performed in 28 patients with a Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (n = 11), Billroth II gastrectomy (n = 15), or Roux-en-Y anastomosis with hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2). DB-ERCP was performed using a short-type DBE combined with several technical innovations such as using an endoscope attachment, marking by submucosal tattooing, selectively applying contrast medium, and CO 2 insufflations. RESULTS: The papilla of Vater or hepaticojejunostomy site was reached in its entirety with a 96 % success rate (45 / 47 procedures). There {{were no significant differences}} in the success rate of reaching the blind end with a DBE among Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (96 %), Billroth II reconstruction (94 %), or pancreatoduodenectomy (100 %), respectively (P = 0. 91). The total successful rate of cannulation and contrast enhancement of the target bile duct in patients whom the blind end was reached with a DBE was 40 / 45 procedures (89 %). Again, there {{were no significant differences in}} the success rate of cannulation and contrast enhancement of the target bile duct with a DBE among Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (88 %), Billroth II reconstruction (89 %), or pancreatoduodenectomy (100 %), respectively (P = 0. 67). Treatment was achieved in all 40 procedures (100 %) in patients whom the contrast enhancement of the bile duct was successful. Common endoscopic treatments were endoscopic biliary drainage (24 procedures) and extraction of stones (14 procedures). Biliary drainage was done by placement of plastic stents. Stones extraction was done by lithotomy with the mechanical lithotripter followed by extraction with a basket or by the balloon pull-through method. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in 14 procedures with a needle <b>precutting</b> knife using a guidewire. The mean total duration of the procedure was 93. 6 1; 6. 8 min and the mean time required to reach the papilla was 30. 5 1; 3. 7 min. The mean time required to reach the papilla tended to be shorter in Billroth II reconstruction (20. 9 1; 5. 8 min) than that in Roux-en-Y total gastrectomy (37. 1 1; 4. 9 min) but there was no significant difference (P = 0. 09). A major complication occurred in one patient (3. 5 %); perforation of the long limb in a patient with Billroth II anastomosis.

40|$|Redesigning {{buildings}} {{to improve their}} space efficiency and allow changes in use is often essential during their service lives to comply with shifts in living standards and functional demands. This may require {{the introduction of new}} openings in elements such as beams, walls, and slabs,which inevitably reduces their structural performance and hence requires repair or strengthening. However, there are uncertainties regarding both the effects of openings and the best remedial optionsfor them. Traditionally, two methods have been used to strengthen reinforced concrete (RC) walls with openings, these being either to create a frame around the opening using RC/steel membersor to increase the cross-sectional thickness. Currently, intervention in existing buildings must be minimal in order to minimise inconvenience caused by limiting the use of the structure during repairs. One option is to use externally-bonded fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs). In this study, the author reports on an experimental investigation of the effectiveness of carbonFRP (CFRP) –based strengthening for restoring the axial capacity of a solid reinforced concretewall after cutting openings. Nine half-scale specimens, designed to represent typical wall panels in residential buildings with and without door-type openings, were tested to failure. The walls were tested in two-way action and subjected to axial loading with low eccentricity (defined as one sixth of the wall’s thickness) along the weak axis to represent imperfections due to thickness variation and misalignment of the panels during the construction process. An extensive instrumentation scheme was used to monitor the specimen’s behaviour during the loading cycles. In addition to classical approaches for measuring strains and displacements, optical 3 D measurements were also acquired using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. These provided better overviews of the failure mechanism by recording the crack pattern development and deformation of the walls throughout the loading history. Reducing the cross-sectional area by cutting out openings i. e. 25 % (hereafter referred to as small opening) and 50 % (hereafter referred to as large opening) led to 36 % and 50 % reductions in peak loads, respectively. In both situations the failure was brittle due to crushing of concrete with spalling and reinforcement buckling. The CFRP strengthening increased the axial capacity of walls with small and large openings by 34 – 50 % and 13 – 27 %, respectively. This partially restored theircapacities to 85 – 95 % and 57 – 63 % of their <b>precutting</b> capacity (i. e. solid wall), respectively. A procedure based on a rigid-plastic approach for evaluating the ultimate load of walls with cut-out openings that have been strengthened with FRPs was also proposed in this study. Predictions made using the proposed method agree closely with experimental results.

50|$|As {{a village}} {{with a central}} place function, three {{bakeries}} with “colonial wares” (originally, products from the “colonies”, thus coffee, tea, cane sugar, tobacco, rice and so on), two butcher’s shops and one Asko Europa-Stiftung branch covered basic demands after the Second World War and until about 1975. Available for further needs were two bank branches, a postal agency, a pharmacy, two textile shops, a shoe shop, an electrical shop, two retail and housewares shops, a stationery shop, a jewellery and watch shop, two shoemaker’s shops, an installation and heating system builder, a locksmith and blacksmith, a cabinetmaker, a painting shop, two hairdressing salons, three tailor’s shops, two dressmaker’s shops, an automotive workshop with a filling station, a Pfalzwerke AG (energy supplier) works and a Raiffeisen yard. These offerings were for a while bolstered by six inns and a cinema. Business and crafts ensured many jobs at that time. There was also work on farms, at the stone quarry and at the many diamond-cutting shops. With the mayoralty, the taxation ofﬁce, the constabulary, the primary school and the Hauptschule, Herschweiler-Pettersheim was a place with good infrastructure. With administrative restructuring in 1972, the village lost its central-place function. The mayoralty and the taxation ofﬁce were, {{in the face of}} the local populace’s opposition, dissolved and by law reassigned to the Verbandsgemeinde of Glan-Münchweiler, a great loss for the municipality, which now had to make do with being nothing more than a population centre. A further cause of this decline was the rising industrial output and mass production of daily needs, the rise of supermarkets, the population’s shift towards the throw-away society, unfavourable wage-price development in agriculture, craft occupations and the diamond industry, which sealed agriculture’s and local business’s fate. Even the post withdrew from the village and the area. Only a few survived the ruinous competition. Of all the businesses that were running just after the war, only one butcher’s shop (with a one-year interruption), one hairdressing salon, the pharmacy (run by Otto Carius) and two inns that both serve meals survived to the turn of the millennium. However, there were some new businesses that came to Herschweiler-Pettersheim in the meantime. Since 1982, a food market with baked goods and meat departments, two branch shops selling baked goods, a drink shop, a florist’s shop, a Turkish produce shop, a kebab shop and a tanning salon have located in the village. Also, in 1973, the Chalou GmbH clothing factory located on the Bockhof, manufacturing ladies’ outerwear. Following the general economic development, the actual production (sewing) was shifted to Eastern Europe, while designing, <b>precutting,</b> pattern creation, ﬁnal inspection, sales and distribution are all things that are handled at the Herschweiler-Pettersheim facility, which in 2004 employed roughly 70 women (but almost 100 in 1986). It is currently the biggest employer in the village and the biggest business tax payer in the Verbandsgemeinde. There are not very many job opportunities for villagers in the village itself nowadays. Indeed, Herschweiler-Pettersheim’s economic structure must be deemed to be rather weak. Most people in the workforce must therefore seek livelihoods in the Saarland and in the Kaiserslautern area, commuting to jobs.|$|R
