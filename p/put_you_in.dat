A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes".

That change in direction can <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze.

She refused to make Too Much Too Soon, so Warner Bros. put her on suspension, which prevented her from starring in The Brothers Karamazov (1958) at MGM. Baker was also chosen by MGM for the lead in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and by Twentieth Century Fox for The Three Faces of Eve (1957), but her contract with Warner Bros. again prevented her from accepting the roles. Tensions between Baker and the studio escalated further when she went against their wishes by appearing in Arms and the Man on stage.

[...] A writer for The Vindicator wrote, [...] "The song is a melodic blend of Usher's smooth, {{youthful}} voice and a strong, upbeat rhythm track. Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Music commended the production on [...] "You Make Me Wanna...", along with that of [...] "Nice and Slow" [...] and [...] "My Way", the second and third singles from My Way, respectively. The Daily News reviewer called the single [...] "very wonderful". When reviewing My Way, Ian Hyland from Sunday Mirror stated that, [...] "Tracks like 'You Make Me Wanna...', 'Nice And Slow' and 'Slow Jam' should <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the mood".

500|$|... "It Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R love song, {{built on}} a finger-clicking beat. The song is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 95 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Derulo's vocal range spanning from the note of E4 to the note of B5. According to Rap-Up, the song's lyrics find Derulo as the male protagonist singing praises of [...] "a lovely lady", comparing her to his [...] "greatest hit". [...] "It Girl" [...] opens with a whistling intro and an acoustic guitar melody. In the first verse, he chants about how he searched all over and finally found the girl of his dreams. He also affirms that the girl means {{much more than a}} Grammy Award to him. Its hook, which forms part of the chorus, contains the lyrics: [...] "You could be my it girl / Baby, you're the shit girl / Lovin; you could be a crime / Crazy how we fit, girl / This is it, girl / Gimme 25 to life / I just wanna rock all night long and <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the middle of my spotlight / You could be my it girl / You're my biggest hit, girl / Let me play it loud."

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund. It was filmed at the Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center, a former shopping mall which was converted to a film set in Hawthorne, California. The singer was spotted by media on November 12, 2013 on the location set wearing a Louis Vuitton ski mask while filming the video. Beyoncé does not lip-sync or dance during the video. During an interview, she explained that [...] "Superpower" [...] was a song which [...] "you can just put on repeat and <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> this trance, which is why I didn't want to perform it in the video". With that being said, she wanted to focus on slow motion shots of [...] "really powerful imagery". It features former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as Pharrell Williams, Luke James and Les Twins. The director {{said that it was}} a [...] "spontaneous decision" [...] to include them in the video; Frank Ocean was also originally planned to appear. Åkerlund elaborated on the video: It's a very untraditional way of doing music videos, to not have her lip-synch. For Beyoncé, who's a dancer, it's very unusual to have a video without a dance part. I felt part of this idea for [...] "Superpower" [...] was to have stuff be in contrast to each other, so this song is very soft and very slow, but the action you see is aggressive and very big. We discussed it many times to see if we'd have the performance in the video or not. We decided no, and I think it works really, really well. It's kind of like a brave move, if you think about it. Most artists can act and have all these different things, but they'll still fall back on the performance.|$|E

[...] At PopMatters, Scott Interrante rated the album eight discs out of ten, writing that [...] "Minor missteps aside, Yours Truly is ultimately an impressive debut for Grande." [...] Ryan Dennehy of AbsolutePunk rated the album a 70-percent, stating that [...] "Yours Truly is more tempered and less likely to <b>put</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a beaming state of catatonia" [...] that is [...] "a missive containing some of her most personal thoughts and her oft-regrettable youthful impulses." [...] At Pitchfork, Andrew Ryce rated the album a 6.5 out of ten, calling it [...] "a very safe record." [...] Lewis Conner of Digital Spy rated the album four stars out of five, writing how [...] "The production feels fresh, the lyrics are relatable and the melodies are as cool and sweet as a dollop of raspberry ripple", and where he also states that [...] "The tone and pace of the album rarely changes, but the songs feel accomplished, polished and vibrant". Corner concluded by calling [...] "Yours Truly" [...] a [...] "little less than a triumph." [...] At The Michigan Daily, Gregory Hicks graded the album a B, saying [...] "most tracks are of quality composition, lyrically and melodically, but beat usage becomes excessive at times."

Matt Casarino of PopMatters gave the album a generally favorable review, claiming that [...] "Clarkson plays it safe and spends too much time showing off her upper register, but Wrapped in Red is a warm and romantic addition to the Christmas pop Zeitgeist," [...] adding: [...] "Wrapped in Red doesn’t need edge; it’s just dynamic and varied enough to be satisfying, and it’s light-years {{better than any of}} the whitewashed Christmas crap Simon Cowell has inflicted on the world". [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave a favorable review, particularly lauding [...] "Underneath the Tree", and described Clarkson's rendering of the Christmas standards as [...] "fairly straight". She added: [...] "She starts gently on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] before belting out the money notes. She ambles assuredly through the soulful favorite [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] and hangs by the piano for a torchy “White Christmas." [...] Newsdays music columnist Glenn Gamboa wrote that [...] "Clarkson handles it all expertly — hitting remarkably high notes on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] and swinging jazzily on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Dunn. The new songs make Wrapped in Red a real gift, as the title track and [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] channel the Phil Spector Christmas albums; and [...] "4 Carats" [...] somehow blends [...] "Stronger" [...] and [...] "Santa Baby". Reviewing for HitFix, Melinda Newman gave the album an [...] "A" [...] rating, praising Clarkson's vocal performances and noting that she and Greg Kurstin [...] "have clearly studied legendary Christmas albums of yore—most notably Spector's A Christmas Gift For You and Andy Williams' Merry Christmas—to lovingly recreate Christmas standards, as well as craft new ones in the image of those sets." [...] Chris Klimek of Slate declared Wrapped in Red as the best of 2013's new Christmas records, noting it for its vintage sound. He also observed that its five original tracks, most notably [...] "Wrapped in Red" [...] and [...] "Underneath the Tree", [...] "have reasonable odds of remaining in the yuletide rotation five years from now." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Jon [...] Caramanica wrote that [...] "Clarkson is very likely the only singer working in pop with a real possibility of creating a modern holiday classic along the lines of Carey's [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", and remarked that her takes on familiar songs, however accomplished, are [...] "also faithful in the way that someone mindful of pop history would be." ...|$|E
