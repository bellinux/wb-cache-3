5|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} – With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, {{such as the}} muscles of one limb, {{one side of the}} body or {{the lower half of the}} body is reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, spina bifida, <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Salk vaccine, or inactivated {{poliovirus}} vaccine (IPV), {{is based}} on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), which are then inactivated with formalin. The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in acute flaccid paralysis. The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> can be difficult, {{since the}} {{symptoms}} are hard to separate from complications due to the original poliomyelitis infection, and from the normal infirmities of aging. There is no laboratory test for <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome,</b> nor {{are there any other}} specific diagnostic criteria. Three important criteria are recognized, including: previous diagnosis of polio, long interval after recovery and the gradual onset of weakness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{documented}} {{to occur in}} cases of nonparalytic polio (NPP). One review states late-onset weakness and fatigue occurs in 14 to 42 percent of NPP patients.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 he was {{diagnosed}} with <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome,</b> having originally contracted polio in 1962, and needed to use a wheelchair most of the time thereafter. Clarke was for many years a Vice-Patron of the British Polio Fellowship.|$|E
25|$|Clarke died in Sri Lanka on 19 March 2008 after {{suffering}} from respiratory failure, according to Rohan de Silva, {{one of his}} aides. His aide described the cause as respiratory complications and heart failure stemming from <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} two decades of her life, Lange's health was poor. She {{suffered}} from gastric problems as well as <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> – although this renewal of the pain and weakness of polio was not yet recognized by most physicians.|$|E
25|$|To {{confirm the}} diagnosis, a {{physician}} must rule out other causes of similar clinical syndromes. Other neuropathies can be differentiated {{on the basis}} of typical clinical or laboratory features. Differential diagnoses to alcoholic polyneuropathy include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, beriberi, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex and <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} no {{sufficient}} longitudinal studies on the prognosis of post-polio syndrome; however, speculations {{have been made by}} several physicians based on experience. Fatigue and mobility usually return to normal {{over a long period of}} time. The prognosis also differs depending upon different causes and factors affecting the individual. An overall mortality rate of 25 percent exists due to possible respiratory paralysis of persons with post-polio syndrome; otherwise, <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> is usually non-lethal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{occurs in}} {{approximately}} 25 to 50 {{percent of people}} who survive a poliomyelitis infection. On average, it occurs 30–35 years afterwards; however, delays of between 8–71 years have been recorded. The disease occurs sooner in persons with more severe initial infection. Other factors that increase the risk of postpolio syndrome include increasing length of time since acute poliovirus infection, presence of permanent residual impairment after recovery from the acute illness, and being female.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} for <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> is generally palliative {{and consists of}} rest, analgesia (pain relief) and utilisation of mechanisms to make life easier such as powered wheelchairs. There are no reversive therapies. Fatigue is usually the most disabling symptom; energy conservation can significantly reduce fatigue episodes. Such conservation can be achieved with lifestyle changes, reducing workload and daytime sleeping. Weight loss is also recommended if patients are obese. In some cases, the use of lower limb orthotics can reduce energy usage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Post-polio</b> <b>{{syndrome}}</b> (PPS, or post-poliomyelitis syndrome or post-polio sequelae) is {{a condition}} that affects approximately 25 to 40 {{percent of people who}} have previously survived an acute attack of poliomyelitis —a viral infection of the nervous system—after the initial infection. Typically the symptoms appear 15 to 30 years after recovery from the original paralytic attack, at an age of 35 to 60. Symptoms include acute or increased muscular weakness, pain in the muscles, and fatigue. The same symptoms may also occur years after a nonparalytic polio (NPP) infection.|$|E
25|$|Born Robert Edward Wilson in Methodist Hospital, in Brooklyn, New York, {{he spent}} his first years in Flatbush, and moved {{with his family to}} lower middle class Gerritsen Beach around the age of four or five, where they stayed until {{relocating}} to the steadfastly middle-class neighborhood of Bay Ridge when Wilson was thirteen. He suffered from polio as a child, and found generally effective treatment with the Kenny Method (created by Elizabeth Kenny) which the American Medical Association repudiated at that time. Polio's effects remained with Wilson throughout his life, usually manifesting as minor muscle spasms causing him to use a cane occasionally until 2000, when he experienced a major bout with <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> that would continue until his death.|$|E
500|$|Between 25 {{percent and}} 50 percent of {{individuals}} who have recovered from paralytic polio in childhood can develop additional symptoms decades after recovering from the acute infection, notably new muscle weakness and extreme fatigue. This condition is known as <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PPS) or post-polio sequelae. The symptoms of PPS are thought to involve {{a failure of the}} oversized motor units created during the recovery phase of the paralytic disease. [...] Contributing factors that increase the risk of PPS include aging with loss of neuron units, the presence of a permanent residual impairment after recovery from the acute illness, and both overuse and disuse of neurons. PPS is a slow, progressive disease, and there is no specific treatment for it. <b>Post-polio</b> <b>syndrome</b> is not an infectious process, and persons experiencing the syndrome do not shed poliovirus.|$|E
500|$|The Paralympic Games {{is a major}} {{international}} multi-sport event involving athletes {{with a range of}} disabilities, including impaired muscle power (e.g. paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome,</b> spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, [...] limb deficiency (e.g. amputation or dysmelia), [...] leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, [...] ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and [...] intellectual impairment. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).|$|E
500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he woke up one morning and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain <b>post-polio</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Despite this, there are currently no absolutely defined causes of PPS. The most widely accepted theory of the mechanism behind the disorder is [...] "neural fatigue". A motor unit is a nerve cell (or neuron) and the muscle fibers it activates. Poliovirus attacks specific neurons in the brainstem and the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, generally resulting {{in the death of}} a substantial fraction of the motor neurons controlling skeletal muscles. In an effort to compensate for the loss of these neurons, surviving motor neurons sprout new nerve terminals to the orphaned muscle fibers. The result is some recovery of movement and the development of enlarged motor units.|$|E
