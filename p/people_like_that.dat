I'm not going to be leaving <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> However, {{at the end of the}} episode, it gives us a pretty big cliffhanger {{question}} as well." ...|$|E

Jenkins's spokesman has said: [...] "They're old friends and they've been on several dates. But people shouldn't consider buying hats just yet." ...|$|E

[...] Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, [...] "On the football field, <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, {{but a lot of the}} time, it's just appearance.

[...] A second post appeared shortly after; titled [...] "Sorry", it featured an apology to her close friends and siblings for the trauma that her suicide would put them through, but also contained a message to her parents: [...] "Fuck you. You can't just control other <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> That's messed up."

500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Not everyone talks like that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from. We made it thick... for humor's sake, but then again, not really. There are folks with seriously heavy accents there, and they are proud of it." ...|$|E

If punk was about {{getting rid of}} hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge". Noel Gallagher of Oasis, while a fan of Nirvana, wrote music that refuted the pessimistic nature of grunge. Gallagher noted in 2006 that the 1994 Oasis single [...] "Live Forever" [...] "was written {{in the middle of}} grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and I Want to Die,' and I was like...'Well, I'm not fucking having that.'

[...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane.

500|$|Jagger and Richards {{shared an}} admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter, which {{influenced}} Brian Jones, of whom Richards says, [...] "He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's {{all the same}} shit, man, {{and you can do}} it.'" [...] Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, [...] was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. [...] "Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four." [...] Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R artists, said it [...] "seemed the most real thing" [...] he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the [...] "most powerful music [...] ever heard... the most expressive." [...] He also stated, [...] "when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters—and {{there were a lot of}} us—in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very... heartwarming".|$|E

Whit Hertford guest-starred as choreographer Dakota Stanley. Cheyenne Jackson was originally {{supposed to play}} Dakota Stanley, but {{when he arrived in}} California he learned that he had the flu. John Lloyd Young played Henri, [...] "a retired wood shop teacher with an excellent singing voice", and Victor Garber and Debra Monk played Will's parents. Morrison was [...] "thrilled" [...] by Garber's casting, having been a longstanding fan of his. Josh Groban received special guest star billing, playing, in Colfer's words, [...] "himself as this ignorant asshole". Morrison's rapping in the episode was an already acquired skill, with Gilsig commenting: [...] "He can do it. It didn't look like a joke, it actually looked totally authentic, and he was fantastic. I think he has just an amazing musical range. <b>People</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> who have been singing their whole lives, they have such a command of that."

500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook.

I can't have <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E
500|$|The Journal of the Ethnological Society of London {{focussed}} {{exclusively on}} the ethnology in the book, praising the value both of the information and of Wallace's [...] "thoughtful and suggestive speculation". The review notes that Wallace identified two [...] "types of mankind" [...] in the archipelago, [...] "the Malayan and the Papuan", and that he thought these two had [...] "no traceable affinity to each other". It remarks that Wallace greatly extends knowledge {{of the people of}} Timor, Celebes, and the Maluccas, while also adding to what is known of the Malays and Papuans, reprinting his entire description and his engraving of a Papuan. The reviewer remarks that the portrait [...] "would as well suit a Papuan of the south-east coast of New Guinea as any of those whom Mr. Wallace saw", noting however that the southern tribes are more varied in skin colour. The reviewer disagrees with Wallace about the extension of this [...] "Papuan race" [...] as far as Fiji, noting that there are or were <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in Tasmania, but that their features and height varied widely, perhaps forming a series. The reviewer disagrees also that the Sandwich Islanders and [...] "New Zealanders" [...] (Maori) are related to the Papuans; and with Wallace's claim that the presence of Malay words in Polynesian languages is caused by the [...] "roaming habits" [...] — trade and navigation – of the Malays, arguing instead that the Polynesians long ago migrated from [...] "some common seat in, or near, the Malay Archipelago". The review ends by stating that despite all these disagreements, it holds Wallace's ethnology in [...] "high estimation".|$|E

2500|$|When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, {{split from}} the {{publisher}} and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore {{to create a new}} universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's [...] "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." [...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen.

2500|$|Zoya's {{favorite}} subject in school was literature. Her teachers noted her essays for {{deep understanding of}} the subject and for imagery. She read far beyond the curriculum. The list of authors she read included Leo Tolstoy, Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Karamzin, Vasily Zhukovsky, Byron, Molière, Miguel Cervantes, Charles Dickens, Wolfgang Goethe, and William Shakespeare. Zoya kept a notebook where she recorded her thoughts about the books she read. Such as: [...] "In Shakespeare's tragedies {{the death of a}} hero is always accompanied by a triumph of a high moral cause." [...] She liked Beethoven's Egmont and often sang Klärchen's song [...] "Die Trommel gerühret." [...] Her favorite music was Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5. Her striving for high ideals led to misunderstandings with her classmates. On the eve of 1939 the girls wrote each other notes with New Year wishes. Zoya received the following note [...] "Zoya, don't judge people so strict. Don't take everything so close to heart. Know that most people are egoist, flatterers, are insincere and you can't depend on them. You should leave their words without attention. Such is my New Year wish."

2500|$|... "Dark layers", and a nuanced {{personality}} of [...] "many different levels and shades" [...] attracted Akingbola to the role. Malick has a violent streak, and is introduced after hitting his former boss, though he becomes calmer with time. A February 2011 episode saw his composure {{threatened by a}} racist patient. Akingbola appreciated the storyline for highlighting the continuation of racism and prejudice: [...] "In this country, we can feel like there's no racism and it's like a lovely Benetton advert but it's still there – that's the truth." [...] He characterised Malick as [...] "not all bad", capable of becoming [...] "a nice guy", and expanded: [...] "I think the thing with Malick is that he's young, confident and he speaks from the heart. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and I don't think there's many <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> on the ward! He doesn't care if what he says offends people, because that's what he believes. But he becomes a bit more sensitive." [...] Akingbola anticipated many [...] "twists and turns" [...] in Malick's storylines. He described him as having many secrets, and being a closed off person who [...] "keeps his cards very close to his chest." [...] Using the simile of an onion, he asserted that Malick's layers would be peeled back slowly, to reveal his [...] "wonderful heart".|$|E

Konnie Huq reportedly described them as [...] "bloody aggressive" [...] and [...] "robotic". The BBC reported that London's Metropolitan Police criticized the Protection Unit for [...] "getting in the way of officers trying to restore calm". Also in the United Kingdom, Shadow Home Secretary David Davis expressed concerns about the Protection Unit, and asked Home Secretary Jacqui Smith: “Who in the British Government authorized their presence and what checks were made as to their background?” Damian Hockney, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, stated that [...] "there's no way <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> should be allowed on our streets". At a later mayoral debate, the incumbent mayor, Ken Livingstone, admitted that allowing the Chinese secret police to guard the Olympic torch during its London relay was a mistake saying [...] "it was wrong and should not have happened". On April 25, the British government's national security department, the Home Office, passed complaints about Chinese security guards' conduct during the London Olympic torch relay to the Olympic Games organisers. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith stated that the guards had no policing powers and that they could only protect the Olympic flame by [...] "placing themselves between the offender and the torch bearer".
