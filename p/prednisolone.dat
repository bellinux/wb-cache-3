5|$|Current {{preclinical}} {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under <b>prednisolone</b> in a study using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight gain or increase of blood glucose were practically inexistent.|$|E
5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} <b>prednisolone</b> and ciclosporin if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|In vivo {{studies in}} {{mice and rats}} showed that a topically {{administered}} SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of oedema, both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to <b>prednisolone.</b> Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and colitis. In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic glucocorticoid in cancer pathologies is currently lacking.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. <b>Prednisolone</b> (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} most {{immunosuppressive}} regimens is <b>prednisolone,</b> a corticosteroid. <b>Prednisolone</b> suppresses the immune system, but its long-term use at high doses causes {{a multitude of}} side effects, including glucose intolerance and diabetes, weight gain, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, hypercholesterolemia, and cataract formation. <b>Prednisolone</b> alone is usually inadequate to prevent rejection of a transplanted kidney. Thus other, non-steroid immunosuppressive agents are needed, which also allow lower doses of <b>prednisolone.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{usefulness}} of corticosteroids (e.g., <b>prednisolone</b> or dexamethasone) {{in the treatment}} of TB is proven for TB meningitis and TB pericarditis. The dose for TB meningitis is dexamethasone 8 to 12mg daily tapered off over six weeks (for those who prefer more precise dosing should refer to Thwaites et al., 2004). The dose for pericarditis is <b>prednisolone</b> 60mg daily tapered off over four to eight weeks.|$|E
25|$|A {{history of}} heartburn, {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD) {{and use of}} certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit cyclooxygenase, and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone and <b>prednisolone).</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{autoimmune}} hemolytic anemia, {{concentrations of}} hemoglobin A1 (HbA1) is undetectable. Administration of <b>prednisolone</b> (PSL) {{will allow the}} HbA1 to be detected. The alternative fructosamine test {{may be used in}} these circumstances and it also reflects an average of blood glucose levels over the preceding 2 to 3 weeks.|$|E
25|$|A {{urine sample}} {{provided}} by Tharanga {{after the world}} cup semi-final against New Zealand on 29 March 2011 {{was found to have}} metabolites of two glucocorticosteroids – prednisone and <b>prednisolone,</b> which are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Tharanga initially claimed he had taken some medication for asthma and had no idea it was a banned drug.|$|E
25|$|Oral steroids such as <b>prednisolone</b> are {{commonly}} used; however, side effects are common, {{and the horse}} may be predisposed to laminitis. Therefore, the use of aerosolised steroids via an equine inhaler are becoming more common. This route of administration reduces the dose required, {{and the risk of}} side effects. Originally, beclomethasone was used, but newer compounds are available now, such as fluticasone propionate.|$|E
25|$|Steroid-induced {{osteoporosis}} (SIOP) arises due {{to use of}} glucocorticoids– {{analogous to}} Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Some professional guidelines recommend prophylaxis in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30mg hydrocortisone (7.5mg of <b>prednisolone),</b> especially when this is in excess of three months. Alternate day use may not prevent this complication.|$|E
25|$|More than 75% {{of women}} with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis have symptoms improve during pregnancy but might have symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and leflunomide are teratogenic (harmful to foetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended {{women of childbearing age}} should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and to discontinue its use if pregnancy is planned. Low dose of <b>prednisolone,</b> hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are considered safe in pregnant persons with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} as {{to whether}} steroids (such as <b>prednisolone)</b> can decrease the severity of hemolytic crises. Transfusion therapy may be needed; in addition to correcting significant anemia, this suppresses the production of PNH cells by the bone marrow, and indirectly {{the severity of the}} hemolysis. Iron deficiency develops with time, due to losses in urine, and may have to be treated if present. Iron therapy can result in more hemolysis as more PNH cells are produced.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron may be beneficial, however, {{there are}} some {{concerns}} regarding an association with cleft palate, {{and there is little}} high-quality data. Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated. Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak; {{there is some evidence that}} corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of oral facial clefts in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity. However, hydrocortisone and <b>prednisolone</b> are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum after 12 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated {{with a combination of}} <b>prednisolone</b> and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{provided}} to all {{children and adults}} with all but the mildest and latest-onset forms of CAH. The glucocorticoids provide a reliable substitute for cortisol, thereby reducing ACTH levels. Reducing ACTH also reduces the stimulus for continued hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens. In other words, glucocorticoid replacement is the primary method of reducing the excessive adrenal androgen production in both sexes. A number of glucocorticoids are available for therapeutic use. Hydrocortisone or liquid <b>prednisolone</b> is preferred in infancy and childhood, and prednisone or dexamethasone are often more convenient for adults.|$|E
25|$|Neurosarcoidosis, once confirmed, is {{generally}} treated with glucocorticoids such as <b>prednisolone.</b> If this is effective, the dose may gradually be reduced (although many patients need {{to remain on}} steroids long-term, frequently leading to side-effects such as diabetes or osteoporosis). Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, pentoxifylline, thalidomide and infliximab {{have been reported to}} be effective in small studies. In patients unresponsive to medical treatment, radiotherapy may be required. If the granulomatous tissue causes obstruction or mass effect, neurosurgical intervention is sometimes necessary. Seizures can be prevented with anticonvulsants, and psychiatric phenomena may be treated with medication usually employed in these situations.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} usually {{consists of}} the administration of corticosteroids, a group of medications that suppress the immune system. The dose and mode of administration is determined by platelet count and whether there is active bleeding: in urgent situations, infusions of dexamethasone or methylprednisolone may be used, while oral prednisone or <b>prednisolone</b> may suffice in less severe cases. Once the platelet count has improved, the dose of steroid is gradually reduced while the possibility of relapse is monitored. 60–90 percent will experience a relapse during dose reduction or cessation. Long-term steroids are avoided if possible because of potential side-effects that include osteoporosis, diabetes and cataracts.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or <b>prednisolone.</b> The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation {{in the hope of}} a permanent cure.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} {{are commonly}} associated with pancreatitis, most commonly corticosteroids such as <b>prednisolone,</b> but also including the HIV medications didanosine and pentamidine, diuretics, the anticonvulsant valproic acid, the chemotherapeutic agents L-asparaginase and azathioprine, estrogen by way of increased blood triglycerides, and antihyperglycemic agents like metformin, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin. It may be noted here that the drugs used to treat conditions that are themselves associated with increased events of pancreatitis may also be incidentally linked to pancreatitis. Examples include statins in dyslipidemia and DPP-4 inhibitors in diabetes. According to the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch Surveillance System and Published Reports Atypical, atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can also cause pancreatitis.|$|E
25|$|No {{controlled}} {{clinical trials}} {{have been conducted}} on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of <b>prednisolone.</b> Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of {{less than three weeks}} duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Russian hackers hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ADAMS {{anti-doping}} {{system and}} released {{data on a}} number of athletes, including Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins. Therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) are medical exemptions athletes can be given when they need treatment for pre-existing medical conditions where the drugs used in the treatment are on the WADA prohibited compound list. The leak demonstrated that Wiggins had received TUEs for triamcinolone acetonide in June 2011, June 2012 and April 2013, a number of days {{before the start of the}} 2011 Tour de France, 2012 Tour de France, and 2013 Giro d'Italia respectively. Wiggins also received TUEs for salbutamol, fluticasone, formoterol and budesonide whilst at Team Highroad. Froome had received TUEs for <b>prednisolone</b> in May 2013 and during the 2014 Tour de Romandie.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{alcoholic}} hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat. Without any treatment, 20-50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality). Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), {{which is a}} nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or <b>prednisolone</b> (CS), corticosteroids with N-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX). Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality. Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis. In these cases PTX may be considered {{on a case by}} case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo. Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients’ risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, <b>prednisolone</b> 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E

2500|$|If an adrenal adenoma is identified, it may {{be removed}} by surgery. An ACTH-secreting corticotrophic {{pituitary}} adenoma should be removed after diagnosis. Regardless of the adenoma's location, most patients [...] require steroid replacement postoperatively {{at least in the}} interim, as long-term suppression of pituitary ACTH and normal adrenal tissue does not recover immediately. Clearly, if both adrenals are removed, replacement with hydrocortisone or <b>prednisolone</b> is imperative.|$|E
2500|$|Acne usually flares up 2–3 {{weeks into}} the {{treatment}} and is usually mild and tolerable. Occasionally this flare-up is severe, necessitating oral antiobiotics such as erythromycin. A short course of oral <b>prednisolone</b> may be required. Some dermatologists favour {{a few weeks of}} pre-treatment with oral antibiotics before commencing isotretinoin to reduce the chance of a severe flare. A [...] "stepped" [...] course may also be used to reduce the chance of this initial flare, by which the initial dose is low (e.g. 0.5mg/kg) and subsequently increased throughout the course.|$|E
2500|$|Non-surgical {{intervention}} is usually via a suitable {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) which doubles as an anti-inflammatory and painkiller. Typical NSAIDs used for hip dysplasia include carprofen and meloxicam (often sold as Rimadyl and Metacam respectively), both used to treat arthritis resulting from dysplasia, although other NSAIDs such as [...] tepoxalin (Zubrin) and prednoleucotropin ("PLT", a combination of cinchophen and <b>prednisolone)</b> are sometimes tried. NSAIDs vary dramatically between species as to effect: a safe NSAID in one species may be unsafe in another. It is important to follow veterinary advice.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: [...] or adult F. gigantica: 25–75×12mm, fasciolosis is a big concern. The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans. Treatment with triclabendazole has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as bithionol are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing cholangitis [...] has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and toxaemia may be treated with <b>prednisolone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hip pain {{is usually}} {{seen by the}} age of 6 to 8 months. [...] The disease is {{bilateral}} in 12 to 16% of cases. X-rays are necessary to make the diagnosis and show increased opacity and focal lysis in the head of the femur, and later in the disease, collapse and fracture of the neck of the femur. [...] The recommended treatment is surgical removal of the head of the femur, but conservative treatment (rest, exercise restriction, and pain medication) may be effective in a limited number of cases (less than 25%, according to some studies). [...] In dogs, the prognosis is excellent with surgery. [...] <b>Prednisolone</b> tablets may also be helpful.|$|E
2500|$|Immuno{{suppress}}ant {{drugs are}} used to suppress the immune system from rejecting the donor kidney. These medicines must be taken {{for the rest of}} the recipient's life. The most common medication regimen today is a mixture of tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and <b>prednisolone.</b> Some recipients may instead take ciclosporin, sirolimus, or azathioprine. The risk of early rejection of the transplanted kidney is increased if corticosteroids are avoided or withdrawn after the transplantation. Ciclosporin, considered a breakthrough immunosuppressive when first discovered in the 1980s, ironically causes nephrotoxicity and can result in iatrogenic damage to the newly transplanted kidney. Tacrolimus, which is a similar drug, also causes nephrotoxicity. Blood levels of both must be monitored closely and if the recipient seems to have declining renal function or proteinuria, a biopsy may be necessary to determine whether this is due to rejection [...] or ciclosporin or tacrolimus intoxication [...]|$|E
