500|$|With less {{control on}} his changeup, Hoffman {{struggled}} in 2010. In April, Hoffman pitched nine innings and allowed 13earned runs and six home runs—surpassing his totals in both categories {{from all of}} the previous season—and he blew four of his seven save opportunities. Historically though, Hoffman had blown 20 of 84 save attempts in April for his career, a 76.1 <b>percent</b> <b>success</b> rate, while converting 90.6 percent the rest of the season. On May 1, Hoffman earned his first save at Petco Park as a visitor, as the Brewers beat the Padres 2–1. After saving just five of his first 10 chances with an ERA over 12.00 in mid-May, Hoffman's struggles prompted Brewers manager Ken Macha to remove him as closer and move him into middle relief to work on his mechanics. Hoffman insisted that there was nothing physically wrong with him, and he served as a mentor for his replacement, John Axford. Stuck at 596 career saves before his demotion, Hoffman eventually returned to a setup role, and occasionally pitched in save situations. On September 7, 2010, he recorded his 600th save, and he was carried off the field by his teammates. [...] "To {{be a part of it}} was great because of how much admiration we all have for Trevor", said teammate Craig Counsell. Hoffman finished the season win a 2–7 win–loss record, 10 saves in 15 chances, and a 5.89 ERA in 50 appearances, but he allowed just nine earned runs in his final 33 appearances dating back to June 3. He and the Brewers parted ways on November 2 when the club declined to exercise a $7 million mutual option on his contract.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} {{of the type}} of soil surface where a robotic vehicle is navigating on is an important issue for performing several agricultural tasks. Satisfactory results in activities such as seeding, plowing, fertilizing, among others depend on a correct identification of the vehicle environment, specially its contact interface with the ground. In the this work, the implementation of a supervised image texture classifier to recognize five different classes of typical agricultural soil surfaces is presented and analysed. The sensing device is the Microsoft Kinect for Windows V 2, which allows to acquire RGB, IR and depth data. Only IR and depth data were used for the processing, since color information becomes unreliable under different illumination conditions. Two data acquisition modes allowed to validate and to apply the system in real operation conditions.

2500|$|When {{performed}} with a YAG laser {{designed specifically for}} vitreolysis, reported side effects and complications associated with vitreolysis are rare. However, YAG lasers have traditionally been designed {{for use in the}} anterior portion of the eye, i.e. posterior capsulotomy and iridotomy treatments. As a result, they often provide a limited view of the vitreous, which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes. They also carry a high risk of damage to surrounding ocular tissue. Accordingly, vitreolysis is not widely practised, being performed by very few specialists. One of them, John Karickhoff, has performed the procedure more than 1,400 times and claims a 90 <b>percent</b> <b>success</b> rate. However, the MedicineNet web site states that [...] "there is no evidence that this [...] is effective. The use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye." [...] A YAG laser optimized for use in the posterior segment, in addition to use in the anterior segment, is recommended for vitreolysis. In order to visualize the floater and target accordingly, the laser's light source must be positioned in the same optical axis as the ophthalmologist's visual axis. Most conventional YAG lasers, in contrast, use a lower angle of illuminating light. Whilst these lasers are well-suited to use in the anterior part of the eye, they are ill-equipped for use in the vitreous chamber, and thereby make it difficult for the ophthalmologist to visualize (and treat) the floater(s).|$|E
