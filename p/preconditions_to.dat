5000|$|Fritz, in American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War, {{describes}} a duality in American views on <b>preconditions</b> <b>to</b> {{the right of}} revolution: [...] "Some of the first state constitutions included 'alter or abolish' provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution" [...] in that they required dire <b>preconditions</b> <b>to</b> its exercise. Maryland's 1776 constitution and New Hampshire's 1784 constitutions required the perversion of the ends of government and the endangering of public liberty and that all other means of redress were to no avail. But in contrast, other states dispensed with the onerous preconditions on the exercise of the right. In the 1776 Virginia constitution the right would arise simply if government was [...] "inadequate" [...] and Pennsylvania's 1776 constitution required only that the people considered a change to be [...] "most conducive" [...] to the public welfare.|$|E

5000|$|Teachers {{are also}} {{affected}} by {{the children in the}} classroom. Teachers reflect what is projected into them by their students. An experiment done by Jenkins and Deno (1969) submitted teachers to a classroom of children who had either been told to be attentive, or unattentive, to the teachers' lecture. They found that teachers who were in the attentive condition would rate their teaching skills as higher. Similar findings by Herrell (1971) stated that when a teacher was <b>preconditioned</b> <b>to</b> classrooms as warm or cold, the teacher would start to gravitate towards their <b>precondition.</b> <b>To</b> further this concept, Klein (1971) did the same kind of study involving teachers still unaware of any <b>precondition</b> <b>to</b> the classroom but with the class full of confederates who were instructed to act differently during periods {{over the course of the}} lecture. [...] "Klein reported that there was little difference between students' behaviors in the natural and the positive conditions." [...] In a more observational study designed to remove the likes of the Hawthorne effect, Oppenlander (1969) studied the top and bottom 20% of students in the sixth grade from a school that tracks and organizes its students under such criteria.|$|R
