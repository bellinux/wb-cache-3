50|$|Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), {{also known}} as PENT, PENTA, TEN, corpent, <b>penthrite</b> (or—rarely and {{primarily}} in German—as nitropenta), is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol, and is structurally very similar to nitroglycerin. Penta refers to the five carbon atoms of the neopentane skeleton.|$|E
50|$|Modern minke whaling is {{conducted}} by many small to medium-sized fishing boats {{in spring and}} summer seasons. These vessels are equipped with a 50 mm or 60 mm harpoon cannon and <b>penthrite</b> grenade tipped harpoons designed to explode inside the whale. Each harpoon is connected to a nylon line and through a system of springs to a winch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>penthrite</b> grenade prototype increased the instantaneous death rate (IDR) of minke whales from 17% with [...] "cold harpoons" [...] (harpoons without explosives) to 45% during a study in 1985-1986. In 2000 the improved Whalegrenade-99 became mandatory and combined with better training further increased the IDR to 80% in all three subsequent whaling seasons in 2000-2002 with no statistical {{significant difference between the}} three seasons.|$|E
50|$|A {{harpoon cannon}} is a whaling {{implement}} {{developed in the}} late 19th century and most used in the 20th century. It would be mounted on the bow of a whale catcher, where it could be easily aimed with a wide field of view at the target. Powered by black powder and later, smokeless powder, it would generally fire a large steel harpoon, either solid steel (cold harpoon) or fitted with an exploding black powder, or later, <b>penthrite</b> (PETN) grenade.|$|E
50|$|The modern whaling harpoon {{consists}} of a deck-mounted launcher (mostly a cannon) and a projectile which is a large harpoon with an explosive (<b>penthrite)</b> charge, attached to a thick rope. The spearhead is shaped in a manner which allows it to penetrate the thick layers of whale blubber and stick in the flesh. It has sharp spikes to prevent the harpoon from sliding out. Thus, by pulling the rope with a motor, the whalers can drag the whale back to their ship.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{types of}} [...] "whale grenades" [...] were {{developed}} using the explosive <b>penthrite.</b> Two {{of these were}} made for 50 mm and 60 mm cannons, one for 90 mm cannons for Icelanders hunting fin and sei whales, {{and one for the}} darting guns used by Alaskan subsistence whalers. In 2000, an improved model called Hvalgranat-99 (Whalegrenade-99), previously developed in cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt - FFI), was put into production and is currently used by Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Japan. The development of this technology was funded by the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries which recovered the cost through the sale of whale grenades.|$|E
50|$|Pro-whaling entities, such as North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission have {{commented that}} it is a {{violation}} of sovereign rights to impose anti-whaling regulations on an independent state, and raise concerns about those nations' factory farming operations, which they see as considerably more harmful than whaling. Many supporters of whaling agree that its macroeconomic importance is negligible, but hold that the livelihood of individuals and small firms depend on it and that sustainable development depends on human harvesting of all non-endangered species, and {{that it is}} an important part of culture in coastal areas. Arne Kalland argues that international pressure against whaling is a form of cultural imperialism imposed on Norway. Norway's whaling today is limited to the minke whale, which are killed using explosive <b>penthrite</b> grenade harpoons, which also accounts for more than 90% of the catch in Norwegian waters since the 1920s.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Alaskan Eskimos catch bowhead whales of the {{protected}} Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea stock using old-fashioned weapons and grenades filled with black powder. Killing {{is sometimes a}} lengthy process, and in some years relatively large numbers of animals are lost. A new grenade containing the explosive <b>penthrite</b> was developed for the Eskimos ’ traditional weapons and first tested in the bowhead whale hunt in 1988, when eight whales were killed by <b>penthrite</b> grenades. Seven of these were landed, and one dead whale was lost. Five whales died instantaneously or within five minutes. Tissue and organ damage was inspected by post-mortem examination. Although data collected after 1988 are less reliable, the survival times recorded for animals landed up to 1992 were markedly shorter for the <b>penthrite</b> grenade than for the traditional black powder grenade. Median survival times were 62 minutes for whales killed by black powder grenades and 15 minutes for those killed by <b>penthrite</b> grenades; 21 % and 45 % of the animals, respectively, were recorded as dead within five minutes, and 32 % and 19 %, respectively, were lost. The <b>penthrite</b> grenade {{is likely to become}} a highly effective weapon for the bowhead whale hunt, although further modification and testing will be needed before large-scale use. An educational and training programme for all prospective users should also be arranged. The possibility of improving other catch equipment to reduce whale loss should also be considered.

40|$|This Diploma Thesis {{is focused}} on {{investigation}} of the voltammetric behavior of the explosive <b>penthrite</b> (pentaerythritol tetranitrate) (PETN) and on searching for optimum conditions for its determination using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) (this part of the Diploma Thesis follows the topic investigated in the author's Bachelor Thesis; in this Diploma Thesis, {{the results of the}} Bachelor thesis are applied to the determination of PETN in environmental matrices) and at a mercury meniscus modified silver solid amalgam electrode (m-AgSAE) and on investigation of voltammetric behavior in real samples (deionized, drinking, and river water). For investigating the behavior of PETN in aqueous-methanolic media on the m-AgSAE, mixtures of Britton-Robinson buffers (BR-buffers) and methanol in various volume ratios were used. In non-aqueous media, methanolic solutions of tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB), tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) were used as supporting electrolytes. Firstly, the influence of pH (in the range of 2 - 13) and methanol content (10 - 90 vol. %) on voltammetric responses of PETN was studied. The best response was obtained at each of those pH values at the volume ratio of BR-buffer - methanol of 1 : 9 or [...] ...|$|E

Mixtures of Britton-Robinson buffer (BR-buffer) and methanol in a volume ratio of 9 : 1 were used as supporting electrolytes in the investigation of voltammetric behavior of PETN in aqueous-methanolic media, and methanolic solutions of tetramethylammonium bromide (TMAB) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) were used for investigations in non-aqueous (methanolic) media. Initially, the study of the influence of pH on voltammetric behavior of PETN was performed. Three pH values of the BR-buffer were chosen as suitable: 2. 0, 6. 0, and 9. 0. At these pH values, the influence of the content of methanol in a supporting electrolyte on the voltammetric response of PETN was measured. At all three pH values, the best responses were obtained at a volume ratio of the BR-buffer and methanol of 9 : 1 or at a 100 % content of methanol (here, TMAB and TBAC methanolic supporting electrolytes were tested and TMAB was selected as the optimum one). Concentration dependences were measured in five different media (in the concentration [...] ...|$|E
