40|$|Introduction. In Japan, the {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of total}} colonoscopy (TCS) for <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> of colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. We compared {{the cost of}} identifying a patient with CRC using two <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> strategies: TCS (strategy 1) and the immunochemical fecal test (FIT) (strategy 2). Materials and Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the TCS screening database at our institution from February 2004 to August 2010 (strategy 1, = 15, 348) and the Japanese nationwide survey of CRC screening in 2008 (strategy 2, = 5, 267, 443). Results. 112 and 6, 838 [*]CRC cases were detected in strategies 1 and 2, costing 2, 124, 000 [*]JPY and 1, 629, 000 [*]JPY, respectively. The rate of earlier-stage CRC was higher in strategy 1. Conclusions. The cost was higher using TCS as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> procedure. However, {{the difference was not}} excessive, and considering the increased rate of detecting earlier CRC, the use of TCS as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> tool may be cost-effective...|$|R

Material from 5, 064 SurePath samples of women participating in routine cervical screening in Copenhagen, Denmark, was tested with the four assays. Positive agreement between the assays was measured as the conditional probability {{that the results of}} all compared assays were positive given that at least one assay returned a positive result. Of all 5, 064 samples, 1, 679 (33. 2 %) tested positive on {{at least one of the}} assays. Among these, 41 % tested positive on all four. Agreement was lower in women aged $ 30 years (30 %, vs. 49 % at, 30 years), in <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> samples (29 %, vs. 38 % in follow-up samples), and in women with concurrent normal cytology (22 %, vs. 68 % with abnormal cytology). Among <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> samples from women aged 30 – 65 years (n = 2, 881), 23 % tested positive on at least one assay, and 42 to 58 % of these showed positive agreement on any compared pair of the assays. While 4 % of <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> samples showed abnormal cytology, 6 to 10 % were discordant on any pair of assays. A literature review corroborated our findings of considerable disagreement between human papillomavirus assays. This suggested that the extent of disagreement in <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> is neither population- nor storage media-specific, leaving assay design differences as the most probable cause. The substantially different selection of women testing positive on the various human papillomavirus assays represents an unexpected challenge for the choice of an assay in <b>primary</b> cervical <b>screening...</b>|$|R

40|$|The use of {{colonoscopy}} as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> {{test for}} colorectal cancer (CRC) in average risk adults {{is a subject}} of controversy. Our primary objective was to build a predictive model based on a few simple variables {{that could be used}} as a guide for identifying average risk adults more suitable for examination with colonoscopy as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> test. METHODS: The prevalence of advanced adenomas was assessed by <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> colonoscopy in 2210 consecutive adults at least 40 yr old, without known risk factors for CRC. Age, gender, and clinical and biochemical data were compared among people without adenomas, those with non-advanced adenomas, and those with any advanced neoplasm. A combined score to assess the risk of advanced adenomas was built with the variables selected by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Neoplastic lesions were found in 617 subjects (27. 9 %), including 259 with at least one neoplasm that was 10 mm or larger, villous, or with moderate-to-severe dysplasia, and 11 with invasive cancers. Advanced lesions were more frequent among men, older people, and those with a higher body mass index (BMI). These three variables were independent predictors of advanced adenomas in multivariate analysis. A score combining age, sex, and BMI was developed as a guide for identifying individuals more suitable for screening colonoscopy.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The ligase chain {{reaction}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis assay uses ligase {{chain reaction}} technology to detect tuberculous DNA sequences in clinical specimens. A study was undertaken {{to determine its}} sensitivity and specificity as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> tool {{for the detection of}} culture positive tuberculosis.  METHODS—The study was conducted on 2420 clinical specimens (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, pleural fluid, urine) submitted for <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to a regional medical microbiology laboratory. Specimens were tested in parallel with smear, ligase chain reaction, and culture.  RESULTS—Thirty nine patients had specimens testing positive by the ligase chain reaction assay. Thirty two patients had newly diagnosed tuberculosis, one had a tuberculosis relapse, three had tuberculosis (on antituberculous therapy when tested), and three had healed tuberculosis. In the newly diagnosed group specimens were smear positive in 21 cases (66 %), ligase chain reaction positive in 30 cases (94 %), and culture positive in 32 cases (100 %). Using a positive culture to diagnose active tuberculosis, the ligase chain reaction assay had a sensitivity of 93. 9 %, a specificity of 99. 8 %, a positive predictive value of 83. 8 %, and a negative predictive value of 99. 9 %.  CONCLUSIONS—This study is the largest clinical trial to date to report the efficacy of the ligase chain reaction as a <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> tool to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The authors conclude that ligase chain reaction is a useful <b>primary</b> <b>screening</b> test for tuberculosis, offering speed and discrimination {{in the early stages of}} diagnosis and complementing traditional smear and culture techniques. ...|$|R

Phenotyping includes the generation of a standardized biobank of paraffin-embedded tissues for each mouse line, but histopathology is not routinely performed. In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary phenotyping screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (n= 30) or without (n= 20) clinical phenotypes detected by the standard MGP primary phenotyping screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63. 3 %) in which the <b>primary</b> <b>screen</b> detected a phenotype. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14 %) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard <b>primary</b> <b>screen.</b> Three of these seven lines had no clinical phenotype detected by the standard <b>primary</b> <b>screen.</b> Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls.

A <b>primary</b> <b>screen</b> of a 13, 001 compound library at a 10 µM final concentration was conducted using the 384 -well format. Z′ values ranged from 0. 54 – 0. 83 with a median of 0. 74.
