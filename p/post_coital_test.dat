40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of temperature on the outcome of intrauterine insemination (IUI), if any. Methodology: In this prospective study, 274 and 294 cycles of Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI) were done at two different time of the year (2005 - 2006), in the cold and hot weather. The minimum and the maximum range of temperature in the cold weather were 3 °C to 17 °C and 13 °C to 27 °C and in the hot weather were 25 °C to 32 °Cand 43 °C to 50 °C respectively. The selected infertile couples were male factor infertility with abnormal parameters of semen, sexual dysfunction and abnormal <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> <b>test</b> and ovulatory factor and unexplained infertility. Pregnancy was confirmed by serum Beta HCG. Results: Among 274 cycles in the cold weather, 24 patients got pregnant, (PR/cycle = 8. 75 %) and among 294 cycles in the hot weather 18 patients were pregnant, (PR/cycle = 6. 12 %) (P= 0. 23) There was no significant correlation between temperature and the outcome of IUI. Conclusion: The finding of the study shows that the outcome of IUI is not influenced by temperature and weather is if no importance for IUI...|$|E

40|$|The innate immune factors {{controlling}} Candida albicans {{are mostly}} unknown. Vulvovaginal candidiasis {{is common in}} women and affects approximately 70 - 75 % of all women at least once. Despite the propensity of Candida to colonize the vagina, transmission of Candida albicans following sexual intercourse is very rare. This prompted us to investigate whether the <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> vaginal milieu contained factors active against C. albicans. By CFU assays, we found prominent candidacidal activity of <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> seminal plasma at both neutral and the acid vaginal pH. In contrast, normal seminal plasma did not display candidacidal activity prior to acidification. By antifungal gel overlay assay, one clearing zone corresponding to a protein band was found in both <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> and normal seminal plasma, which was subsequently identified as beta-microseminoprotein. At neutral pH, the fungicidal activity of beta-microseminoprotein and seminal plasma was inhibited by calcium. By NMR spectroscopy, amino acid residue E- 71 was shown to be critical for the calcium coordination. The acidic vaginal milieu unleashed the fungicidal activity by decreasing the inhibitory effect of calcium. The candidacidal activity of beta-microseminoprotein was mapped to a fragment of the C-terminal domain with no structural similarity to other known proteins. A homologous fragment from porcine beta-microseminoprotein demonstrated calcium-dependent fungicidal activity in a CFU assay, suggesting {{this may be a}} common feature for members of the beta-microseminoprotein family. By electron microscopy, beta-microseminoprotein was found to cause lysis of Candida. Liposome experiments demonstrated that beta-microseminoprotein was active towards ergosterol-containing liposomes that mimic fungal membranes, offering an explanation for the selectivity against fungi. These data identify beta-microseminoprotein as an important innate immune factor active against C. albicans and may help explain the low sexual transmission rate of Candida...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{colposcopy}} for {{follow up}} {{of patients with}} abnormal cervical smears has considerably increased the rate of detection of cervical malignancies and intraepithelial lesions in recent years. In case the lesion is situated {{high up in the}} cervical canal however, the chances of missing out the lesion are considerable.

Colposcopically directed biopsy also showed the same findings. On a high index of suspicion clinically, the endocervical sampling was done with a cytobrush, which showed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix. Subsequent hysterectomy of the patient confirmed the diagnosis. Simultaneous endocervical sampling considerably increases the chances of finding an intracanalar lesion, particularly in older women, in whom the transitional zone (TZ) is situated high up in the cervical canal.

40|$|Our first {{aim was to}} {{generate}} transgenic mice to express beta-galactosidase reporter gene {{under the control of}} the two promoters. The model would allow us to study the temporal and spatial expression of PTH 1 R during the onset of embryonic endochondral ossification, and in the adult.

We have cloned 11 kilobases of mouse PTH 1 R gene promoter sequence containing four untranslated exons U 1, U 2, U 3 and SS, and fused this to a Lac Z reporter gene, which was in turn fused to a 250 by fragment containing the A-rich polyadenylylation signal. Three additional constructs were made with deletion of transcription start sites in exon U 1 (DeltaU 1), U 3 (DeltaU 3) and both (DeltaU 1 DeltaU 3).

Western Blot and immunohistochemical techniques were employed to study {{the distribution of the}} glycoprotein, and the results suggest that this glycoprotein is present only in the day 4 p. c. uterus and is specifically localized in the stromal cells. Administration of anti-UA (Uterine Agglutinin) antiserum against the glycoprotein into the day 4 p. c. uterine lumen inhibits carrying of embryo to term. The antiserum is not embryo toxic. After in vivo in utero intra-luminal administration of anti-UA antiserum in day 4 p. c. rat the antiserum has been specifically localized in the uterine stroma by immunohistochemistry. After intravenous injection, the glycoprotein is cleared mainly through the kidney and liver. The possible role of this glycoprotein in the implantation process in rats has been discussed. From the data it is evident that UA may not be directly involved in sugar-sugar interactions with embryo since it is not present in any significant amount in pregnant uterus from day 5 onwards. Since other experiments show that UA does have some role to play in early pregnancy, UA probably acts through some other factor, and preliminary studies suggest that this factor maybe TGF-b 3.

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{well known}} that the use of the α-adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonists in the BPH therapy may induce ejaculatory disorder. A review of clinical literature shows a greater incidence of ejaculatory disorder during the use of tamsulosin compared with alfuzosin. Anejaculation has been until now referred to retrograde ejaculation due to relaxation of prostatic and bladder neck smooth muscle tone. In a recent researches was evaluated the effect of tamsulosin and alfuzosin on rat vas deferent "in vitro", concluding that tamsulosin may "cause ejaculatory dysfunction by altering the progression and emission of sperm". An abnormal increase of contraction would be the cause of ejaculatory disorder. The aim of our paper is to compare human and rat vas deferens contractile activity and to evaluate with a clinical study if tamsulosin causes retrograde ejaculation disorder. Methods We have revaluated the human and rat vas deferens contractile activity in vitro according to our experience and literature. We have also performed a clinical study on 10 patients (48 – 72 y) affected by anejaculation. Post-coital urine was examined to search spermatozoa. Results Human and rat vas deferens activity is not comparable. Contractile activity induced by norepinephrin after tamsulosin incubation in rat prostatic vas deferens strips is similar to the contractile activity evoked by norepinephrin in human strips. Spermatozoa were found in <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> urine of 6 patients. Conclusion In our opinion the treatment with tamsulosin may induce retrograde ejaculation but not other ejaculatory disorder due to abnormal sperm progression. </p...|$|R

Aims: This pilot study was aimed to assess test performances of VIA, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and Pap smear, individually and in simulated combinations, to determine the probable best screening option. Setting and Design: Gynecology outpatient department (OPD); cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: One hundred women with complaints of irregular vaginal bleeding or discharge, <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> bleeding or unhealthy cervix on examination underwent Pap smear, HPV testing, VIA, colposcopy and biopsy, if indicated, in this screening order. Statistical Analysis: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated {{for each of the}} tests with a biopsy result of &# 8805;HSIL taken as the gold standard.

40|$|Screening for Chlamydia trachomatis infections {{is aimed}} at the {{reduction}} of these infections and subsequent complications. Selective screening may increase the cost effectiveness of a screening programme. Few population based systematic screening programmes {{have been carried out}} and attempts to validate selective screening criteria have shown poor performance. This study describes the development of a prediction rule for estimating the risk of chlamydial infection as a basis for selective screening. A population based chlamydia screening study was performed in the Netherlands by inviting 21, 000 15 - 29 year old women and men in urban and rural areas for home based urine testing. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for chlamydial infection among 6303 sexually active participants, and the discriminative ability was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Internal validity was assessed with bootstrap resampling techniques. The prevalence of C trachomatis (CT) infection was 2. 6 % (95 % CI 2. 2 to 3. 2) in women and 2. 0 % (95 % CI 1. 4 to 2. 7) in men. Chlamydial infection was associated with high level of urbanisation, young age, Surinam/Antillian ethnicity, low/intermediate education, multiple lifetime partners, a new contact in the previous two months, no condom use at last sexual contact, and complaints of (<b>post)</b> <b>coital</b> bleeding in women and frequent urination in men.

No high grade cytology abnormalities were detected. No positive syphilis or new HIV positive results were identified; five women were found to be hepatitis B surface antibody positive. Contraception was changed in 60. 8 %. Most frequently supplied was the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). At the first FPC attendance six women required <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> contraception (PCC) and five were already pregnant, three suspected it, two were unaware. During the year three women conceived; two used COCP, but were non compliant; one used a diaphragm with unclear compliance. Seven of the eight pregnancies were terminated. Over the following year, 1992 - 93, contraception was supplied to 42 women; four required PCC; two intentional pregnancies occurred. Only one of the TOP women returned. CONCLUSION [...] An integrated FPC provides co-ordinated sexual health care. Pregnancy, TOP and FPC re-attendance rates together with improvement strategies are discussed. Avoiding unwanted pregnancy remains a universal challenge...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} the third most common cancer in women, and fourth {{cause of cancer death}} in females worldwide. More than 85 % of the global burden occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. In Tanzania 35. 3 % of cancer {{patients}} attending Ocean Road Cancer Institute have cervical cancer. HIV constitutes about 21 % among cervical cancer patients at ORCI in 2007. Objective: To determine factors associated with cervical cancer among women attending referral hospitals in Dar es Salaam. Methods: This was a hospital based unmatched case control study with a case to control ratio of 1 : 1. A case was a woman attending Ocean Road Cancer Institute (ORCI) with a confirmed cervical cancer diagnosis in less than 6 months from the day of recruitment. A control was woman attending the Gynaecology clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital with non-cancer related diagnosis. A standardised structured questionnaire was used; data analysis was performed in Epi Info and STATA. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs). Results: A total of 165 cases and 165 controls were included in the study. The mean age ± standard deviation was 51 ± 12 years and 33 ± 11 years among cases and controls respectively. 98 (59. 4 %) of cases were peasants while 91 (60. 7 %) of the controls were employed. The HIV prevalence was 42 (28. 3 %) among cases. Significant risk factors for cervical cancer in our study included lowest wealth quintile (AOR = 6. 29; 95 % CI: 2. 12 – 18. 13), peasant (AOR = 6. 20; 95 % CI: 1. 58 – 25. 00), occasional <b>post</b> <b>coital</b> genital wash (AOR= 2. 8, 95 % CI= 1. 01 – 7. 72) and oral contraceptive use (AOR= 2. 29; 95 % CI= 1. 09 – 5. 23). Conclusion: HIV prevalence among cases was quite high. These data provide further evidence that low socio-economic status, oral contraceptive use and poor genital hygiene conditions were the main risk factors for cervical cancer. Recommendations: Scaling up of cervical cancer prevention and control interventions should address socio-economic, behavioural and HIV infection among the risk population...|$|R
