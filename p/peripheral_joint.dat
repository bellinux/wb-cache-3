40|$|Objective: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has been widely}} used {{for the evaluation of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with only a minority of studies considering other types of arthritis. This review is concerned with an evaluation of the MRI appearance of <b>peripheral</b> <b>joints</b> in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: A Medline search was performed to identify all publications from the years 1985 to 2006 concerning MRI of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>joints</b> and PsA. Additional papers were retrieved by scanning the references to the Medline-listed articles. Articles written in English, French, German, and Italian were included. Results: Most papers studied the hand and wrist, and only few of them were concerned with the knee, foot, temporomandibular joint, and elbow. Patients with PsA showed often, but not always, a pattern of joint inflammation which extended beyond the capsule into the extraarticular tissue. Bone oedema and erosions were less frequent than in RA. In particular, bone oedema at the entheseal junction was seen, especially in the knee. The degree of synovitis, assessed by dynamic MRI, was similar in PsA and RA. Discussion: Data on MRI of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>joints</b> in PsA are scanty. Only few studies were specifically designed to evaluate the pattern of arthritis in PsA, with most information deriving from papers where different types of arthritis were considered together. An enthesis-related origin of PsA has been proposed in contrast to the primarily synovial inflammation of RA. This pathogenic interpretation is likely to be true, but does not explain all cases of PsA, and needs to be confirmed by further studies...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{review article}} {{addresses}} {{the best evidence}} currently available for the effectiveness of injection therapy for musculoskeletal conditions involving the <b>peripheral</b> <b>joints.</b> The research is presented by anatomical region and areas of controversy {{and the need for}} additional research are identified. DISCUSSION: Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews are lacking that address the effectiveness of therapeutic injections to the sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, ankle and foot joints. No research studies of any kind have been reported for therapeutic injections of the sternoclavicular joint. With the exception of the knee, possibly the hip and patients with inflammatory arthropathies, research does not unequivocally support the use of therapeutic joint injections for most of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>joints,</b> including the shoulder. Additionally, controversy exists in some areas {{as to whether or not}} corticosteroids provide better outcomes compared to local anesthetic injections alone. CONCLUSION: When viscosupplementation injections are compared to corticosteroids in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, the evidence supports the use of viscosupplementation for more prolonged improvement in outcomes, with corticosteroids being good for short-term relief...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Anti-cyclic citrullinated {{peptides}} (anti-CCP) {{are highly}} specific diagnostic and prognostic markers for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They have been {{also found in}} psoriatic arthritis (PsA), with controversies as regards clinical and radiological associations. The current study assessed anti-CCP in PsA and determined its clinical and radiological associations. Methods Four groups contributed to this study. 40 PsA, 40 psoriasis without arthritis, 40 RA and 40 healthy controls. They were tested for anti-CCP. Clinical and radiological data were collected and statistically compared between anti-CCP-positive and -negative PsA patients. Results Seven PsA (17. 5 %) and 34 RA (85 %) were seropositive for anti-CCP. Patients of other groups were anti-CCP-negative. Regarding anti-CCP concentrations, highly significant difference existed between different groups and between anti-CCP-positive and -negative PsA. Significantly higher numbers of involved, swollen and tender joints, deformities and functional impairment of <b>peripheral</b> <b>joints</b> and radiological changes were found in anti-CCP-positive PsA. Conclusion Anti-CCP {{may be found in}} PsA and are associated with higher number of involved, swollen and tender joints, with deformities and functional impairment of <b>peripheral</b> <b>joints</b> and with erosive arthritis. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} a model osteoarthritis consultation, compared with usual care, on physical function and uptake of NICE osteoarthritis recommendations, in adults ≥ 45 years consulting with <b>peripheral</b> <b>joint</b> pain in UK general practice. Method: Two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial with baseline health survey. Eight general practices in England. Participants: 525 adults ≥ 45 years consulting for <b>peripheral</b> <b>joint</b> pain, amongst 28, 443 population survey recipients. Four intervention practices delivered the model osteoarthritis consultation to patients consulting with <b>peripheral</b> <b>joint</b> pain; four control practices continued usual care. The primary clinical outcome of the trial was the SF- 12 physical component score (PCS) at six months; the main secondary outcome was uptake of NICE core recommendations by six months, measured by osteoarthritis quality indicators. A Linear Mixed Model was used to analyse clinical outcome data (SF- 12 PCS). Differences in quality indicator outcomes were assessed using logistic regression. Results: 525 eligible participants were enrolled (mean age 67. 3 years, SD 10. 5; 59. 6 % female) : 288 from intervention and 237 from control practices. There were no statistically significant differences in SF- 12 PCS: mean difference at the 6 -month primary endpoint was - 0. 37 (95 % CI - 2. 32, 1. 57). Uptake of core NICE recommendations by six months was statistically significantly higher in the intervention arm compared with control: e. g. increased written exercise information, 20. 5 % (7. 9, 28. 3).
