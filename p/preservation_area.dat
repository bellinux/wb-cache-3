5|$|Roland {{was born}} on 26 January 1899 and {{initially}} followed {{a career in the}} army. He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated <b>preservation</b> <b>area,</b> causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the company may have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.|$|E

The cartographic delimitation of these areas provides for better environmental decision-making, helping to resolve existing conflicts by detecting priority areas for the implementation of projects designed to rehabilitate degraded areas. As such, the aim {{of this paper is to}} generate a Permanent <b>Preservation</b> <b>Areas</b> map within the Petropolis Environmental Protection Area.

In this context, legal mechanisms were created with the objective of assigning sustainability to the process of human activities expansion. One such mechanism includes the Permanent <b>Preservation</b> <b>Areas.</b> However, as the anthropic land occupation precedes this mechanism, the scenarios of illegality and spatial conflicts are already established.
