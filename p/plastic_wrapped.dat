5000|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>wrap,</b> {{cling film}} (UK), cling wrap, food wrap, or {{pliofilm}} {{is a thin}} plastic film typically used for sealing food items in containers to keep them fresh {{over a longer period}} of time. <b>Plastic</b> <b>wrap,</b> typically sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge, clings to many smooth surfaces and can thus remain tight over the opening of a container without adhesive. Common <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap</b> is roughly 0.5 Thousandth of an inch (12.5 μm) thick. The trend has been to produce thinner <b>plastic</b> <b>wrap,</b> particularly for household use (where very little stretch is needed), so now the majority of brands on shelves around the world are 8, 9 or 10 μm thick.|$|R

40|$|Proper {{implementation}} of {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) {{has the potential to}} revolutionize supply chain management. This technology provides simultaneous indirect scanning of multiple packages and palletized loads equipped with a RFID tag, transmitting substantially more information than a bar code. Also, stored information on the tag can be updated according to inventory status, thus, eliminating key limitations of barcode technology. This study was designed to address some of the currently known shortcomings of the RFID technology. One of the commonly occurring drawbacks is transmitted signal from RFID antennae is reflected from metal objects or absorbed by water contained in a product. These limitation of effective reads can be easily shown using EPC Hotspot, which is capable of creating a profile map for product cases based on the correct reads of RFID tags. This study included three types of packaged products that were palletized. These were filled beverage in metal cans, filled water in plastic bottles and <b>plastic</b> <b>wrapped</b> paper towels. The objective {{of the study was to}} assess overall tag readability of three newly developed Gen 2 RFID tags as a function of tag location and orientation, product composition, case location on a pallet load and speed of material handling equipment. The results indicated that overall readability was highest for 2 ̆ 7 paper towels 2 ̆ 7 followed by 2 ̆ 7 water filled bottles 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 soda filled cans 2 ̆ 7 across all RFID tags.

40|$|An air filled {{ionization}} chamber has been constructed with {{a volume of}} 552 liters and a wall consisting of 12. 7 mg/cm 2 of <b>plastic</b> <b>wrapped</b> over a rigid, lightweight aluminum frame. A calibration in absolute units, independent of previous Caltech ion chamber calibrations, was applied to a sealed Neher electrometer for use in this chamber. The new chamber was flown along with an older, argon filled, balloon type chamber in a C- 135 aircraft from 1, 000 to 40, 000 feet altitude, and other measurements of sea level cosmic ray ionization were made, resulting {{in the value of}} 2. 60 ±. 03 ion pairs/cm 3 sec atm) at sea level. The calibrations of the two instruments were found to agree within 1 percent, and the airplane data were consistent with previous balloon measurements in the upper atmosphere. Ionization due to radon gas in the atmosphere was investigated. Absolute ionization data in the lower atmosphere have been compared with results of other observers, and discrepancies have been discussed. Data from a polar orbiting ion chamber on the OGO-II, IV spacecraft have been analyzed. The problem of radioactivity produced on the spacecraft during passes through high fluxes of trapped protons has been investigated, and some corrections determined. Quiet time ionization averages over the polar regions have been plotted as function of altitude, and an analytical fit is made to the data that gives a value of 10. 4 ± 2. 3 percent for the fractional part of the ionization {{at the top of the}} atmosphere due to splash albedo particles, although this result is shown to depend on an assumed angular distribution for the albedo particles. Comparisons with other albedo measurements are made. The data are shown to be consistent with balloon and interplanetary ionization measurements. The position of the cosmic ray knee is found to exhibit an altitude dependence, a North-South effect, and a small local time variation. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we focus on}} two {{specific}} transportation systems, namely postal automation and baggage handling. Postal automation: During the last decades the volume of magazines, catalogs, and other <b>plastic</b> <b>wrapped</b> mail items {{that have to be}} processed by post sorting centers has increased considerably. In {{order to be able to}} handle the large volumes of mail, state-of-the-art post sorting centers are equipped with dedicated mail sorting machines. The throughput of a post sorting machine is defined as the number of sorted mail items divided by the time needed to sort them. In this thesis we consider large letters of A 4 size envelopes. Such mail items are called flats. Briefly, a state-of-the-art automated flats sorting machine operates as follows: the flats are inserted into transport boxes by feeding devices; the boxes carry the pieces with constant speed and sort them into static destination bins according to the selected sorting scheme. The throughput of a basic system sketched above can be augmented by designing a system where the bottom part consisting of destination bins can move bidirectional with piecewise constant speed. The model of the flats sorting system is event-based, determined using simulation. In order to compute the speed of the bottom system that maximizes the throughput of this machine, we implement and compare different variants of optimal control with gradually decreasing complexity namely: optimal control with a piecewise constant speed on time intervals of variable length, optimal control with a piecewise constant speed on time intervals of constant length, optimal control with a constant speed, and model-based predictive control with a piecewise constant speed on time intervals of constant length. The considered control methods are compared for several scenarios. In this thesis we also discuss the influence of the structural changes on the throughput. In particular, we consider structural changes such as increasing the number of feeding devices and changing their inserting point around the transport boxes, and increasing the velocity of the transport boxes. Baggage handling: The continuous need for reduction of costs in the air transport industry and the rise of low-cost carriers require a cost effective operation of the airports. Modern baggage handling systems transport luggage in an automated way using destination coded vehicles (DCVs). These vehicles transport the bags at high speeds on a railway of tracks. The DCV-based baggage handling operates as follows: given a dynamic demand of bags and a buffer of empty DCVs for each loading station, together with the network of single-direction tracks, the route of each DCV has to be computed subject to operational and safety constraints such that each of the bags to be handled arrives at its given end point within a specific time window. Currently, the networks have simple structure, the DCVs being routed through the system using routing schemes based on preferred routes. These routing schemes can be adapted to respond on the occurrence of predefined events. However, the load patterns of the system are highly variable, depending on e. g. the season, time of the day, type of aircraft at each gate, or the number of passengers for each flight. Therefore, we do not consider predefined preferred routes, but instead we develop and compare efficient control methods to determine the optimal routing in case of dynamic demand. In particular, we consider predictive and heuristic approaches implemented in a centralized, decentralized, and distributed manner. Furthermore, in order to efficiently determine the route choice of each DCV we also propose a hierarchical control framework that consists of a two-level control structure with local switch controllers at the lowest level and one higher supervisory controller. In this control framework, switch controllers provide position instructions for each switch in the network. The collection of switch controllers is then supervised by a so-called network controller that mainly takes care of the flow instructions for the switch controllers. Computing the optimal route choice yields a nonlinear, nonconvex, mixed integer optimization problem. The computational efforts required to determine the optimal route choice are high, and therefore, solving this optimization problem becomes intractable in practice. Consequently, we also present an alternative approach for reducing the complexity of the computations by writing the nonlinear optimization problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The advantage is that for MILP optimization problems solvers are available that allow us to efficiently compute the global optimal solution. The solution of the MILP problem can then be used directly or as an initial starting point for the original optimization problem. To assess the performance of the proposed control approaches and control frameworks, we consider a benchmark case study, in which the methods are compared for several scenarios.
