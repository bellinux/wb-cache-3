5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (often 34.5 kV), <b>power</b> <b>collection</b> system and communications network.

25|$|With {{contemporary}} space industry's {{economic activity}} and the related private spaceflight, with the manufacturing industries, that go into Earth's orbit or beyond, delivering them to those regions will require further energy development. Researchers have contemplated space-based solar power for collecting solar power for use on Earth. Space-based solar power has been in research since the early 1970s. Space-based solar power would require construction of collector structures in space. The advantage over ground-based solar power is higher intensity of light, and no weather to interrupt <b>power</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{had been}} speculated {{throughout}} the toy collecting community that Swamp Thing {{would have been}} included in the unproduced fourth series of Kenner's Super <b>Powers</b> <b>Collection</b> and that Bio-Glow Swamp Thing may have been based on the prototype. This is due to the figure's swinging arm feature similar to that seen in the Super <b>Powers</b> <b>Collection.</b> However, such rumors have since been refuted by the uncovering of new information regarding the proposed fourth and fifth series of the Super <b>Powers</b> <b>Collection.</b>|$|R

25|$|In general, a {{distance}} of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm, but micrositing optimizes placement, particularly in hilly areas. Individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (usually 34.5 kV) <b>power</b> <b>collection</b> system and communications network. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage transmission system. Construction of a land-based wind farm requires installation of the collector system and substation, and possibly access roads to each turbine site.|$|E
25|$|When new, {{the units}} were {{initially}} numbered {{in the range}} 001-091, but were later renumbered to 303 001-091 when TOPS was introduced. Each unit consisted of 3-cars coupled together in a semi-permanent formation, and up to four sets could be operated in multiple to form up to a 12-car formation. Although 6-car formations were frequently operated, 9-car formations were operated occasionally. 12-car formations were usually only seen {{as a result of}} train failures or ECS workings to the depots at Shields Road or Hyndland. The two outer carriages of each unit were driving trailers, with an intermediate motor coach containing the motor bogies and electrical equipment. Units operated from the standard 25 kV alternating current (AC) overhead power lines system, with <b>power</b> <b>collection</b> via a Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph on the motor coach. The technical description of the formation is DTSO+MBSO+BDTSO. Individual vehicle numbers are shown below.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Vought {{was awarded}} a $7 million {{contract}} by the Urban Mass Transit Administration to study modifications needed to produce a version of Airtrans suitable for mass transit applications. Changes were aimed primarily at increasing the speed from 17 to 30mph, along with changes to reduce capital costs of implementing systems. Vought used one of the production cargo vehicles as an instrumented testbed, running it on the existing DFW guideways at increased speeds, and used the information collected to determine what changes {{would need to be}} made to provide this performance in an operational setting. Several changes were needed; the <b>power</b> <b>collection</b> arms that pressed against the wires on the track side had to be modified to a design originally considered for the DFW system, the steering had to be upgraded in order to switch quickly enough, and to improve energy use, the new vehicles also featured regenerative braking. A non-mechanical steering system reading a ferrous stripe {{in the center of the}} guideway was also tried, but abandoned as not necessary for speeds up to 30mph.|$|E

25|$|The Eurostar Class 373 trains, which {{run through}} the Channel Tunnel between the UK and both France and Belgium, are {{substantially}} {{different versions of the}} TGV trains, with support for four voltages, of them two present in the UK, both pantograph and third-rail <b>power</b> <b>collection</b> (although the third-rail shoe-gear has now been removed following the opening of High-Speed 1), the ability to adapt to multiple platform heights, and to cope with no fewer than seven different signalling modes. Like the TGVs, Eurostar trains are articulated with bogies between the carriages, and most units have 18 passenger carriages and two power cars (the end passenger carriages also have their outer bogies powered). New Class 374 trains were introduced in November 2015, and are able to carry passengers to destinations beyond the core routes to Paris and Brussels. A Class 374 train has 900 seats, roughly equivalent to six Airbus A320s or Boeing 737s (the aircraft typically used by low-cost airlines). These trains operate at the highest scheduled speeds of any in the UK, using a high-speed line between the Channel Tunnel and St Pancras station in London (High Speed 1) which was fully opened in November 2007.|$|E
