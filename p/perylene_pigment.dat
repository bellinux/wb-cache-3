40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} study of optical and {{photovoltaic}} properties of iso-type and aniso-type heterostructures based on photosensitive layers of organic semiconductors. The primary {{attention has been}} paid on determination of optimal conditions for preparation of organic thin-film structures of methyl substituted <b>perylene</b> <b>pigment,</b> hexathiopentacene and SnCl 2 phthalocyanine. These structures are perspective for fabrication of photosensitive heterostructures and can be used for development of effective photoconverters of solar energy. The influence of annealing and substrate temperature during thermal deposition of the films on morphology and surface structure, optical and photovoltaic properties of thin films of methyl substituted <b>perylene</b> <b>pigment,</b> hexathiopentacene and SnCl 2 phthalocyanine was studied. The surface and bulk parameters of considered films were determined from the results obtained here. The photovoltaic and optical properties of organic iso-type and aniso-type heterostructures prepared on the substrates with different temperatures were studied. The obtained data for heterostructures were analyzed using Anderson model and Van Opdorp model, respectively. This analysis showed that organic aniso-type heterostructures based on methyl substituted <b>perylene</b> <b>pigment</b> and iso-type heterostructures based on pentacene can be described by the models proposed and developed for inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions. The optimal conditions were determined for preparation of organic photosensitive heterostructures, which absorb most part of solar radiation in visible and near infrared range, as well as effectively generate and separate charge carriers on the interface of heterojunction. The aniso-type and iso-type heterostructures prepared under optimal conditions are perspective elements for development of organic photoconverters, including organic solar cells.

40|$|The energy {{conversion}} efficiency of a two-layer organic solar cell consisting of a <b>perylene</b> <b>pigment</b> (PV) and regioregular polythiophene polymer (P 3 DT) was 0. 99 % under illumination with simulated solar light (AM 1. 5 – 100 mW cm− 2). The photovoltaic mechanism is discussed {{on the basis of}} the ionization potential of the component materials. The photoinduced hole-transfer from PV to P 3 DT quickly occurred at the PV/P 3 DT interface because of the large free energy change of 1. 2 eV, then the subsequent charge separation efficiently proceeded, resulting in a large short-circuit photocurrent of 6. 5 mA cm− 2. On the other hand, the open-circuit photovoltage was only 0. 42 V because the LUMO level of PV is close to the HOMO level of P 3 DT. The difference between the LUMO and the HOMO can be attributed to the open-circuit photovoltage...|$|E
40|$|We report here {{efficient}} air-stable p-n heterojunction organic {{solar cells}} with a structure consisting of an n-type insoluble <b>perylene</b> <b>pigment</b> penetrated by a p-type-conjugated polymer, where the interfacial area for photocurrent generation increases. The solar cells are easily produced by infiltrating a soluble-conjugated polymer intentionally into an opening among insoluble microcrystalline perylene layer under a saturated chloroform vapor. This {{approach can be}} regarded as an alternative convenient way to achieve bulk heterojunction solar cells. The cell performance is further enhanced by inserting an additional layer between the electrode and the photoactive layer to confine exciton in the photoactive layer. The overall attempt to improve the cell performance, so far, results in maximum quantum efficiency up to 45 % under illumination of 485 -nm monochromatic light and power conversion efficiency up to 1. 9 % under a simulated solar light (AM 1. 5) with a 100 mW cm- 2 intensity. The approach is promising to achieve practical efficiency because tuning the opening size can further widen the photoactive area. © 2004 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Porphyrins and perylene {{biomarkers}} {{have attracted}} considerable attention as important constituents of source rocks and crude oils, in recent years. These biomarkers provide significant information on depositional environments, origin, and maturity of the oils in petroliferous basins. During present studies, both porphyrins and <b>perylene</b> <b>pigments</b> in oils from different structures and sediment samples belonging to Cambay Shale Formation from age Late-Early Eocene of North Cambay basin were analysed and quantified. The {{results indicate that}} distribution and preservation of both petroporphyrins and <b>perylene</b> <b>pigments</b> are mainly controlled by the redox conditions experienced by different sub units of the Cambay Shale Formation. The anoxic events identified by the distribution of these pigments during Early to Late Eocene times can be correlated with the sea level changes, which occurred during this period. The abundance of vanadyl porphyrins and perylene in the Younger Cambay Shale sequences suggests that high anoxic condition with low pH during deposition. On the contrary the enrichment of nickel porphyrins in Older Cambay Shale sediments indicate suboxic conditions with high pH and Eh. Furthermore, the enrichment of etioporphyrin (ETIO) series of nickel porphyrins with vanadyl porphyrins as well as low concentrations of vanadium in the oils of North Cambay basin suggests that these oils are mainly derived from the Older Cambay Shale (OCS) and Olpad Formation deposited under suboxic conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of 76 synthetic organic pigments was analysed using pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The {{purpose of this}} work was to expand the knowledge on synthetic pigments and to assess characteristic pyrolysis products that could help {{in the identification of}} these pigments in paint samples. We analysed several classes of synthetic pigments not previously reported as being analysed by this technique: some metal complexes, β-naphthol pigment lakes, BONA pigment lakes, disazopyrazolone, triarylcarbonium, dioxazine, anthraquinone, indanthrone, isoindoline and thioindigo classes. We also report {{for the first time the}} Py-GC/MS analysis of a number of naphthol AS, benzimidazolone, phthalocyanine and <b>perylene</b> <b>pigments</b> and other miscellaneous pigments including pigments with unpublished chemical structure.

40|$|The {{films of}} {{phthalocyanine}} and perylene derivatives found {{an application for}} so-lar cells [1, 2], light-emitting diodes [2], gas sensors [3]. The improving of such de-vices {{can be reached by}} forming of nanocomposites [4, 5]. The determination of corre-lation between the structure and electrical properties of nanocomposites requires the experimental methods of phase analysis on a nanometer scale. Photoassisted scanning tunneling microscopy (photoSTM) combines the high spa-tial resolution of STM with energy selectivity of optical spectroscopy and can be used in nanoscale phase analysis. However, many difficulties restrain the application of photoSTM technique in this area [6]. The main difficult is the heating due to light ab-sorption. The heating causes thermal expansion of STM tip affecting the tunneling gap width. As we have showed in previous reports [7, 8], the illumination of organic semi-conductors influences on the STM images and local current-voltage characteristics, but remain not clear the contribution of thermal expansion in these effects.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was {{to find out whether}} surface plasmon {{absorption}} in small metal clusters could be of benefit for the photovoltaic efficiency of molecular organic solar cells. Starting point was the hypothesis that plasmon absorption of metal clusters in the electric field of an photovoltaically active contact may lead to a directed charge carrier emission. Silver clusters were prepared by evaporation of silver island films in vacuum followed by tempering. Thereby well separated clusters of nearly spherical geometry were formed which were embedded into photovoltaically active organic dye films made from zinc phthalocyanine and/or a methyl substituted <b>perylene</b> <b>pigment</b> with indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass as a front and gold as a back contact. The samples were investigated by optical and photocurrent spectroscopy as well as by electrical measurements. It was proven in this thesis that silver clusters embedded into the photovoltaically active contact formed at the junction of ITO and zinc phthalocyanine lead to a primary photocurrent exactly following both, the surface plasmon resonance of the silver clusters (in a region with negligible absorption in the dye film) and the direct absorption of the zinc phthalocyanine layer. This experimental result is explained using an energy model in which the cluster plasmon decay leads to the excitation of electrons followed by the directed emission in an electric field.

40|$|The organic {{junction}} of vacuum sublimated thin films of p-type zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and the n-type <b>perylene</b> <b>pigment,</b> N, N'-dimethyl- 3, 4, 9, 10 -perylenbis (carboximid) (MPP) {{was investigated in}} detail. From modeling of experimentally determined photocurrent spectra the active thickness of the junction formed by these two materials is determined to be restricted to the range of about 10 nm. This modeling gives also evidence of a space charge region {{in which all the}} absorbed photons lead to photocurrent whereas the photons absorbed outside do not contribute. A careful investigation of the electroabsorption spectra - determined {{for the first time in}} voltage dependent measurements of organic p/n-hetero junction solar cells - shows clear evidence of an electric field within the organic solar cell. Furthermore the luminescence quenching observed when the cell is polarized in depletion fully confirms the expected voltage dependence of a space charge model. All three experiments provide clear evidence of a classical p/n-type depletion layer formed at the interface of the two organic layers. In order to achieve a higher internal photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) a mixed layer of ZnPc with C_ 6 _ 0 was evaporated onto the MPP layer. Instead of the classical p/n-{{junction of}} only 10 nm thickness an interconnected network is formed, extending the thickness of the photovoltaically active junction to more than 30 nm. Thereby the IPCE in the absorption maximum of the solar cells was improved from about 12 % to almost 40 % and a short circuit current of 3. 6 mA/cm" 2 was measured in a AM 1. 5 solar simulator for 860 W/m" 2 light intensity.

40|$|A {{collection}} {{of more than}} 70 synthetic organic pigments were analysed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). We report on the analysis of diketo-pyrrolo-pyrrole, isoindolinone and <b>perylene</b> <b>pigments</b> which are classes not previously reported as being analysed by this technique. We also report on a number of azo pigments (2 -naphthol, naphthol AS, arylide, diarylide, benzimidazolone and disazo condensation pigments) and phthalocyanine pigments, the Py-GC-MS analysis of which has not been previously reported. The members of each class were found to fragment in a consistent way and the pyrolysis products are reported. The technique was successfully applied to the analysis of paints used by the artist Francis Bacon (1909 - 1992), to simultaneously identify synthetic organic pigments and synthetic binding media in two samples of paint taken from Bacon's studio and micro-samples taken from three of his paintings and one painting attributed to him...|$|R
40|$|<b>Perylene</b> <b>pigments</b> {{are known}} to exhibit a variety of shades in the solid state from vivid red, via maroon to black, {{although}} their solution spectra are quite similar. A {{second phase of the}} title compound (phase II) has newly been found when the single crystals were grown from the vapor phase. Phase H bears a black color while the previous phase (phase I) exhibits red-maroon. For this reason, the electronic structure of both phases has been investigated {{on the basis of the}} crystal structure as well as intermolecular interactions. In both phases, the absorption spectrum is composed of two bands: one is due to individual molecules (i. e. around 450 - 550 nm) and the second band arises from excitonic interactions between transition dipoles (i. e. around 600 nm in phase I and 625 nm in phase II). The intermolecular interactions along the stacking axis are primarily responsible for the appearance of the second band in both phases. Additionally, the interaction on the molecular plane is found to be slightly hypsochromic in phase I while bathochromic in phase II. This induces a difference in absorption maximum of the second band, leading to two different colors (red-maroon and black) in phases I and II. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one core {{samples from}} DSDP/IPOD Leg 63 were {{analyzed}} for products of chlorophyll diagenesis. In {{addition to the}} tetrapyrrole <b>pigments,</b> <b>perylene</b> and carotenoid <b>pigments</b> were isolated and identified. The 16 core samples from the San Miguel Gap site (467) and the five from the Baja California borderland location (471) afforded the unique opportunity of examining tetrapyrrole diagenesis in clay-rich marine sediments that are very high in total organic matter. The chelation reaction, whereby free-base porphyrins give rise to metalloporphyrins (viz., nickel), is well documented within the downhole sequence of sediments from the San Miguel Gap (Site 467). Recognition of unique arrays of highly dealkylated copper and nickel ETIO-porphyrins, exhibiting nearly identical carbonnumber homologies (viz., C- 23 to C- 30; mode = C- 26), enabled subtraction of this component (thought {{to be derived from}} an allochthonous source) and thus permitted description of the actual in situ diagenesis of autochthonous chlorophyll derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Interior {{temperature}} of automobiles and buildings may reach an uncomfortable level during hot weather, which requires {{the use of}} air-conditioners. The solar heating of automobiles and buildings can be partly reduced if the incident solar radiations can be reflected back to the atmosphere. One way to achieve this is to replace the traditional pigments used in surface coatings by NIR (near infrared) -reflective pigments as they keep the surface cool by rejecting significant amounts of NIR-radiations of the solar spectrum. There are many commercially available NIR-reflecting pigments to date but most of them are inorganic, heavy metals based and are not environment friendly. Among the organic pigments, the use of <b>perylene</b> <b>pigments</b> in the NIR-reflective coatings has been described in few patents. However there is no systematic study in the open literature regarding the influence of different factors such as particle size, pigment concentration, electronic influence of different substituents and degree of crystallinity on their NIR-reflectance. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop understanding of the effect of these factors on the NIR-reflectance of <b>perylene</b> based <b>pigments</b> which would help to develop <b>perylene</b> based <b>pigments</b> with significant reflectance in the NIR-region. Therefore five different perylene derivatives P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4 and P 5 were synthesized and their NIR-reflectance was measured and compared with each other as well as with some commercially available pigments such as carbon black, lumogen and titanium dioxide after their dispersion in polypropylene. The relative reflectance of different diimide derivatives (P 1 -P 4) varied from 38 to 65 at 980 nm wavelength and from 37 to 54 at 1300 nm wavelength; P 1 has shown the highest NIR-reflectance among these derivatives. On the other hand derivative P 5 has shown the least reflectance in the NIR-region. The reflectance of synthesized black coloured derivative P 1 is comparable to that of Lumogen® (LG) at 1300 nm, whereas reflectance of LG drops radically in the wavelength region of 700 - 1000 nm. The particle size and particle size distribution do not seem to be the only contributing factor for this observed difference as all the perylene diimides derivatives (P 1 -P 4) have similar particle size and particle size distribution, yet they show significant variation in their NIR-reflectance. Similarly PTCA and P 5 have similar particle size range but exhibit dramatic difference in their NIR-reflectance. Computational study performed on these derivatives has shown that two of the derivatives P 2 and P 5 have a considerable amount of net dipole moments and low reflectance compared to that of P 1, P 4 and PTCA which have zero net dipole moment and higher NIR-reflectance. This demonstrates the direct impact of the development of net dipole moment in reducing the NIR-reflectance. The results of degree of crystallinity for these derivatives indicate the following order of increasing crystallinity: PTCA&gt;P 3 &gt;P 2 &gt;P 1 &gt;P 4 &gt;P 5 A combination of the effect of three factors i. e. particle size, dipole moment and degree of crystallinity, means that PTCA having smallest particle size, zero dipole moment and high degree of crystallinity has the highest ability to reject NIR-radiations...|$|R

40|$|Near-infrared (NIR) {{reflecting}} pigments {{offer the}} potential to incorporate thermal insulating qualities into paint coatings. Experimental reflectance measurements are presented {{of a series of}} <b>perylene</b> based <b>pigments,</b> revealing significant variations in the NIR region as a function of derivatisation and substitution. Theoretical methods are applied to account for the observed trends. Derivatisation of perylene leads to an extension of the π-aromatic system, resulting in a bathochromic shift of UV/Vis absorption maxima towards the NIR region. However, this is insufficient to account for the observed variations in NIR reflectance. In comparison, overtones and combination modes of fundamental IR vibrations appear to be more important in explaining the observed variations in NIR reflectance/absorbance. Aromatic groups lead to a small number of intense NIR bands, while alkyl groups generally lead to a greater number of less intense NIR bands. However, neighbouring group effects and/or a molecular dipole moment can substantially alter the intensity of these bands...|$|R
