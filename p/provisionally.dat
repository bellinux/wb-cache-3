5|$|Apatosaurus grandis {{was named}} in 1877 by Marsh {{in the article}} that {{described}} A.ajax. It was briefly described, figured, and diagnosed. Marsh later mentioned it was only <b>provisionally</b> assigned to Apatosaurus when he reassigned it to his new genus Morosaurus in 1878. Since Morosaurus has been considered a synonym of Camarasaurus, C.grandis is the oldest-named species of the latter genus.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin also edited a {{collection}} of his journalism, which was published as What Am I Doing Here (1989). At {{the time of his}} death in 1989, he was working on a number of new ideas for future novels, including a transcontinental epic <b>provisionally</b> titled Lydia Livingstone.|$|E

5|$|The legal {{standing}} of the FARDC was {{laid down in}} the Transitional Constitution, articles 118 and 188. This was then superseded by provisions in the 2006 Constitution, articles 187 to 192. Law 04/023 of November 12, 2004 establishes the General Organisation of Defence and the Armed Forces. In mid-2010, the Congolese Parliament was debating a new defence law, <b>provisionally</b> designated Organic Law 130.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first officially {{described}} and named in a 2010 Mycologia article, although Tuber oregonense {{had been previously}} used <b>provisionally</b> (as Tuber oregonense Trappe & Bonito) in American field guides and other popular publications for several years. The type specimen was collected from Benton County, Oregon on 3February, 2007 along U.S. Route 20 in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} attribution to Droeshout {{the younger}} {{can also be}} supported on stylistic grounds. A drawing known to be by Droeshout the elder appears to show superior artistic skill than {{the work of his}} nephew, and the clumsy features of the depiction of Shakespeare's body resemble other prints by Droeshout the Younger. The attribution to the younger artist is <b>provisionally</b> accepted by the National Portrait Gallery.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Citizen Kane, that mysterious, dark, and {{infinitely}} deep world {{of space and}} memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct <b>provisionally</b> the sense of our lives.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>provisionally</b> an {{entrance}} inside the 3 Hudson Boulevard building, {{near where the}} secondary station building will be.

5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and <b>provisionally</b> named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though {{it was unclear whether}} it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{has been}} criticised for alleged {{corruption}} and has twice {{been the subject}} of undercover investigations. In September 2006, he and his son, Craig, were implicated in a BBC Panorama documentary for taking bribes, allegations which they denied. In September 2016, undercover Daily Telegraph reporters posing as businessmen recorded him offering to help them to get around FA third party ownership rules and <b>provisionally</b> agreeing a £400,000 contract. Following the Daily Telegraph investigation, Allardyce resigned as England manager in a mutual agreement with the Football Association on 27 September.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>provisionally</b> {{assigned}} the designation U-7, the submarine was commissioned as SM U-12 on 21 August 1914, with Linienschiffsleutnant Egon Lerch in command. U-12s activities over {{the early part}} of the war are not reported, but the boat's armament was augmented by a 3.7cm/23 (1.5in) quick-firing (QF) deck gun in November 1914. Sister boat U-5 had her first radio receiver installed at the same time her deck gun was added, but it is not reported whether U-12 did as well.|$|E
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been <b>provisionally</b> named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian School of Law {{was granted}} full {{accreditation}} by the American Bar Association on June 12, 2006.

Prior to February 2001, graduates of the school were allowed to sit for the bar examination in Virginia and West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Collector Heinrich Fischer had {{originally}} labeled a partial foot, from the Solnhofen area, {{as belonging to}} Compsognathus longipes. Though this identification was rejected by Wilhelm Barnim Dames in 1884, Friedrich von Huene nevertheless in 1925 <b>provisionally</b> referred the specimen to Compsognathus. However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. Jens Zinke in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the Kimmeridgian Guimarota formation of Portugal to the genus. These were not identical to those of C. longipes, having serrations on the front edge, but were because of general similarities in form referred to a Compsognathus sp.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not taking}} part in this edition of the Giro, Tondó {{had participated in the}} 2010 edition and was a popular, well-liked rider. Race leader and {{eventual}} winner Alberto Contador, along with many others, rode the stage 16 individual time trial with black armbands. The stage was preceded by a minute of silence. Tondó's teammate Branislau Samoilau posted a time that was <b>provisionally</b> best much of the day and was visibly overcome with emotion when interviewed by assembled media after his ride. Contador, who won the time trial, dedicated the victory to Tondó, as the two were acquainted despite never having been teammates.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 Bamber's defence team, which {{included}} Giovanni di Stefano, applied unsuccessfully {{to have the}} CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal. His lawyers made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009. The CCRC <b>provisionally</b> rejected Bamber's 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document. It invited his lawyers to respond within three months, extended the deadline {{to allow them to}} study all 406 crime-scene photographs, and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional line of inquiry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} years after SS-3s March 1911 launch, Whitehead's {{attempted}} to sell the boat to the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet. Although <b>provisionally</b> commissioned as U-7, she was commissioned as U-12 in August 1914.|$|E

Nuclear Strike 64 was developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light and published by THQ. Another sequel <b>provisionally</b> titled Future Strike was later planned, but the game was eventually released as , a mech-based shooter game.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 1990, the Division Support Command {{deployed}} to the Middle East {{in support of}} Operation Desert Shield. In January 1991, Division Support Command provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division throughout Operation Desert Storm, leading to a quick liberation of Kuwait. On 16 December 1991, the 215th Forward Support Battalion was activated at Fort Hood bringing the number of active duty forward support battalions to three.

5|$|Pattle was <b>provisionally</b> {{credited}} with 50 air victories (and two shared), seven (and one shared) probable victories, and four (and two shared) damaged. It {{is likely that}} his total was at least 40 enemy aircraft destroyed a figure which biographer Edgar Baker has compiled through a list of semi-official records and log-books. Baker asserts that the true figure could be higher, owing to the inability of post-war researchers to identify an exact figure, due to the loss or destruction of British records in the retreat from Greece or during the subsequent occupation.|$|E
5|$|The OSO and OAO {{missions}} {{demonstrated the}} important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a mirror 3m in diameter, known <b>provisionally</b> as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.|$|E
5|$|The Public Information Office (PIO) also {{operates}} an Explorers Post, Prince George's County Sheriff's Office Explorer Post #1696 for Prince George's County youths {{between the}} ages of 15 (or 14, <b>provisionally)</b> and 20. The sheriff and his command staff operate out of the Sheriff's Office complex located in Upper Marlboro. Most of the civilian support personnel also work out of this facility providing administrative duties such as NCIC monitoring, teletype (TTY), uniform and supply, criminal warrant research and organization, as well as other administrative duties as directed.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{inactive}} for a {{year while}} it was reconstructed in Hawaii. As {{a part of the}} transformation of the US Army, the brigade was reorganized into a modular force with new and updated equipment and new personnel. The Brigade stood up <b>provisionally</b> on 27 June 2008 as it neared ready status. On 23 October, the brigade's colors were formally uncased at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. This signified the end of the brigade's relocation to Hawaii as well as its completion and readiness to take on new missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the French Army at Điện Biên Phủ in 1954, {{followed}} by the Geneva Accords, led to a divided Vietnam. The French-backed State of Vietnam, led by former Emperor Bảo Đại, <b>provisionally</b> held control south of the 17th parallel. Hồ Chí Minh's Viet Minh held the north under the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which Hồ Chí Minh had proclaimed in 1945. The agreements stated that nationwide elections were {{to be held in}} 1956 to unify the country under a common government. In July 1954, during the transition period, Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish {{locality}} {{from the latest}} Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also. The specimen has been <b>provisionally</b> identified as Ampelosaurus sp.; it is most likely a mature titanosaurian since {{the bones of the}} braincase have largely fused together.|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg). The Council would also have to hold sessions in Luxembourg during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became <b>provisionally</b> located in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|After the Republic was proclaimed, the {{national}} flag was <b>provisionally</b> adopted as distinguishing {{flag of the}} head of state in place of the royal standard. On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag. Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms; however, under conditions of poor visibility, this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico, which is also that country's national flag. The standard is kept in the custody of the Commander of the Reggimento Corazzieri of the Arma dei Carabinieri, along with the war flag (assigned to Regiment in 1878).|$|E
