50|$|The gin was {{originally}} powered by {{two to four}} mules hitched to horizontal sweeps that turned the vertical <b>power</b> <b>shaft.</b> The <b>power</b> <b>shaft</b> was connected {{to a series of}} cog wheels that ultimately transferred power to the leather belt that drove the gin. In 1875, Mial replaced the mules with a 15-horsepower steam engine, which considerably increased the gin's production capacity. The gin house received a number of other upgrades as ginning technology progressed over the following fifty years. The Walnut Hill cotton gin ceased operation in the mid-1930s, shortly after the death of Millard Mial, Alonzo T. Mial's oldest son.|$|E

5000|$|Bluebird CN7 was {{the first}} land speed record vehicle to be powered by a gas turbine engine.The Bristol-Siddeley Proteus was the Bristol Aeroplane Company's first {{successful}} gas turbine engine design, and delivered [...] plus approximately [...] of exhaust thrust. The Proteus was a two spool, reverse flow turboshaft. Because the turbine stages of the inner spool drove no compressor stages, but only a <b>power</b> <b>shaft,</b> this engine is sometimes classified as a free turbine. The engine, a Proteus 705, was specially modified by Bristol's Stanley Hooker to have a <b>power</b> <b>shaft</b> {{at each end of}} the engine. These shafts are connected directly to final drive assemblies with differentials and fixed ratios of 3.6 to 1 providing power to all four wheels via half-shafts.|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to the piston, the trajectory of the <b>power</b> <b>shaft</b> axis has corner points, which correspond to extreme positions of the piston as related to the working chamber.

40|$|The {{experimental}} X- 29 A forward swept-wing aircraft {{has many}} unique and critical systems that require constant monitoring during ground or flight operation. One such {{system is the}} <b>power</b> takeoff <b>shaft,</b> which is the mechanical link between the engine and the aircraft-mounted accessory drive. The X- 29 A <b>power</b> takeoff <b>shaft</b> opertes in a range between 0 and 16, 810 rpm, is longer than most jet engine <b>power</b> takeoff <b>shafts,</b> and is made of graphite epoxy material. Since the X- 29 A aircraft operates on a single engine, failure of the shaft during flight could lead to loss of the aircraft. The monitoring techniques and test methods used during <b>power</b> takeoff <b>shaft</b> ground and flight operations are discussed. Test data are presented in two case studies where monitoring and testing of the shaft dynamics proved instrumental in discovering and isolating X- 29 A <b>power</b> takeoff <b>shaft</b> problems. The first study concerns the installation of an unbalanced shaft. The effect of the unbalance on the shaft vibration data and the procedure used to correct the problem are discussed. The second study deals with the shaft exceeding the established vibration limits during flight. This case {{study found that the}} vibration of connected rotating machinery unbalances contributed to the excessive vibration level of the shaft.

50|$|The gin {{house is}} a -story-tall, hand-hewn timber frame structure, {{approximately}} 36 ft wide and 56 ft deep. The frontmost two-thirds of the structure is supported by tall, 2 ft thick granite ashlar pillars that form a square, open-air space {{on the ground floor}} in which the mule track and <b>power</b> <b>shaft</b> were located. The rear third of the gin house rests on short, granite rubble piers, and housed the ground-floor pressing and packaging rooms.

50|$|The main <b>power</b> <b>shaft</b> {{entered the}} mill {{on the first}} floor through the south wall of bay 15. There was a bevel gear and a {{vertical}} shaft passed through the floors to each storey. Here it was transmitted by a main shaft across the mill. The three longitudinal line-shaft runs took power from the main shaft. (six on the first three floors), they were slung by hangers on the jack-beams. Later this system was modified with the main shafts on the three upper floors being driven by belts. All of this was later removed and additional features obscure the original locations.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{there are}} many {{differences}} between the two. The Wankel engine working chamber is mobile while the RKM chamber is stationary.

50|$|The initial design {{featured}} a unique engine installation {{with a central}} engine room housing all four engines. The engines were to be geared in pairs and power taken from the engines to the four propellers by <b>power</b> <b>shafts.</b> This design was abandoned early in development, and both the completed Braemars had a conventional engine installation, with the engines in inline tandem pairs, driving pusher and tractor propellers. However, the engine-room design was resurrected later in the Braemar's development life, for the proposed steam-powered Tramp.|$|R
50|$|The {{compressor}} had ten axial {{stages of}} mixed steel and aluminum construction. In the original Orenda 8, 9 and 10's this operated at a 5.5:1 compression ratio, compared to about 3.5 for wartime designs. The hub {{consisted of three}} aluminum disks carrying the first nine stages, and a steel disk bolted onto the end carrying the tenth. The central casing held the <b>power</b> <b>shaft</b> and was made from magnesium alloy. Around it were the six flame cans. The turbine was made of solid Inconel blades attached to an austenitic steel hub. The blades were air cooled by bleeding off compressed air from the fifth compressor stage and piping it to the turbine face, the six pipes lying between the flame cans. The exhaust section consisted of welded steel sheeting.|$|E
5000|$|In 1928, Frederick G. Creed {{developed}} a single-turn spring clutch (see above) that was particularly {{well suited to}} the repetitive start-stop action required in teleprinters. [...] In 1942, two employees of Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company {{developed a}}n improved single turn spring clutch. [...] In these clutches, a coil spring is wrapped around the driven shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the trip lever. When tripped, the spring rapidly contracts around the <b>power</b> <b>shaft</b> engaging the clutch. At {{the end of one}} revolution, if the trip lever has been reset, it catches the end of the spring (or a pawl attached to it) and the angular momentum of the driven member releases the tension on the spring. These clutches have long operating lives, many have cycled for tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication.|$|E
50|$|Judah Baker {{built his}} {{windmill}} in 1791 at Grand Cove in North Dennis, Massachusetts to grind corn. The original structure had a cone-shaped roof and two dormers, one dormer {{that was for}} the mast and <b>power</b> <b>shaft,</b> and the other dormer was for the tail pole. The windmill was then sold to Captain Freeman Crowell and moved to East Dennis, Massachusetts. In 1886, the windmill was then moved by Captain Braddock Matthews to South Yarmouth. Seth Baker bought the windmill from Captain Matthews in 1875. Seth operated the windmill {{until his death in}} 1891. Seth’s son Joseph sold the mill in 1893 to William Stone. The mill no longer operated. A storm in 1916 damaged the mill. Charles Henry Davis assumed the guardianship of the mill and he moved it down the street to its present location. A deal was made in 1953 where the Town of Yarmouth took over the responsibility of the windmill.|$|E

In the aforementioned criteria, output <b>power</b> and <b>shaft</b> torque {{are the most important}} criteria which represent the performance and efficiency of the stirling engines. So, determination of output <b>power</b> and <b>shaft</b> torque with low uncertainty and high precision are required.

To build, train and test the model, various accurate experimental data from open literature are employed. The outputs of the model are compared to experimental ones and statistical parameters of the model including correlation coefficient, average absolute relative deviation (AARD) and root mean square error (RMSE) are calculated. According to the results obtained via model, the model can predict output <b>power</b> and <b>shaft</b> torque of Stirling heat engine with reasonable and acceptable accuracy. Finally, the model can help us in designing of Stirling engine with low degree of uncertainty and high precision...|$|R
