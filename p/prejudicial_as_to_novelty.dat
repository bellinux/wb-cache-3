50|$|On August 27, 1954, a {{unanimous}} three-judge {{panel of the}} Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his conviction {{on the grounds that}} the cross-examination about his alleged homosexuality had prejudiced the jury and the venue was improper. Judge Thomas Walter Swan wrote: It is obvious that the cross-examination informed the jury that on several occasions after reenlistment the defendant had been charged with being, or suspected by military authorities or hospital doctors of being, a homosexualist. Neither by court martial nor by a civil court was he ever brought to trial and convicted on any charge of sodomy. Obviously such a charge was utterly irrelevant to the issue whether he had committed treason while a prisoner of war. But these highly inflammatory and prejudicial collateral and irrelevant charges were brought to the jury's attention. Nor was it done by accident or unintentionally.... That the facts so developed were so <b>prejudicial</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> constitute reversible error, if they were improperly admitted, is too plain for debate. They had no relevancy to charges on which he was being tried and were certain to degrade him in the eyes of the jury. Of the government's argument that the questioning was a legitimate way of testing Provoo's veracity, he wrote: No authority has been cited which suggests that homosexuality indicates a propensity to disregard the obligation of an oath. The sole purpose and effect of this examination was to humiliate and degrade the defendant, and increase the probability that he would be convicted, not for the crime charged, but for his general unsavory character. Permitting it was error.The error was plainly prejudicial. Indeed we can conceive of no accusation which could have been more degrading in the eyes of the jury nor more irrelevant to the issue of treason on which he was being tried. The court also ruled that the Army had improperly brought Provoo to New York for discharge only so he could be arrested and charged there, when he should have been discharged, arrested, and tried in Maryland.|$|R
40|$|The Minor in the Civil Procedure JUDr. Jana Sladká Hyklová Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} {{the topic of the}} minor in civil procedure. This topic has not been yet {{properly}} compiled in Czech legal literature although the issues of participation of minors within civil proceedings are still actual and their importance is increasing. The basic legal source covering the chosen topic is Act No. 99 / 1963 Coll., Civil Procedure Code, which had to be amended more than 120 times. Procedural law in family law matters, which form substantial part of the content of this thesis topic, is firmly connected with substantive law. Substantive legislation is nowadays represented by Civil Code and Family Law, which are supposed to be replaced on 1 January 2014 with new code of civil law, Civil Code (Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll.). This is the reason why the thesis pays attention to the existing legislation <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>novelties</b> brought by the new code. Where needed, an analysis of new legislation in terms of proper procedural protection of the rights of minors is provided. New legislation of civil law brings the question of preparation of appropriate procedural code. On spring 2012 the draft of law of non contentious procedure which includes main principles and outline of this brand new procedural regulation was published. Where [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The long-standing {{observation}} that the novelty-seeking personality trait is a predictor of drug use and other reinforcable risky behaviors raises the question <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how <b>novelty</b> and reward processing functionally interact in mesolimbic dopaminergic circuitry and how this interaction is modulated by the novelty-seeking personality trait. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hemodynamic responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and reward (monetary incentive) from the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA),the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and the hippocampus of 29 subjects were correlated with novelty-seeking scores. These correlations were compared with those obtained for scores of reward-dependence. The fMRI data were taken from two experiments in which the interaction of novelty and reward was manipulated as a within-subject variable, and long-term memory for the critical stimuli was assessed after 24 hours. Results: Novelty-seeking {{was positively correlated with}} SN/VTA activation elicited by novel cues that did not predict reward, whereas reward-dependence was related to activations elicited by novel cues that predicted reward. The positive correlation between SN/VTA responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and novelty-seeking scores was accompanied by a negative correlation with reward-related SN/VTA activation and memory enhancement. Conclusions: SN/VTA responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and reward are differentially affected by personality traits of novelty-seeking and reward-dependence. Importantly, novelty-seekers were more responsive to novel cues in the absence of reward and needed less reward to boost their memory for novel cues. These observations strongly suggest that for novelty-seekers, the motivational value of novelty is not necessarily based on actual reward-predicting stimulus properties...|$|R

However, the current volume of research largely centers around administering empathy-inducing scenarios to participants and then assessing levels of <b>prejudicial</b> attitudes <b>as</b> opposed <b>to</b> examining initial levels of empathy. In addition, {{there is a lack of}} research regarding modern prejudicial attitudes towards individuals of Aboriginal descent. The present study examines the predictive value of ethnocultural empathy, age, gender, and social desirability on the levels of those prejudicial attitudes. One hundred and sixty eight undergraduate students from the University of Saskatchewan completed a questionnaire, including the Scale of Ethnocultural Empathy (Wang, Davidson, Yakushko, Savoy, Tan, & Bleier, 2003), the Prejudiced Attitudes Towards Aboriginals Scale (Morrison, 2007), and Form C of the Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Reynolds, 1982). The multiple regression analysis revealed that ethnocultural empathy and age were predictive of modern prejudicial attitudes toward Aboriginals. Participants with higher levels of ethnocultural empathy reported reduced levels of modern prejudicial attitudes. However, contrary to expectation, gender was not a significant predictor variable. Practical applications and limitations of these findings are discussed as well as directions for future research...|$|R

40|$|It {{is argued}} {{in this paper}} that a doctor cannot serve two masters. The work of the prison medical officer is {{examined}} and it is shown that his dual allegiance {{to the state and}} to those individuals who are under his care results in activities which largely favour the former. The World Health Organisation prescribes a system of health ethics which indicates, in qualitative terms, the responsibility of each state for health provisions. In contrast, the World Medical Association acts as both promulgator and guardian of a code of medical ethics which determines the responsibilities of the doctor to his patient. In the historical sense medical practitioners have always emphasized the sanctity of the relationship with their patients and the doctor's role as an expert witness is shown to have centered around this bond. The development of medical services in prisons has focused more on the partnership between doctor and institution. Imprisonment in itself could be seen <b>as</b> <b>prejudicial</b> <b>to</b> health <b>as</b> are disciplinary methods which are more obviously detrimental. The involvement of medical practitioners in such procedures is discussed in the light of their role as the prisoner's personal physician...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of memory}} in {{behavioral}} distraction by auditory attentional capture was investigated: We examined whether capture {{is a product}} of the novelty of the capturing event (i. e., the absence of a recent memory for the event) or its violation of learned expectancies on the basis of a memory for an event structure. Attentional capture-indicated by disruption of a focal visually presented serial recall task-was found when the voice conveying a concurrent irrelevant auditory sequence changed every 5 recall trials (from male to female or vice versa). There was no evidence of attentional capture when the irrelevant sequence was first encountered and hence novel; capture occurred only when an expectation for a particular voice had been learned and then violated. Furthermore, with the increasing predictability of (and hence expectancy for) the voice changes across the experimental session, the capture response diminished only to be reinstated when that session-wide expectation was itself violated by a break in the change-every- 5 -trials pattern. The results highlight the critical role of learned expectations, <b>as</b> opposed <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> detection, in behavioral auditory attentional capture.

40|$|Abstract Background Gender and {{enhanced}} novelty reactivity can predispose certain individuals to drug abuse. Previous research in {{male and female}} rats selectively bred for high or low locomotor reactivity <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> found that bred High Responders (bHRs) acquire cocaine self-administration more rapidly than bred Low Responders (bLRs) and that bHR females in particular self-administered more cocaine than the other groups. The experiments presented here aimed to determine whether an individual's sex and behavioral phenotype interact to affect motivation to take cocaine. Methods We examined motivation for taking cocaine in two experiments using a range of doses on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of responding in bHR or bLR males and females. Additionally, we included a measure of continuing to respond {{in the absence of}} reinforcement, a feature of addiction that has been recently incorporated into tests of animal models {{on the basis of the}} criteria for substance use disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18. 0 software. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni correction post hoc test when applicable. Results We found sex differences as well as effects of novelty reactivity on the motivation to self-administer cocaine. Specifically, females demonstrated higher breaking points on the PR schedule compared with males, regardless of phenotype, and bHR males and females exhibited higher motivation than bLR animals at a number of the doses studied. Conclusions An individual's sex continues to be a predisposing factor with respect to drug abuse liability and can be compounded by additional individual differences such <b>as</b> reactivity <b>to</b> <b>novelty.</b> </p...|$|R
