50|$|The world's first <b>planetary</b> <b>gearhead</b> (the SP series) was {{unveiled}} at the Hanover Fair in 1983. The SP {{turned out to}} be so successful that alpha getriebebau was set up soon afterwards as an independent Wittenstein subsidiary. In 1984, alpha getriebebau GmbH was established as a cooperative venture of two SMEs (Bastian in Fellbach, just outside Stuttgart, and Wittenstein), with Manfred Bastian and Manfred Wittenstein as managing partners.|$|E
50|$|The {{high power}} {{necessary}} for the lower limbs and spine was realised with brushed DC motors, for cost reasons and ease of implementation, all lower joints use the same motor/ gearhead combination. The Maxon RE 32 series motor wound for a nominal 32V in combinations with a ceramic 156:1, 72% efficient, <b>planetary</b> <b>gearhead</b> is used. The maximum continuous output torque available is 10Nm with maximum speed of 5.3 rad/s at 2 amps of current consumption. Maximum intermittently permissible torque available is 22.5Nm at 4a. The length of the motors dictated the width of GuRoo's legs. The high-powered motors made up 33% of the total weight of the robot.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the way was}} paved for a new {{generation}} to take over the helm. Walter Wittenstein, the textile maker and machine builder, went into gradual retirement and was succeeded by his son, Dr. Manfred Wittenstein. Company founder Walter Wittenstein died in Igersheim in 1988. Shortly after joining the family firm in 1979, Manfred Wittenstein set to work modernising its production and product portfolio. In the search for market opportunities and adequate products with unique attributes, he quickly recognized the potential of low-backlash <b>planetary</b> <b>gearheads.</b>|$|R
40|$|A new sampler {{is similar}} to a common snow blower, but is robust and {{effective}} in sample collection. The brush wheels are arranged in a triangle shape, each driven by a brushless DC motor and <b>planetary</b> <b>gearhead</b> embedded in the wheel shaft. Its speed can be varied from 800 - 2, 000 rpm, depending on the surface regolith resistance. The sample-collecting flow path, and internal features, are designed based on flow dynamics, and the sample-collecting rates have consistently exceeded the requirement under various conditions that span the range of expected surface properties. The brush-wheel sampler (BWS) is designed so that the flow channel is {{the main body of the}} apparatus, and links the brush-wheel assembly to the sample canister. The combination of the three brush wheels, the sample flow path, and the canister location make sample collection, storage, and transfer an easier task...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{development}} of a novel regenerative shock absorber sized for a passengercar suspension system is studied. In the first phase, DC and AC rotary machines along with charging circuits, {{to be used in the}} energy conversion stage of the proposed shock absorber are analyzed.

The shock absorber includes a simple and highly efficient motion converter stage called ”two-leg mechanism”, a <b>planetary</b> <b>gearhead,</b> and a brushless three-phase rotary machine. The design and analysis of the regenerative shock absorber is presented by considering the linear damping coefficient and efficiency of the electromechanical device. The performance of the regenerative shock absorber is evaluated under sinusoidal excitation inputs for typical amplitudes and frequencies in a vehicular suspensionsystem. In the fourth phase, the effect of nonlinear terms of the shock absorber on linear dampingcoefficient provided by this system is studied.

40|$|Patients with {{neurological}} disorders, such as stroke survivors, can {{be treated}} with physical rehabilitation to regain motor control and function. Conventional therapy techniques are labor intensive and non-standardized. This {{is especially true in}} gait rehabilitation. The robotic therapy paradigm developed in the Newman Lab for Hu- man Rehabilitation uses low impedance robots, such as the MIT-MANUS, to provide assistive therapy in a repeatable and measurable fashion. A system is now being designed to assist gait rehabilitation using a series of lower extremity and pelvis robots that can be used together or independently. The focus of this document is ankle rehabilitation. Ankle function is typically not targeted in conventional or other robotic therapy systems. The result is often that the patient is required to wear a brace or orthosis after therapy. The proposed module allows all normal ankle movements and is capable of driving the two most important movements in gait, dorsi/plantar flexion and inversion/eversion. It is designed to provide sufficient force to position the foot in swing phase while still being as lightweight and backdriveable as possible. The kinematics consist of two parallel two-link mechanisms. The robot is driven by two DC brushless motors with <b>planetary</b> <b>gearheads</b> to amplify the torque output. by Jason W. Wheeler.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the last}} decade new {{technologies}} for manufacturing of precison mechanical components have been developed. Nowadays, the reduction of size and weight is very often {{one of the most}} important requirements in product design. Many applications in robotics, automation, medicine systems etc require powerful precison actuator. The powerful precision actuator has Speeds up to high speed and high output torque efficiencies. To accomplish a powerful precision actuator, these powerful motor have to be combined with gearhead of the same outer diameter. So, we have developed BLDC motor and <b>planetary</b> type <b>gearheads</b> as powerful precison actuator. The BLDC motor has advantages that compact structure, high efficiency, high reliability. The planetary type gear heads have advantages that same-axle structure, high torque transmission, low noise in comparison with spur gear heads. In this study included BLDC motor and planetary type gear heads design, manufacture for small robot...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the design and {{evaluation}} of a robust drive mechanism intended to robotically steer a thermal ablation electrode. The device is intended to enable more efficient kidney tumor ablation therapy guided by CT scanning. The steering mechanism {{is based on the}} concept of substantially straightening a pre-curved Nitinol stylet by retracting it into a concentric outer cannula, and re-deploying it at a different position. A drive mechanism was previously designed to actuate the cannula and stylet motions. While successfully demonstrating the concept, the previous prototype used a screw-spline mechanism that had a key and groove that were difficult to manufacture, assemble and align. To address the issue of the key being misaligned with the spline nut, an alternative, more robust means was considered for constraining the screw-spline from rotating. This was achieved through the design of a new profiled threaded shaft and nut that reduced the part count and simplified manufacturing and assembly. To determine the optimal parameters for the profile shape, an analytical expression was derived that related the tolerance between the nut and shaft to the angular backlash, which was validated using SolidWorks. A deterministic design process was then followed to size the actuators and transmissions for such drive mechanisms given a set of specifications for cannula/stylet force and speed. Specifically, the gear train was designed to ensure sufficient force for deploying a pre-curved needle from a cannula and into a gelatinous solid based on previously collected experimental data. Using this process, Faulhaber AM 1524 micro-stepper motors with 15 A <b>planetary</b> <b>gearheads</b> were selected that could provide 10 N and 20 N of force to both the cannula and stylet (in line with the screws) at a speed of 7 mm/s. Accuracy and repeatability of the drive mechanism were measured in a bench-top experiment using calipers and a protractor and yielded sub-mm values for translation and approximately two degrees of play for rotation. Targeting experiments were also performed in ballistics gelatin and ex-vivo tissue samples where the distal tip of the stylet was recorded with a camera and CT scanner and demonstrated that the device is ready for testing with an integrated thermal ablation system. by Carmen Marten-Ellis Graves.
