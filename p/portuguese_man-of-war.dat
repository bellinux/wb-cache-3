60|$|During our stay, I {{observed}} {{the habits of}} some marine animals. A large Aplysia is very common. This sea-slug is about five inches long; and is of a dirty yellowish colour, veined with purple. On {{each side of the}} lower surface, or foot, there is a broad membrane, which appears sometimes to act as a ventilator, in causing a current of water to flow over the dorsal branchiae or lungs. It feeds on the delicate seaweeds which grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water; and I found in its stomach several small pebbles, as in the gizzard of a bird. This slug, when disturbed, emits a very fine purplish-red fluid, which stains the water for the space of a foot around. Besides this means of defence, an acrid secretion, which is spread over its body, causes a sharp, stinging sensation, similar to that produced by the Physalia, or <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war.</b>|$|E
60|$|We sailed {{away for}} the Cape of Good Hope the {{beginning}} of October 1706, and passed by, in sight of the Cape, the 12th of November following, having met {{with a great deal}} of bad weather. We saw several merchant-ships in the roads there, as well English as Dutch, whether outward bound or homeward we could not tell; be it what it would, we did not think fit to come to an anchor, not knowing what they might be, or what they might attempt against us, when they knew what we were. However, as we wanted fresh water, we sent the two boats belonging to the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war,</b> with all Portuguese seamen or negroes in them, to the watering-place, to take in water; and in the meantime we hung out a Portuguese ancient at sea, and lay by all that night.

60|$|We {{were very}} glad of the sloop in particular, {{and began to}} consult what we should do, whether we had not best turn off our great Portuguese ship, and stick to our first ship and the sloop, seeing we had scarce men enough for all three, and that the biggest ship was thought too big for our business. However, another dispute, which was now decided, brought the first to a conclusion. The first dispute was, whither we should go. My comrade, as I called him now, that is to say, he that was my captain before we took this <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war,</b> was for going to the South Seas, and {{coasting}} up {{the west side of}} America, where we could not fail of making several good prizes upon the Spaniards; and that then, if occasion required it, we might come home by the South Seas to the East Indies, and so go round the globe, as others had done before us.|$|E

Results The clinical manifestations of envenomation were rare and mild and mostly local, systemic reactions; there was a low rate of late complications. Conclusions The consequences of envenomation were of moderate severity, and first aid measures were effective in controlling the pain.

Its venomous tentacles can deliver painful sting. In July, 2013 sudden strong winds and high tide had brought in several bluebottle jelly fish (Fig 1). For several people, a walk by the seaside at Juhu and Girgaum beaches during first week of July, 2013 ended in redness of skin, swelling, irritation, itching, blisters and severe body ache.

40|$|This work {{attempts}} to establish dermatological identification patterns for Brazilian cnidarian species and a probable correlation with envenoming severity. In an observational prospective study, {{one hundred and}} twenty-eight patients from the North Coast region of São Paulo State, Brazil were seen between 2002 and 2008. About 80 % of these showed only local effects (erythema, edema, and pain) with small, less than 20 cm, oval or round skin marks and impressions from small tentacles. Approximately 20 % of the victims had long, more than 20 cm, linear and crossed marks with frequent systemic phenomena, such as malaise, vomiting, dyspnea, and tachycardia. The former {{is compatible with the}} common hydromedusa from Southeast and Southern Brazil (Olindias sambaquiensis). The long linear marks with intense pain and systemic phenomena are compatible with envenoming by the box jellyfish Tamoya haplonema and Chiropsalmus quadrumanus and the hydrozoan <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war</b> (Physalis physalis). There was an association between skin marks and probable accident etiology. This simple observation rule can be indicative of severity, as the Cubozoa Class (box jellyfish) and <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war</b> cause the most severe accidents.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} distribution of Physalia physalis (L.) (the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war),</b> a wind-propelled jellyfish-like animal on sea-surface waters, {{is a much}} discussed but poorly understood phenomenon. The radically different courses sailed by the two mirror-image forms of this organism appear to result from simply their need for maximum dispersion by the winds on the earth's warmer seas. Study reveals, however, that the two forms of P. physalis sail different mirror-image courses and gain separate access to upwelling, diverging sea-surface waters that probably contain their major food. These courses are sailed without obvious steering efforts by the animals. Thus the wind-induced pattern of motion of the waters appears to have markedly influenced the animal's form and sailing courses. Their behavior apparently results from their natural involuntary use of steering effects of two wind induced surface-water motions...|$|E
40|$|In 2010, the Mediterranean basin {{experienced}} a <b>Portuguese</b> <b>Man-of-War</b> (Physalia physalis) outburst that had dramatic consequences, {{including the first}} ever recorded human mortality attributed to a jellyfish sting in the region. However, and despite the impact of jellyfishes on coastal economic activities {{and the importance of}} the tourism industry for the Mediterranean region (accounting for 15 % of global tourism), no scientific consensus has been achieved so far regarding the causes of this episode. Here we analyze the meteorological and oceanographic conditions of the North East Atlantic Ocean during the months previous to P. physalis appearance in the Mediterranean. We simulate the probable drift of Atlantic populations into the Mediterranean basin with a numerical model and compare model results with available observations. We conclude that the summer 2010 P.

40|$|This ancient phylum {{of mostly}} marine organisms {{is best known}} for its {{contribution}} to geomorphological features, forming thousands of square kilometres of coral reefs in warm tropical waters. Their fossil remains contribute to some limestones. Cnidarians are also significant components of the plankton, where large medusae – popularly called jellyfish – and colonial forms like <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war</b> and stringy siphonophores prey on other organisms including small fish. Some of these species are justly feared by humans for their stings, which in some cases can be fatal. Certainly, most New Zealanders will have encountered cnidarians when rambling along beaches and fossicking in rock pools where sea anemones and diminutive bushy hydroids abound. In New Zealand’s fiords and in deeper water on seamounts, black corals and branching gorgonians can form veritable trees five metres high or more. In contrast, inland inhabitants of continental landmasses who have never, or rarely, seen an ocean or visited a seashore can hardly be impressed with the Cnidaria as a phylum – freshwater cnidarians are relatively few, restricted to tiny hydras, the branching hydroid Cordylophora, and rare medusae...|$|E

40|$|Background: The phylum Cnidarians {{have over}} nine {{thousand}} species that approximately, one hundred species are dangerous for humans. Annually, {{a large number}} of deaths were reported due to jellyfish stings. The manifestations depend on their species and kind of venoms, and include the local and systemic manifestations. A number of methods and compounds were used and under investigation for management of injuries with jellyfishes. Due to the lack of an integrated systematic review, the current study was done. Materials and Methods: The PubMed data bank was searched for the term “Jellyfish”. A total of 1677 papers were found. These papers were divided into three categories: medical, biomedical and biotechnological fields. The medical category was further divided into three subcategories comprising systemic manifestations, cutaneous manifestations and treatments for the stings of jellyfishes. The biomedical category was further subdivided into genomics, proteomics, and biology of venoms, mechanisms of actions and products of biomedical significance. In this part of systematic review, the medical aspects of injuries with jellyfishes were evaluated. Results: The clinical manifestations in jellyfish envenomation depend on their species and the nature of venoms. The most common clinical manifestations of jellyfish stings are cutaneous presentations like urticasia, erythema, swelling, vesicles and severe dermonectoric manifestations. Systemic manifestations were seen in the stings of box jellyfishes, <b>Portuguese</b> <b>man-of-war</b> and in Irukandji syndrome. The most common recommendations for jellyfish envenomation managements include decreasing the local effects of venom, prevention of the venomous nematocysts release, and Controlling of systemic reactions. Application of commercial vinegar (4 - 6 % acetic acid), hot water immersion (HWI) (42 ° C for 20 minutes), ice packs, sea water rinsing for inactivating nematocysts, administration of topical and parenteral analgesics, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are the basics for treatments of jellyfish envenomations. The Anti-venom for jellyfishes can counteract the effects of venom. Conclusion: The cutaneous manifestations in jellyfish envenomation are the most common clinical presentation. There was no any conducted double-blind and controlled clinical trials for the management of jellyfish envenomation, the application of commercial vinegar (4 - 6 % acetic acid), hot water, ice packs and sea water rinsing are the fundamentals of treatments in the stings of the jellyfishes...|$|E
