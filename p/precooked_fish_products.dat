40|$|The {{composition}} of diets in farm-raised blue foxes varies seasonally. Our present {{study sought to}} determine the effects of normal (NOR) and high (HIGH) <b>fish</b> <b>product</b> levels in the diet on growth performance and fur properties of farmed blue foxes (Vulpes lagopus). Experimental groups employed were: (1) Normal, traditional <b>fish</b> <b>product</b> level; 21 % (NOR); and (2) high <b>fish</b> <b>product</b> level; 30 % (HIGH). Each group comprised 30 juvenile males. The results showed that appetite of experimental foxes in both study groups was good when evaluated as a fresh feed intake. However, when measured as an ingested dry matter and energy intake, consumption was slightly higher for NOR animals. Significant differences were found in body weights only in Sept 24 when NOR animals were heavier (P 0. 05). It can be concluded that the amount of 30 % <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> (10 % <b>fish</b> meal, 20 % fish mixture) tended to provide lower weight gain and shorter skin length compared to diet having 21 % <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> (1 % <b>fish</b> oil, 20 % fish mixture).

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{assessment}} of <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> consumption by the citizens of the region. The purpose of the research is the development and application of the tools simulating consumer demand on <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> on the example of the households in the Republic of Buryatia for the “Baikal omul” brand promotion. The authors have found that the rise of consumer demand in world <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> consumption is due to the increase of aquaculture in artificial reservoirs. On the fish market, we have observed the steady differentiation of cultivated fish and fish from natural reservoirs. The rise of prices on <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> significantly changes the segments of consumers especially depending on their incomes. We have found that <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> are significant for the citizens of the Republic of Buryatia. Some key factors of <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> consumption were established. The authors offered the methodological approach of making the survey of the population on consumption of <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> based on the cluster analysis. The methodology toolkit includes the mathematical methods of statistical and survey data processing. We have proved that <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> {{play an important role in}} the diet of the citizens of the Republic of Buryatia. There are significant differences in fish consumption according to the income of respondents. The scientific novelty of the study includes establishing the deterrent factors of <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> in the conditions of decreasing incomes and increasing prices on fish market; estimation of traditional kind of processed fish production from the lake Baikal in terms of technology of fermentation for developing a brand and its promotion outwards of local market; applying a differential approach to the analysis of consumers preferences in fish products; reasoning the deficiency of “omul with odor” brand estimation in the context of the prospect development of tourist cluster.

40|$|Aim: In {{the current}} study, a {{contribution}} to the knowledge on the prevalence and level of contamination of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) seafood marketed in Thessaloniki (Northern Greece) was provided; the serovar identity of the L. monocytogenes isolates was also determined.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} consumers' perceptions and barriers {{in relation to}} fresh, frozen, preserved and ready-meal <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> in a geographically diverse selection of European countries. Design/methodology/approach – Cross-sectional data were collected through a consumer survey (n= 3, 213), conducted in June 2008 in the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the UK. Items measured were self-reported consumption frequencies, consumer perceptions of different <b>fish</b> <b>product</b> categories, and perceived barriers for increased fish consumption levels. Country specificities are discussed. Findings – The overriding healthy perception consumers have about fish was confirmed, and contributed very strongly to the general perception consumers have about fish. Fresh fish was perceived the most healthy <b>fish</b> <b>product,</b> followed by frozen, preserved and ready-meal <b>fish</b> <b>products.</b> Perception scores were highest correlated with self-reported fish consumption in the Mediterranean countries. With the exception of Romania, perceived barriers only poorly explained self-reported consumption frequencies of the different <b>fish</b> <b>product</b> categories. This finding {{is related to the}} possible influence of habit and tradition with regard to eating fish, to the absence of measures related to motivations or drivers to consume fish, or to the possibility that some of the perceived barriers reinforce each other. In the Mediterranean countries, fish consumption frequency is on a very high level, independently of perceived barriers and motivational aspects, and part of the traditional Mediterranean diet. Originality/value – The strength of this study pertains to its international scope and geographical spread. Further, consumer perceptions and perceived barriers in relation to fresh, frozen, preserved and ready-meal <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> have rarely been studied in parallel. Findings are relevant to support efforts on national and international level to stimulate or modify fish consumption, and to explore opportunities to trade <b>fish</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture, or more {{generally}} fish farming, and fisheries interact {{in several different}} ways. First, many types of fish farming require <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> as inputs, mostly for feeding purposes. Second, farmed fish and wild <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> compete in <b>fish</b> markets with consequences for both the industry and, of course, consumers. Third, fish farming generates various types of polluting agents that may affect wild fish stocks and their habitat. Several other interactions exist. This paper is primarily concerned with {{the implications of the}} first of these interactions, namely the input relationships, for the overall supply of <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> in the future. To the extent that the fish farming industry demands wild <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> such as <b>fish</b> meal, fish oil, etc. as inputs, the price of these products is increased compared to what would otherwise be the case and, as a result, the price of fish landings. This encourages increased demand from the fish farming industry may – especially given the ecosystem context of most fisheries – lead to long-term fluctuations, instability and even chaotic behavior of wild fish supply. A formal model describing the above considerations is constructed. Possible schedules of global supply of <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> are calculated given various assumptions about (i) fisheries management, (ii) wild fish requirements of the fish farming industry, and (iii) technological progress in fish farming. The impact of expanding global fish farming on the wild fish industry and global supply of <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> is assessed.
