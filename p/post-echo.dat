40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose two metrics for the {{evaluation}} of the impact of pre-echoes and <b>post-echoes</b> on theperceived quality in soundfield rendering applications. These metrics are derived from psychoacoustic-basedconsiderations, in particular the masking effect, well known in the literature of perceptual coding. Themeasurement is accomplished through a virtual microphone array that samples the soundfield on acircumference. The soundfield within the circle is estimated by means of the circular harmonic decomposition. As a result, space-time impulse responses of the rendering system are obtained, which are then analyzed through the masking curve to extract the pre- and <b>post-echoes</b> metrics. A comparison between experimentaland simulative results, conducted using the same setup, allows to discriminate the impact of the adopted rendering engine and of the non-idealities of the real system (environment and loudspeakers) on pre- andpost-echoes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Transmit {{diversity}} {{is a technique}} that exploits the nature of fading due to multipaths and that potentially incurs delay and pre- and <b>post-echoes</b> into the received signals. There is some concern that early set-top boxes would not be compliant in this respect. Also, introduction of such techniques that would degrade reception for inservice equipments would have an important impact, which should be evaluated. This paper presents a measurement campaign to establish whether the in-service DVB-T receivers are compatible with transmit diversity schemes and also to evaluate the possible diversity loss in the line-of-sight fixed receptions...|$|R

50|$|Tape {{formulation}} {{affects the}} retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, print-through, optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types (ferric oxide Fe2O3, chromium dioxide CrO2, etc.) {{and also in the}} precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the tensile strength and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended pre- and <b>post-echoes</b> on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{editorial}} excellence, the <b>Post-Echo</b> eventually {{bowed to}} the inexorable rise of freesheets and their demands on advertising revenue [...] and the deep recession of the early 80s eventually saw its demise. It closed in 1983 {{with the loss of}} 470 jobs.|$|E

50|$|The psychoacoustic {{component}} of the effect is that one hears only the echo preceding the transient, not the one following - because this latter is {{drowned out by the}} transient. Formally, forward temporal masking is much stronger than backwards temporal masking, hence one hears a pre-echo, but no <b>post-echo.</b>|$|E

50|$|From 1972, {{during the}} English county cricket offseason winter months, Johnson was {{employed}} as a trainee reporter on The Tribune newspaper in Nassau. In October 1975, Johnson became a trainee journalist with Thomson Newspapers, owned by Lord Thomson of Fleet. He worked at the Hemel Hempstead Evening <b>Post-Echo</b> and studied at the Harlow College of Journalism in Essex. This training was followed by one year's cadetship at Reuters.|$|E

50|$|In {{its early}} days, the <b>Post-Echo</b> won many design awards, using offset {{printing}} to produce bold broadsheet pages with imaginative use of pictures. It regularly outshone its London rivals, the Evening News and Evening Standard, on the newsstands and {{was seen by}} many Fleet Street observers of the day as the future of newspapers. One of the Evening Post photographers, Alun John {{went on to become}} the award winning launch Picture Editor of The Independent.|$|E
50|$|The {{direct metal}} {{mastering}} technology addresses the lacquer mastering technology's issue of pre-echoes during record play, caused by the cutting stylus unintentionally transferring some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous groove wall. In particular, a quiet passage followed by a loud sound often clearly revealed a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time (the duration of one revolution at 33 rpm). This problem could also appear as <b>post-echo,</b> 1.8 seconds after a peak in volume.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>Post-Echo</b> journalists became authors. Stephen Pile wrote The Book of Heroic Failures, Melanie Phillips the {{controversial}} Londonistan, Jean Ritchie {{a book about}} murderess Myra Hindley, and Ashley Walton The Duke of Hazard about Prince Philip. Anthony Holden became a biographer and also {{wrote a book about}} professional poker called Big Deal. John Marquis wrote Blood and Fire, about the famous murder of Sir Harry Oakes, and Papa Doc, about the Haitian dictator François Duvalier. Michael Bilton wrote books about the Falklands War, the My Lai Massacre and the Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the Finlandia Hall {{building}} is a tower like section with a sloping roof. Alvar Aalto’s idea behind the design was that a high empty space would provide better acoustics. A lattice ceiling hides the space to the audience but it allows {{the creation of the}} same deep <b>post-echo</b> as tall church towers. Aalto used marble in both indoor and outdoor surfaces as a contrast to black granite. For Aalto, marble was a tie to the Mediterranean culture, which he wanted to bring to Finland.|$|E
