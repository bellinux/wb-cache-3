Food sampling is undertaken primarily by local authorities and port health authorities for submission to public analysts for analysis. Much of the legislation relates to food as supplied to a consumer, meaning that every portion of a size of perishable food and foods at risk as may be supplied to a consumer has to comply, so that in such cases the sample submitted for analysis could simply be an entire consumer-sized portion. There are exceptions, however, such as the sampling of nut products {{for the presence of}} aflatoxins, which stipulate a <b>primary</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> related {{to the size of the}} consignment - with associated requirements for initial homogenisation to produce a smaller sample to be sent for analysis.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{to investigate the}} impact of effect size heterogeneity {{on the results of}} a meta-analysis. Specifically, we address the small sample behaviour of the OLS, the fixed effects regression and the mixed effects meta-estimators under three alternative scenarios of effect size heterogeneity. We distinguish heterogeneity in effect size variance, heterogeneity due to a varying true underlying effect across primary studies, and heterogeneity due to a non-systematic impact of omitted variable bias in primary studies. Our results show that the mixed effects estimator is to be preferred to the other two estimators in the first two situations. However, in the presence of random effect size variation due to a non-systematic impact of omitted variable bias, using the mixed effects estimator may be suboptimal. We also address the impact of <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> and show that meta-analysis <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is far more effective in reducing meta-estimator variance and increasing the power of hypothesis testing than <b>primary</b> study <b>sample</b> <b>size.</b> Effect size heterogeneity; meta-analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; fixed effects regression estimator; mixed effects estimator...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Sample</b> <b>size</b> {{computation}} {{is required}} for designing a clinical trial. For a trial with multiple <b>primary</b> outcomes, the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is often computed for each outcome using some adjustment of the overall Type I error, such as the Bonferroni correction, and the largest <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> required for a single outcome is selected for the trial. Many of these approaches, in particular the Bonferroni method and its extensions, can be too conservative when the interest is to detect a consistent but small improvement over {{a large number of}} outcomes. Thus, rather than conducting multiple tests on the primary outcomes of interest separately, a global statistical test, such as O'Brien's rank-sum test, can be adopted. This statistical approach requires a smaller <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> than the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> computed using the Bonferroni approach. We propose a new <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> computation formula for a nonparametric global statistical test when multiple nonsurvival outcomes and a survival outcome are considered jointly.

40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) {{which involve}} cost-effectiveness evaluations rarely use health economic input when undertaking <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> calculations {{for the trial}} design; however, in studies undertaken with cost-effectiveness as the <b>primary</b> outcome, <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> calculations should be {{directly related to the}} cost-effectiveness result rather than to the effectiveness outcome alone. This paper reports on a case in which a clinical trial design <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> and power calculations were determined with regard to cost-effectiveness using the net monetary benefit (NMB) approach to demonstrate the feasibility of <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> calculation for cost-effectiveness in a real life setting. The proposed RCT of fetal fibronectin screening (fFN) for women with threatened pre-term labour is discussed, followed by the design of a preliminary model to inform the trial design calculation.

The NMB approach for cost-effectiveness is discussed and used to calculate the required <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> for different powers. The <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> calculations are then recalculated using a non-inferiority margin, to ensure that the NMB <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> for the trial was also sufficient to demonstrate non-inferiority for the effectiveness endpoint.

40|$|Chimeric RNAs {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a phenomenon not unique to cancer cells. They also exist in normal physiology. Aging is often characterized by deregulation of molecular and cellular mechanisms, including loss of heterochromatin, increased transcriptional noise, less tight control on alternative splicing, and more stress-induced changes. It is thus assumed that chimeric RNAs are more abundant in older people. In this study, we conducted a preliminary investigation to identify any chimeric RNAs with age-based trends in their expression levels in blood samples. A chimeric RNA candidate list generated by bioinformatic analysis indicated the possibility of both negative and positive trends in the expression of chimeric RNAs. Out of this candidate list, five novel chimeric RNAs were successfully amplified in multiple blood samples and then sequenced. Although <b>primary</b> smaller <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> displayed some weak trends with respect to age, analysis of quantitative PCR data from larger <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> showed essentially no relationship between expression levels and age. Altogether, these results indicate that, contradictory to the common assumption, chimeric RNAs as a group are not all higher in older individuals and that placing chimeric RNAs {{in the context of}} aging will be a much more complex task than initially anticipated...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{authors of}} this article {{analysed}} the importance of recognizing roles in team work experience for work experience quality work between preschool teachers and teachers in preschools and schools. Teamwork is a complex area, which includes communication, collaboration, and reacting to stressful situations. Accordingly, it is absolutely necessary for preschool teachers and primary school teachers to have good communication skills, management of potential conflict situations, approaches to identification and management of different work situations, as well as approaches to coping with stress and working with different people. The purpose of the empirical study was therefore to analyse and compare different roles in teamwork at preschool (between preschool teacher and her assistant) and primary school, especially in first grade, where the teacher and preschool teacher work together in the classroom. During the empirical research, conducted on a population of preschool teachers and teachers {{in the first grade}} of <b>primary</b> school (<b>sample</b> <b>size</b> was 140), the authors found that all different roles appear as important and more or less equal; maybe some more preschool teachers and teacher seem to take on the role of team worker or implementer The authors did not observe important statistical differences considering work experience or level of education, but there are, as expected, differences considering work position...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{cases are}} often {{clustered}} within herds or generally groups that share common characteristics. <b>Sample</b> <b>size</b> formulae must adjust for the within-cluster correlation of the <b>primary</b> <b>sampling</b> units.

We reviewed all studies evaluating biotechnological therapies in pSS to identify their inclusion criteria and primary endpoints. Then, in a large cohort (ASSESS), we determined the proportion of patients who would be included in RCTs using various inclusion criteria sets. Finally, we used the population of a large randomised therapeutic trial in pSS (TEARS) to assess the impact of various primary objectives and endpoints on estimated <b>sample</b> <b>sizes.</b> These analyses were performed only for the endpoints indicating greater efficacy of rituximab compared to the placebo. We identified 18 studies. The most common inclusion criteria were short disease duration; systemic involvement; high mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for dryness, pain, and fatigue; and biological evidence of activity. In the ASSESS cohort, 35 percent of patients had recent-onset disease (lower than 4 years), 68 percent systemic manifestations, 68 percent high scores on two of three VASs, and 52 percent biological evidence of activity. The primary endpoints associated with the smallest <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> (nlower than 200) were a VAS dryness score improvement higher to 20 mm by week 24 or variable improvements (10, 20, or 30 mm) in fatigue VAS by week 6 or 16. For patients with systemic manifestations, the ESSDAI change may be the most logical endpoint, as it reflects all domains of disease activity. However, the ESSDAI did not improve significantly with rituximab therapy in the TEARS study. Ultrasound score improvement produced the smallest <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> estimate in the TEARS study. This study provides valuable information for designing future RCTs on the basis of previously published studies. Previous RCTs used inclusion criteria that selected a small part of the entire pSS population. The endpoint was usually based on VASs assessing patient complaints. In contrast to VAS dryness cut-offs, VAS fatigue cut-offs did not affect estimated <b>sample</b> <b>sizes.</b> SGUS improvement produced the smallest estimated <b>sample</b> <b>size.</b> Further studies are required to validate standardised SGUS modalities and assessment criteria.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{barrier to}} the assessment of ecosystem services {{is a lack of}} primary data, especially for cultural ecosystem services. Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300 m resolution) and CORINE (100 m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the <b>primary</b> data <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services...|$|R

Methodology: A conceptual framework for HRQOL in TB has been developed to identify patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for HRQOL and adherence and to generate an endpoint model. Two generic (SF- 12 and EQ- 5 D- 5 L), one disease-specific (St. George´s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)) and one condition-specific (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) measure for HRQOL and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) for adherence assessment were identified.

Nor have they distinguished between babies with and without a predisposition to atopic eczema. We conducted a pilot study as a prequel to designing an optimum trial to investigate whether bathing with a specific cleansing product is superior to bathing with water alone. The aims were to produce baseline data which would inform decisions for the main trial design (i. e. population, <b>primary</b> outcome, <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> calculation) and to optimize the robustness of trial processes within the study setting. Methods 100 healthy, full term neonates aged Results Forty nine babies were randomized to cleansing product, 51 to water. The 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for the average TEWL measurement at each time point were: whole sample at baseline: 10. 8 g/m 2 /h to 11. 7 g/m 2 /h; CP group 4 weeks: 10. 9 g/m 2 /h to 13. 3 g/m 2 /h; 8 weeks: 11. 4 g/m 2 /h to 12. 9 g/m 2 /h; W group 4 weeks: 10. 9 g/m 2 /h to 12. 2 g/m 2 /h; 8 weeks: 11. 4 g/m 2 /h to 12. 9 g/m 2 /h. Conclusion This pilot study provided valuable baseline data and important information on trial processes. The decision to proceed with a superiority trial, for example, was inconsistent with our data; therefore a non-inferiority trial is recommended. Trial registration ISRCTN 72285670 </p...|$|R

The present study examines the economic potentialities of home stay for operators. The study also analyzes socio-economic impact of this accommodation from the perception of operator’s. Both primary and secondary data {{have been used in}} the study. A total of 10 home stay operators are selected from Terengganu for collecting <b>primary</b> data. The <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> has been determined based on non-probability convenience sampling design. Purposive sampling technique is used to select the respondents. Regression and descriptive analysis are using to attain the objectives. The study reveals that home stay is economically potential for the operators. Their monthly income rise based on initial investment, monthly expenses and targeted annual revenue. Moreover, the respondents believe this operation has helped local economy, society and environment. It gives focus on traditional culture and customs of local people. Home stay is increasing employment opportunities, local people living standard and public-private investment; and helpful for conservation and ecosystem to maintain the environmental balance. There are some initiatives such as proper planning and marketing, research activities, increase customer service and sufficient allocation can ensure socio-economic advancement from home stay accommodation...|$|R

40|$|In the 2000 {{redesign}} of the Survey of Income and Program Participation sample, a two-stage sample design is adopted. In the first stage, two geographic <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units are selected {{from each of}} the strata within each state. In selecting <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units, if a <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit that was in the 1990 design is reselected in 2000, then the experienced field representative in that <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit can remain working on the survey. If a new <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit is selected, then a new field representative will have to be hired and trained. Therefore, reselecting as many of the <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units that were in the 1990 design as possible would minimize this turnover of field representatives. This will help reduce nonsampling errors caused by the inexperience of newly hired field representatives and the costs to train them. The Bureau of the Census employs the Ernst (1986) algorithm to select <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units while maximizing the <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Unit overlap between the 1990 and 2000 designs. Ernst's approach (1986) is demonstrated on test data for selecting two <b>Primary</b> <b>Sampling</b> Units from each stratum. The test results are reported in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{literacy}} {{is regarded as}} essential for good citizenship, employment, and practical day-to-day living. The ubiquitous nature of data and computers in contemporary society has increased both the need for statistical literacy and the means of developing statistical literacy. This study investigated students’ acceptance of Fathom® virtual simulation and resampling as a legitimate mathematics tool, {{the teaching and learning}} of the explicit determination of <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> when <b>sampling</b> from large populations, and students’ development of use of Fathom statistics education software. The study was conducted as a three-week long classroom unit of work taught in two Year 9 classes and a detailed study of twelve students in Tasmania, Australia. Pedagogical best practice principles derived from statistics education research guided the study. These included engagement with the big ideas of statistics, active learning and data sets students can understand and value, statistical enquiry that cultivates statistical habits of mind, the use of technology tools that allows students to explore data and concepts, mathematical experiences of substance, provision of a developmental pathway for students to study statistics at more senior years, and authentic assessment. Fathom was developed for senior high school and tertiary study, and its use in Australian high schools is relatively novel. Students’ unfamiliarity with the software presented at least two challenges: developing acceptance of Fathom’s virtual resampling probability simulator as a legitimate mathematical tool and acquiring basic fluency in the software’s use such that the software was not a constraint on learning. Students’ acceptance of the probability simulator was cultivated purposefully through a process of formal statistical enquiry where students examined the fairness of the Fathom virtual die. Students’ development of use of Fathom re-sampling was examined from the three aspects of key terminology, graphical data representations, and their relationship with Fathom. The principles of instrumental genesis guided the introduction to, and the examination of, students’ use of Fathom. <b>Sample</b> <b>size</b> is presently ignored in the high school curriculum, and students may complete formal school education with unsophisticated notions of <b>sample</b> <b>size,</b> possibly first acquired in upper <b>primary</b> school. The <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> model e=+/Vn, which relates the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> n, to the margin of error e, of the accuracy of measurement, was used in this study. A foremost consideration was that the model was potentially accessible and that students could apply their understanding in a real-life context. Large populations were studied because formal mathematical treatment is relatively simple. Students’ work samples were assessed using the SOLO taxonomy, and situated abstraction was used to observe students’ development of understanding of selected mathematical concepts. The study concluded that a process of statistical enquiry may be used both to promote acceptance of virtual simulation and to foster the development of statistical “habits of mind. ” The <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> model e=+/Vn has application in Year 9 principally to mathematise traditional Law of Large Numbers activities, where the computing power of virtual simulation allows exploration of very large <b>sample</b> <b>sizes.</b> The introduction of re-sampling and the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> model in Year 9 provides the foundation for the consideration of contextual tasks in more senior school years. The study suggests that Fathom is suitable for Year 9 students, but recommends further research in the use of re-sampling to exploit fully the software’s potential...|$|R
