25|$|After the Civil War {{concluded}} in 1865, {{a variety of}} new businesses were established to better serve the Palmyra area. A large grain warehouse, a slaughterhouse and lumber mill were some of the first industries developed in Palmyra. The town’s first newspaper was printed in 1878 and was titled “The Londonderry Gazette”. The Palmyra Bank opened in 1887. The first of several shoe factories opened in 1888. A knitting mill, <b>paper</b> <b>box</b> factory, gas and fuel company, bakery, bottling works, and a feed mill was also open in Palmyra around the start of the 20th century. The growth of Milton S. Hershey’s chocolate company in nearby Derry also encouraged people to move to the Palmyra area.|$|E

He invented {{a new form of}} box termed [...] "a round square", particularly adapted for holding cartrages, as the corners were compressed in, not out, giving extra strength. The machines built to make the boxes were semi-automatic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} {{sections of the}} district were transformed from a largely residential area to a mix of factory and warehouse buildings. [...] Six such buildings were constructed between 1900 and 1910 with another six buildings built the following decade. [...] By 1901 the Davenport <b>Paper</b> <b>Box</b> Company and the Kerker <b>Paper</b> <b>Box</b> Company {{were among the first}} businesses to build new structures in the district. [...] They were followed by the Sieg Iron Company warehouse (1905), a heavy hardware distributor, and grocery distributor Smith Brothers and Burdick Company (1905). [...] The later building was built on the property vacated by Trinity Church. The Halligan Coffee Company built a new office and warehouse building in 1907 at the corner of East Fourth and Iowa Streets. [...] The freight building was the sixth building built in that decade.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1964 {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of Christopher Jackman of the Laundry Workers Union and Winfield Chasmar, Jr. of the <b>Paper</b> <b>Box</b> Workers Union, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The senate enacted a proposal whereby each senator's vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, [...] under which Cape May County's senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. In a decision issued on December 15, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the weighted voting system as adopted was unconstitutional. The court ordered that interim measures be established for the 1965 legislative elections, in which weighted voting {{could be used as a}} temporary measure, and that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with [...] "one man, one vote" [...] requirements be in place before elections taking place in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The {{buildings}} in the district include multi-story wholesale and transfer warehouses, large and small-scale multi-story factories and small-scale mixed-use buildings. [...] Some of Davenport’s most prominent architectural firms contributed buildings. [...] Most of the buildings {{were built in the}} Vernacular commercial style. [...] These structures feature segmental brick window arches, stone lintels, and brick corbelling along the cornice line. [...] The first Sieg Iron Company building at 312 East Fifth Street and the Davenport <b>Paper</b> <b>Box</b> Company building at 310 East Fourth Street exemplify this style. The Smith Brothers and Burdick Company building at 427 Pershing Avenue and the Halligan Coffee Company building at 402 East Fourth Street were designed in the Classical Revival style. [...] They were the product of Temple, Burrows and McLane. [...] Both buildings have a main floor and a cornice that are set off by stone and metal Classical ornamentation. [...] In between is a multi-story shaft that contains segmental and flat-arched windows. [...] The Sickles, Preston and Nutting Company building at 511 Pershing Avenue and the second Sieg Iron Company building at 500 Iowa Street were designed by Davenport architect Arthur Ebeling. [...] They are typical of his style which features simple, functional buildings with minimal ornamentation and practical floor plans. The Davenport architectural firm of Clausen & Kruse contributed the Crescent Macaroni and Cracker Company building at 427 Iowa Street and both Ewert and Richter Transfer and Storage Company buildings at 320 East Fourth Street.|$|E

60|$|Saxon {{sat back}} in the Morris chair, resting and thinking. The problem was growing more {{complicated}} than ever. This elderly, round-bellied, and bald-headed gunfighter, too, had a wife and family. And there was Frank Davis, married barely a year and with a baby boy.

She worked at all the tasks she had ever done, performing, in fancy, the myriads of mechanical movements peculiar to each occupation--shaping and pasting in the <b>paper</b> <b>box</b> factory, ironing in the laundry, weaving in the jute mill, peeling fruit in the cannery and countless boxes of scalded tomatoes. She attended all her dances and all her picnics over again; went through her school days, recalling the face and name and seat of every schoolmate; endured the gray bleakness of the years in the orphan asylum; revisioned every memory of her mother, every tale; and relived all her life with Billy. But ever--and here the torment lay--she was drawn back from these far-wanderings to her present trouble, with its parch in the throat, its ache in the breast, and its gnawing, vacant goneness.|$|E

6000|$|For, {{how often}} have I heard the unfortunate working man lectured, {{as if he}} were a little charity-child, humid as to his nasal development, {{strictly}} literal as to his Catechism, and called by Providence to walk all his days in a station in life represented on festive occasions by a mug of warm milk-and-water and a bun! What popguns of jokes have these ears tingled to hear let off at him, what asinine sentiments, what impotent conclusions, what spelling- book moralities, what adaptations of the orator's insufferable tediousness to the assumed level of his understanding! If his sledge-hammers, his spades and pick-axes, his saws and chisels, his paint-pots and brushes, his forges, furnaces, and engines, the horses that he drove at his work, and the machines that drove him at his work, were all toys in one little <b>paper</b> <b>box,</b> and he the baby who played with them, he could not have been discoursed to, more impertinently and absurdly than I have heard him discoursed to times innumerable.

60|$|Happily the hostelries {{were mostly}} in one quarter, {{the better to}} keep an eye on one another; for in the course of the next ten minutes I suppose we visited nearly every inn in the place. The choice was not a whit furthered by the change from the {{outposts}} to the originals. At last, however, I got so far in decision as to pull off my boots, --an act elsewhere as well, I believe, considered an acquiescence in fate,--and suffered myself to be led through the house, along the indoor piazza of polished board exceeding slippery, up several breakneck, ladder-like stairways even more polished and frictionless, round some corners dark as a dim andon (a feeble tallow candle blinded by a <b>paper</b> <b>box),</b> placed so as not to light the turn, could make them, until finally we emerged on the third story, a height that itself spoke for the superiority of the inn, and I was ushered into what my bewildered fancy instantly pictured a mediaeval banqueting hall. It conjured up the idea on what I must own to have been insufficient grounds, namely, a plain deal table and a set of questionably made, though rather gaudily upholstered chairs. But chairs, in a land whose people have from time immemorial found their own feet quite good enough to sit on, were so unexpected a luxury, even after our Takasaki experience, that they may be pardoned for suggesting any flight of fancy.|$|E

She had obeyed her mother; obeyed Cady, the saloon-keeper, and Cady's wife; obeyed the matron and the {{other women in the}} orphan asylum; obeyed Tom when she came to live in his house, and never run in the streets because he didn't wish her to. At school she had always been honorably promoted, and never had her deportment report varied from one hundred per cent. She had worked from the day she left school to the day of her marriage. She had been a good worker, too. The little Jew who ran the <b>paper</b> <b>box</b> factory had almost wept when she quit. It was the same at the cannery.
