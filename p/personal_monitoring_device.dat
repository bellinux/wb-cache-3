40|$|Lithium {{preparations}} {{are considered}} the most reliable form of mood stabilizing medication for patients with Bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, lithium is a toxic element and its therapeutic range is extremely narrow, with levels of 0. 61. 0 mEq considered normal, whereas levels above 1. 5 mEq are toxic. Thus unfortunately, many patients reach toxic levels that lead to unnecessary complications. It is believed that personal monitoring of blood lithium levels would benefit patients taking lithium medication. Therefore, our aim {{is to develop a}} personal lithium blood level analyzer for patients with bipolar mood disorder, and we report here our initial results of a colorimetric-based method used to test drop-volumes of human plasma that had been spiked with lithium. It was possible to validate results with standard flame photometry readings. Applying the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method on preprocessed spectra, therapeutic concentrations of lithium in a single drop can be predicted in a rapid manner, and furthermore, the calibration results were used to select effective wavelengths which were employed as inputs in Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The simplified algorithms of this would prove useful when developing a personal lithium analyzer. Overall, both calibration methods gave high correlation and small error outputs with a R 2 = 0. 99036 and RMSEC = 0. 03778, and R 2 = 0. 994148 and RMSEC= 0. 0294404, for PLS and MLR methods, respectively. The results show that the spectrophotometric determination of blood lithium levels can be extended beyond laboratory applications and indicate the capability of this testing principle to be employed in a <b>personal</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>device.</b> Future work will now focus on the technical development of a miniaturized system for measurement of lithium levels in blood with an acceptable level of accuracy and sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} air {{pollution}} are associated with adverse effects on public health. Pollutant concentrations are typically subject to a high spatial and temporal variability. To investigate and quantify potential relations between pollutant concentrations and health effects, e. g. cases of respiratory diseases, sophisticated geospatial tools and methods are required. Air pollutants are ubiquitous and {{a certain level of}} exposure is inevitable. For risk assessments and public health advice, however, it is necessary to quantify human exposure to specific pollutants of concern. This is a challenging task as individual daily mobility patterns substantially influence exposure to air pollutants over time and in space. But it is not only people’s activities making the quantification difficult, also air chemistry, microclimatic and meteorological influences are changing over space and time, resulting in high spatial and temporal variation of ambient pollutant concentrations. Within a research project funded by the Scottish Government (EDPHiS, Environmental Determinants of Public Health in Scotland), the application of GIS methods and tools for integrating data from personal monitoring trials with supporting Scotland-wide datasets such as air pollution concentrations, land use and population data for personal exposure assessment will be examined. The work described here is conducted in the frame of a joint PhD studentship between the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and the University of Exeter. It focuses on the development of methods for personal exposure monitoring as well as the integration of measured data with supporting secondary data for improving human exposure assessment. For this purpose, an experimental design with a small, wearable <b>personal</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>device</b> to derive personal time-activity patterns and exposure profiles is currently devised. Resulting personal exposure profiles will be integrated and assessed using geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods for a complementary human exposure assessment approach.

Current digital communication modalities include cell phones, smartphones, interactive voice response, text messages, e-mails, clinic-based interactive video, home-based web-cams, mobile smartphone two-way cameras, <b>personal</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices,</b> kiosks, dashboards, <b>personal</b> health records, web-based portals, social networking sites, secure chat rooms, and on-line forums. Improvements in digital access could drastically diminish the geographical, temporal, and cultural access problems faced by many patients. Conversely, a growing digital divide could create greater access disparities for some populations. As the paradigm of healthcare delivery evolves towards greater reliance on non-encounter-based digital communications between patients and their care teams, {{it is critical that}} our theoretical conceptualization of access undergoes a concurrent paradigm shift to make it more relevant for the digital age. The traditional conceptualizations and indicators of access are not well adapted to measure access to health services that are delivered digitally outside the context of face-to-face encounters with providers.

Personal health technologies may help improve engagement in health promotion programs and maintenance of their effect. Objective: This study investigated personal health technologies in supporting employee health promotion targeting multiple behavioral health risks. We studied the relations of usage activity to demographic and physiological characteristics, health-related outcomes (weight, aerobic fitness, blood pressure and cholesterol), and the perceived usefulness of technologies in wellness management. Methods: We conducted a subgroup analysis of the technology group (114 subjects, 33 males, average age 45 years, average BMI 27. 1 kg/m 2) of a 3 -arm randomized controlled trial (N= 352).

However, physical and mental wellness indicators directly affect {{the output of the}} worker according to existing studies that illustrate the strong relationship between workplace conditions and productivity. Personal and environmental sensed data can inform smarter workplace design and operations to potentially increase productivity and benefit all stakeholders in the modern workplace. This paper introduces a project that will measure environmental variables and personal physical and mental parameters of employees in different office environments to determine correlations with productivity. In-vivo measurements are obtained via a combination of environmental sensor modules and <b>personal</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> that record the interplay between variables affecting comfort and productivity in a workplace.

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} {{has become}} the primary theme of healthcare reforms globally. More providers are moving towards remote patient monitoring, which reduces the length of hospital stays and frees up their physicians and nurses for acute cases and helps them to tackle staff shortages. Physiological sensors are commonly used in many human specialties e. g. electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, for monitoring heart signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes, for sensing the electrical activity of the brain, are the most well-known applications. Consequently {{there is a substantial}} unmet need for physiological sensors that can be simply and easily applied by the patient or primary carer, are comfortable to wear, can accurately sense parameters {{over long periods of time}} and can be connected to data recording systems using Bluetooth technology. We have developed a small, battery powered, user customizable portable monitor. This prototype is capable of recording three-axial body acceleration, skin temperature, and has up to four bio analogical front ends. Moreover, it is also able of continuous wireless transmission to any Bluetooth device including a PDA or a cellular phone. The bio-front end can use long-lasting dry electrodes or novel textile electrodes that can be embedded in clothes. The device can be powered by a standard mobile phone which has a Ni-MH 3. 6 V battery, to sustain more than seven days continuous functioning when using the Bluetooth Sniff mode to reduce TX power.

This paper details {{the results of these}} measurements and derives calibration factors for two photometric devices compared to gravimetric measures. Methods: Between April 2006 and February 2007, respirable dust and PM 2. 5 levels were measured over a 24 -h period in 490 households in a range of urban and rural settings in the Kathmandu valley of Nepal.

Wrist-worn actigraph devices have been utilized in research settings for measures of sleep for over two decades. Whether sleep measures from commercially available devices are similarly valid is unknown. We sought to determine the validity of five wearable devices: Basis Health Tracker, Misfit Shine, Fitbit Flex, Withings Pulse O 2, and a research-based actigraph, Actiwatch Spectrum. We used Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests to assess differences between devices relative to PSG and correlational analysis to assess {{the strength of the}} relationship. Data loss was greatest for Fitbit and Misfit. For all devices, we found no difference and strong correlation of total sleep time with PSG. Sleep efficiency differed from PSG for Withings, Misfit, Fitbit, and Basis, while Actiwatch mean values did not differ from that of PSG. Only mean values of sleep efficiency (time asleep/time in bed) from Actiwatch correlated with PSG, yet this correlation was weak. Light sleep time differed from PSG (nREM 1 + nREM 2) for all devices. Measures of Deep sleep time did not differ from PSG (SWS + REM) for Basis.

We consider how one such <b>device,</b> blood pressure <b>monitors,</b> comes to be integrated into everyday life. We pursue the concept of ‘care infrastructure’, drawing on recent scholarship in STS and medical sociology, to illuminate the work and range of people, things and spaces involved in selfmonitoring. Drawing on a UK study involving observations and interviews with 31 people who have used a consumer blood pressure monitor, we apply the concept beyond chronic illness, to practices involving consumer devices – and develop a critical account of its value. We conclude that the care infrastructure concept is useful to highlight the socio-material arrangements involved in selfmonitoring, showing that even for ostensibly <b>personal</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>monitoring</b> may be a shared practice that expresses care for self and for others. The concept also helps draw attention to links between different objects and spaces that are integral to the practice, beyond the device alone.

This paper details {{the results of these}} measurements and derives calibration factors for two photometric devices compared to gravimetric measures. METHODS: Between April 2006 and February 2007, respirable dust and PM(2. 5) levels were measured over a 24 -h period in 490 households in a range of urban and rural settings in the Kathmandu valley of Nepal. Sampling was carried out by photometric and gravimetric methods with the co-located gravimetric data used to derive a calibration factor for the photometric devices. RESULTS: The time-weighted average (TWA) (24 h) respirable dust levels measured by gravimetric sampler ranged from 13 to 2600 microg m(- 3) in the rural settings and 3 to 110 microg m(- 3) in the urban settings. The co-located photometric and gravimetric devices indicate that the SidePak <b>Personal</b> Aerosol <b>Monitor</b> <b>device</b> required a calibration factor of 0. 48 and 0. 51 for rural and urban data, respectively, whereas the DustTrak device required a factor of 0. 31 and 0. 35 for rural and urban settings to correct for the particle size and density of the biomass smoke. The photometric devices provide time history data on PM concentration levels and generally indicate two distinct peaks around a morning and early evening cooking time. CONCLUSIONS: Those involved in domestic work in rural Nepal are exposed to average respirable dust concentrations of approximately 1400 microg m(- 3). Converted to an 8 -h TWA, this equates to more than the current UK limit for respirable dust (4000 microg m(- 3)).

All components of the proposed detector {{can be divided into}} two main units depending on their packaging placements (i. e., the NP sampler head and the electronics mounted in a handy-format housing). For the NP sampler, a miniaturized electrophoretic aerosol sampler created in a cubical shape and an electrothermal piezoresistive resonant silicon cantilever mass sensor are employed for collecting the ENPs from the air stream to the cantilever surfaces and measuring their mass concentration, respectively.
