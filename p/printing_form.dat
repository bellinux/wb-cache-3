40|$|The {{possibility}} of the electro less deposition of chromium onto aluminum was investigated {{in order to improve}} non-printing element properties. It was determined that the electrochemical deposition of trivalent chromium was possible from alkaline solutions. The presence of chromium was confirmed by the EDAX procedure in three different laboratories. The influence of chromium on the wet ability of the nonprinting elements of the <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> was examined by drop spreading. Specimens were examined by pouring distilled water in drops onto the surface of the specimen. The picture of the drop was taken by a digital camera from two directions, in order to measure the diameter of the spreaded drop (a measuring gauge was recorded together with the drop) and contact angle. The chromium-treated samples showed increased wettability compared with the non-chromium-treated samples. Improvement of the non-printing elements was confirmed during a printing test that was performed under real printing conditions. The purity of the prints made by two types of printing forms was analyzed in two ways: based on densitometric measurements and based on statistical analysis of the scanned print. Both methods of analysis of the control prints showed that the control prints made from chromium-treated specimens were purer than the prints made from the non-chromium-treated specimens. Considering that all the conditions of making the printing forms and the printing conditions, except the electro less deposition procedure were the same, it could be concluded that the electro less deposited layer of chromium improved the printing properties of the offset <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> because of the increased wettability...|$|E

The imprint with {{a stable}} color {{characteristics}} and saturation while printing on non-absorbing substrates {{is determined by}} the reaction of ink and the substrate. To stabilize the printing process and to ensure the standardized color reproduction parameters on the substrates that have got a non-absorbing surface it is proposed to place into the offset ink formula (combining with the general components like pigment, mixture of solid resins and oligomers) the mixture of ethoxylated linear secondary alcohols and alcoxylates, which stabilizes the ink-water balance, makes the even ink transfer on all the substrate surface; and also to place the target additives to increase the printing production productivity and increase the height of the imprints pile on the delivery. For white ink of the screen printing it is proposed to combine the phenol-formaldehyde resins and resins based on the vinilidenchloryde derivatives, organic solvents, glycol derivatives, fluorescent components, and surfactants to achieve easy squeezing of the ink through the printing element high-dens <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> net, to reach an even layer of the ink on the substrate, high adhesion, exact image reproduction, and standardized parameters in CIE LAB system for typical papers. The complex methodology is developed and certified to examine the reproduction parameters depending on the components of <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> making process and the printing process: printing substrate composition, structure and characteristics, reproduction original, type of printing equipment and control systems. The mathematical models of the reproduction processes basing on the parameters of the system ?original-imprint? are developed to predict the imprints? properties and to evaluate the figures reliability and also to ensure the printing stability of the printing forms. The recommendations for mass ink production and conducting the technological reproduction process are developed. ???????????? ?????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ???????????????? ? ????????????? ?? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????????????? ?????????. ??? ???????????? ???????? ????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????????????? ?? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????? ??? ???????? ?????? ? ????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ? ?????????, ?????? ??????? ????, ???????????, ? ??????? ??????? ?? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ?????-????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ?????????????? ?? ???? ??????? ??????? ? ????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????????? ?????? ????? ????????. ??? ????? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ??????-??????????????? ? ???? ?? ?????? ??????????? ????????????????, ???????????? ?????????????, ??????????? ????????, ?????????????? ???????????, ????????????-???????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????? ?????, ???????????? ???? ?????? ?? ?????????????? ???????????, ??????? ???????, ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ?IE LAB ??? ??????? ?????? ?????. ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????????? ? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????????; ???????, ????????? ? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????????, ???????????, ???? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????????. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????-??????? ??? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ????. ??????????? ???????????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????????????? ???????? ????????????????...|$|E

40|$|Flexographic {{printing}} is {{a process}} that employs a flexible <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> and low viscous ink, often water-based. The flexible <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> is favourable for printing on rough surfaces, but the high surface tension of the ink may cause printability problems. This work has focused on the interaction between paper/paperboard coating and water-based flexographic ink, aimed at increasing the knowledge about the printing process in form of physical/chemical parameters that are important for ink setting. The effects of printing conditions on print quality, such as printing pressure and temperature, have also been in focus. The work has shown that fluids of different polarities, i. e. different dipole moments, behave differently when being absorbed by a coating layer. Due to their chemical compatibility to the coating layer, fluids with large dipole moment fill the pore matrix of the coating to a lesser extent but penetrate further into the coating than fluids with small dipole moments. On the other hand, polarity of the coating layer also affects the print. When printing on coatings with different polarities, higher print densities was obtained on the more polar substrates. As a tentative explanation, it is proposed that the ink builds different layer structures during drying depending on the coating polarity. Print gloss is related to the ink setting which, in turn, is affected by the solvent retaining capacity of the ink. Large water holding capacity allows the ink components to smoothen out before the structure is set, resulting in a higher print gloss. The rheology of inks is affected by temperature; at a higher temperature the viscosity is reduced. The reduction in ink viscosity at higher temperature has been shown to affect the print quality, e. g., print density and dot gain. It is suggested that a thicker layer is immobilised during impression due to the lower viscosity and that it is an explanation of the higher print density at a higher printing temperature. The influence of impression pressure on dot gain has been experimentally evaluated and mathematically modelled with good agreement. The dot gain is shown to respond non-linearly to the applied printing pressure. Studies based on pilot coated and printed paperboards is also reported, and it is shown that the print quality, e. g. print density, print gloss and dot gain, is largely dependent on the type of ink chosen and on the coating characteristics. Higher clay content in the coating resulted in increased dot gain and a decreased mottling...|$|E

Inkjet Printing is a {{non-contact}} printing, {{and it has}} wide adaptability, {{high speed}} and intelligence, low cost and no pollution as well, so {{it is the best}} <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> for food and drug surface printing. Drops control technology {{is the key to the}} development of ink-jet printing technology, and viscosity is also the key factor that influences the drop state. In this article, the samples which have different viscosity are got by the way of adding different levels of resin to the ink. Drop state is observed through drops observatory, the speed, tail length and volume are measured by it in order to evaluate the influence of viscosity to ink-jet drop state. The result shows that viscosity has big influence to ink-jet drop state, if the viscosity is larger, the speed of drops is smaller. The ink with high viscosity is easier to gather into a circular drop than that with small viscosity. If the viscosity more than 13. 2 mPa·s, the rupture time and tail length of the drop increases along with the increase of viscosity. When the viscosity is 10. 3 mPa·s, its rupture time is 80 µs and the ink soon gather into a circular drop under the action of cohesion, its drop state is the best...|$|E

40|$|A {{printing}} and non-printing surface {{structure of the}} offset printing forms are key factors in maintaining the conventionaloffset printing. The main characteristics of the surface are: physical and chemical structure, surface tensionand surface roughness. Surface topography {{is one of the}} critical factors which could cause the instability inthe quality performance and the durability of the printing forms. During the printing process these characteristicschange and directly influence the print. Performed investigations are {{based on the fact that}} the changes in physicalchemicalproperties of the non-printing areas as well as the changes in the surface micro structure of the printingforms directly influence the quality of the reproduction. In this paper, the behaviour of non-printing elements of athermal CTP plate developed in a fresh developer and used for a print run of 123. 000, 177. 000 and 300. 000 copieson a web offset heat-set printing press has been investigated. Investigation made in a paper showed that high depthof focus SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) can provide detailed topographical information about the surface,but cannot provide quantitative topographical information.

Also some significant examples of tasks for optimal control in different fields of application are described. Starting from this point the optimal solutions searching tasks concerning printing industry are analyzed. Basing on this the hypothetic task for optimal control in ink and water supply had been stated. While adding the typical transportation delay and the margins set by this phenomenon, the task for optimal control search had been finalized. With this the simplified point with the ink or fountain solution will travel through the complex rollers system in the printing unit that are doing the rotating, oscillating and rotating-oscillate-transporting moves. The conducted research shows the existence of ability to set the process of achieving and constant keeping the ink-water balance, while having some numbers of ink and fountain solution supply according to the number of printing and non-printing elements on the <b>printing</b> <b>form</b> in offset printing. The mathematical model for solving the task of optimal control search while setting and correcting the amounts of ink and fountain solution supply in the preprint preparation and while controlling the print-run itself was proposed. This is crucial for keeping the normalized parameters of optical density and color difference on the imprint, as the trajectory of ink of fountain solution flow change was determined for the corrections in ?increase? or ?decrease? directions. ? ?????? ???????? ?????? ??????????, ????????? ??????? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????. ????? ???????????????? ????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????????????? ???????, ? ?????????, ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????? ????????????...|$|E
