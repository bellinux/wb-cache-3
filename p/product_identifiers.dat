5000|$|Automatic bus {{configuration}} is {{a related}} issue. A given address {{may be used}} {{by a number of}} different protocol-incompatible devices in various systems, and hardly any device types can be detected at runtime.

The only reliable configuration mechanisms available to hosts involve out-of-band mechanisms such as tables provided by system firmware, which list the available devices.

50|$|The EPC is {{designed}} {{to meet the needs of}} various industries, while guaranteeing uniqueness for all EPC-compliant tags. Some of the existing GS1 identification keys http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/id_keys (such as the Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI)) already provide for unique identification of individual objects. However, the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) only identifies the product type or stock-keeping unit (SKU) rather than an individual instance of a particular product type. To ensure that an EPC always uniquely identifies an individual physical object, in the case of a GTIN, the EPC is constructed as a serialised Serialised Global Trade Item Number (SGTIN) by combining a GTIN <b>product</b> <b>identifier</b> with a unique serial number.|$|R

The framework is suited to the particular needs of such services, in particular for supporting brand protection against forgeries, as well as the sustainability of market competition by covering product quantity and quality related information. Main idea is the separation between an application service, and a brand service guarding service. With the addition of storing information in a logo or scheme by Gestalt based information hiding, entailment and control over the distributed information can be achieved.

2500|$|A {{trademark}} is said {{to become}} genericized when it begins as a distinctive <b>product</b> <b>identifier</b> but changes in meaning to become generic. [...] This typically happens when the products or services with which the trademark is associated have acquired substantial market dominance or mind share, such that the primary meaning of the genericized trademark becomes the product or service itself rather than an indication of source for the product or service. A trademark thus popularized has its legal protection at risk in some countries such as the United States and United Kingdom, as its intellectual property rights in the trademark may be lost and competitors enabled to use the genericized trademark to describe their similar products, unless the owner of an affected trademark works sufficiently to correct and prevent such broad use.|$|R
40|$|Many {{database}} columns contain string or {{numerical data}} that conforms to a pattern, such as phone numbers, dates, addresses, <b>product</b> <b>identifiers,</b> and employee ids. These patterns {{are useful in}} a number of data processing applications, including understanding what a specific field represents when field names are ambiguous, identifying outlier values, and finding similar fields across data sets. One way to express such patterns would be to learn regular expressions for each field in the database. Unfortunately, exist- ing techniques on regular expression learning are slow, taking hundreds of seconds for columns of just a few thousand values. In contrast, we develop XSystem, an efficient method to learn patterns over database columns in significantly less time. We show that these patterns can not only be built quickly, but are expressive enough to capture a number of key applications, including detecting outliers, measuring column similarity, and assigning semantic labels to columns (based on a library of regular expressions). We evaluate these applications with datasets that range from chemical databases (based on a collaboration with a pharmaceutical company), our university data warehouse, and open data from MassData. gov...|$|E
40|$|Identifiers, like metadata, serve many {{different}} purposes. They {{are of course}} very useful for searching, since they may provide a unique access key to the identified resource.

Identifiers are also essential for resolution services, systems which provide persistent linking between references and the resources themselves.

As of this writing (November 2001) there are still many open issues, and one of my aims to increase awareness of these.

40|$|The string is a stark data structure, and {{everywhere}} it is passed {{there is much}} duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information. End users often validate and reuse short, human-readable data such as phone numbers, state names, and <b>product</b> <b>identifiers,</b> each of which may appear in multiple formats. For some categories of data, it is usually clear whether a particular value is a valid instance of that category. Other categories are more ambiguous, and in these cases, values might appear to be “slightly invalid. ” As an example, although email addresses technically can be fairly long, any value longer than 40 characters {{would seem to be}} of questionable validity. In addition, for some categories, certain exceptional values might not immediately seem to be valid instances of a category yet turn out to be valid {{in the context of a}} particular task. End users sometimes accept and use slightly invalid data, though they may take extra steps to double-check the values if using invalid data might imperil the task at hand. Traditional software types are unsuitable for representing these categories of data. First, end-user programmers (and some professional programmers) find typed languages confusing and hard to use. Second, type-checking algorithms rely on the fact that a value either is or is not a valid instance of a type and therefore do not support a non-binary scale of validity. Finally, exceptional inputs are often discovered and treated as valid at runtime...|$|E
