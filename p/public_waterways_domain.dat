40|$|Given {{the primacy}} of Iowa in pork {{production}} for the U. S. and global markets, we sought to understand if the same relationship with traditional environmental justice (EJ) variables such as low income and minority populations observed in other concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) studies exists in the relationship with swine CAFO densities in Iowa. We examined the potential for spatial clustering of swine CAFOs {{in certain parts of}} the state and used spatial regression techniques to determine the relationships of high swine concentrations to these EJ variables. We found that while swine CAFOs do cluster in certain regions and watersheds of Iowa, these high densities of swine are not associated with traditional EJ populations of low income and minority race/ethnicity. Instead, the potential for environmental injustice in the negative impacts of intensive swine production require a more complex appraisal. The clustering of swine production in watersheds, the presence of antibiotics used in swine production in <b>public</b> <b>waterways,</b> the clustering of manure spills, and other findings suggest that a more literal and figurative “downstream” approach is necessary. We document the presence and location of antibiotics used in animal production in the <b>public</b> <b>waterways</b> of the state. At the same time, we suggest a more “upstream” understanding of the structural, political and economic factors that create an environmentally unjust landscape of swine production in Iowa and the Upper Midwest is also crucial. Finally, we highlight the important role of publicly accessible and high quality data in the analysis of these upstream and downstream EJ question...|$|R

50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} planned to extend from Haneda to Shimbashi or Tokyo Stations and the monorail company acquired licences {{to build the}} line to both locations. However, cost overruns on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen drained the government subsidies allocated {{to the construction of}} both lines, requiring the Tokyo Monorail to shorten its route. In addition, to save costs the monorail was constructed over <b>public</b> <b>waterways</b> instead of acquiring private land for the route. The resulting construction eliminated a number of fishing and aquatic farming operations and the affected local fishing cooperatives had their licences summarily revoked by the Tokyo metropolitan government. In particular, the Omori no nori sea field in Ota Ward, which had produced a premium brand of nori since the Edo Period, was destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Citizen Science is an ever {{increasingly}} relevant societal tool {{employed to}} educate and motivate the populace in the ways and utility of science. Collaborative efforts benefit both the laity and academia, contributing to our body of scientific knowledge while creating opportunities to effect governmental policy changes. Investigations into perceived environmental problems especially issues surrounding clean water have mobilized legions of dedicated volunteer, amateur scientists to document the water quality of local streams and rivers. This paper reviews the work of three organizations that use citizen scientists to help gather data and assess the biological and chemical health of our <b>public</b> <b>waterways.</b> The groups investigated are: the Sierra Club New York Water Sentinels, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation WAVE Program, and the Community Science Institute Red Flag and Benthic monitoring programs.

50|$|Where archaeological {{requirements}} {{apply to}} a site of proposed development, if no significant archaeological or other cultural property sites {{are found in the}} impacted area, construction may proceed as planned, often with the requirement that archaeologists are on-site providing a watching brief. If potentially significant remains are found, construction may be delayed to allow for evaluation of the site or sites found within the impacted area. This is done to determine the archaeological site's true significance. If archaeologists determine the site contains important/significant cultural remains, the adverse effects on the site must be mitigated. Site mitigation can involve avoiding the site through redesigning the development or excavating only a percentage of the site. In the U.S., these restrictions involve any federal project involving the possible disturbance of cultural resources and can also extend to state and private developments if they involve <b>public</b> <b>waterways</b> or federal funds.|$|R

30|$|Eventually, a new non-farm land economy proliferates {{with the}} {{diminishing}} acceptance of agriculture as feasible economic practices for many. It systematically leads to devaluation of rural farmland and fosters land conversion {{giving way to}} non-farm uses through speculation, fragmentation and land-sale. 12 The growing urban population triggers further thresholds stimulating the demand for residential land. 13 It triggers the higher incidence of land transaction price (refer to Table  1), often in the hand of absentee landowners from cities- the ultimate symptom of a very active land market. The disposal of agricultural land through sale becomes a lucrative and fast cash incentive. 14 Industries mushroom in the fringes due to the supply of cheap land and the new non-farm labor force. Increasing occupation of the ‘khas’ land by the landless villagers becomes visible. 15 It {{is no surprise that}} the <b>public</b> <b>waterways</b> have a consistent history of being erased from the rural fringes through real-estate speculation.|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{shortages}} {{of water in}} arid and semi-arid {{regions of the world}} and environmental policy regulations have stimulated the search for appropriate technologies capable of treating wastewater for reuse or safe discharge. Industrial effluents often carry chemical contaminants such as organics, petrochemicals, pesticides, dyes and heavy metal ions. The standard biological treatment processes commonly used for wastewater treatment are not capable of treating some of these complex organic chemicals that are found in varying quantities in the wastewaters. Another emerging problem is the increasing presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptor compounds in municipal wastewater entering into the receiving stream, for which new treatment techniques and procedures are needed to remove excreted drugs before releasing the effluent into <b>public</b> <b>waterways</b> or reuse. Radiation-initiated degradation of organics helps to transform various pollutants into less harmful substances or reduced to the levels below the permissible concentrations. Studies in several Member States (MS) have demonstrated the usefulness and efficiency of radiation technology for treatment of different organic pollutants. The lack of comparative data in pilot scale studies using radiation technique (alone or in combination with other methods) has been a major issue in furthe...|$|R
