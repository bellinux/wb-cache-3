50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> or <b>call</b> diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> that the <b>call</b> is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for <b>forwarded</b> <b>calls.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which <b>calls</b> should be <b>forwarded.</b> Once someone answers, <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect <b>call</b> <b>forwarding.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> which permit the control over <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|R

50|$|These Android phones have a menu option “Dual SIM Always on” which when {{activated}} activates <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> on the carrier’s network. This {{can be done}} manually on any phone, {{regardless of}} manufacturer, e.g. enable <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to SIM 1 when SIM 2 is disconnected. <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> must be provided by the carrier, often for a fee, subscriber will also be charged for <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> on a minute by minute basis, this depends on the subscription agreement.|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} {{there is an}} increasing problem with reaching people one wishes to speak to. People have several telephones and this makes the situation complex for the caller. Many phone calls are left unanswered. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is in this report presented {{as a solution to}} this reachability problem. The idea is to have an agent setting <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of all the users’ phones or numbers, towards the terminal where he is available. Later, when someone calls any of the users’ phones, the call will be terminated at the terminal where the user can receive it. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is compared to a number of similar services. The personal number service offers the same functionality as the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent, but the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent does not force the subscriber to change phone number and it also admits a simple call screening. We have implemented a prototype of the <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent that can set <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of regular Public Service Telephony Network terminals and the Internet telephones in Ellemtel’s IP-phone system...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the influence of a}} <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> service on the traffic process in modern telecommunication networks. We analyse in detail only the case when the called user is busy. It is proved that <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> not only increases utilization of servers and the percent of successful calls but it also increases the call loss. On the simple example, we showed that this call loss increase is greater in the case of local (internal) and incoming calls, but smaller in the case of outgoing calls. The reason for such behaviour is in the role of <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function in the case of internal and incoming traffic. In that situation <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function decreases the effect of limited number of users on the decrease of offered traffic, comparing to the case of internal and incoming traffic without <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> (Engset traffic model). This statement is illustrated by comparative graphics of traffic loss without <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> function, and with this function when considering, separately, internal, incoming, and outgoing traffic.

50|$|When a {{subscriber}} is roaming internationally and a <b>call</b> is <b>forwarded</b> {{to his or}} {{her voice}} mail, such as when his or her phone is off, busy, or not answered, he or she may actually be charged for two simultaneous international phone calls—the first to get from the GMSC to the VMSC and the second to get from the VMSC to the <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> Busy or <b>Call</b> <b>Forward</b> No Reply number (typically the voice mailbox) in the subscriber's country. However, some networks' GMSCs connect unanswered calls directly, keeping the voice signal entirely within the home country and thus avoiding the double charge.|$|R

50|$|Some {{businesses}} {{find that}} the human touch can improve contact, thus sales, but traditional wired answering services are expensive, so they have their <b>calls</b> <b>forwarded</b> to a <b>call</b> center, so the client can reach an operator instead of an answering machine or voice mail. Before the availability of <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> commercial answering services needed to physically connect to every line for which they provided after-hours response; this required their offices be located near the local central exchange and be fed by a huge multi-pair trunk in which a separate pair of wires existed for each client subscriber. With <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> there is no physical connection to the client's main telephone service, which is merely call-forwarded to the answering service (usually on a direct inward dial number) {{at the end of}} the business day.|$|R
