The man was autistic, and the police failure to handle such a case sparked controversy. According to the police, the suspect made a written confession of an assault that contradicted severely with statements obtained whilst interviewed with family members. A nursing home later offered the suspect an alibi, corroborated with video evidence, that the man {{could not have been}} at the alleged crime scene. Civil rights activists condemned the incident which traumatised a vulnerable individual, and criticised the police procedures including not <b>proposing</b> <b>legal</b> <b>representation,</b> lengthy detention, an methods for obtaining a bogus confession. The police chief expressed [...] "regret" [...] but refused to make an apology. Also in May 2015, police procedures for conducting identity parades attracted controversy when suspects in an assault case on television reporters were allowed to wear shower caps and face masks during an identity parade, ostensibly to cover distinctive features, leading to the police abandoning the case due to insufficient evidence. The police stance was confirmed by the new Chief Commissioner.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. An {{employee}} is usually entitled to representation in a disciplinary hearing. The question arises whether this <b>representation</b> includes <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> {{or whether it}} is limited to representation by union representatives or a fellow employee? An employee's right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> will in most cases be determined by a collective agreement, the employment contract or a disciplinary code. Over the years the Courts have indicated that they are not prepared to grant an absolute right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in disciplinary enquiries. Yet in some cases the courts found <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> to be a sine qua non for a fair hearing and an intrinsic part of natural justice. It seems that the conclusion that can be drawn from this research is that <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> might soon become a requirement for a fair disciplinary hearing in serious and complex matters. This research looks at numerous decisions both in die public and private sector before and after 1994. The right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> is also discussed in the light of a fair hearing. The various advantages and disadvantages of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> are briefly examined. It is argued that all employees should be granted <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in complex and serious matters where the {{employee is}} likely to be dismissed. It is thus said that all presiding officers should be granted a discretion to allow <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in serious and complex matters. Master...|$|R

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the success of}} litigants in tax cases in England and Wales between 1996 and 2010. I explore the effect upon success of having better-ranked <b>legal</b> <b>representation,</b> according to rankings of barristers published by Chambers. I find that, {{for a variety of}} model specifications, there is no significant positive effect of having better-ranked <b>legal</b> <b>representation.</b> After conducting a sensitivity analysis, I conclude that better-ranked <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> might {{have a positive effect on}} litigation outcomes, but only if better-ranked lawyers receive cases that are substantially more difficult to win. However, if better-ranked lawyers receive substantially more difficult cases, this suggests consumers of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> are sophisticated enough to dispense with legal rankings...|$|R

40|$|Objective basing on the {{research}} {{and analysis of the}} legislation historical legal sources and other materials to study the process of formation and development of the institution of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in Russia before 1917. 	Methods the theoretical basis of research is the works of Russian scientists on various aspects of formation development and functioning of the institution of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in Russia from ancient times till 1917. The methodological basis of {{the research}} is general scientific methods historical formallogical system and general logical methods analysis synthesis induction and deduction synthesis analogy abstraction. Historicallegal formallegal logicallegal comparative legal methods were applied in the study. The author used the retrospective approach {{to the study of the}} issues of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in Russia. 	Results basing on analysis of normative legal acts regulating relations in the sphere of judicial representation and various doctrinal sources the author has examined the process of the formation and development of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution in Russia before 1917 raised the question of providing legal assistance in prerevolutionary Russia. An analogy is drawn between the prerevolutionary legal regulation of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution and the modern legislation regulating this legal institution. The conclusion is made about the inadequacy of prerevolutionary legislation regulating relations in the sphere of judicial representation as well as the modern legal regulation of relations in this sphere. It is established that the judicial reform of 1864 improved regulation in this sphere but still did not solve all the problems in this area. 	The relevance of the study is due to the topicality and the constitutional importance of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> for the entire Russian society the need to examine the origins of this legal phenomenon as well as the fact that the institution of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> has a constitutionalguaranteeing value not only in relation to the judicial protection of individual rights and freedoms of a person and citizen but also from the point of view of ensuring the effective exercise of justice. In this respect the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution is a means of guaranteeing the constitutional principles of justice and a means of providing the adversarial character of the court trial. 	Scientific novelty the article considers the origin and development of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution in Russia the development of this institution before 1917. The conclusion is made about the imperfection of the 1864 judicial reform in terms of reforming the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution. For the first time using retrospective approach a parallel is drawn between the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution that existed in Russia before 1917 and the modern judicial representation. 	Practical significance the main provisions and conclusions of the article can be used in research and teaching in addressing issues about the formation and development of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution in Russia. 	nbs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Legal</b> <b>representation</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in criminal sentencing decisions. China has recently stipulated a mandatory <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> clause for all offenders facing capital charges in its Criminal Procedural Law (1996). This study uses data generated from criminal court case documents involving three serious violent crimes: murder, intentional assault, and robbery. All these crimes carry a maximum of sentence of death. The study examines whether and under what conditions <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> has an effect on criminal sentencing decisions in China. While the overall multi-regression model did not find that having a <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> significantly reduces the criminal sentence, a further analysis of the types of criminal defense reveals that sentencing decisions are significantly correlated with the type of defense, and in particular, the court’s appraisal of the defense. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|LLM (Labour Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This study {{focuses on}} the impact of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in general as well as on CCMA {{proceedings}} involving unfair dismissals relating to conduction on capacity. The study also touches on the common law position before the enactment of Labour Relations Act 28 of 1956 and Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995. Rule 25 of CCMA rules which makes provision that <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> at CCMA arbitration proceedings relating to fairness of dismissal and party has alleged that the reason for dismissal relates to the employees conduct on capacity, the party is not entitled to be represented by a legal practitioner. The dissertation analyses the effect of this provision on the Constitutional rights to <b>legal</b> <b>representations</b> well as rights relating to fair procedure. Refusal of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in certain instances is justified in the right of legislative requirements on obligation placed particularly on the arbitrator legislative measures which, justifies refusal of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> at CCMA that cannot be imposed without giving consideration to the Constitution. The study will highlight the South African case on position with regards to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> at CCMA. A literature study will be done using current and researched sources such as textbooks, law journals, and legislation, case law, conferences papers and internet sources. Different rights will be weighed up through literature sources. Master...|$|R

40|$|THRE RIGHT TO <b>LEGAL</b> <b>REPRESENTATION</b> DURING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGSThe {{question}} {{whether a person}} is entitled to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> is normally posed during disciplinary proceedings, but is also relevant to other types of administrative proceedings. No absolute right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> exists beyond a court of law. The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 has confirmed the common law position, to wit that an administrative organ has a discretion to allow <b>legal</b> <b>representation,</b> should the circumstances warrant it. This discretion should exercised properly, as held in Hamata v Chairperson, Peninsula Technikon Internal Disciplinary Committee 2002 5 SA 449 (SCA). The submission is that this discretion cannot be excluded either by means of contract or statute, should the Act apply. The definition of administrative action in the Act does not include proceedings before a domestic tribunal and the possibility exists that the discretion to consider allowing <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> can be contractually excluded. It is argued that disciplinary proceedings affecting an employee should be distinguished from proceedings where a non-employee is involved. Employees should enjoy protection similar to that afforded by the Act. Article in Afrikaan...|$|R

40|$|Fair Work Australia is the Commonwealth Government's {{proposed}} 'one-stop shop' {{for employment}} relations matters. An {{important feature of}} FWA is its unfair dismissal jurisdiction, which is supposedly designed to deliver a simpler, faster and less costly process by restricting <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> of parties before FWA and instituting a mixed 'inquisitorial-adversarial' model of dispute resolution. This study examines whether restricting <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> achieves {{the primary goal of}} Labor's substantive workplace relations reforms - fairness - by reference to three key elements: legal truth, costs and efficiency. Following this examination, the article finds that imposing further restrictions on <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> undermines fairness because it creates an imbalance between costs, legal truth and efficiency. The article recommends that, subject to minor amendments aimed at improving the unfair dismissal process, the present statutory treatment of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> should remain.

40|$|This Article {{suggests}} that {{our failure to}} focus on the possible need for representation in mediation and arbitration is fundamentally misguided. Although <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> is no doubt more important in some contexts than others, it is wrong to make the binary assumption that <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> is always more important in litigation than in ADR processes; <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> may often be critically important in ADR processes. Because many disputes will be finally resolved in ADR and because <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> can be equally or even more important in ADR than in litigation, we need to focus simultaneously on improving representation in both ADR and litigation. These insights need to be considered by courts regulating ADR processes and examining right-to-counsel arguments in those processes, by policymakers examining how access to counsel can be improved, and by attorneys and legal services organizations determining how to allocate their scarce resources...|$|R

Should lawyers of color embrace or resist race’s influence on intra-race <b>legal</b> <b>representation?</b> How do lawyers balance their desire to remain representative of their race with their responsibility to their clients? This Article also scrutinizes the role of the lawyer of color in intra-race <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> by examining questions that are under-reviewed, such as: Do lawyers of color engage in the same explicit and implicit biases against their clients of color that lawyers of color similarly suffer? Do racial stereotypes tempt the lawyer to be more sympathetic towards, and understanding of, their same-race clients, or does it cause the lawyer to view the same-race client as an ‘other’? For lawyers of color and clients of color who seek same-race <b>legal</b> <b>representation,</b> this Article explores a difficult question— Is the lawyer of color representative enough of the race to be a representative for the client, particularly when the lawyer of color and the client of color live in different socio-economic environments?
