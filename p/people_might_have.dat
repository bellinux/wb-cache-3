The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E
5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E

25|$|In December 1672, King Charles XI came to age. Despite what <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> anticipated, De la Gardie now became mightier {{than ever}} before. The young and inexperienced king {{seems to have}} been glad to take the advice of his Lord High Chancellor De la Gardie, who tried to {{increase}} the king's power in order to increase his own. However, from 1675, his influence decreased. That year, bound by the treaty with France, Sweden entered the Franco-Dutch War by invading Brandenburg. Although being numerically superior, the Swedish forces lost at Fehrbellin, which led to Denmark being encouraged to attack Sweden. Thus, the Scanian War was initiated. In connection with King Charles's coronation the same year, De la Gardie was accused of high treason, an accusation that soon was judged as unjustified.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the Roman conquest on these people is uncertain. One {{hypothesis}} {{was that they were}} effectively eliminated. An important clue to the character of Dacian casualties is offered by the ancient sources Eutropius and Crito. Both speak about men when they describe the losses suffered by the Dacians in the wars. This suggests that both refer to losses due to fighting, not due to a process of extermination of the whole population. A strong component of the Dacian army, including the Celtic Bastarnae and the Germans, had withdrawn rather than submit to Trajan. Some scenes on Trajan's Column represent acts of obedience of the Dacian population, and others show the refugee Dacians returning to their own places. Dacians trying to buy amnesty are depicted on Trajan's Column (one offers to Trajan a tray of three gold ingots). Alternatively, a substantial number may have survived in the province, although were probably outnumbered by the Romanised immigrants. Cultural life in Dacia became very mixed and decidedly cosmopolitan because of the colonial communities. The Dacians retained their names and their own ways {{in the midst of the}} newcomers, and the region continued to exhibit Dacian characteristics. The Dacians who survived the war are attested as revolting against the Roman domination in Dacia at least twice, in the period of time right after the Dacian Wars, and in a more determined manner in 117 AD. In 158 AD, they revolted again, and were put down by M. Statius Priscus. Some Dacians were apparently expelled from the occupied zone at the end of each of the two Dacian Wars, or otherwise emigrated. It is uncertain where these refugees settled. Some of these <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> mingled with the existing ethnic Dacian tribes beyond the Carpathians (the Costoboci and Carpi).|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the first}} years of her career, Carey's musical styles mainly {{involved}} pop influenced R. Additionally, her image was of a reserved and modestly dressed female, or as Carey's later described it [...] "the 90s version of Mary Poppins". As the 1990s wore on, Carey began featuring rappers on remixes, and began infusing hip-hop into her musical palette. As her music changed, so too did her image, which became more sexual, and aimed at younger audiences than the more contemporary appeal of her earlier works. According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was used not only as a vehicle for listeners to become more in-tune with Carey's personal struggles, but also as a means to [...] "re-capture" [...] her audience throughout the earlier stages of her career. A contemporary and pop ballad, he felt the song would find [...] "much embrace" [...] from her older fans, while her audience that grew accustomed to her hip-hop flavored music would feel [...] "lost and abandoned". In an interview with MTV News, the song's co-producer Jimmy Jam described why Carey chose to release it as the lead single: [...] "I think 'Through the Rain' {{is a great way to}} start the record, because it is emotional and it kind of speaks directly to the questions <b>people</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> about the last year of her life. It's a good idea to get that out of the way and move on to happy, less emotional songs." ...|$|E
