5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the <b>picture</b> <b>frame,</b> a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

5000|$|In the <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> industry, {{a fillet}} (also {{referred}} to as a slip) is a small piece of moulding which fits inside a larger frame or, typically, underneath or in between matting, used for decorative purposes. The <b>picture</b> <b>framing</b> term is probably related to, though not necessarily derived from, the engineering term, which it is frequently pronounced similarly to; however, unlike the use of fillets in mechanical engineering, the use of [...] "fillets" [...] in <b>picture</b> <b>frames</b> is wholly decorative.|$|R

25|$|Ellis {{desired to}} make artistic compositions, which {{generally}} represented with bold close-up form. The colorful and vivid flora painted by her {{were not in}} the conventional way but placed in the varies native habitats, extending beyond the <b>picture</b> <b>frame.</b> It is said that her composition was influenced by the Thornton’s Temple of Flora. Ellis sometimes added insects and even snakes to her artworks, like some of Thornton’s artists, in order to achieve the dramatic effect.|$|E
25|$|When Homer {{puts his}} daycare permit in the <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> Bart and Lisa gave him {{was based on}} a real life {{experience}} of former writer Dana Gould in which he gave his parents a newspaper article about him winning a Boston comedy competition and later found out that it was replaced by Larry Bird dunking butterfingers. The third act did not initially include a police car chase and it was placed in after the table read. The scratches in Homer's day-care video were added to the animation in post-production.|$|E
25|$|The Throne Room was {{originally}} {{described as a}} bridal chambers of the Rezzonico family; today it is of all the reconstructed chambers perhaps the most remarkable, consisting chiefly of articles pertaining to the Venetian patrician family of Barbarigo. One {{of the most remarkable}} items in the room after the ceiling, is a <b>picture</b> <b>frame.</b> This ornate gilt frame celebrates with putti, shields and other allegories the glories of the illustrious family of Barbarigo. It {{was originally}} given to Pietro Barbarigo whose portrait it surrounds. The room is named for the ornate gilt chair or throne by rococo sculptor Antonio Corradini. Two very similar chairs were included in the sale at Mentmore Towers in the 1970s, rather than serving as the thrones of monarchs, they were often used by high-ranking priests in the many churches of the city during the interminable masses.|$|E

25|$|Windows Explorer also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the play with the {{illusion}} of space in the painting {{can be seen in}} the young man at the top of the ladder holding the nails withdrawn from Christ's body. Campbell points out that this servant behind the cross appears to have caught his sleeve in the wooden tracery depicted at the top of the painting. The head of one of the bloody nails that he holds is in front of the fictional wooden <b>picture</b> <b>frame,</b> though the point of the other nail is behind the tracery. Campbell argues that, in order to prevent these spatial distortion from becoming too obvious, Rogier took pains to conceal the principal pictorial junctions in the picture. For example, the ladder is in an impossible perspective: its top is behind the cross while its foot appears to be in front of the cross. To conceal the points at which the Cross and the ladder meet the landscape, Rogier has greatly lengthened the Virgin's left leg, so that her left foot and mantle cover the base of the Cross and one upright of the ladder.|$|E
25|$|The actor {{followed}} The Godfather with Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris opposite Maria Schneider, but Brando's highly noted performance {{threatened to}} be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual {{content of the}} film. Brando portrays a recent American widower named Paul, who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young, betrothed Parisian woman named Jeanne. As with previous films, Brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes; instead, he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference, leaving Bertolucci {{with the problem of}} keeping them out of the <b>picture</b> <b>frame.</b> The film features several intense, graphic scenes involving Brando, including Paul anally raping Jeanne using butter as a lubricant and Paul's angry, emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife. The controversial movie was a hit, however, and Brando made the list of Top Ten Box Office Stars for the last time. The voting membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences again nominated Brando for Best Actor, his seventh nomination. Although Brando won the 1973 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the actor did not appear at the ceremony or send a representative to pick up the award if he won.|$|E

25|$|In Italy, {{the birthplace}} of the Renaissance, there is much fine work of the 16th century. A very {{important}} school of design was promoted by Raphael, whose patterns were used or adapted by a large number of craftsmen. The shutters of Raphaels Stanze in the Vatican, and the choir stalls in the church of St Pietro de Cassinesi at Perugia, are among the most beautiful examples of this style of carving. The work is in slight relief, and carved in walnut with those graceful patterns which Raphael developed out of the newly discovered remains of ancient Roman wall painting from the palace of Nero and other places. In the Victoria and Albert Museum are many examples of Italian work: the door from a convent near Parma, with its three prominent masks and heavy gadroon moulds; a <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> with a charming acanthus border and, egg and tongue moulds on either side; and various marriage chests in walnut covered with very elaborate schemes of carving. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Spanish, or for that matter South of France work, from Italian, so much alike is the character. The Spaniards yield to none in good workmanship. Some Spanish panels of typical Italian design are in the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as cabinets of the purest Renaissance order. There is a wonderful Portuguese coffer (17th century) in this section. The top is deeply carved in little compartments with scenes from the life of Our Lord.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Cecilia Dribelle (Carol MacReady) - The extravagantly dressed businesswoman {{from whom}} Bodger rents his flat in Series 6 and 7. She has a {{distinct}} dislike for animals (apart from cats) and forbids her tenants from keeping pets, resulting in Bodger having to constantly hide Badger whenever she visits. She dislikes Bodger intensely and tries everything she can think of to evict him, she also expressed a dislike for pop music in one episode. She is fond of cakes and biscuits, and likes to make lots of money from silly ideas. She is nicknamed 'Mrs Dribble' and 'Dribbly Bibbly' by Badger. She drives around {{in a car with}} the registration plate 'DRIB 1' and has a cat called Fluffykins. In her early episodes she is made aware of Badger's presence by her sidekick, Elton, but never actually sees him as Elton's plans to catch Badger always fail. She eventually decides that Elton is imagining Badger. However, she has spotted Badger herself on several occasions - in one episode she saw Badger when she got knocked out, mistakenly thinking that Badger was her pet cat Fluffykins. Another was when Fluffykins had disappeared and Badger was inside the cat box pretending to be Fluffykins. Another time was when Badger was hiding behind a <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> which Mrs Dribelle thought was a picture of a Badger. After spending the majority of Series 6 trying to find ways to evict Bodger, Mrs Dribelle later employs him as her handyman in Series 7. Later on she allowed her niece, Vicky, to stay in the first floor flat above Bodger's after she evicted Alec Smart. After Vicky left to go touring with a band, Mrs Dribelle temporarily moved into the vacant flat while her house was being decorated.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] {{live for}} the first time at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York in 2001. The performance was also part of the setlist for their World Tour. Beyoncé also famously performed the song at the 2004 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004, where it won in the category of Best Female R Vocal Performance. Beyoncé was wearing a long, glittery turquoise and silver dress. She positioned herself between the edges of a giant <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> and sung [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] as if she were in a living oil painting. She was joined by seventeen backup singers, musicians and dancers. At the end, she held out her hand and a dove landed in her outstretched palm.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Olivia called the single an [...] "empowering women's song" [...] for inspiring women to leave unfulfilling relationships. She said she wrote it: [...] "for {{all the people who}} don't know how to tell the other person to 'bounce' [...] ". An article in Vibe magazine noted lyrics, like: [...] "I can't take this shit no more / <b>Picture</b> <b>frame</b> broken daddy 'cause I can't trust you / I'm ridin' high now / So nigga fuck you", as creating an impression of Olivia as a [...] "potty-mouth".

That struck me as tonight's type of episode." [...] Though, Zulkey felt that the zombies scene [...] "didn't really work" [...] except for when Liz smashed a <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> over Pete Hornberger's (Scott Adsit) head. She said that the [...] "funniest part" [...] from [...] "Flu Shot" [...] was the look on Jack and Elisa's faces [...] "as the animals from The Lion King walked through the audience."

She screams in terror and attempts to flee. Leland chases Maddy up the stairs, and drags her to the living room. He strangles and punches her, then taunts and chases her around the living room. He corners her and punches her in the face until she is catatonic. He dances with and cries over her limp body, calling her [...] "Laura," [...] while Bob kisses her.

500|$|Reportedly, {{the writers}} {{for the show}} wanted Michael to [...] "give a cool gift that the show's {{co-workers}} would later resent". They eventually {{decided that he would}} buy an iPod for Ryan. Apple Inc. received over four minutes of publicity for the device, {{despite the fact that the}} company did not pay for the placement. The poster that Toby gives to Angela was created by one of the show's prop workers. Several of the series' crew members brought in their own children for the picture, an act that Kate Flannery jokingly called [...] "so great". Schur revealed in the commentary for the episode that Stanley bought Kelly her nameplate, Dwight's paintballs were intended for Phyllis, Meredith bought Dwight shot glasses, Ryan got Toby a book of short stories, Angela purchased Stanley a <b>picture</b> <b>frame,</b> and Pam drew Meredith a picture of the office. Pam's picture was initially drawn by an on-staff artist. However, the producers felt that he was not able to capture Pam's [...] "feminine side" [...] and so several young female artists were asked to draw the building. One was eventually chosen, and the artists returned to draw Pam's doodles in the later episode [...] "Boys and Girls".|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns to}} Dunder Mifflin with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. Andy enlists Robert California (James Spader) to give Andy his job back, which fails. Nellie further asserts her {{authority}} when she orders Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) to dock Andy's paycheck twice, and she complies. This causes Andy to have sexual performance difficulties with Erin. Erin asks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{if he had}} similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. After Dwight tells Nellie that she has affected Andy's sex life, she begins to feel guilty. She holds a meeting where the office workers share {{advice on how to}} sexually perform. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, followed by Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his desk chair at Robert, throwing Nellie's <b>picture</b> <b>frame</b> to the ground, and finally punching his hand through the wall (echoing his behavior in the third season episode [...] "The Return"). When Robert then chooses Nellie as regional manager, Andy refuses to accept a demotion by saying [...] "no" [...] too many times in a calm way, and a surprised Robert fires him. As a result, Andy regains his sense of self-confidence and is once again able to perform.|$|E
500|$|The show {{continued}} {{with a video}} interlude featuring Marilyn Manson's cover of [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", showing Spears in a classically decadent party-setting, in which everyone except her was wearing masks. A distorted voice welcomed spectators to the third act and Spears appeared onstage to perform [...] "Freakshow" [...] and [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)". A video spoofing late-night chat lines featuring [...] "Britney's Hotline" [...] played, while clowns took a person from the audience and goofed around with them. Spears returned to perform [...] "Breathe on Me", dancing on a giant <b>picture</b> <b>frame,</b> and [...] "Touch of My Hand", in which she sported a blindfold while being lifted on the air sitting in the backs of two aerialists. In the fourth section, there was a band interlude, and Spears appeared on stage to perform [...] "Do Somethin'", with a gun that shot sparks in her hand. This {{was followed by a}} remix of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", in which she was raised on a platform as a ring of fire started below her. In the [...] "Heartbeat" [...] interlude, the dancers showcased their individual moves. Spears performed [...] "Toxic" [...] with moving jungle gyms and surrounded by green sci-fi lightning effects. The act ended with Spears and her dancers performing a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time". After a brief pause, the encore began with the [...] "Break the Ice" [...] video interlude, which included various clips of Spears's music videos. Spears returned for a performance of [...] "Womanizer" [...] dressed as a policewoman. Spears and the dancers bowed to each side of the arena and left with [...] "Circus" [...] playing in the background. Some changes were made to the setlist throughout the tour. During opening night in New Orleans, Spears was supposed to perform a cover of Duffy's [...] "I'm Scared" [...] after [...] "Everytime". However, the lyric sheet went missing onstage and she started performing from below the stage, leaving two backup singers in the main stage. It was later dropped from the show. [...] "Mannequin" [...] was added on the second Paris date and performed after [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)", with a brief lightshow introduction. The song was performed until July 26, 2009.
