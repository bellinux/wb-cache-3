Their work built on earlier papers by John Baumgardner and Russell Humphreys in 1986. Baumgardner proposed a model of mantel convection that allows for runaway subduction and Humphrey associated mantle convection with rapid magnetic reversals in earth history. Baumgardner's proposal holds that the rapid plunge of former oceanic plates into the mantle (caused by an unknown trigger-mechanism) increased local mantle pressures {{to the point that}} its viscosity dropped several magnitudes according to known properties of mantle silicates. [...] Once initiated, sinking plates caused the spread of low viscosity throughout the mantle resulting in runaway mantle-convection and catastrophic tectonic motion which dragged continents {{across the surface of the}} earth. Once the former ocean plates, which are thought to be denser than the mantle, reached the bottom of the mantle an equilibrium resulted. [...] Pressures dropped, viscosity increased, runaway mantle-convection stopped, leaving the surface of the earth rearranged.

50|$|One <b>preliminary</b> <b>model</b> as to {{how this}} would occur {{involves}} a positive feedback loop. When activated, microglia will secrete proteases, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species. The cytokines may induce neighboring cells to synthesize amyloid precursor protein. The proteases then possibly could cause the cleaving required to turn precursor molecules into the beta amyloid that characterizes the disease. Then, the oxygen species encourage the aggregation of beta amyloid in order to form plaques. The growing size of these plaques then in turn triggers the action of even more microglia, which then secrete more cytokines, proteases, and oxygen species, thus amplifying the neurodegeneration.|$|E

By the late 1980s, the generally accepted model was a three-axis object with major albedo or topographical features.|$|E

[...] The modification by kethoxal prevents single stranded guanine nucleotides to become modified, {{so that when}} reverse transcriptase reaches the modified guanine it falls off resulting in a band.

These stayed in production for some forty years and were imitated by other factories in France and abroad, being used not just as wall hangings but for chair covers and other domestic purposes. Furniture craftsmen in France also used the fables as themes and took these {{with them when they}} emigrated. Among them was Martin Jugiez (d.1815), who had a workshop in the American city of Philadelphia where the still surviving Fox and Grapes chest of drawers was produced.The Sèvres porcelain works used the fables on their china as well as reproducing Pierre's Julien's statue from a <b>preliminary</b> <b>model</b> in 1784, even before the finished product was exhibited. Another domestic use for the fable was as an architectural medallion on the outside of mansions, of which there is still an example dating from the turn of the 19th century on the Avenue Felix Fauré in Paris. A medallion of another kind, cast in bronze by Jean Vernon (1897-1975), was produced as part of his renowned series based on the fables in the 1930s. That of [...] "The Fox and the Grapes" [...] features two foxes scrambling up a trellis with what looks like more success than La Fontaine's creation.|$|E

5000|$|Eero Saarinen (1910-1961) {{was the son}} of Eliel Saarinen, {{the most}} famous Finnish {{architect}} of the Art Nouveau period, who emigrated to the United States in 1923, when Eero was thirteen. He studied art and sculpture at the academy where his father taught, and then at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière Academy in Paris before studying architecture at Yale University. His architectural designs were more like enormous pieces of sculpture than traditional modern buildings; he broke away from the elegant boxes inspired by Mies van der Rohe and used instead sweeping curves and parabolas, like the wings of birds. In 1948 he conceived the idea of a monument in St. Louis, Missouri {{in the form of a}} parabolic arch 192 meters high, made of stainless steel (1948). He then designed the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan (1949-55), a glass modernist box in the style of Mies van der Rohe, followed by the IBM Research Center in Yorktown, Virginia (1957-61). His next works were a major departure in style; he produced a particularly striking sculptural design for the Ingalls Rink in New Haven, Connecticut (1956-59, an ice skiing rink with a parabolic roof suspended from cables, which served as a <b>preliminary</b> <b>model</b> for next and most famous work, the TWA Terminal at JFK airport in New York (1956-1962). His declared intention was to design a building that was distinctive and memorable, and also one that would capture the particular excitement of passengers before a journey. The structure is separated into four white concrete parabolic vaults, which together resemble a bird on the ground perched for flight. Each of the four curving roof vaults has two sides attached to columns in a Y form just outside the structure. One of the angles of each shell is lightly raised, and the other is attached to the center of the structure. The roof is connected with the ground by curtain walls of glass. All of the details inside the building, including the benches, counters, escalators and clocks, were designed in the same style.|$|E
