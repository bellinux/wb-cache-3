40|$|A {{state of}} the art report. Topics {{discussed}} include rationale for use of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps,</b> history of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps,</b> description of various types of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> (including reciprocating, diaphragm, rotary, helical rotary, bucket, chain, windlass, and various traditional low lift, slowmoving water lifting devices used since ancient times). The principles of operation; nomenclature; hydraulic, struct:lral, and energy analysis; and the design of each component of reciprocating <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> are described with examples. Also administration of <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> programmes with emphasis on installation and maintenance practices. Recent handpump research and indigenous pumps manufactured with plastic, steel, wood, and bamboo components. A final chapter described manufacture of pumps in foundries, machine shops, and using intermediate technology. Key words: <b>Hand</b> <b>pumps,</b> rural water supply, developing countries, reciprocating <b>pumps,</b> appropriate technology, <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> design, <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> maintenance, <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> manufacture, <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> research and development...|$|R

50|$|VLOM, meaning Village Level Operation and Maintenance, {{is a term}} {{first used}} during the UNDP and World Bank Rural Water Supply <b>Hand</b> <b>Pumps</b> Project. This project lasted from 1981 to 1991, and studied the {{availability}} and maintenance of <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> systems. 40 kinds of <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> were analyzed in laboratories, {{and the performance of}} 2700 <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> was analyzed in the field. The study established that centralized maintenance structure was a cause of many problems in <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> programs, and that maintenance at the village level is best.|$|R

50|$|Deep well <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} for high lifts of more than 15 m. The weight of the column of water is too great to be lifted {{directly}} and some form of mechanical advantage system such as a lever or flywheel is used.High lift pumps need to be stronger and sturdier {{to cope with the}} extra stresses. The installation, maintenance and repair of deep well <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> is more complicated than with other <b>hand</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{manually}} operated pumps; they use human power and mechanical advantage to move fluids or air {{from one place}} to another. They are widely used in {{every country in the world}} for a variety of industrial, marine, irrigation and leisure activities. There are many different types of <b>hand</b> <b>pump</b> available, mainly operating on a piston, diaphragm or rotary vane principle with a check valve on the entry and exit ports to the chamber operating in opposing directions. Most <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> have plungers or reciprocating pistons, and are positive displacement.|$|R

2500|$|Modern shanties {{were used}} to {{accompany}} work at the patent windlass, {{which was designed to}} raise anchor and was operated by the see-saw like action of <b>pumping</b> <b>hand</b> brakes. The up and down motion of the brake levers lent the action a binary form that was well-suited by many of the same songs used as halyard shanties. And yet, the continuous nature of the task also meant grand choruses were possible. So while halyard shanties and capstan shanties tended to be exclusive of one another, windlass shanties sometimes shared repertoire with each of those other types.

50|$|For example, {{in a rural}} sub-Saharan {{community}} it may not {{be appropriate}} to provide a chlorinated and pumped water system because it cannot be maintained or controlled adequately - simple <b>hand</b> <b>pumps</b> may be better; while in a big city in the same country it would be inappropriate to provide water with <b>hand</b> <b>pumps,</b> and the chlorinated system would be the correct response.|$|R
50|$|However, villagers did {{not stop}} using {{traditional}} means of gathering water during this project. This was especially true when rain provided villagers with shallow water sources. These shallow wells were often easier to access than the wells with <b>hand</b> <b>pumps.</b> When faced with the option of using near surface water or traveling to the <b>hand</b> <b>pumps,</b> many villagers chose the former.|$|R
