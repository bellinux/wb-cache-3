25|$|In 2007, {{the site}} of Andover Airfield {{became the focus of}} local {{controversy}} when developers submitted a <b>planning</b> <b>proposal</b> to build a large distribution centre for the Tesco supermarket company.

The City council initially invited the <b>planning</b> <b>proposal</b> amid suggestions that the club might move to a site in Gateshead, a 75,000-seat stadium next to Gateshead International Stadium, but it led to political debate and opposition. A pressure group [...] "No Business on the Moor" [...] eventually gathered a 36,000-petition signature, equal to the then-current stadium capacity. Opposition also came from a conservation group Friends of Leazes Park led by Dolly Potter. The club proposed to mitigate {{the loss of the}} moor land with proposals for a land trade-off with landscaping of land freed up by scaling down of the existing stadium restoring the views of the historic park from Leazes Terrace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Autonomous {{planning}} {{agents that}} {{share a common}} goal {{should be able to}} propose, justify and share information about plans. To reach an agreement on the best plan, strategies for persuasion and negotiation can be used by agents in order to share their beliefs about the world and resolve conflicts between the agents.
