40|$|It {{is nearly}} axiomatic, that {{to take the}} {{greatest}} advantage of the useful features available in a development system, and to avoid the negative interactions of those features, requires the exercise of a design methodology which constrains their use. A major design support feature of the Ada language is abstraction: for data, functions processes, resources, and system elements in general. Atomic abstract types can be created in packages defining those <b>private</b> <b>types</b> {{and all of the}} overloaded operators, functions, and hidden data required for their use in an application. Generically structured abstract types can be created in generic packages defining those structured <b>private</b> <b>types,</b> as buildups from the user-defined data types which are input as parameters. A study is made of the design constraints required for software incorporating either atomic or generically structured abstract types, if the integration of software components based on them is to be subsequently performed. The impact of these techniques on the reusability of software and the creation of project-specific software support environments is also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} appearing libraries in Rome {{were of the}} <b>private</b> <b>type</b> {{and were}} most often procured as spoils in times of war. For example, when the Roman general Aemilius defeated the Macedonian king Perseus in 168 BC the only plunder he wished to possess was the king's private library. Likewise, in 86 BC, Roman general Sulla appropriated the library of the infamous Greek bibliophile and kleptobibliophile Apellicon of Teos. Finally; around 73 BC, Lucullus removed and brought back to Rome the private library of King Mithridates VI of the Pontus region.Nearly every house of nobility had a library and virtually every one was split into two rooms: one for Latin texts and one for Greek texts. Rome {{may very well have}} been the birthplace of specialized libraries, with evidence of early medical and legal libraries. In Rome one can see the beginnings of book preservation. One author proposed that a library is better suited if it meets the rising sun in the east {{in order to ensure that}} it does not succumb to bookworms and decomposition. Some examples of Roman-period private libraries include the Villa of the Papyri, the House of Menander, the House of Augustus, and the Domus Aurea.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing auctions in social networks for goods that exhibit single-parameter submodular network externalities in which a bidder’s value for an outcome is a fixed <b>private</b> <b>type</b> times a known submodular function of the allocation of his friends. Externalities pose many issues {{that are hard to}} address with traditional techniques; our work shows how to resolve these issues in a specific setting of particular interest. We operate in a Bayesian environment and so assume private values are drawn according to known distributions. We prove that the optimal auction is APX-hard. Thus we instead design auctions whose revenue approximates that of the optimal auction. Our main result considers step-function externalities in which a bidder’s value for an outcome is either zero, or equal to his <b>private</b> <b>type</b> if at least one friend has the good.
