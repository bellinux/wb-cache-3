40|$|Ñuñas, <b>popping</b> beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), {{burst and}} expand when heated rapidly. Differences in seed {{microstructure}} between <b>popping</b> and conventional (non-popping) bean genotypes conceivably contribute to <b>popping</b> in ñuñas. However, the microstructural characteristics which {{contribute to the}} <b>popping</b> attribute and sites of expansion have not been identified. Seeds and excised cotyledons of unpopped and <b>popped</b> ñuñas were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Protoplasts of unpopped ñuñas were similar to protoplasts of conventional beans. Intercellular spaces of unpopped ñuñas were occuled by schizogenous cell walls. The occluded form of intercellular spaces differed distinctively from the open form in <b>popped</b> ñuñas and untreated conventional beans. The expansion of cotyledon mesophyll in <b>popped</b> ñuñas came primarily from expansion of cell walls and secondarily by expansion of the intercellular spaces. Cell wall thickness and dimensions of protoplasts were not changed during <b>popping.</b> Expansion of cell walls away from protoplasts created intracellular voids. SEM images indicated that starch granules (grains) in <b>popped</b> ñuñas were generally not altered by <b>popping.</b> Starch granules did not gelatinize or melt during <b>popping</b> as indicated by retention of birefringence. In contrast to popcorn (Zea mays L.), starch granules did not contribute to expansion of <b>popped</b> ñuña cotyledonsPeer-reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{the vast}} {{majority}} of breakfast cereals, Corn <b>Pops</b> in the USA had been packaged in a foil-lined bag until the mid-2010s. This helped to prevent the <b>Pops</b> from going stale and from secreting a sticky substance that caused the corn <b>pops</b> to stick together (a problem caused by the method by which the cereal is processed). Honey Smacks, another Kellogg's puffed grain cereal, used the same bag Corn <b>Pops</b> used.

40|$|Beside the yield, as an {{economically}} important trait, the <b>popping</b> volume that breeders have been improving is equally important.

Breeding of <b>popping</b> maize for improved yield is not a primary aim of breeding. If <b>popping</b> maize hybrids do not have a high <b>popping</b> volume and high quality of flakes, they will not be used in the production no matter how high yielding they are. The yield, the <b>popping</b> volume and the relation of these two equally important traits, were estimated in the trial with <b>popping</b> maize hybrids sown in two locations. According to means for both trial locations, the observed hybrid combinations were ranked for the traits of grain yield and <b>popping</b> volume. Obtained ranks were used to calculate the Spearman shrank correlation coefficients. A gained value is not statistically significant, but it points to a weak dependence between these traits.

40|$|Public {{concern over}} {{persistent}} organic pollutants (<b>POPs)</b> re-emerged in the 1990 s due to studies describing endocrine disrupting effects of some <b>POPs.</b> While monitoring data suggested that concentrations of contaminants were less in South Korea than in more industrialized countries, the public perception {{was that there were}} significant risks posed by <b>POPs.</b> This perception may have resulted from inaccurate and insufficient information about the status of <b>POPs</b> in South Ko-rea. The South Korean government, as a signatory authority of the Stockholm Convention, is obliged to submit a national implementa-tion plan to ban or minimize <b>POPs</b> emissions. To date, little has been known regarding the overall <b>POPs</b> status including inventories, usage patterns, sources, emission, fate, and distribution in South Korea. To assess the status of four emerging <b>POPs</b> as well as the 12 existing classical <b>POPs</b> in South Korea we have compiled and reviewed all the available literature published since the mid- 1990 s on <b>POPs</b> in South Korea. We present and discuss: (1) emission inventories of individual POPs; (2) concentrations of the various <b>POPs</b> in various compart-ments of the environment; (3) conducted ecosystem and human ex-posure assessments; (4) report a case study of fate and multi-media transport of POPs; and finally (5) propose an appropriate strategy to minimize the risks of <b>POPs</b> in South Korea. In brief, concentrations of <b>POPs</b> were found to be relatively small, compared to most other industrialized countries.
