40|$|In the {{criminal}} cases, {{the recording of}} defendant’s statements <b>to</b> threaten <b>the</b> victim or <b>to</b> confess his crime are often submitted as evidence <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> charge in <b>fact.</b> However, it is important <b>to</b> disambiguate <b>the</b> admissibility of the recording medium because this issue implies some arguing points. It is acknowledged that hearsay rule should apply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recording of statements, like written statements. Nevertheless, some critics {{do not agree with}} that the defendant"s confession recorded by the investigative agencies can be used <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> constituting <b>the</b> crime charged. Also, regarding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> admissibility of the recording by individuals who are not he investigative agencies, there are several discrepancies among viewpoints. If the recording of <b>the</b> defendant"s statements <b>to</b> confess <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crime made by the investigative agencies satisfies the requirements of Criminal Procedure Act Article 312 paragraph (1) to (3), it may be admissible. However, in the light of CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT Article 312 paragraph (2), Article 381 - 2 paragraph (2) and ACT ON SPECIAL CASES CONCERNING THE PUNISHMENT, ETC. OF SEXUAL CRIMES Article 30 paragraph (6), ACT ON THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AND JUVENILES AGAINST SEXUAL ABUSE Article 26 paragraph (6) the video-recorded product containing a defendant"s statement made by the investigative agencies is not admissible <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> constituting <b>the</b> crime charged except for cases in which there are special regulations that allow a video-recorded product to use as proof of <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> constituting <b>the</b> crime charged. Therefore, the recording of <b>the</b> defendant‘s statements <b>to</b> confess <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crime made by the investigative agencies cannot be used <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> constituting <b>the</b> crime charged, because the recording of defendant’s statement and the video-recorded product are similar in nature as a proof. On the other hand, in the case of individual recording, if it satisfies the requirements of CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ACT Article 313 paragraph (1), it may be used <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> constituting <b>the</b> crime charged. In other words, if it is <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be genuine by the acceptance of the defendant at a preparatory hearing or during a public trial, such recording medium is admissible. When it cannot be proven by the statement of the defendant at a preparatory hearing or during a public trial, for it"s being admissible, it should be <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be genuine by the statement of the individual, who recorded the statement of the defendant, at a preparatory hearing or during a public trial and, if it goes <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that <b>the</b> defendant"s statement was made in a particularly reliable state...|$|R

50|$|If M is {{a module}} {{which has a}} non-zero proper {{submodule}} N, {{then there is a}} short exact sequenceA common approach <b>to</b> <b>proving</b> a fact about M is <b>to</b> show that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> is true for the center term of a short exact sequence when it is true for the left and right terms, then <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> for N and M/N. If N has a non-zero proper submodule, then this process can be repeated. This produces a chain of submodulesIn order <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> this way, one needs conditions on this sequence and on the modules Mi/Mi + 1. One particularly useful condition is that the length of the sequence is finite and each quotient module Mi/Mi + 1 is simple. In this case the sequence is called a composition series for M. In order <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> a statement inductively using composition series, the statement is first proved for simple modules, which form the base case of the induction, and then <b>the</b> statement is <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> remain true under an extension of a module by a simple module. For example, the Fitting lemma shows that the endomorphism ring of a finite length indecomposable module is a local ring, so that the strong Krull-Schmidt theorem holds and the category of finite length modules is a Krull-Schmidt category.|$|R
