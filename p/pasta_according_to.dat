40|$|An {{innovative}} pasta cooking process {{performed with}} a prototype microwave oven was characterised {{and the quality}} of microwave cooked pasta was compared to that of traditionally cooked pasta. A first step of this research was aimed to determine the optimum time for spaghetti cooking by the microwave method, eventually further analysis were carried out to investigate the effect of microwave cooking on starch gelatinization as well as structural and rheological modifications of pasta. Finally, a sensory evaluation was performed by a panel of trained judges in order to (i) evaluate the influence of the different cooking methods on pasta sensory quality, (ii) test if the differences evidenced by analytical determinations were perceived by sensory analysis. Optimum cooking time being equal, microwave cooked spaghetti showed lower cooking loss and shear strength values than traditionally cooked ones, moreover microwave cooked samples showed a more closely-packed superficial protein network and a higher saturation of yellow colour. The panel of sensory judges did not perceived any difference between the two tested samples except for the yellow colour intensity, which was higher for microwave cooked <b>pasta</b> <b>according</b> <b>to</b> instrumental analysis data.

5000|$|The cheese has a salty flavour {{and rich}} aroma. It {{is often used}} in a Greek dish called Saganaki, cut into {{triangular}} pieces, rolled in seasoned flour and lightly fried. It is an excellent cheese for grating, and is widely used as a topping for <b>pasta</b> dishes. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> one cookbook, [...] "At its best, it {{is as good as}} or better than Romano or aged Asiago." [...] It is very similar to Kefalotyri cheese and sometimes is sold under that name.|$|R
5000|$|After the curd heals, it {{is further}} cut into 3/8"-1/2" [...] large pieces. The curds are stirred and heated to {{separate}} the curds from the whey. The whey is then drained from the curds and the curds are placed in a hoop to form a solid mass. The curd mass is left until the pH is at around 5.2-5.5, which is the point when the cheese can be stretched and kneaded to produce a delicate consistency—this process is generally known as <b>pasta</b> filata. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> the Mozzarella di Bufala trade association, [...] "The cheese-maker kneads it with his hands, like a baker making bread, until he obtains a smooth, shiny paste, a strand of which he pulls out and lops off, forming the individual mozzarella." [...] It is then typically formed into cylinder shapes or in plait. In Italy, a [...] "rubbery" [...] consistency is generally considered not satisfactory; the cheese {{is expected to be}} softer.|$|R
40|$|The {{headspace}} solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique {{followed by}} GC/MS {{analysis was performed}} to evaluate the volatile fraction of durum wheat pasta produced under different process conditions (artisan manufacturing methods or industrial processes). At the same time, HPLC analysis was performed to quantify furosine in the same pasta samples. Furosine is commonly used as an index of nutritional damage occurring during pasta drying, although drastic thermal treatments may lead to its underestimation. Moreover, since furosine determination requires time/solvent-consuming methods, a more convenient approach could be the identification of volatile compounds formed during the drying step and detectable through simple and automated methods. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to experimental data in order <b>to</b> discriminate <b>pasta</b> samples <b>according</b> <b>to</b> their drying conditions. A limited number of volatile compounds including Maillard reaction and lipid-derived products (nonanal, hexanal, nonanoic acid, maltol and 2 -furanmethanol) proved to be crucial in the differentiation of the samples. Therefore, these compounds {{could be used as}} pasta quality markers, alternatively to furosine, or as process markers to keep the drying treatment under control...|$|R
40|$|International {{trade in}} {{agricultural}} products represents an important {{share of the}} whole European export market. This is exemplified by Italian food products that have been promoted on international markets through the idea of quality and health linked to the Mediterranean diet. Together with the benefit due to the increasing consumer interest in traditional European products and “food style”, a growing phenomenon of agropiracy has taken place. It is commonly recognized that agropiracy works exclusively by reducing the market shares of the original products, intentionally exploiting consumer confusion by using original-sounding brands. Therefore, production firms' marketing strategies tend to concentrate on product purity such as branding and origin authentication policies. Our hypothesis, supported {{by the results of}} a survey on pasta consumption in the US, is that there exists a well-defined system path worth that can be summarized in three phases: first, introduction of a traditional (original) product on international markets; secondly, local firms' imitation of the successful good; lastly, local firms redesigning original products <b>according</b> <b>to</b> local consumption models and preferences. The results presented in this paper seem to amply confirm this scenario: giving more attention to the second phase (Italian-sounding brand) may result in inappropriate marketing strategies. A representative sample of American consumers (608) were interviewed in supermarkets in 12 US cities. Econometric analysis (a Hedonic Pricing Model followed by a Random Utility Model) shows that: 1) price is the most important product attribute affecting choice; 2) original Italian brands get the higher market share but only when price is the driving attribute; 3) product attributes strictly related to quality, as intended by Italian consumers, have no influence in determining the choice; 4) consumer groups show a higher willingness to pay for <b>pasta</b> redesigned <b>according</b> <b>to</b> local preference; 5) such a path worth does not appear to affect the single original product, rather the whole idea of Italian. These results suggest that a strategy aimed at emphasizing the authenticity of the origin of pasta or of any other “real Italian” product may not lead to any improvement in their market share, but it might very likely affect that market as a whole. Products should be offered as part of a sort of “traditional product package” which allows them to promote food habits rather than just commodities...|$|R
