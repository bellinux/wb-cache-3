The women's indoor program won its first NCAA title in 2010 and by 2017, had won seven of the previous eight national championships. In the 2017 indoor national championship, the sprinters excelled as the women's program set a record for points scored at 84, exceeding the previous record set by Texas by 13 points. The sprinters were so dominant that despite Deajah Stevens's lane violation in the 200m <b>prelims</b> which would have set a new collegiate record, the points accrued from Oregon women's sprinters alone would have been only two points shy of runner up Georgia's entire points total.|$|E

But the {{university}} cricket season was badly affected by wet weather and Gurr also went through what Wisden termed a [...] "bad patch" [...] in which his bowling lacked control.

Dubbed The Sicilians, Altomare and Albano competed as a stereotypical Italian gangster combo {{in the mode of}} the then-popular television series The Untouchables. The pair won the Midwest tag team championship on the undercard of the June 30, 1961 Comiskey Park event starring Pat O'Connor and Buddy Rogers that set the all-time record gate in the United States to that point. Their realistic depiction of gangster characters caught the attention of actual mafiosi in 1961. In Chicago, Tony Accardo and two associates [...] "requested" [...] that Albano and Altomare cease using the word [...] "mafia." [...] During their run as Midwest tag team champions, personal differences with bookers and other wrestlers resulted in the pair abandoning the territory quickly enough that they did not lose the title before leaving. In July 1967, they won the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship from Arnold Skaaland and Spiros Arion. [...] Albano and Altomare only held the championship for two weeks, a title change which was not even acknowledged on WWWF television outside the Atlantic City market. But several photographs of the pair with their title belts were taken, which elevated Albano's reputation in the wrestling magazines of the time, and provided good publicity fodder later in his career.|$|E
