In this study, the role of <b>product</b> <b>origin</b> familiarity in influencing consumer attitudes is examined. The concept is conceptualized and empirically examined.

GI is used to both protect and guarantee that the product has a unique characteristic, resulting from being qualifiedly produced in a specific place. There are many products in Thailand that have been certified by the Ministry of Commerce, carrying the GI label. The purpose of conducting this research is to study Thai consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for products with GI labels. This experiment was carried out under the n th price auction method on Doi Tung coffee, Tung Kula Ronghai Thai Hom Mali rice, and Chaiya salted eggs. Sixty {{participants were asked to}} offer bids for three products each with different types of labels, a normal label; a label stating the product’s origin; and a label which stated the <b>product’s</b> <b>origin</b> and contained a GI sign. The results show that Thai consumers’ WTPs are influenced by the <b>origin</b> of the <b>product.</b> However, the WTPs of GI labels do not significantly differ from the WTPs of labels which state the <b>product’s</b> <b>origin.</b> This implies that Thai consumers value the <b>product’s</b> <b>origin,</b> but do not recognize the importance of the GI label. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} if consumers pay {{a premium}} for unobservable quality {{in the absence of}} quality standards and/or quality grading systems and, if so, how they assess that unobservable quality, using a rice retail market in Madagascar as an example. In Madagascar, the lack of quality standards and/or grading systems for rice makes is considered {{to be one of the}} causes of the rice market's spatial disintegration. Thus, quality standards and grading systems will be necessary to increase the market's efficiency. We hypothesize that consumers and retailers use <b>product</b> <b>origin</b> and rice name as observable indictors of unobservable quality and test the hypothesis using hedonic price regressions. We find that the interaction terms of <b>product</b> <b>origin</b> and rice name significantly affect the price after controlling for both observable quality and spatial and temporal price variation, but that the contribution of <b>product</b> <b>origin</b> and rice name to rice price variation is smaller than spatial and temporal factors. We thus conclude that consumers {{pay a premium}} for unobservable quality throughout Madagascar. This finding implies that quality standards and/or grading systems will work in the Malagasy market and that improving market infrastructure such as roads and storage will make them even more effective...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study is to determine how display size, point-of-purchase material, <b>product</b> <b>origin,</b> <b>product</b> information and display placement impact consumer expenditures for fresh apples and pears. These variables were incorporated into a non-linear Almost Ideal Demand System with share equations for Gala, Fuji, Red Delicious, Other Sweet Apples, Tart Apples, and Pears. Forty-four weeks of data on weekly store sales were collected from two grocery stores in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. Share influences and elasticities are provided for price inputs and for other variables where appropriate. <b>Product</b> <b>origin,</b> e. g. state and national, influenced consumers' expenditures for Red Delicious apples and pears; it was insignificant in other share equations. Product information, e. g. tart or sweet, only influenced expenditures on apple varieties that are less familiar to the consumer. The size of point-of-purchase material had a significant effect on expenditures as did display sizes to a lesser extent. This research provided valuable information to produce managers and apple and pear producers on factors that influence consumers' expenditures at the retail level...|$|R
