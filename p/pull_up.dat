In Duel, a likewise maniacal truck <b>pulls</b> <b>up</b> the protagonist, and a small billboard for ICE is visible in the background.|$|R

5|$|Election Special is an American {{roots and}} blues rock album of protest songs with music {{characterized}} by upbeat melodies, simple instrumentation, and sparse arrangements. Cooder played {{all of the}} instruments, including bass, guitar, and mandolin, {{with the exception of}} drums by his son Joachim. A deeply political album, it expands on the socio-political musings and current event topics of <b>Pull</b> <b>Up</b> Some Dust and Sit Down with forthright, satirical lyrics and song-form vignettes. Cooder's songwriting exhibits liberal and populist sentiments and draws on older musical sources such as broadside ballads and country blues.|$|E
5|$|Election Special is the 2012 fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder.

Election Special was recorded mostly at Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E

A group of people (In which {{one of them is}} YouTube star, Wendy McColm) <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> in cars and they also lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video.

5|$|That night, Natalie sneaks into Dylan's house. When they kiss, {{something}} apparently cuts her mouth, {{causing her}} to leave in tears. Dare's friends, who believe Dylan is responsible for his death, <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> moments later and abduct him. During the drive, an insect-like protrusion comes out of Dylan's mouth and sprays webbing everywhere, causing the car to flip and crash. Doggett and Reyes arrive at the scene, and are told that Dylan chewed his way out the back window. Meanwhile, Scully and a bug specialist search Dylan's home. Scully leaves to help Reyes find the teenager while the specialist stays behind; the specialist is subsequently attacked by Dylan's mother.|$|E

5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} <b>Pull</b> <b>Up</b> Some Dust and Sit Down {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road trip across the United States, speaking out to people in towns {{about the state of}} the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E

He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He went on to the 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal best by almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E
