40|$|Most {{contemporary}} political philosophers deny that justice requires giving {{people what they}} deserve. According to a familiar anti-desert argument, the influence of genes and environment on <b>people</b> <b>s</b> <b>actions</b> and traits undermines all desert-claims. According to a less familiar but more plausible argument, the influence of genes and environment on <b>people</b> <b>s</b> <b>actions</b> and traits undermines some desert-claims (or all desert-claims to an extent). But, it says, {{we do not know}} which ones (or to what extent). This article examines this epistemological argument against desert. It gives reason to believe that it fails, emphasizing the importance of justice relative to efficiency and attempting to construct a practical way of measuring desert. ...|$|R
40|$|When Singapore {{celebrated its}} 50 th year of {{independence}} in 2015, there were reminders {{of how the}} People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> (PAP) government had effectively implemented policies on social integration and economic change, and saved Singapore from the twin threats of communism and Chinese chauvinism. Such reminders were not new. In a statement issued in 1983, the party declared that 2 ̆ 7 {{if there were no}} PAP there would be no Singapore {{as we know it today}} 2 ̆ 7. The historiography of Singapore remains overwhelmingly about the achievements of the PAP. Little is said about the opposition parties in Singapore over the last 50 years...|$|R
40|$|November 1990, {{with the}} {{stepping}} down of Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s inaugural Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, saw {{the changing of}} the guard in Singapore, together with the promise of a more consultative style of government and greater citizen participation. However, the ruling People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> (PAP) had been {{quick to point out that}} the new openness did not mean that they would tolerate undue criticisms of the government. Participants in political discussions are thus constrained by the Out-of-bounds markers (OB markers) which dictate the rules of political engagement and the topics which are deemed by the PAP as too sensitive for public debate. The OB markers are not a defined set of rules, and evolve with the prevailing socio-political climate. The OB markers have been in existence long before it was brought into the limelight in 1994, when a Singaporean author was chastised by the PAP for two critical political commentaries published in the press. The Singaporean government has justified the need for OB markers in maintaining national security and religious and racial harmony. Although Singaporean academics have mentioned the OB markers in their work, there has been no extensive study performed on the topic. This thesis aims to explore the conditions which have informed the need for OB markers and its implementation in the local press, using The Straits Times as a case study. The thesis will also discern if there has been a shift in these markers using the public discussion of the Marxist Conspiracy, the Catherine Lim incident and the Ong Presidency as test cases...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} article {{attempts to}} interrogate the emerging {{responses of the}} traditionally powerful Singaporean city-state as it is confronted by the upsurge of social media networks. This inquiry is premised on the assertion that Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s city-state, historically dominated by the People 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> (PAP), acts as an overall enforcer by employing tactical globalization. In its drive towards development and nation-building, the city-state has identified protecting social cohesion among its diverse and multicultural population {{as one of its}} key vulnerabilities. Globalization, particularly heralded by the increasingly unpredictable electronic media, is anathema to the ethos of a city-state that leaves nothing to chance. The city-state pragmatically and selectively appropriates what it sees as benign aspects {{while at the same time}} discarding and de-legitimizing malignant features of the globalization phenomenon as it carries out its dominant role as creator and enforcer of policies. The information age characterized by the Internet provides an interesting case study of how tactical globalization is employed by the city-state. On the one hand, Singapore declares itself an open and wired nation with the goal of being an information hub. On the other hand, it controls social media through a repertoire of dominant party rolemodeling, restrictive communications policies, and harsh legal regulations warning against "crusading journalism" that could lead to political instability and damage the nation-building project. Nonetheless, very recent high-profile and embarrassing events that have tarnished top members of the bureaucracy have been highlighted through social media networks. The Internet chatter caused by the slip-ups of elites associated with the ruling party seems to be a portent of the emergence of a "politics of scandal. " Levels of trust in government seem to have been dampened, evidenced by the most recent parliamentary elections that have witnessed an unprecedented defeat of a bailiwick of the ruling PAP. The unpredictability and intractability of social media networks poses a serious challenge to the Singaporean city-state that has built an ethos of control and shrewdly applied tactical globalization as it navigates the twenty-first century. This article explores the evolving responses of the city-state as it attempts to manage the potential power wielded by social media...|$|R
30|$|Kindergartens started {{very early}} in churches and in the private sector. Its role was very {{specific}} — to prepare children for primary school. Kindergartens were not widespread during the 1940 s and 1950 s, and attended mainly by children from middle and upper income families. An early major player is the People’s Association (PA), a Statutory Board that ran kindergartens in community centres. In the 1960 <b>s,</b> the <b>People’s</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> (PAP) 1, ventured into setting up 3 kindergartens. It was not until 1986 when the PAP went full-scale {{with the establishment of}} the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) 2 that kindergartens were quickly made accessible to all children in every constituency. In one fell swoop, PCF became (and still is) the largest provider of kindergartens in Singapore while the PA kindergartens slowly faded off. The low fees made kindergartens affordable to the masses. Kindergartens were no longer the privilege of a few. Later, ‘madrasahs’ 3 began offering kindergarten classes for Malay/Muslim children as well.|$|R
