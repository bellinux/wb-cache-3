25|$|The Redoubt {{positions}} {{and others in}} Switzerland were augmented by the Bison project, which involved the installation of anti-tank guns in new bunkers at key locations to provide a modernized <b>pre-positioned</b> <b>force</b> capable of defeating modern armor. A project to install automatic 120mm mortars was completed in 2003.|$|E

50|$|On 10 December 1992, ACB-1 {{arrived at}} Mogadishu {{as part of}} the Naval Support Element in Somalia. Within a short time ACB-1 {{unloaded}} five of the Marines' Maritime <b>Pre-positioning</b> <b>Force</b> ships, refurbished the port, and provided fuel and water for military forces in Somalia.|$|R

Provide combat logistics to Marine Expeditionary Units and provide terminal operation support to deploying II MEF forces.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, the 1er RCP {{created and}} {{implemented}} {{a system of}} [...] "rotating combat companies" [...] in New Caledonia, Réunion and Gabon and {{that in order to}} make ready immediate <b>pre-positioned</b> <b>forces</b> in case of operational necessity. Almost every year, a combat company is sent to these territories for missions lasting 4 months.|$|R
5000|$|Junction City's grand {{tactical}} plan was a [...] "hammer and anvil" [...] tactic, whereupon airborne forces would [...] "flush out" [...] the VietCong headquarters, {{sending them to}} retreat against a prepared [...] "anvil" [...] of <b>pre-positioned</b> <b>forces.</b> Total forces earmarked for this operation included most of the 1st Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division including the 196th Light Infantry Brigade and the airborne troops of the 173rd Airborne Brigade and large armored elements of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.|$|R
5000|$|Headquarters Regiment Provides combat {{logistics}} to 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) and command, {{control and}} coordination of logistics services to I MEF <b>forces.</b> Executes Maritime <b>Pre-positioning</b> <b>Force</b> (MPF) Operations {{in order to}} achieve rapid build-up of combat power.

30|$|Information {{about the}} {{distribution}} of lightning will {{provide insight into the}} role of fire in California’s bioregions and will aid in predicting lightning fire occurrence. Knowing where and when lightning is most likely to occur will allow mangers to <b>pre-position</b> suppression <b>forces,</b> plan for fuel treatments, and prepare fire prevention and public safety materials.|$|R
50|$|The ISO {{containers}} are secured for sea using normal ship’s tie-down {{points in}} any appropriate open space. The design also includes satellite communication antennas for connectivity to DISA’s Global Information Grid. This connectivity {{may also be}} provided via the ship’s organic satellite communications system. The demonstrator, which has been successfully tested, can easily be scaled larger when the mission requires it by adding more ISO containers of each type. In addition, the C2 architecture is sufficiently robust to support {{a large number of}} additional external users in other ship spaces (e.g., embarked unit spaces). The demonstrator can be installed on a designated ship of opportunity - including Navy, Military Sealift Command, Maritime <b>Pre-Positioning</b> <b>Force</b> Units, Coalition Force ships - or ashore. Since it is self-contained and easy to install/uninstall, it can be moved as needed among ships and installed wherever space and power are available.|$|R
5|$|While the Australians in AO Columbus had {{successfully}} interrupted the <b>pre-positioning</b> of communist <b>forces</b> {{on one of}} the main approaches to Saigon, in hindsight they had been deployed too late to interfere seriously with the offensive. Over the period 9−12 February 1 ATF redeployed, moving south back towards the fire support bases. The remaining companies of 3 RAR subsequently relieved 7 RAR and moved north on 11 February, while 2 RAR/NZ returned to Nui Dat on 13 February. FSB Harrison was abandoned and all command and support elements concentrated at FSB Andersen. Contact was minimal during this period, with just three Viet Cong killed.|$|R
