50|$|In {{offshore}} applications, huge {{lengths of}} rope are often housed on drums. The anchor winches on Saipem’s Semac 1 <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> barge, for example, each hold 2,800 metres of 76mm (3 inch) diameter wire rope in 14 layers. Saipem’s Castorone, the world’s largest <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> vessel uses a wire rope that is 3,850m long and 152mm in diameter. It weighs 420t.

50|$|A {{large amount}} of {{offshore}} diving work is associated with pipeline work, particularly with pipeline connections. Depths may range from deep to shallow, and procedures and diving mode will be chosen to suit. Work includes aspects of <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> and trenching, and work on existing pipelines and ancillary equipment.|$|E
5000|$|A {{spoolbase}} is a shore-based facility used {{to facilitate}} continuous <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> for offshore {{oil and gas}} production. The facility allows the welding of single or double joints (40' or 80') of steel pipe of 4" [...] to 18" [...] diameter, into predetermined lengths for spooling onto a reel lay vessel.|$|E
5000|$|Currents: High {{currents}} are objectionable in {{that they}} hinder <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> operations. For instance, in shallow seas tidal currents may be quite strong in a strait between two islands. Under these circumstances, it may be preferable to bring the pipe elsewhere, even if this alternative route ends up being longer.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a Taft {{oil well}} {{blow-out}} in Kern County, ca. 1920. The well {{was owned by}} Standard Oil (10 - 36. 31 - 23). The blow-out consisted of 20, 000 barrels of oil. At least 6 other derricks are visible in the hilly distance behind the oil gushing upward out of the derrick. <b>Pipes</b> <b>lay</b> in a pile at left adjacent {{to one of the}} oil rig shacks...|$|R

When he saw the two, he rose expectantly, and went forward to meet them. Virginia stopped before him.|$|R

50|$|The river gravels {{are well}} drained and {{strongly}} acidic, {{leading to a}} hostile environment in which plants have to withstand occasional drought and nutrient deficiency. However, considerable areas have acquired foreign soils during landfill programmes, whilst ploughing for agriculture during World War II and numerous <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> programmes have brought trapped nutrients to the surface. The result is a patchwork of soil types, each providing different plant and animal habitats. As the grassland reverts to woodland, the various stages in this process create further habitats.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{types of}} vessels used for <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> are the [...] "Derrick Barge (DB)", the [...] "Pipelay Barge (LB)" [...] and the [...] "Derrick/Lay barge (DLB)" [...] combination. Diving bells in {{offshore}} construction are mainly used in water depths greater than 120 ft, less than that, the divers use a metal basket driven from an [...] "A" [...] frame from the deck. The basket is lowered {{to the water}} level, then the divers enter the water from it {{to a maximum of}} 120 ft. Bells can go to 1500 ft, but are normally used at 400 to 800 ft.|$|E
50|$|In July 2008, {{preparatory work}} for the raw gas {{pipeline}} began in Glengad. Under Gilligan's superintendency over forty arrests {{were made in the}} summer of 2008. The Irish Navy were brought in to provide assistance in dealing with possible protests on water. Local businessman and fisherman Pat O'Donnell accused the Gardaí of selective policing, alleging that they made no answer to call for assistance in defending his private property, in the form of crab pots that were {{in the path of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> vessel, Solitaire. Gardaí arrested O'Donnell and his son twice in a 24-hour period from the sea on public order charges, but desisted when their solicitor requested they charge their clients or stop arresting them.|$|E

50|$|However, {{laying a}} {{pipeline}} {{as a part}} of an invasion presented significant difficulties. The pipe would have to withstand huge pressures from 600 ft of sea water and even higher internal pressures as oil was pumped; yet the pipe would have to be flexible enough to lie on the seabed and strong enough to resist the effects of being moved by currents possibly while resting on rocks. The pipe and everything else needed would have to be prepared in great secrecy; <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> could not start until the invasion actually took place and would have to be completed quickly enough to be useful. Another reason to work quickly was to avoid bad weather and the worst of the channels currents.|$|E
50|$|A {{fuel pipe}} line was built, it started at Martigues and utilising storage tanks in the La Mede refinery. The harbour was mined {{and it was}} 9 September when the first tanker docked. A tug {{assisting}} it dock hit a mine. <b>Pipe</b> <b>laying</b> started the same day. Six teams, each laying over two miles of 4 inch pipe a day. Interim storage and dispensing points were built. When completed it was capable of moving 500 tons of petrol a day, which reduced the problems caused by a shortage of Jerrycan's and trucks. A second 6-inch pipeline would be laid and it eventually reached the Sarrebourg, 850 km away. By Spring 1945, 1,200,000 gallons were being pumped every day. Meeting the requirements of both the Seventh United States Army and the First Army (France).|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1944 the ship was {{converted}} to a pipe carrier and transported pipe in her aft two holds from the United States to England {{that was used in}} the construction of a fuel pipeline under the English Channel, Operation PLUTO, following the Normandy landings. She made the first and last pipe transport voyage carrying 70 miles km of pipe departing New York on 22 September 1945 and then spending eighty-four days in London discharging 17 miles km of pipe into <b>pipe</b> <b>laying</b> ships and unloading the remainder at the dock. For the remainder of the war and immediate post war period Arthur M. Huddell carried coal, general cargo and personnel in voyages involving the United States, France, Italy and Algeria before a final return to Baltimore, Maryland in July 1945 and a voyage to New York before lay up.|$|E
