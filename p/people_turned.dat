5|$|According to folklore, the priory {{is haunted}} by {{the ghost of a}} monk in a black habit who returns {{annually}} to check that its buried treasure has not been disturbed. He is said to arrive at midnight on the year's first new moon to lower a ghostly drawbridge spanning a vanished moat. In 1966 and 1967 a hundred <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> out to watch and allegedly managed to spot a cowled figure, but in 1968 the few spectators who turned up saw nothing.|$|E
5|$|Almost 24 {{hours after}} the dramatics in Barcelona, a crowd of 500,000 <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> up {{on the streets of}} Manchester to greet the United players, who paraded through the city in an open-top bus. As champions of Europe, Manchester United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup against Brazilian side Palmeiras in Tokyo. Roy Keane scored the winner, {{ensuring}} the team became the first and last British side to win the trophy, which was abolished in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the latter group {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand <b>people,</b> <b>turned</b> the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E

5|$|After a twenty-year career, {{of which}} he played {{fourteen}} with Bayern, he had his professional farewell in a testimonial match versus the select Germany XI on 2 September 2008, which ended 1–1. His last appearance for Bayern Munich was on 27 May 2008 at the Salt Lake Stadium (Yuvabharati Krirangan), Kolkata in a friendly against Mohun Bagan of India during Bayern's Asian tour of 2008. Around 120,000 <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> up for the match. The match ended 0–3 in favour of Bayern and Michael Rensing substituted him in the 55th minute.|$|E
5|$|Belarusian {{authorities}} {{vowed to}} prevent any large-scale demonstrations following the election (such as those that marked the Orange Revolution in Ukraine). Despite their efforts, the opposition had {{the largest number of}} demonstrators in years, with nightly protests in Minsk continuing for a number of days after the election. The largest protest occurred on election night; reporters for the Associated Press estimated that approximately 10,000 <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> out. Election observers from the Russia-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) differed on the Belarusian election.|$|E
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible for Democrats to win.|$|E

5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for staff and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's group {{opponents in}} Italia '90 were England, Egypt and the Netherlands. Charlton felt that England's four-man midfield of Waddle, Barnes, Bryan Robson and Paul Gascoigne {{did not offer}} enough {{protection}} to the back four, and he was proved correct when Kevin Sheedy cancelled out Gary Lineker's opener to secure a 1–1 draw in the group opener at the Stadio Sant'Elia. A poor performance against a negative Egyptian side at the Stadio La Favorita meant that neither side scored a goal in a dour draw. They ended the group with a 1–1 draw with the Dutch, Niall Quinn cancelling out Ruud Gullit's opener in the 71st minute, after which both sides settled for a stalemate as a draw meant that both qualified ahead of Egypt. Ireland then defeated Romania in the Second Round match at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris which went to penalties after a 0–0 draw, before the whole team had a meeting Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Ireland eventually {{went out to the}} hosts, Italy, 1–0 in the quarter-finals at the Stadio Olimpico. A lapse of concentration meant that Italy's Salvatore Schillaci scored on 38 minutes, and Ireland failed to build up enough chances to find the equalising goal. After returning to Dublin over 500,000 <b>people</b> <b>turned</b> out to welcome the team back.|$|E
