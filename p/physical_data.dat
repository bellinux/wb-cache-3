25|$|Like the {{majority}} of major racing simulators, Forza Motorsport is designed to calculate a car's performance in real time using <b>physical</b> <b>data</b> (for example, {{the weight of a}} car's engine, its drag coefficient, etc.), consequently causing the cars to mimic the handling characteristics of their real-life counterparts. In 2005, Popular Science magazine tested this effect by inviting professional race car driver Gunnar Jeannette and a car enthusiast without major professional motorsports experience to drive identical cars on an identical track in both Forza Motorsport and the real world. Aside from several cars which were either in challenging physical condition or lacking identical setups, Jeannette's track times matched closely from his performance on the real track and in virtual reality. The amateur's real world times in all of the cars were roughly identical despite a 16-second spread between fastest and slowest in Forza, which he attributed to his fear of the consequences of driving too hard causing him to drive more slowly in the faster cars.|$|E

60|$|Thus, to come, at last, to {{the really}} {{important}} part of all this discussion, if the belief in a God is essential to morality, physical science offers no obstacle thereto; if the belief in immortality is essential to morality, physical science has no more to say against the probability of that doctrine than the most ordinary experience has, and it effectually closes the mouths of those who pretend to refute it by objections deduced from merely <b>physical</b> <b>data.</b> Finally, if {{the belief in the}} uncausedness of volition is essential to morality, the student of physical science has no more to say against that absurdity than the logical philosopher or theologian. Physical science, I repeat, did not invent determinism, and the deterministic doctrine would stand on just as firm a foundation as it does if there were no physical science. Let any one who doubts this read Jonathan Edwards, whose demonstrations are derived wholly from philosophy and theology.|$|E
60|$|It sounds {{paradoxical}} to {{say that}} the attainment of scientific truth has been effected, to a great extent, by the help of scientific errors. But the subject-matter of physical science is furnished by observation, which cannot extend beyond the limits of our faculties; while, even within those limits, we cannot be certain that any observation is absolutely exact and exhaustive. Hence it follows that any given generalisation from observation may be true, within the limits of our powers of observation at a given time, and yet turn out to be untrue, when those powers of observation are directly or indirectly enlarged. Or, to put the matter in another way, a doctrine which is untrue absolutely, may, to a very great extent, be susceptible of an interpretation in accordance with the truth. At a certain period in the history of astronomical science, the assumption that the planets move in circles was true enough to serve the purpose of correlating such observations as were then possible; after Kepler, the assumption that they move in ellipses became true enough in regard to the state of observational astronomy at that time. We say still that the orbits of the planets are ellipses, because, for all ordinary purposes, that is a sufficiently near approximation to the truth; but, as a matter of fact, the centre of gravity of a planet describes neither an ellipse or any other simple curve, but an immensely complicated undulating line. It may fairly be doubted whether any generalisation, or hypothesis, based upon <b>physical</b> <b>data</b> is absolutely true, in the sense that a mathematical proposition is so; but, if its errors can become apparent only outside the limits of practicable observation, it may be just as usefully adopted for one of the symbols of that algebra by which we interpret nature, as if it were absolutely true.|$|E

40|$|Decomposition {{analysis}} {{can provide a}} useful efficiency metric for the industrial sector, it does so by separating the influence of changes in energy intensity from structural and activity changes. The activity refactorisation (AR) approach to decomposition analysis offers a potentially improved methodology, with a better correlation to real efficiency improvements. This is achieved through combining monetary and <b>physical</b> output <b>data.</b> Here the AR approach is compared to other methodologies for the United Kingdom industrial sector over the period 1997 – 2012. Even with limited availability of <b>physical</b> output <b>data</b> the AR approach was found to provide significantly different results to those obtained using only monetary output measures. When monetary output was the sole measure of activity, intensity (efficiency) improvements were overestimated. It is recommended that <b>physical</b> output <b>data</b> is supplied alongside energy demand and monetary output data in national accounts to better track efficiency improvements and allow such improved metrics to feed into decarbonisation policy discussions...|$|R

30|$|SMART-PET was {{calibrated}} to the Siemens Biograph mCT 64, and we {{demonstrated that}} the simulated images show similar image characteristics as <b>physical</b> phantom <b>data</b> over different reconstruction settings and scan durations. Some discrepancies were observed when comparing the COV of the OSEM[*]+[*]TOF reconstructions for different TOF resolutions with the theoretically expected values. These discrepancies {{may be due to}} the fact that the expected TOF effect is calculated expecting a cylindrical object with a fixed diameter [32]. As the IQ phantom does not have a cylindrical shape, the average diameter was estimated, what can be the cause for these small differences. Furthermore, when comparing the simulated and the physical COV values over the different scan durations, the relationship between scan and simulation was not directly proportional for the OSEM[*]+[*]PSF reconstruction. This is due to the fact that the COVs of the <b>physical</b> phantom <b>data</b> did not follow the expected behaviour over time (according to formula 1), while the simulated data behaves as expected.
