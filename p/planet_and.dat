5|$|Since no {{consensus}} could be reached, the committee {{decided to put}} these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from {{two of the three}} proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot.|$|E

5|$|Acknowledging the problem, the IAU {{set about}} {{creating}} {{the definition of}} <b>planet,</b> <b>and</b> produced one in August 2006.

40|$|Brown dwarfs are {{intermediate}} objects between <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> stars.

We present results on new potential brown-dwarf companions of Sun-like stars, which were discovered using CORALIE radial-velocity measurements. By combining the spectroscopic orbits and Hipparcos astrometric measurements, we have determined the orbit inclinations and therefore the companion masses for many of these systems. This has revealed a mass range between 25 and 45 Jupiter masses almost void of objects, suggesting a possible dividing line between massive <b>planets</b> <b>and</b> sub-stellar companion...|$|R

5|$|Flagged {{initially}} as {{a transit}} event by the satellite, Kepler-9d {{was given the}} designation KOI 377.03.

Kepler's team exhaustively disproved that the small transit event could have been anything but a <b>planet,</b> <b>and</b> their results {{were published in the}} Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011.

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} <b>planet</b> <b>and</b> its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of X-ray observations of the trans-Jovian <b>planets</b> Saturn, Uranus <b>and</b> Neptune with the ROSAT PSPC in comparison with X-ray observations of Jupiter. For {{the first time a}} marginal X-ray detection of Saturn was found and 95 % confidence upper limits for Uranus and Neptune were obtained. These upper limits show that Jupiter-like X-ray luminosities can be excluded for all three planets, while they are consistent assuming intrinsic Saturn-like X-ray luminosities. Similar X-ray production mechanisms on all trans-Jovian planets can therefore not be ruled out, and spectral shape and total luminosity observed from Saturn are consistent with thick-target bremsstrahlung caused by electron precipitation as occurring in auroral emission from the Earth.
