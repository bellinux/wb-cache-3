5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. Oxaloacetate {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E

In this work, the equivalent Arg 336 from the S. cerevisiae enzyme was changed to Lys or Gln. Kinetic analyses of the varied enzymes showed that a positive charge at position 336 is critical for catalysis of the main reaction, and further suggested different rate limiting steps for the main reaction and the secondary activities. The Arg 336 Lys altered enzyme showed increased oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity and developed the ability to catalyze pyruvate enolization.

25|$|Hydrazine sulfate was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer cachexia). This hypothesis was based on the fact that cancer cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase</b> (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia. In this model, hydrazine sulfate is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> <b>carboxykinase.</b>|$|E

The enzyme requires GDP or inosine diphosphate (GTP or inosine triphosphate) for activity. Pyruvate- and other PEP-dependent CO 2 -fixing enzyme activities were not detected, regardless of whether the cells were grown autotrophically or heterotrophically. It is suggested that two pathways are present in the organism for the formation of PEP from C 4 dicarboxylic acids. Besides decarboxylation of oxaloacetate by PEP carboxykinase, the consecutive action of NADP+-malic enzyme and PEP synthetase can also accomplish this synthesis. An oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity observed in the cell extracts may also contribute to the latter route. The properties of a mutant deficient in PEP synthetase supported the biochemical data. This mutant was unable to grow on pyruvate or lactate and grew slower than the wild type on direct or indirect metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle such as succinate, glutamate, or acetate. Growth on fructose and autotrophic growth were not affected by the enzyme defect.

40|$|During {{metabolic}} evolution {{to improve}} succinate production in Escherichia coli strains, {{significant changes in}} cellular metabolism were acquired that increased energy efficiency in two respects. The energy-conserving <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> (PEP) <b>carboxykinase</b> (pck), which normally functions in the reverse direction (gluconeogenesis; glucose repressed) during the oxidative metabolism of organic acids, evolved to become the major carboxylation pathway for succinate production. Both PCK enzyme activity and gene expression levels increased significantly in two stages because of several mutations during the metabolic evolution process. High-level expression of this enzyme-dominated CO 2 fixation and increased ATP yield (1 ATP per oxaloacetate). In addition, the native PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system for glucose uptake was inactivated by a mutation in ptsI. This glucose transport function was replaced by increased expression of the GalP permease (galP) and glucokinase (glk). Results of deleting individual transport genes confirmed that GalP served as the dominant glucose transporter in evolved strains. Using this alternative transport system would increase the pool of PEP available for redox balance. This change would also increase energy efficiency by eliminating the need to produce additional PEP from pyruvate, a reaction that requires two ATP equivalents. Together, these changes converted the wild-type E. coli fermentation pathway for succinate into a functional equivalent of the native pathway that nature evolved in succinate-producing rumen bacteria...|$|R

Kinetic studies of P-pyruvate carboxykinase activity, measured by either carboxylation of P-pyruvate or decarboxylation of oxaloacetate, revealed a decrease in both V(max) and Km after phenobarbital treatment, whereas the nutritional state affected only the V(max), as expected. Assessment of P-pyruvate carboxykinase specificity was confirmed by the full inhibition of the enzyme with its specific inhibitor 3 -mercaptopicolinate in the micromolar range.

C. glutamicum cells harbouring pck on plasmid showed about tenfold higher specific PEP carboxykinase activities than the wildtype. Inactivation of the chromosomal pck gene led to the absence of PEP carboxykinase activity and the inability to grow on acetate or lactate indicating that the enzyme is essential for growth on these carbon sources and thus, for gluconeogenesis.

Theoretical calculations of the pKa of Lys 213 indicate a value of 6. 5 ± 0. 9, and it increases to 8. 2 ± 1. 6 upon Phe 416 Tyr mutation. Additionally, mutation Phe 416 Tyr causes a loss of 1. 3 kcal mol− 1 in the affinity of the enzyme for PEP, an effect perhaps related to the close proximity of Phe 416 to Arg 70, a residue previously shown to be important for PEP binding...|$|R
40|$|The halotolerant alga Dunaliella salina was cultured on 10 mM NH 4 + or NO 3 - {{with air}} CO 2 or 5 % (v/v) CO 2. Cells grown on NH 4 + rather than NO 3 - {{were up to}} 17 % larger in volume but had similar {{division}} rates. The photosynthetic K 0. 5 of dissolved inorganic C per cell was reduced, but the light- and CO 2 -saturated photosynthesis, dark respiration, and light-independent fixation rates were increased. The cells exhibited 2 - to 5 -fold greater activities of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, <b>phosphoenolpyruvate</b> carboxylase and <b>carboxykinase,</b> and carbonic anhydrase and more soluble and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase protein. Chlorophyll and [beta]-carotene also increased by 30 to 70 %. However, starch and glycerol decreased, indicating that C was reallocated from carbohydrates into protein and pigments by growth on NH 4 +. Algae cultured on air-CO 2 rather than a high CO 2 concentration were 44 % smaller with 55 to 67 % lower cell division rates and thus appeared C-limited, despite the operation of a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism. Cells cultured on air-CO 2 had less protein and starch and 28 % more glycerol, but the pigment content was unchanged. In only one growth regime was the cell glycerol concentration sufficient to maintain osmotic equilibrium with the external medium, indicating that an additional osmoticum was required. It appears that the N source, {{as well as the}} growth [CO 2], substantially modifies photosynthetic and growth characteristics, light-independent C metabolism, and C-allocation patterns of D. salina cells...|$|R

Insulin and its counteracting hormones regulate the hepatic expression of KLF15.
