40|$|An informal, {{online survey}} of 1, 059 reporters and <b>public</b> <b>information</b> <b>officers,</b> {{conducted}} {{this year by}} EurekAlert! (www. eurekalert. org), the science-news Web service of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), seems to confirm key challenges associated with communicating science in a post-print, increasingly multi-media-focused era. As many newspapers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other regions continue to down-size, reporters still covering science and technology say they increasingly need good-quality images, as well as rapid access to researchers capable of making science more understandable to lay audiences. The EurekAlert! findings, released 16 August during the Euroscience Open Forum 2006 meeting in Munich, Germany, suggest that beyond the predictable reporter concerns of learning about breaking research news before the competition or the public, top concerns for today’s reporters are “finding researchers who can explain science,” and “obtaining photographs or other multimedia to support the story. ” Judging the trustworthiness or integrity of scientific findings while avoiding “hype” also emerged as key concerns for 614 reporters {{who participated in the}} EurekAlert! survey, along with 445 <b>public</b> <b>information</b> <b>officers...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 2015 and 2016, the Michigan DEQ {{was criticized}} for {{its role in the}} Flint water crisis; agency {{officials}} repeatedly dismissed citizens' concerns about water quality in Flint, leading to a delay in addressing lead poisoning in the city's water supply.

2500|$|When Shastri {{went to the}} USSR for the Tashkent talks, {{he wanted}} a promise from Ayub Khan that Pakistan would never use force in the future. But the talks did not proceed and {{followed}} Shastri's death on the next day. The Indian Government released no information about his death, and the media then was kept silent. The possible existence of a conspiracy was covered in India by the Outlook magazine. A query was later posed by Anuj Dhar, author of CIA's Eye on South Asia, under the Right to Information Act to declassify a document supposedly related to Shastri's death, but the Prime Minister's Office refused to oblige, reportedly citing that this could lead to harming of foreign relations, cause disruption {{in the country and}} cause breach of parliamentary privileges. Another RTI plea by Kuldip Nayar was also declined, as PMO cited exemption from disclosure on the plea. The home ministry is yet to respond to queries whether India conducted a post-mortem on Shastri, and if the government had investigated allegations of foul play. The Delhi Police in their reply to an RTI application said they do not have any record pertaining to Shastri's death. The Ministry of External Affairs has already said no post-mortem was conducted in the USSR. The Central <b>Public</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Officer</b> of Delhi Police in his reply dated 29 July said, [...] "No such record related to the death of the former Prime Minister of India Lal Bahadur Shastri is available in this district...

The first purpose is to investigate how <b>public</b> health <b>information</b> <b>officers</b> perceive health journalists in terms of trust and how that trust is associated with their perception of media agenda-building. The second is to examine how evaluations of their health advocacy and health expertise can affect media agenda-building perception. The third is to examine the effect of different conditions of press releases on media agenda-building perception. The conditions had high versus low medical jargon usage. All three goals were approached with a coorientation model; therefore, how much <b>public</b> health <b>information</b> <b>officers</b> and health journalists agreed on trust and media agenda-building perception was examined and the levels of agreement were used as independent variables in the study.
