Jordan won the scoring title for a fifth {{consecutive}} season, {{but the team}} {{was no longer a}} one-man show of years past. Instead, Jordan distributed the ball with regularity, {{thanks in large part to}} the triangle offense instituted by head coach Phil Jackson and assistant Tex Winter. This gave the Bulls additional offensive weapons to choose from, ranging from wingman Scottie Pippen and post players Horace Grant and Bill Cartwright to shooters such as John Paxson and B. J.

25|$|Howard {{returned}} to his business as a private eye, working {{in the same building}} as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard managed to recover the necklace. But on his way to give it back to Richards, he found himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain's collection. Upon returning to Earth, he confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him, after he was robbed by May Parker, Spider-Man's aunt. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard was approached by Richards {{in the middle of his}} fight against the Ringmaster and Richards revealed himself to be Talos the Untamed, who revealed that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara located the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but were unable to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> when Talos grabbed it, who proceeded to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos was confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara took cover. He was able to point out that Tara, who revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt (Super-Skrull), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand. Talos was later apprehended by the Fantastic Four and everything went back to normal. Afterwards, with the help of new arrival Gwenpool, Howard prevented Hydra from infecting the world with a deadly virus. He also has a crossover event with The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. Howard the Duck was shown to be living in She-Hulk's apartment building when Patsy Walker moves out.|$|E

GameSpy's Raymond Padilla lauded the game's use of characters and the player categories, stating [...] "When you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>together,</b> you have a broad cast of characters, each of whom offers a different feel." [...] Despite this, the Gimmick courts were labeled by Matt Casamassina as a [...] "distraction" [...] and [...] "annoyance", although he acknowledged that some courts were better than others. Additionally, Nintendo World Report's Michael Cole thought that most players would revert to standard courts [...] "after being 'unfairly defeated' by ghosts, paint, or some other trap."

When comparing the game to its predecessor, reviewers praised Power Tennis for its incorporation of the Mario franchise in the different scenarios and courts.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 1986 press conference, Mann {{said that}} the first season of the show would go from Chicago in 1963 to Las Vegas in 1980. He said, [...] "It's a serial {{in the sense that}} we have {{continuing}} stories, and in that sense the show is one big novel". Mann and Reininger's inspiration for the 1963-1980 arc came from their mutual admiration of the epic 15+ hour film, Berlin Alexanderplatz, by German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Mann said, [...] "The pace of our story is like the speed of light compared to that, but that's the idea— if you <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> at the end you've got one hell of a 22-hour movie". Mann predicted a five-year network run for the show. However, due to budgetary constraints (the need for four sets of period cars proved to be too expensive). Tartikoff eventually allowed their series to move to Las Vegas for the last quarter of the 22 episodes. [...] Ultimately, the show encompasses only the years 1963-64.|$|E
2500|$|The Kanins {{rented a}} house in Malibu for their honeymoon, and after buying an A. J.

They knew they were on the track to a partnership when MGM bought the screenplay. [...] "We would make a story outline together with rather detailed descriptions of the scenes. Then we divided up the writing, each taking the scenes we felt strongly about. Then [...] {{one or the other of}} us would <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>together</b> into a single draft. We did find a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when I felt as if we were together 48 hours a day. Writing with someone else always requires some degree of compromise, as does marriage. When it came down to the question of which would survive, the marriage or the writing partnership, it was a pretty easy decision. But I [...] remember that it was a challenge convincing the powers that be that we had been successful writers individually and would be again. We were hyphenated in people's minds: Fay-and-Michael Kanin. To again become Fay Kanin and Michael Kanin took some doing." ...|$|E

[Picture: Persian soldier] After this answer, Mardonius marched {{again into}} Attica, and took {{possession}} of it; {{but as the}} Athenians were now all safe in Salamis, or among their friends, he could not do them much harm; {{and while he was}} finishing the ruin he had begun ten months before, the Spartans had raised their army, under the command of their king, Pausanias, nephew to Leonidas, and all the best soldiers from the other Greek cities. They came up with the Persians near the city of Platæa. Though a Spartan, Pausanias had rather not have fought; but when at last the battle began, it was a grand victory, and was gained in a wonderfully short time. The Spartans killed Mardonius, and put the best Persian troops, called the Immortals, to flight; and the Athenians, under Aristides, fought with the Thebans, who had joined the Persian army. The whole Persian camp was sacked. The Helots were sent to collect the spoil, and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>together.</b> They stole {{a good deal of the}} gold, which they took for brass, and sold it as such. Waggon-loads of silver and gold vessels were to be seen; collars, bracelets, and rich armour; and the manger of Xerxes’ horses, which he had left behind, and which was of finely-worked brass. Pausanias bade the slaves of Mardonius to prepare such a feast as their master was used to, and then called his friends to see how useless were all the carpets, cushions, curtains, gold and silver, and the dainties upon them, and how absurd it was to set out on a conquering expedition thus encumbered.|$|E
6000|$|The {{fellow was}} amazed at his own good fortune, and hardly {{knew what to do}} with himself; I bid him go take care of his other things, and of his horses, and come again. So he went and {{discharged}} the boor that waited and packed up all his plunder, and came up to me in his old clothes again. [...] "How now, captain," [...] says I, [...] "what, have you altered your equipage already?" [...] "I am no more ashamed, sir, of your livery," [...] answered he, [...] "than of your service, and nevertheless your servant for what I have got by it." [...] "Well," [...] says I to him, [...] "but what will you do now with all your money?" [...] "I wish my poor father had some of it," [...] says he, [...] "and for the rest I got it for you, sir, and desire you would take it." [...] He spoke it with so much honesty and freedom that I could not but take it very kindly; but, however, I told him I would not take a farthing from him as his master, but I would have him play the good husband with it, now he had such good fortune to get it. He told me he would take my directions in everything. [...] "Why, then," [...] said I, [...] "I'll tell you what I would advise you to do, turn it all into ready money, and convey it by return home into England, and follow yourself the first opportunity, and with good management you may put yourself in a good posture of living with it." [...] The fellow, with a sort of dejection in his looks, asked me if he had disobliged me in anything? [...] "Why?" [...] says I. [...] "That I was willing to turn him out of his service." [...] "No, George" [...] (that was his name), says I, [...] "but you may live on this money without being a servant." [...] "I'd throw it all into the Elbe," [...] says he, [...] "over Torgau bridge, rather than leave your service; and besides," [...] says he, [...] "can't I save my money without going from you? I got it in your service, and I'll never spend it out of your service, unless you put me away. I hope my money won't make me the worse servant; if I thought it would, I'd soon have little enough." [...] "Nay, George," [...] says I, [...] "I shall not oblige you to it, for I am not willing to lose you neither: come, then," [...] says I, [...] "let us <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>together,</b> and see what it will come to." [...] So he laid it all together on the table, and by our computation he had gotten as much plunder as was worth about 1400 rix-dollars, besides three horses with their furniture, a tent, a bed, and some wearing linen. Then he takes the necklace of pearl, a very good watch, a diamond ring, and 100 pieces of gold, and lays them by themselves, and having, according to our best calculation, valued the things, he put up all the rest, and as I was going to ask him what they were left out for, he takes them up in his hand, and coming round the table, told me, that if I did not think him unworthy of my service and favour, he begged I would give him leave to make that present to me; that it was my first thought his going out, that he had got it all in my service, and he should think I had no kindness for him if I should refuse it.|$|E
