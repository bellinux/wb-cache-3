5|$|Anne refused {{initially}} {{to appoint a}} new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out {{the duties of the}} office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's <b>place.</b> <b>She</b> burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead.
