We assume that the private information of the principal is correlated {{with that of the}} agent. The main result of the paper is that the principal can extract a larger share of the surplus from the agent than in the case where her information is public. The principal can design such a contract because she exploits the fact that her type is an informative signal on the agent's one. We fully characterize the equilibrium of the game in which different types of <b>principal</b> <b>offer</b> the same menu of contracts that leaves the agent uninformed about the principal's type. This gives more freedom to the principal when setting the transfers because the agent's constraints need to hold only at an interim stage. Informed principal Private values Correlation...|$|E

40|$|How best {{to provide}} {{effective}} {{protection for the}} poorest against the financial risks of ill health remains an unanswered policy question. Community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes, by pooling risks and resources, can in <b>principal</b> <b>offer</b> protection against the risk of medical expenses, and make accessible health care services {{that would otherwise be}} unaffordable. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to measure the distributional impact of a large CBHI scheme in Gujarat, India, which reimburses hospitalization costs, and to identify barriers to optimal distributional impact. The study found that the Vimo Self-employed Women's Association (SEWA) scheme is inclusive of the poorest, with 32 % of rural members, and 40 % of urban members, drawn from households below the 30 th percentile of socio-economic status. Submission of claims for inpatient care is equitable in Ahmedabad City, but inequitable in rural areas. The financially better off in rural areas are significantly more likely to submit claims than are the poorest, and men are significantly more likely to submit claims than women. Members living in areas that have better access to health care submit more claims than those living in remote areas. A variety of factors prevent the poorest in rural and remote areas from accessing inpatient care or from submitting a claim. The study concludes that even a well-intentioned scheme may have an undesirable distributional impact, particularly if: (1) the scheme does not address the major barriers to accessing (inpatient) health care; and (2) the process of seeking reimbursement under the scheme is burdensome for the poor. Design and implementation of an equitable scheme must involve: a careful assessment of barriers to health care seeking; interventions to address the main barriers; and reimbursement requiring minimum paperwork and at the time/place of service utilization.

40|$|I analyze common agency {{games in}} which the principals, and {{possibly}} the agent, have private information. I distinguish between {{games in which}} the principals delegate the final decisions to the agent, and games in which they retain some decision power after offering their mechanisms. I show that, in contrast with mechanism design models with one informed principal, Myerson's Inscrutability Principle fails when there are many informed principals. I also find that, in contrast with common agency models with uninformed principals, the Delegation Principle (Menu Theorem) fails when principals are informed. I then focus on Perfect Bayesian Equilibria in which <b>principals</b> <b>offer</b> their mechanisms without randomizing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{question}} of collusion in mechanisms under asymmetric information by assuming that one of the colluding parties offers a side contract to the other one. We develop a methodology to analyze collusion as an informed principal problem. We show that if collusion occurs after the agents accept or reject the <b>principal’s</b> <b>offer,</b> the dominant-strategy implementation of the optimal contract without collusion is collusion proof. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we look at a different timing, assuming that the agents’ decision to accept or reject the <b>principal’s</b> <b>offer</b> is taken after collusion, so the agents share their private information before accepting the <b>principal’s</b> <b>offer.</b> On the other hand, we assume that the collusion offer includes a punishment strategy, to be used whenever the other agent rejects the side contract. We establish the conditions that have to be satisfied for a contract to be collusion proof and we show that the optimal contract without collusion is no longer collusion proof. The optimal collusion proof contract is asymmetric, both in transfers and in quantities. Collusion Informed principal Mechanism design...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{models of}} common agency in which principals compete in incentive contracts (that is, they make {{take it or}} leave it offers) with models where <b>principals</b> <b>offer</b> agents menus of incentive contracts from which the final contract is negotiated.

In addition, a no-externalities condition is given such that any equilibrium allocation with menus can be supported with competition in incentive contracts. The noexternalities condition is restrictive, but it is shown that it applies in most well known common agency problems, including, for example, the Bertrand pricing problem. Common agency provides a convenient way to model incentive problems in which there is competition.

40|$|Using the {{canonical}} principal-agent setting with adverse selection, we study {{the implications of}} honesty when it requires pre-commitment.

The dishonest is willing to misrepresent his match with the assigned task, which may be good or bad, while the honest reveals the match honestly if he has committed to it. Equilibrium ethics screening occurs if both honesty and a good match are sufficiently likely: the principal leaves a smaller rent to an honest while screening matches for a dishonest by inducing a message reversal by the dishonest. Otherwise, if dishonesty is likely, the <b>principal</b> <b>offers</b> the standard second-best mechanism, while if both dishonesty and a good match are unlikely, she offers the first-best mechanism, implying that no match screening occurs for a dishonest...|$|R
