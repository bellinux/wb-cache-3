40|$|The maxillary full-arch implant-supported fixed {{prosthesis}} represents a challenge due tothe structural {{limitations of the}} existing premaxillary ridge and maxillary sinus. Prior to initiatingimplant treatment, {{it is critical to}} consider the necessary clinical and laboratory proceduresneeded to obtain an optimal level of patient and clinician satisfaction. Consideration must be given to establish a comfortable, cleansible prosthesis with a stable,harmonious occlusion that also meets esthetic and phonetic requirements. A 56 -year-oldfemale presented at the Graduate Prosthodontic Clinic at the University of Alabama atBirmingham to extract 4 mandibular incisors and the left mandibular first molar, due toadvanced periodontitis. Steri-Oss root form implants (3. 8 -mm and 5. 0 -mm diameter) weresubsequently placed (8 maxillary and 3 mandibular). To evaluate esthetics, vertical dimensionof occlusion, and anterior guidance, screw-retained fixed provisional restorations werefabricated for both arches by means of a <b>pick-up</b> <b>impression</b> technique. Cement-retaineddefinitive restorations were constructed and cemented using an acrylic/urethane-based provisionalcement (ImProv).

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} the dimensional accuracy of <b>pick-up</b> <b>impression</b> technique using a Modular Individual Tray (MIT), and {{to compare it to}} the Standard individual Tray (ST) in multiple internal connection implants, considering both the role of materials and the geometrical misfits. Materials and Methods Since MIT relies on stiffness and elasticity of an acrylic Pattern Resin, a preliminary investigation on the dynamics of the resin volume contraction of this material during curing and polymerization process was carried out. Two series of specimens were tested to compare the accuracy of MIT (test group) to the ST (control group). The specimens were analyzed in three different steps during the impression procedure. Linear and angular displacements of the transfer copings were measured and compared between two groups. Experimental measurements were performed using a computerized coordinate measuring machine. Results Investigation of the curing dynamics of the acrylic Pattern Resin showed that the increase of the powder/liquid ratio speeds up the polymerizing process of the resin (less of 1 / 3 of the time required) and reduces the final volume contraction of 45...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of the exact position and orientation of the implants to the working cast is particularly impor-tant in implant restorative procedures. 1 - 3 When a mul-tiple abutment restoration is fabricated, the <b>pick-up</b> <b>impression</b> copings can be joined together with acrylic resin or composite to stabilize them within the impres-sion material. Similar procedures are not applicable for single-tooth replacement, which may imply that minor movements of the impression coping retained inside the impression material can occur during all the proce-dural passages, leading to the master cast. As a result, the {{transfer of}} the exact position of the implant with its hexagonal head to the working cast may be tri-dimen-sionally inaccurate. This inaccuracy can lead to the fab-rication of a final single tooth crown that, clinically, may present occlusal and/or interproximal contacts dif-ferent from those achieved by the technician on the working casts. Numerous reports have evaluated the importance of various clinical and laboratory steps in the elaboration of accurate master casts in regular crown and fixed par-tial denture procedures such as impression materials, 4 - 6 use of custom trays, 7, 8 and use of adhesives in the impression tray. 9 In multiple abutment implant prosthodontics, many technical variations have been suggested to improve the accuracy of the final master casts. Carr 10 compared a direct and an indirect impres-sion technique for a 5 -implant model and concluded that the direct transfer method produced a more accu-In vitro comparison of master cast accuracy for single-tooth implant replacemen...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{transfer}} the provisional restoration emergence profile to the final implant-supported restoration and to buccal gingival margin (BGM) stability after 2 years of function. Materials and Methods: A total of 33 patients were recruited for treatment of single gaps by means of 33 implant-supported restorations. Fixed provisional crowns were screwed to the fixture and adjusted until the complete peri-implant soft tissue maturation was achieved. After 12 weeks, a second fixture impression was taken by means of a pick-up customization technique in order to transfer the clinical aspect of the peri-implant soft tissues to the master cast. A definitive restoration was delivered. A standardized method from digital photographs was used to assess the gingival margin modification (BGM) from the provisional (P) to the definitive prosthesis installation at baseline (D 0), and after 1 (D 1) and 2 years (D 2) of function. Also, marginal bone loss (MBL) was calculated after 1 (D 1) and 2 years (D 2) of definitive restoration function. Results: The BGM index at the time of the final restoration installation (D 0) was 0. 12 +/- 0. 33 mm if compared with the BGM position of the provisional restoration (P); it was of 0. 12 +/- 0. 46 mm after 1 -year of follow-up (D 1) and of 0. 31 +/- 0. 21 after 2 years of function (D 2). No significant difference was calculated between measurements in different follow-up visits (p > 0. 05). No significant MBL was measured between the baseline (D 0) and the 1 -year follow-up (p = 0. 816) with a mean MBL value of 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 mm. Similar result was calculated after 2 years (p = 0. 684) with a mean MBL value of 0. 3 +/- 0. 2. Conclusion: A modified <b>impression</b> <b>pick-up</b> may be helpful to reproduce the gingival margin position from the provisional to the definitive restoration. Moreover, the gingival zenith position during the follow-up period seemed to be stable...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the stress distribution at the bone–implant contact in the pick-up implant impression technique. The mechanical properties and the curing dynamics of Pattern Resin LS were previously investigated. Materials and methods Measurements of the elastic modules of Pattern Resin LS were carried out after complete curing by standard stress–strain tests and a three-point bending technique. A specific laboratory set-up was implemented to monitor the curing dynamics and the linear contraction by using optical imaging methods. A finite element model (FEM) was created and a complete assembly was made with 33 solid bodies representing the main components of the system including the external portion of cortical bone, the internal portion of trabecular bone, six implants, six copings, one bridging structure (modular individual tray), six modules, and six pattern resin layers to fill up the interstitial spaces. Isotropic characteristics for cortical and trabecular bone were incorporated. The stress distribution was measured at the total body of the bone–implant interface, at the external cortical bone surface, at the coping–implant connection area, and at the tray–coping junction. Parametric analysis was also done to study the behavior of two types of internal connection in the impression phase: type A consisting of a 0. 4 mm tube-in-tube connection with a triangular head by three cams (Cam-Log Biotechnologies, Germany); type B consisting of a 0. 5 -mm internal hexagonal connection (Biomet 3 i, USA). Results The measured values of Young’s modulus and the flexural modulus of the resin were 1. 58 ± 0. 12 GPa and 2. 07 ± 0. 24 GPa, respectively. The final volume contraction was found to be strongly dependent on the powder/ liquid ratio; specifically, the tests suggested that the highest value of the powder/liquid ratio (2 : 1) was the most favorable one. In all cases, however, the Pattern Resin behavior was within the linear elastic range, without any permanent deformation or detachment. At individual tray–Pattern Resin interfaces, a stress of about 20. 0 MPa was produced for each component; FEM analysis showed that the stress level at the implant–transfer copings connection was higher than that at the bone–implant interface. The trabecular and cortical bone showed the lowest level of stress concentration. B-type transfer showed a higher stress at the transfer coping–implant connection; A-type transfer coping allowed for a higher deformation area, increasing the risk of detachment. Conclusions The mechanical properties of Pattern Resin LS seem to be appropriate for use in the <b>pick-up</b> <b>impression</b> technique thanks to the low-volume contraction, the capabilities to dampen misfits, and permanent deformation effects. The shape of the copings affects the values of the stress both in the transfer coping–implant connection zones and at resin–transfer coping interfaces. A thicker clearance of the module–tray connection helps in reducing the mechanical stress. The FEM analysis showed that the removal procedure of the pick-up implant impression tray does not produce any irreversible damage on the cortical and trabecular bone structure. Since the yield threshold was high, the stress dis-tribution at the bone–implant–coping configurations was largely within the safety range for the multiple internalconnection implants, in combination with a modular individual impression tray...|$|E
