5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E
