5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in <b>Paris,</b> <b>or</b> that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as great in the Vendée as in <b>Paris</b> <b>or</b> in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E

5|$|Dmowski was {{a deputy}} to the 1919 Legislative Sejm, but he {{attended}} {{only a single}} session, seeing the Sejm as too chaotic for him to exert much influence; he also spent much of that year either in <b>Paris</b> <b>or</b> recuperating from a lung infection, in Algeria. He reorganized endecja into a new party, Popular National Union (Związek Ludowo-Narodowy). During the Polish-Soviet War {{he was a member}} of the Council of National Defense and a vocal critic of Piłsudski's policies. In the aftermath of the war, Polish eastern borders were similar, if somewhat smaller, from what became known as the Dmowski's Line.|$|E
5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left <b>Paris,</b> <b>or</b> Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

25|$|Close {{cultural}} {{contacts with}} Italy, which originated during the Renaissance, had remained strong ever since.
