25|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the arrival of}} the first BAC One-Eleven 500, the airline changed its name on 1 January 1970 to Court Line Aviation and introduced a new corporate look and strategy that focused exclusively on the then fast-growing <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> market. As the larger One-Eleven 500s were delivered, all but one of the smaller, former Autair 400 series One-Elevens were retired.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1974, Court Line went bankrupt, {{with all}} flights cancelled, its fleet {{comprising}} two TriStars and nine One-Eleven 500s grounded, all 1,150 staff {{losing their jobs}} {{and as many as}} 49,000 holidaymakers stranded overseas with no means of getting home. To enable stranded holidaymakers to return to the UK at no additional cost to them, the collapsed group's rivals organised an airlift through the Tour Operators' Study Group (TOSG), the <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> industry association. This operation was paid for using the £3.5m bond the failed group's tour operators had deposited with TOSG.|$|E
25|$|When the Thomas Cook & Son {{travel agency}} {{declined}} Eagle's offer {{to take on}} the role of the airline's tour operator, Eagle acquired the Sir Henry Lunn Ltd travel agency chain. This made the airline one of the pioneers of the British <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> industry and probably marked the first occasion in the UK an airline became vertically integrated with its own in-house tour operator (i.e. where an airline owns or is owned by a tour operator or both are part of an integrated travel group) British Eagle also acquired the Polytechnic Touring Association in the 1950s and formed Lunn Poly from the two agencies in the mid-1960s.|$|E
5000|$|However, by the 1970s {{the market}} {{began to decline}} as people began to holiday abroad taking {{advantage}} of the new, cheap <b>package</b> <b>holidays.</b> [...] Pontins was least affected, partly as they were already providing <b>packaged</b> <b>holidays</b> and partly because their smaller camps meant that they had fewer beds to fill. Butlins attempted to diversify into this same market, purchasing smaller camps, and caravan parks and marketing them under the freshfields name.|$|R
40|$|Tour {{operators}} in Europe and Switzerland face multiple challenges. Yet, against all expectations, they {{more or less}} manage to maintain their overall market share. This paper explores {{why this is so}} by exploring determinants which predict <b>packaged</b> <b>holiday</b> purchases (as opposed to independent travel) by means of a binary logistic regression. The case is a mature outbound market — Switzerland. The results somewhat contrast with previous research, and reveal that choosing a <b>packaged</b> <b>holiday</b> cannot be predicted by socio-demographics, but rather by a given travel situation. Lack of familiarity with the destination, small travel groups, the travel motivations diversion/experience of something new, enjoyment of comfort and pampering, and the search for self-time increase the likelihood of people taking up a <b>packaged</b> <b>holiday...</b>|$|R
50|$|The major {{expenses}} for travel companies were the print brochures and the PR and advertising space needed to promote <b>package</b> <b>holidays.</b>|$|R
25|$|Other {{airlines}} and tour operators {{were quick to}} jump on the burgeoning <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> bandwagon. This resulted in increasingly fierce competition between operators and led to a price warfare to fill planes and hotels. Under Tom Gullick's management, Shipping Industrial Holdings subsidiary Clarksons Holidays became the undisputed cut-price leader in the IT market. By 1973, Clarksons carried 1.1 million holidaymakers — almost 1968's whole industry total — and contracted over 70% of Court Line's charter capacity. Its meteoric rise was entirely volume-based. It generated the required volumes by ruthlessly undercutting rivals and outbidding them to win the race for securing accommodation in popular overseas holiday resorts, especially in Spain. Thus, in the early 1970s, a holiday in Majorca or on the Costa del Sol became affordable for the average person for the first time.|$|E
25|$|During 1995, British Airways {{decided to}} exit the short- to medium-haul <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> market; accordingly, the airline sold Caledonian Airways to British-based tour {{operator}} Inspirations, which was then {{a part of the}} American-owned Carlson group, along with the firm's core fleet of five Tristars. Following Caledonian's sale to Inspirations, the Boeing 757s were returned to British Airways. During 1999, Inspirations became part of the Thomas Cook group when Caledonian Airways was merged with the Flying Colours airline to form JMC Air Services, which in turn became the British arm of the present day Thomas Cook Airlines. Following Inspirations' takeover by Thomas Cook, the remaining former Caledonian Airways Tristars were withdrawn from service as these had suffered increasing and widely publicised reliability problems which had resulted in a generally poor perception of Caledonian amongst the travelling public.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Buczynski and Muto {{went on a}} <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> to Greece, further inspiring the former's {{interests}} in the region's ancient cultures. Deciding to explore this topic further, he enrolled to study for an undergraduate degree in Classics and Ancient History at Hunter College, {{a part of the}} City University of New York (CUNY) located in Manhattan's Upper East Side, beginning there in September 1980. At the university, he became friends with one of his mentors, the classical archaeologist Clairève Grandjouan, and was saddened by her death before he had completed the course. He devoted himself to his studies, which he greatly enjoyed, and was sufficiently successful to be placed on the Thomas Hunter Honors Program. In June 1982, he returned to Greece in order to take part in his first archaeological excavations, which were run by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA). Returning to New York City, he began to take all of the modules that he could which were devoted to field archaeology, considering a potential career in the profession. In the winter break between 1982 and 1983, he once more returned to the Mediterranean, [...] touring Greece and Italy with Muto. He would subsequently be laid off from his job, but gained work in the Hunter College Classics Office. His increased interest in academic archaeology came at the expense of his involvement in the occult, and in the Spring of 1981 he stepped down from his leadership of the Knossos Grove coven, handing control over to Tony Fiara. As his studies at Hunter College came to an end, he decided to continue his education to a postgraduate level, and successfully obtained a scholarship from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.|$|E

2500|$|Dan-Air Flight 1903 was a de Havilland Comet 4 {{aircraft}} {{operated by}} Dan Air Services Limited that, on Friday, 3 July 1970, {{crashed into the}} wooded slopes of the Serralada del Montseny near Arbúcies (Girona), Catalonia in northern Spain. The flight was on a non-scheduled international passenger service from Manchester to Barcelona. British tour operator Clarksons Holidays had contracted the aircraft to carry a group of holidaymakers who had booked an all-inclusive <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> with it. The crash resulted in the aircraft's destruction and the deaths of all 112 on board. [...] It was the deadliest aviation accident in 1970, and remains the worldwide deadliest involving a de Havilland Comet.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Court Line/Clarksons, Great Universal Stores (GUS) subsidiary Global {{was a major}} proponent of [...] "seat-back" [...] catering among the UK's leading contemporary tour operators. It demanded that <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> costs be driven down to the bare minimum by replacing the traditional meal service on holiday charter flights with something much cheaper that would simply give passengers [...] "a slice of pie". Industry insiders referred to Global's new inflight catering concept as Global Pie. The cost advantage industry leaders such as Court Line/Clarksons and Global gained over their rivals {{as a result of}} their onboard catering innovation eventually forced every other major UK charter airline to adopt [...] "seat-back" [...] catering on most flights serving short- and medium-haul IT destinations.|$|E
2500|$|... 1974 {{became known}} as the worst year for the UK package tour industry. At the {{beginning}} of the year, Britain plunged into the three-day working week, {{as a consequence of the}} miners' strike that had been called to topple the Heath Government. This immediately reduced <b>package</b> <b>holiday</b> bookings by 30%. Clarksons, Court Line's main customer and in-house tour operator since April 1973, was facing mounting financial pressure, and Vladimir Raitz's Horizon Holidays, another of the airline's major customers, collapsed during that time. Following Court Line's takeover of Clarksons the previous year for a nominal £1 (excluding a £3.4 million [...] "subsidy" [...] from the airline's parent company to cover the tour operator's projected 1973 loss), it purchased the Horizon group's goodwill for £600,000 — including the acquisition of 58% of Horizon Midlands for £400,000 — from the administrator. The deal, which became effective in February 1974, was based on payment of £1 for each Horizon customer Court Line expected to carry over the following three years. The airline's decision to purchase Clarksons as well as Horizon was intended to protect its business. In reality, these deals did little to help improve Court Line's increasingly bleak prospects.|$|E

Amanda Farah of Clash explained that Odd Blood is [...] "an unabashed pop record that anyone should be proud to play at full volume", while Paul Terefenko of NOW concluded, [...] "Who'd have thought the psych-folk pile, already teetering on the brink of over-saturation, would peak with Yeasayer's second album?" [...] Odd Blood figured highly in several end-of-year best album lists for 2010, notably, at number five by American Songwriter, at number eight by Time and by Drowned in Sound, at number nine by One Thirty BPM, at number 11 by Under the Radar, at number 12 by Spin, at number 14 by The Guardian, and at number 15 by NME and Q.
