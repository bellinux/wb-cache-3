40|$|Abstract Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the acceptability of}} iron and iron-alloy cooking pots prior to an intervention trial and to investigate factors affecting retention and use. Design Pre-trial research was conducted on five types of iron and iron-alloy pots using focus group discussions and a laboratory evaluation of Fe transfer during cooking was undertaken. Usage and retention during the subsequent intervention trial were investigated using focus group discussions and market monitoring. Setting Three refugee camps in western Tanzania. Subjects Refugee health workers were selected for pre-trial research. Mothers of children aged 6 - 59 months participated {{in the investigation of}} retention and use. Results Pre-trial research indicated that the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pot</b> would be the only acceptable type for use in this population due to excessive rusting and/or the high weight of other types. Cooking three typical refugee dishes in stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pots</b> led to an increase in Fe content of 3 · 2 to 17 · 1 mg/ 100 g food (P < 0 · 001). During the trial, the acceptability of the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pots</b> was lower than expected owing to difficulties with using, cleaning and their utility for other purposes. Households also continued to use their pre-existing <b>pots,</b> and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pots</b> were sold to increase household income. Conclusions Pre-trial research led to the selection of a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pot</b> that met basic acceptability criteria. The relatively low usage reported during the trial highlights the limitations of using high-value iron-alloy cooking pots as an intervention in populations where poverty and the availability of other pots may lead to sellin...|$|R
50|$|To keep up {{with the}} {{increasing}} demand for crab in the late 1980s and early 1990s, boats needed to carry more <b>pots</b> (<b>steel</b> box shaped traps that are used to fish crab). Rather than buying a new boat, the Hansen family decided to have the Northwestern extended twice. Originally built at 108 feet (32.9 m) with the ability to carry 156 pots, the Northwestern was extended to 118 feet (36.0 m) in 1987 to allow for 200 pots. In 1991, when the maximum crab pots a boat could carry was raised to 250, the Hansens again had the Northwestern lengthened, this time to 125 ft. Today, in the IFQ system, they usually carry no more than 195 pots.|$|R

25|$|The process uses a {{salt bath}} of alkali cyanate. This is {{contained}} in a <b>steel</b> <b>pot</b> that has an aeration system. The cyanate thermally reacts with {{the surface of the}} workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate. The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case.|$|R
40|$|Food {{fortification}} involves adding essential {{vitamins and}} minerals to foods to prevent micronutrient malnutrition and birth defects and thus improve overall health. Although maize meal is an important staple food in many African countries, only 30 % of the industrially milled maize meal on the continent is fortified so the potential for better health is still enormous. A major drawback for maize meal fortification however {{is that it may}} provoke sensory (colour, taste) changes in the cooked maize porridge leading to rejection by the population. To get insight in the mechanisms driving this food quality issue, the impact of fortification premixes and some of its components (Fe and Zn fortificants) on porridge quality was studied for maize meal stored up to 10 weeks. Furthermore, the interaction with type of maize meal (super or special), type of water (demi or tap water) and type of cooking <b>pot</b> (stainless <b>steel</b> and aluminum) was investigated. Porridges were produced with a standardized cooking trial. Porridge colour was measured with a colorimeter (L*a*b*) and a rheometer was used to perform pasting experiments on the maize meal.

When applying tap water for porridge production, colour changes were observed for all Fe fortificants (ferrous sulphate, ferrous fumarate, NaFeEDTA) ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to specify a {{probability}} model for time-to-failure items in a manufacturing process. Specifically, I am interested in the time-to-failure of containers, called pots, in which aluminum is produced. Aluminum smelting {{is a very complex}} and sensitive process. The process uses specialized large carbon lined <b>steel</b> <b>pots</b> that contain a carbon rod and a molten cryolite bath, in which the final product aluminum is produced. A problem arises when the pots fail, for example, when a pot is unable to operate at a certain temperature the molten aluminum hardens resulting not only in wasted product, but also wasted time and resources to clean and remove the pot. In this thesis, I investigate different parametric models for the time-to-failure distribution for aluminum pots: the Weibull model, the Weibull change-point model, the Gompertz model, and the Gompertz-Makeham model. My work involves understanding the structure of the data, specifying which distributions to investigate and why, estimating parameters using maximum likelihood estimation, visualization methods for time-to-failure data, and how to test the fit of the models.
