A series of eight dresses, cashmere knitwear, faux fur and sequinned shrugs also feature in the range. She commented [...] "If you {{want to create a}} waist, there's a dress that's going to do that for you too. We've designed it very much around the female body." [...] She also stated [...] "It's not about what size you are, it's about how you can minimise or accentuate <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> body with clothing. That's what we've created." ...|$|E
500|$|Khaled Hosseini {{considers}} pain, love, {{and familial}} {{love to be}} the primary themes of And the Mountains Echoed. The separation of the two siblings, Abdullah and Pari, is [...] "the heart of the book". Both subsequently become [...] "victims of the passage of time": Abdullah, who is older and remembers Pari, agonizes over her loss for most of his life, while Pari is younger and able to forget her brother after losing him. However, {{towards the end of the}} book, Pari is informed that she was adopted and that she has a brother, Abdullah; she locates him in the United States only to discover that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has forgotten her. Hosseini stated, [...] "The question is raised a number of times about whether memory is a blessing — something that safeguards in all the things that are dear to you — or is memory a curse — something that makes you relive the most painful <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life, the toil, the struggle, the sorrows." [...] Thus, the combination of these events make And the Mountains Echoed [...] "kind of like a fairytale turned on its head".|$|E

It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, {{but on the other}} hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [...] Because that's your art. You feel attached to it. You feel a certain way and you want people to go out and support it. The time that you take, it's like a piece of your life.

2500|$|In 1863 Sir Moses Montefiore and the Board of Deputies of British Jews {{received}} a telegram from Morocco {{asking for help}} {{for a group of}} Jews who were imprisoned at Safi on suspicion of having killed a Spaniard. Two others had already been executed at the instigation of the Spanish consul; one of them publicly in Tangier, the other in Safi. Sir Moses, supported by the British government, undertook a journey to Morocco to demand the liberation of the imprisoned Jews and, as he said {{in a letter to the}} sultan, to move the latter [...] "to give the most positive orders that Jews and Christians, dwelling in all <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty's dominions, shall be perfectly protected, and that no person shall molest them in any manner whatsoever in anything which concerns their safety and tranquillity; and that they may be placed in the enjoyment of the same advantages as all other subjects of Your Majesty." [...] Montefiore was successful in both attempts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plan was}} unworkable, however, {{because it was}} drawn up as an [...] "on-demand" [...] operation. Before it was fully implemented, Arnold ordered the {{commander}} of ACFC, Maj. Gen. Robert Olds, to take [...] "complete military control over all <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> operation." [...] On February 18, 1942, all overseas contracts except those {{in the western hemisphere}} were cancelled and their associated civil operations (primarily those of Pan American) were militarized. The AAF had neither sufficient resources nor expertise, however, and C.R. Smith, now a colonel in the AAF, was appointed second-in-command of ACFC in April. He brought ideas and extensive transport experience to the transport command, which its senior officers did not have, developing a workable long-range plan to maintain the civil status of airline operations before further militarization took place. In the meantime Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson opposed the attempt to subsume the CAA into the AAF and honored Lovett's agreement with the airlines not to invoke EO 8974. In August 1942, along with Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, he put the nationalization issue to rest by writing Secretary of Commerce Jesse H. Jones that the CAA would conduct its war support activities as a civilian agency.|$|E
2500|$|Uninterested in {{adopting}} others' opinions, with {{a penchant for}} discipline and thoroughness acquired in Germany, he became an adept of Stoicism, which accounts for his emphasis on ethical values, above all honesty. His devotion to honesty sometimes caused problems in social settings. Analyzing his style, particularly as found in his correspondence, philologist Cristina Florescu categorizes Philippide as a late Romantic, displaying [...] "impetuosity, idealism, a longing for a vanished time, imprudent and abrupt gestures", his flourishes meshing with his [...] "elevated consciousness of Romanian realities". She suggests that his spirit, in order to face a society he often shunned, took refuge in humor. His primary weapon was irony: [...] "whether acidic or gently sentimental, frequently hilarious but even more often stinging". His blend of satire, humor and irony made for a highly specific writing style. However, as argued by his friend Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, his speeches were uplifting, [...] "stirring up inside you, in the deepest <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> soul, the pleasure to work and live." [...] According to Kirileanu, Philippide was cheereful only [...] "because he wants to make others happy"; his scatological jokes, however, were perfectly suited to annoy [...] "the delicate aristocrats", Simion Mehedinți and Matei B. Cantacuzino.|$|E

2500|$|In his Octavius, Marcus Minucius Felix(? — c. 250AD, Rome), {{responding}} to the pagan jibe that Christians worship wooden crosses – {{an indication of how}} the cross symbol was already associated with Christians – denies the charge and then retorts that the cross shape (a crossbeam placed on an upright) is honoured even by pagans in the form of their standards and trophies and is in any case found in nature: [...] "Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for. You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> gods. For your very standards, as well as your banners; and flags of your camp, what else are they but crosses gilded and adorned? Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it. We assuredly see the sign of a cross, naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched. Thus {{the sign of the cross}} either is sustained by a natural reason, or your own religion is formed with respect to it." ...|$|E
