5000|$|In {{financial}} regulation, [...] "politically exposed person" [...] (PEP) {{is a term}} describing {{someone who}} has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms <b>politically</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>person</b> and senior foreign political figure are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums. Foreign official is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, {{there are quite a few}} differences and should not be used interchangeably. The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.|$|R

50|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to determine by such activity alone whether the particular act was related to terrorism or to organized crime. For this reason, these activities must be examined in context with other factors in order to determine a terrorism financing connection. Simple transactions can be found to be suspect and money laundering derived from terrorism will typically involve instances in which simple operations had been performed (retail foreign exchange operations, international transfer of funds) revealing links with other countries including FATF blacklisted countries. Some of the customers may have police records, particularly for trafficking in narcotics and weapons and may be linked with foreign terrorist groups. The funds may have moved through a state sponsor of terrorism or a country where there is a terrorism problem. A link with a <b>Politically</b> <b>Exposed</b> <b>Person</b> (PEP) may ultimately link up to a terrorism financing transaction. A charity may be a link in the transaction. Accounts (especially student) that only receive periodic deposits withdrawn via ATM over two months and are dormant at other periods could indicate that they are becoming active to prepare for an attack.|$|R

Thereafter, the percentage increased between 2011 and 2015 towards the same level as when the survey was commenced (when the percentage of <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> was 5.0%). Exposure to harassment is more common for women than men, and most common among the youngest in the survey (in the 16-19 age bracket). It is most common for the perpetrator to be unknown to the victim.|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) was detected in Singapore {{at the beginning}} of March 2003. The outbreak, initiated by a traveler to Hong Kong in late February 2003, led to sequential spread of SARS to three major acute care hospitals in Singapore. The critical factor in containing this outbreak was early detection and complete assessment of movements and follow-up of patients, healthcare workers, and visitors who were contacts. Visitor records were important in helping identify <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> who could carry the infection into the community. In the three hospital outbreaks, three different containment strategies were used to contain spread of infection: closing an entire hospital, removing all potentially infected persons to a dedicated SARS hospital, and managing <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> in place. On the basis of this experience, if a nosocomial outbreak is detected late, a hospital may need to be closed in order to contain spread of the disease. Outbreaks detected early can be managed by either removing all <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> to a designated location or isolating and managing them in place...|$|R
40|$|Sister-chromatid {{exchange}} (SCE) {{in blood}} lymphocytes, serum tumors markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and {{tissue polypeptide antigen}} (TPA), and urinary excretion of chromium, cobalt and nickel were determined in 26 male workers occupationally exposed to chromium, cobalt and nickel dust and in 25 controls matched for age and smoking habits. The differences in the urinary excretion of metals between <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> and controls were statistically significant. An analysis of variance on the SCE rank values revealed that both exposure status (<b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> vs. controls) and smoking habits (smokers and former smokers vs. never smokers) had a statistically significant effect. For the tumor markers, the analysis of variance did not reveal {{a statistically significant difference}} between <b>exposed</b> <b>persons</b> and controls. However, CEA serum levels were significantly correlated not only with smoking habits but also with duration of exposure. As cobalt is only weakly mutagenic, these results suggest that the small amount of absorbed chromium and nickel may have been sufficient to induce SCE. The hypothesis that tumor markers may be increased in groups of subjects exposed to genotoxic substances deserves further study...|$|R

The owner of a third anonymous shell company in Panama, Egrant Inc, whose existence was revealed in the same document referring to the other two companies, remains unknown, although the strict secrecy observed in its acquisition, including the avoidance of e-mail communications and the utilization of communications via Skype, have fuelled strong suspicions that a third top Maltese politically exposed person is involved.|$|E
