40|$|Abstract — In <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> technology, an {{effective}} way to reduce transients produced by switching action, equipment failure preventions, and to inhance power quality, that is, already defined controlled strategies are to close and/or open each independent circuit breaker pole. <b>Controlled</b> <b>switching</b> of high voltage AC gas circuit breaker (GCB) and explains the <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> methods that are existing now a days is presented in this paper. Also the paper discusses the merits of <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> technology with an application. The accurate prediction of the operating time, subject to the various affecting parameters at that instant. Consistency of CB open and closing time is decides the success of CSS and reliability of CSW device to operate in high voltage environment system. The work presented in the paper focuses on suitability check of the circuit breaker for <b>controlled</b> <b>switching</b> application from mechanical scatter point of view and finds the mechanical scatter window.

40|$|A Distributed Switch {{is a set}} of FCDFs {{associated}} with at least one <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> that <b>controls</b> the operations of the set of FCDFs. Figure 42 shows an example of Distributed Switch composed of a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and two FCDFs. From an external point of view (i. e., outside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), a Distribut-ed Switch behaves as a Fibre Channel Switch. In particular, a Distributed Switch supports the instan-tiation of N_Port to F_Port links and of E_Port to E_Port links (ISLs). N_Port to F_Port links are supported by both FCDFs and <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switches,</b> while ISLs are supported only by <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switches.</b> This means {{that it is possible to}} connect a Distributed Switch to another Switch only through a <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch,</b> not through an FCDF. From an internal point of view (i. e., inside the dotted and dashed black line in figure 42), A_Port to A_Port links (ASLs) enable FC frames forwarding between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs, as well as between FCDFs. ASLs are also used to exchange control information between <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> and FCDFs. The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses one or more Virtual Domain_IDs Domain_ID to perform N_Port_ID allo-cations for N_Ports connected to the FCDF Set FCDFs of the Distributed Switch (i. e., a Virtual Domain_ID is used as the most significant byte in the N_Port_IDs allocated to N_Ports that are at-tached to an FCDF of the FCDF SetDistributed <b>Switch).</b> The <b>Controlling</b> <b>Switch</b> uses also another Domain_ID, called Principal Domain, for its normal functions as a Fibre Channel Switch. As a result, a Distributed Switch such as the one shown in figure 42 uses at least two Domain_IDs: one for the Principal Domain and one or more for the Virtual Domain. To properly support the operations of a Vir...|$|R

This technique reduces {{the number of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>switches</b> used in conventional multilevel inverter.

A multi conversion cell consists of three equal voltage sources with three <b>controlled</b> <b>switches</b> and three diodes. In conventional method, twelve <b>controlled</b> <b>switches</b> are used to obtain seven levels. Due to involvement of twelve switches the harmonics, switching losses, cost and total harmonic distortion are increased.

40|$|Abstract- A new carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) - based <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> is introduced. The new CNT device {{is a field}} emission – based device that uses field electron emission from the CNT to implement the functionality of <b>controlled</b> <b>switching.</b> To implement the field emission CNT <b>controlled</b> <b>switch,</b> four field emission CNTs that have single {{carbon nanotube}}s as the emitters were tested; two with single-walled CNT and two with multi-walled CNT. A tube with a tungsten tip was also used for comparison. The Fowler-Nordheim analysis of the DC currentvoltage data provided reasonable values for the local fields at the emitters and the sizes of the emitters. It is also shown within the new implementation of the <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> that squarewave pulses from a single laser diode with 20 mW power and 658 nm wavelength which is focused on each emitter increased the emitted current by 5. 2 % with the CNT and 0. 19 % with the compared tungsten tip. The extension of the new device from the two-valued to the general m-valued case is introduced, and the implementation of multiple-valued Galois circuits and systems utilizing the new CNT field emission – based device is also shown. Since the <b>controlled</b> <b>switch</b> is a basic block {{in the design of}} modern digital systems, the new CNT device can have a wide range of applications {{in a wide variety of}} nano circuits...|$|R

40|$|In the dimmers {{and motor}} driving apperatuses, AC <b>control</b> <b>switches</b> {{consisting}} of thyristor are generally used {{in order to}} control the AC power of load. Those <b>switches</b> <b>control</b> the load voltage by adjusting the firing angle of thyristor, so the equivalent power factor considered as the difference between source voltage and load current are more lagging than that of preadjusting in spite of load characteristic. And the larger the firing angle, the lagger the equivalent power factor. But if we can control the AC power by adjusting not only the firing angle but also the extinction angle of thyristor, this defect is improved regardless of load characteristic. In this paper we proposed this new type AC <b>control</b> <b>switch</b> and discussed on its basic characteristics which were a fundation of its applicatioh. At first constitution of AC <b>control</b> <b>switch</b> was mentioned in chapter 2 and two new circuits were proposed. And next supposing the switch circuits as an ideal switch, we discussed on basic characteristics of AC <b>control</b> <b>switch</b> as the effective value and fundamental component of load voltage (Section 3. 1), current waveforms of inductive load ahd capacitive load (Section 3. 2), and phase difference between source voltage and load current so on (Section 3. 3).

The duty-cycle <b>controlled</b> <b>switched</b> resistor is continuously tunable with low signal distortion and provides a tuning range that is independent of supply voltage. It consists of a single tunable element in the signal path and therefore does not suffer from the area and parasitic problems of digital element arrays.

40|$|The {{power of}} fully superconducting {{rectifiers}} {{can be improved}} by increasing either the operating frequency or the transformer primary inductance [1].
