50|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>hogs</b> were {{exhibited}} in the zoos of London and Berlin in the 19th century. However, this captivity was not aimed at conservation, {{and none of the}} captive populations survived. Zürich Zoo exhibited <b>pygmy</b> <b>hogs</b> from 1976 to 1978, but all females died. The success of captive breeding dramatically increased after the <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Hog</b> Conservation Programme (PHCP) was established in 1995. The PHCP was established under the umbrella of a formal 'International Conservation Management and Research Agreement' by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the IUCN's Pigs, Peccaries and Hippo Specialist Group, the Forest Department, Government of Assam, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust has launched a comprehensive conservation strategy including field status surveys of <b>pygmy</b> <b>hogs</b> and their habitats, behavioural studies, personnel training, local community awareness and assistance programmes, and the establishment of a highly successful captive-breeding programme at the <b>Pygmy</b> <b>Hog</b> Research and Breeding Centre in Assam. Active habitat management has been established and a reintroduction programme has now been launched. (Narayan, 2006).|$|R

50|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog</b> (Porcula salvania) is a {{critically}} endangered suid, previously spread across India, Nepal, and Bhutan, but now only found in Assam.

5000|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog</b> is {{the sole}} {{representative}} of Porcula, making the conservation of this critically endangered species even more important, as its extinction {{would result in the}} loss of a unique evolutionary branch of pigs. They used to be widespread in the tall, wet grasslands in the southern Himalayan foothills from Uttar Pradesh to Assam, through Nepal and north Bengal. However, human encroachment has largely destroyed the natural habitat of the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog</b> by development, agriculture, domestic grazing, and deliberate fires. Only one viable population remains in the Manas Tiger Reserve, but even there, threats due to livestock grazing, poaching, fire, and tigers persist. The total wild population has been estimated as less than 150 animals and the species is listed as [...] "critically endangered". Their rarity contrasts greatly with the massive population of wild boars (Sus scrofa cristatus) in India.|$|R

50|$|Orang park {{contains}} significant breeding {{populations of}} several mammalian species. Apart {{from the great}} Indian one-horned rhinoceros (68 at the last count), which is the dominant species of the national park, the other key species sharing the habitat are the royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris), Asiatic elephant, <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog,</b> hog deer and wild boar. Some important species of the critically endangered and endangered category are the following.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the centuries}} of human {{clearance}} and exploitation, {{the forests and}} grasslands along the river remain a habitat {{for a variety of}} wildlife including tiger (Panthera tigris), clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), capped langur, (Semnopithecus pileatus), gaur (Bos gaurus), barasingha deer (Cervus duvaucelii), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), India's largest population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and the world's largest population of Indian rhinoceros, while Asian black bears live in the higher slopes of the valley sides. Most of these mammals are threatened or endangered species. The Brahmaputra is a natural barrier to the migration of much wildlife and many species, such as the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog,</b> hispid hare, or the Malayan sun bear, pig-tailed macaque, golden langur, stump-tailed macaque, western hoolock gibbon live {{on one side of the}} river only. The area is a meeting point of species of Indian and Malayan origin. The endemic mammals of the valley are the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog</b> and the hispid hare, both of which inhabit the grasslands of the riverbanks.|$|R

50|$|Conservation of {{the species}} has been {{hampered}} {{by the lack of}} public support, unlike that for charismatic South Asian mammals such as the Bengal tiger or Indian rhinoceros. Local political unrest in the area has also severely hampered effective conservation efforts, but these conflicts have now ceased..

25|$|Assam has conserved the one-horned Indian {{rhinoceros}} {{from near}} extinction, {{along with the}} <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog,</b> tiger and numerous species of birds, and it provides {{one of the last}} wild habitats for the Asian elephant. Kaziranga and Manas are both World Heritage Sites. The state contains Sal tree forests and forest products, much depleted from earlier times. A land of high rainfall, Assam displays greenery.

It is also the only Bhutanese park {{inhabited}} by the one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) and wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee). Hundreds of species of birds — including four species of hornbills - rufous-necked, wreathed, pied and great Indian — also live in the vast park.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, many {{artiodactyls}} {{have declined}} significantly in numbers, {{and some have}} even gone extinct, largely due to over-hunting, and, more recently, habitat destruction. Extinct species include several gazelles (such as the Arabian gazelle), the Malagasy hippopotamus, the bluebuck, and Schomburgk's deer. Two species, the Scimitar-horned oryx and Pere David's deer, are extinct in the wild. Fourteen species are considered critically endangered, including the addax, the kouprey, the Bactrian camel, Przewalski's gazelle, the saiga, and the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog.</b> Twenty-four species are considered endangered.|$|R

50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as {{the only member of}} the genus Porcula, by Brian Houghton Hodgson but was later moved with other pig species in the genus Sus and named Sus salvanius. A 2007 genetic analysis of the variation in a large section of mitochondrial DNA suggested that the original classification of the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog</b> as a distinct genus was justified. The resurrection of the original genus status and the species name Porcula salvania has been adopted by GenBank. The species name salvania is after the sal forests where it was found.|$|R

50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{has been}} successful in the past. The Pere David's deer was successfully saved through captive breeding programs after almost being hunted to extinction in China. Captive-breeding is employed by modern conservationists, and has saved a wide variety of species from extinction, ranging from birds (e.g., the pink pigeon), mammals (e.g., the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog),</b> reptiles (e.g., the Round Island boa) and amphibians (e.g., poison arrow frogs). Their efforts were successful in reintroducing the Arabian oryx (under the auspices of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society), in 1963. The Przewalski's horse was also successfully reintroduced in the wild after being bred in captivity.|$|R
50|$|They {{are small}} to medium animals, varying {{in size from}} 58 to 66 cm in length, and 6 to 9 kg in weight {{in the case of}} the <b>pygmy</b> <b>hog,</b> to 130 - 210 cm and 100 - 275 kg in the giant forest hog. They have large heads and short necks, with {{relatively}} small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female's cervix.|$|R
