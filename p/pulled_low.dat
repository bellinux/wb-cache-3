25|$|NAND flash {{also uses}} floating-gate transistors, {{but they are}} {{connected}} {{in a way that}} resembles a NANDgate: several transistors are connected in series, and the bit line is <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> only if all the word lines are pulled high (above the transistors' VT). These groups are then connected via some additional transistors to a NOR-style bit line array {{in the same way that}} single transistors are linked in NORflash.|$|E
25|$|Below is {{an example}} of bit-banging the SPI {{protocol}} as an SPI master with CPOL=0, CPHA=0, and eight bits per transfer. The example is written in the C programming language. Because this is CPOL=0 the clock must be <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> before the chip select is activated. The chip select line must be activated, which normally means being toggled low, for the peripheral {{before the start of the}} transfer, and then deactivated afterward. Most peripherals allow or require several transfers while the select line is low; this routine might be called several times before deselecting the chip.|$|E
25|$|This {{standard}} defines an Alert# {{signal that}} is used by an eSPI slave to request service from the master. In a performance-oriented design or a design with only one eSPI slave, each eSPI slave will have its Alert# pin connected to an Alert# pin on the eSPI master that is dedicated to each slave, allowing the eSPI master to grant low-latency service because the eSPI master will know which eSPI slave needs service and will not need to poll all of the slaves to determine which device needs service. In a budget design with more than one eSPI slave, all of the Alert# pins of the slaves are connected to one Alert# pin on the eSPI master in a wired-OR connection, which will require the master to poll all the slaves to determine which ones need service when the Alert# signal is <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> by one or more peripherals that need service. Only after all of the devices are serviced will the Alert# signal be pulled high due to none of the eSPI slaves needing service and therefore pulling the Alert# signal low.|$|E

5000|$|Send a [...] "Repeated start": Set SDA high, let SCL go high, and <b>pull</b> SDA <b>low</b> again. This {{starts a}} new I²C bus {{transaction}} without releasing the bus.|$|R
50|$|A not {{so common}} use for old laptops is as generic SMBus readers, as the {{internal}} EEPROM on the module can be disabled once the BIOS has read {{it so the}} bus is essentially available for use. The method used is to <b>pull</b> <b>low</b> the A0,A1 lines so the internal memory shuts down, allowing the external device to access the SMBus. Once this is done, a custom Linux build or DOS application can then access the external device. A common use is recovering data from LCD panel memory chips to retrofit a generic panel into a proprietary laptop.|$|R
500|$|As Marko matured, {{he became}} headstrong; Vukašin {{once said that}} he had no control over his son, who went {{wherever}} he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into a large, strong man, with a terrifying appearance, which was also somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> over his dark eyes, his black moustache {{was the size of a}} six-month-old lamb and his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A Damascus sabre swung at his waist, and a spear was slung across his back. Marko's pernach weighed 66okas (...) and hung on the left side of his saddle, balanced by a well-filled wineskin on the saddle's right side. His grip was strong enough to squeeze drops of water from a piece of dry cornel wood. Marko defeated a succession of champions against overwhelming odds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other type}} of BJT is the PNP, {{consisting}} of a layer of N-doped semiconductor between two layers of P-doped material. A small current leaving the base is amplified in the collector output. That is, a PNP transistor is [...] "on" [...] when its base is <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> relative to the emitter.|$|E
60|$|Upon the {{opposite}} side the stranger approached {{the doorway to the}} mill. The rain was falling in blinding sheets. Ominously the thunder roared. Vivid flashes of lightning shot the heavens. The watchman, coming suddenly from the doorway, his hat brim <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> over his eyes, passed within a couple of paces of the stranger without seeing him.|$|E
50|$|Once SCL is high, {{the master}} waits a minimum time (4 μs for standard-speed I²C) {{to ensure that}} the {{receiver}} has seen the bit, then <b>pulls</b> it <b>low</b> again. This completes transmission of one bit.|$|R
5|$|Critchlow himself {{appears in}} a number of Thrud strips, {{occasionally}} as a narrator although more often as a drinking companion for Thrud. Critchlow depicts himself with lank hair and a large cap <b>pulled</b> down <b>low</b> over his eyes.|$|R

60|$|They {{had walked}} {{a quarter of}} a mile, when they saw four {{horsemen}} coming on the road. They were closely wrapped up in cloaks, and as they passed, with their heads bent down to meet the force of the gale and their broad brimmed hats <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> down over their eyes, the boys did nor get even a glimpse of their features.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, {{as he stood}} near {{the other side of}} the bed. His cap was <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> over his brow, his black {{overcoat}} was buttoned close up to his chin. His face was strange and luminous. He was inevitable as a supernatural being. When she had seen him, she knew. She knew there was something fatal in the situation, and she must accept it. Yet she must challenge him.|$|E
60|$|The {{cause was}} {{the figure of}} a man {{squatting}} behind the spruce and peering intently into the valley. He wore a fur cup <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> to shade his eyes, and this, together with the distance, made it impossible for Upton to see his features clearly, but somehow he received an unshakable conviction that it was an Indian or a half-breed. A rifle leaned against the tree and doubtless it was the glint of the sun on its polished surface that had produced the mysterious flashes that had first caught his attention.|$|E
2500|$|A PCI bus {{transaction}} {{begins with}} an address phase. [...] The initiator, seeing that it has GNT# and the bus is idle, drives the target address onto the AD lines, the associated command (e.g. memory read, or I/O write) on the C/BE# lines, and <b>pulls</b> FRAME# <b>low.</b>|$|R
60|$|Rochester strolled {{through the}} open French-window into the flower-garden. He <b>pulled</b> a <b>low</b> basket chair out into the sun, close to a bed of pink and white hyacinths. A man-servant, seeing him, brought out the morning papers, which had just arrived, but Rochester waved them away.|$|R

60|$|Poor Thady was signally defeated. There {{he stood}} {{with his back to}} the fire, his old and dirty hat <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> over his brow, his hands stuck into the pockets of his much worn {{shooting}} coat, his strong brogues and the bottoms of his corduroy trowsers covered with dirt and dry mould, with the same heavy discontented look about his face which he always now wore. He certainly appeared but a sorry Mentor for a young lady in a love affair! He felt that his sister despised him, the more from her being accustomed to the comparatively gentleman-like appearance and refined manners of her lover.|$|E
60|$|Some {{time after}} this, {{so hard and}} sharp grew the cold that Thumb and Thimble were minded to put on their red metal-hooked jackets when they went out stick-gathering. They took their knives and nut-sacks over their shoulders, and muffled and bunched {{themselves}} up close, with cotton-leaves wound round their stomachs, and their skin caps <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> over their round frost-enticing ears. And they told Nod to cook them a smoking hot supper against the dark, for now the snow was so deep {{it was a hard}} matter to find and carry sticks, and they meant to look for more before matters worsened yet. So Nod at once set to his cookery.|$|E
60|$|Saxon {{smiled with}} appreciation, pointed out her foot, velvet-slippered with high Cuban heels, and {{slightly}} lifted the tight black skirt, exposing a trim ankle and delicate swell of calf, the white flesh gleaming through the thinnest and flimsiest of fifty-cent black silk stockings. She was slender, not tall, yet the due round lines of womanhood were hers. On her white shirtwaist was a pleated jabot of cheap lace, caught {{with a large}} novelty pin of imitation coral. Over the shirtwaist was a natty jacket, elbow-sleeved, and to the elbows she wore gloves of imitation suede. The one essentially natural touch about her appearance was the few curls, strangers to curling-irons, that escaped from under the little naughty hat of black velvet <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> over the eyes.|$|E
50|$|The master {{must wait}} until it observes the clock line going high, and an {{additional}} minimal time (4 μs for standard 100 kbit/s I²C) before <b>pulling</b> the clock <b>low</b> again.|$|R

50|$|Communication is serial, {{synchronous}} and bidirectional. The attached device {{generates the}} clock signal. The host controls communication using the clock line; when the host <b>pulls</b> the clock <b>low,</b> communication from {{the device is}} inhibited.|$|R
60|$|Bostil {{recognized}} Hutchinson and Dick Sears, but {{the others}} of Cordts's gang he did not know. They were a hard-looking lot. Hutchinson was a spare, stoop-shouldered, red-faced, squinty-eyed rider, branded all over with the marks of a bad man. And Dick Sears looked his notoriety. He was a little knot of muscle, short and bow-legged, rough in appearance as cactus. He wore a ragged slouch-hat <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> down. His face and stubby beard were dust-colored, and his eyes seemed sullen, watchful. He made Bostil think of a dusty, scaly, hard, desert rattlesnake. Bostil eyed this right-hand man of Cordts's and certainly felt no fear of him, though Sears had the fame of swift and deadly skill with a gun. Bostil {{felt that he was}} neither afraid nor loath to face Sears in gun-play, and he gazed at the little horse-thief in a manner that no one could mistake. Sears was not drunk, neither was he wholly free from the unsteadiness caused by the bottle. Assuredly he had no fear of Bostil and eyed him insolently. Bostil turned away to the group of his riders and friends, and he asked for his daughter.|$|E
60|$|Miss Haldin {{advanced}} {{into the}} middle of the room; I, faithful to my part of mere attendant, remained by the door after closing it behind me. The room, quite a large one, but with a low ceiling, was scantily furnished, and an electric bulb with a porcelain shade <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> down over a big table (with a very large map spread on it) left its distant parts in a dim, artificial twilight. Peter Ivanovitch was not to be seen, neither was Mr. Razumov present. But, on the sofa, near Sophia Antonovna, a bony-faced man with a goatee beard leaned forward with his hands on his knees, staring hard with a kindly expression. In a remote corner a broad, pale face and a bulky shape could be made out, uncouth, and as if insecure on the low seat on which it rested. The only person known to me was little Julius Laspara, who seemed to have been poring over the map, his feet twined tightly round the chair-legs. He got down briskly and bowed to Miss Haldin, looking absurdly like a hooknosed boy with a beautiful false pepper-and-salt beard. He advanced, offering his seat, which Miss Haldin declined. She had only come in for a moment to say a few words to Peter Ivanovitch.|$|E
6000|$|One afternoon, {{sitting on}} the terrasse of the Café Tortoni, General D'Hubert learned from the {{conversation}} of two strangers occupying a table near his own that General Feraud, included in the batch of superior officers arrested after the second return of the king, {{was in danger of}} passing before the Special Commission. Living all his spare moments, as is frequently the case with expectant lovers a day in advance of reality, as it were, and in a state of bestarred hallucination, it required nothing less than the name of his perpetual antagonist pronounced in a loud voice to call the youngest of Napoleon's generals away from the mental contemplation of his betrothed. He looked round. The strangers wore civilian clothes. Lean and weather-beaten, lolling back in their chairs, they looked at people with moody and defiant abstraction from under their hats <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> over their eyes. It was not difficult to recognise them for two of the compulsorily retired officers of the Old Guard. As from bravado or carelessness they chose to speak in loud tones, General D'Hubert, who saw no reason why he should change his seat, heard every word. They {{did not seem to be}} the personal friends of General Feraud. His name came up with some others; and hearing it repeated General D'Hubert's tender anticipations of a domestic future adorned by a woman's grace were traversed by the harsh regret of that warlike past, of that one long, intoxicating clash of arms, unique in the magnitude of its glory and disaster--the marvellous work and the special possession of his own generation. He felt an irrational tenderness toward his old adversary, and appreciated emotionally the murderous absurdity their encounter had introduced into his life. It was like an additional pinch of spice in a hot dish. He remembered the flavour with sudden melancholy. He would never taste it again. It was all over.... "I fancy it was being left lying in the garden that had exasperated him so against me," [...] he thought indulgently.|$|E
60|$|They were {{in sight}} of the fleeing Pinky in two miles. Pinky looked back; {{instantly}} was to be seen <b>pulling</b> his hat <b>low,</b> stooping over--the demon driver. Milt merely sat more erect, looked more bland and white-browed and steady.|$|R

6000|$|Look at {{this group}} at a street corner. Number {{one is a}} shirking fellow of five-and-twenty, in an ill-favoured and ill-savoured suit, his {{trousers}} of corduroy, his coat of some indiscernible groundwork for the deposition of grease, his neckerchief like an eel, his complexion like dirty dough, his mangy fur cap <b>pulled</b> <b>low</b> upon his beetle brows to hide the prison cut of his hair. His hands are in his pockets. He puts them there when they are idle, as naturally as in other people's pockets when they are busy, for he knows {{that they are not}} roughened by work, and that they tell a tale. Hence, whenever he takes one out to draw a sleeve across his nose--which is often, for he has weak eyes and a constitutional cold in his head--he restores it to its pocket immediately afterwards. Number two is a burly brute of five-and-thirty, in a tall stiff hat; is a composite as to his clothes of betting-man and fighting-man; is whiskered; has a staring pin in his breast, along with his right hand; has insolent and cruel eyes: large shoulders; strong legs booted and tipped for kicking. Number three is forty years of age; is short, thick-set, strong, and bow-legged; wears knee cords and white stockings, a very long-sleeved waistcoat, a very large neckerchief doubled or trebled round his throat, and a crumpled white hat crowns his ghastly parchment face. This fellow looks like an executed postboy of other days, cut down from the gallows too soon, and restored and preserved by express diabolical agency. Numbers five, six, and seven, are hulking, idle, slouching young men, patched and shabby, too short in the sleeves and too tight in the legs, slimily clothed, foul-spoken, repulsive wretches inside and out. In all the party there obtains a certain twitching character of mouth and furtiveness of eye, that hint how the coward is lurking under the bully. The hint is quite correct, for they are a slinking sneaking set, far more prone to lie down on their backs and kick out, when in difficulty, than to make a stand for it. (This may account for the street mud on the backs of Numbers five, six, and seven, being much fresher than the stale splashes on their legs.) ...|$|E
