40|$|Unsaturated <b>polyesters</b> {{based on}} {{ethylene}} glycol have been synthesized {{using a variety}} of anhydride, saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and various catalysts. The structure of the <b>polyesters</b> and the effect of the different compositions on the colour of cured <b>polyesters</b> are studied by FTIR, DSC and colorimetry. The structure of cured <b>polyesters</b> greatly depends on the isomerization of maleic acid to fumaric acid during polyesterification. The colour of unsaturated <b>polyesters</b> cured with the most common curing system (MEKP as initiator and CoNp as accelerator) is firstly influenced by the curing accelerator CoNp via the d-d transitions of the transition metal cobalt. Secondly, the composition of the dicarboxylic acids and anhydride used in the polyesterification influences the colour of the <b>polyesters</b> which depends especially on the isomerization of maleic acid. The cured maleate <b>polyesters</b> have more unreacted double bonds and more polar structure {{because of the presence of}} carbonyl groups, compared to the corresponding fumarate <b>polyesters,</b> and this structure affects the colour. The residual catalysts from the polyesterification have minor influence on the colour of cured <b>polyesters.</b> Copyright (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, <b>polyester</b> and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E

Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen.

5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} <b>polyester</b> mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a natural fibre.

Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with <b>polyester</b> and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E
40|$|Catalyst-free thermal polyesterification has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} potential strategy for designing biodegradable thermoset polymers, particularly polyol-based <b>polyesters</b> for biomedical applications.

Additionally, polyol-based <b>polyesters</b> demonstrated good biocompatibility as non-toxic catalysts and/or solvents involved in the reaction, and the monomers used are endogenous to human metabolism which can be resorbed and metabolized in various physiological pathways.
