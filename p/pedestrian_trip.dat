60|$|But {{here is an}} artist. He {{desires to}} paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic {{landscape}} in all {{the valley of the}} Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm wanting?-- Water there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trip</b> to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.|$|E
60|$|DURING A <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trip</b> last summer, {{through one}} or two of the river {{counties}} of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat embarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very remarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so confusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of B-, where I had determined to stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone--strictly speaking--during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly warm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all things, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much about the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset, or even before dark, it was more than possible that a little Dutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its appearance--although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At all events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me. I sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease--Ponto taking charge of my gun--until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the numerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to be paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light wheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown undergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even to the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon--the most aspiring vehicle, I take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open through the wood--if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees--and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks--bore no resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which I speak were but faintly perceptible--having been impressed upon the firm, yet pleasantly moist surface of--what looked more like green Genoese velvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly--but grass such as we seldom see out of England--so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in color. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route--not even a chip or dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully placed--not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and wholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere, luxuriantly, in the interspaces.|$|E

Built examples of such connected culs-de-sac can be found in the United States (such as Radburn, New Jersey and Village Homes, California), England (such as Milton Keynes) and Greece (such as Papagou, a suburb of Athens) (see photo). Acknowledging their use, Germany, under the 2009 amendment to the Road Traffic Act, introduced an additional sign for culs-de-sac that are permeable to pedestrians and cyclists. (see under signage below). A new system for organizing connected, permeable culs-de-sac into complete neighbourhoods, the Fused Grid, has been developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.|$|E

40|$|Improvement on {{assessment}} {{of air pollution}} exposure will enhance {{assessment of}} health risk-benefit when active travel (cycling and walking). Earlier studies assessed air pollution exposure according to travel time and city-level air pollution.

Due to a high-level spatial granularity, Strava Metro provides an opportunity to assessing air pollution exposure in combination with spatially varying air pollution concentrations. Strava Metro anonymized and aggregated a large volume of users’ traces to streets for each city.

40|$|Explaining pedestrians' {{crossing}} behavior along entire trips {{may contribute}} toward {{more efficient and}} targeted planning of pedestrian facilities in urban areas and more accurate consideration of pedestrian safety. Although existing research on pedestrians' crossing behavior is extensive, most related studies examine pedestrians' crossing decisions at local level and focus on {{a particular set of}} determinants (roadway environment, traffic conditions, or human factors). On the contrary, crossing behavior along entire trips is seldom explored. This paper presents a theoretical framework for modeling pedestrians' crossing behavior along a trip, addressing {{a large part of the}} difficulties involved in collecting the necessary data and setting up a modeling framework. First, a topological approach of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trip</b> characteristics and crossing decisions is proposed, allowing consideration of distinct patterns of crossing behavior along a trip. Moreover, specific techniques from the family of discrete choice models are proposed for determining the number and location of pedestrians' crossings, accounting for the hierarchical and dynamic nature of pedestrians' decisions along a trip. Finally, a field survey method is presented, allowing collection of detailed information about pedestrians' crossing decisions along urban trips, including data on roadway, traffic, and individual characteristics, as well as the interactions between pedestrians and motorists. Preliminary results from a pilot implementation of the proposed framework are promising, and a full-scale application for testing and validation is in progress. © 2010 ASCE...|$|E
40|$|A <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trip</b> is a spatiotemporal process {{going through}} {{different}} states {{and related to}} different decisions made at certain times and locations on the urban network. The analysis of pedestrian trips in terms of crossing patterns is a complex task, which is often further limited {{by a lack of}} appropriate and detailed data. The objective of this research is the development and testing of appropriate indicators of pedestrian crossing behavior along urban trips, and a methodology for collecting and processing the data required for the analysis of this behavior. First, a comprehensive set of indicators for the assessment of pedestrian behavior in urban areas is proposed (i. e. average trip length, number, type and location of crossings). Then, a GIS tool is developed for the storage and integration of information on pedestrian trips, and the crossings made during the trips, with other geographical information (e. g. road network function and geometry, traffic control and pedestrian facilities). The proposed approach is then tested at network level on a sample of pedestrian trips collected by a field survey. The results suggest specific patterns of pedestrian crossing behavior, such as the tendency to cross {{at the beginning of the}} trip and the tendency to cross at mid-block locations when signalized junctions are not available. The results are further discussed in terms of urban planning and management implications. It is concluded that the proposed approach is very efficient for the analysis of pedestrian crossing behavior in urban areas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop and test a theoretical framework for modelling pedestrian crossing behaviour along trips in urban areas. The general question examined concerns the estimation of the probability to cross at each alternative location within a pedestrian's crossing choice set, associated with each crossing decision made along an urban trip. A topological consideration of urban road networks and pedestrian trips is opted for, which enables the overall parameterisation of the problem and the estimation of the number and type of crossings along a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trip.</b> On the basis of certain topological properties of pedestrian trips, an algorithm is then developed for determining the set of choice alternatives for each crossing along the trip. Finally, specific techniques from the family of discrete choice models are proposed for modelling the choice of a crossing location from the available alternatives in each case. Different hypotheses are examined with respect to road crossing decision making process (sequential or hierarchical decision making) and various models are tested in each case (multinomial, nested, or cross-nested models). For the development of the proposed models, a field survey is carried out, in order to collect detailed data on pedestrian trips and crossings in urban areas per road network, traffic conditions and pedestrian characteristics. The modelling results reveal increased probability of crossing {{at the beginning of the}} trip, a tendency to postpone crossings in longer trips, especially for pedestrians with increased walking speeds, increased probability of crossing at signalised junctions, when available, and increased probability of crossing at mid-block in low traffic volumes and on one-way roads. Moreover, the hypothesis of sequential decision making is proved to be more promising for the description of pedestrians' crossing choices along urban trips. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Walking {{at first}} {{appears to be}} a {{relatively}} simple, mundane behavior that should pose no great puzzle for the diligent researcher in the social and behavioral sciences. The review presented here of recent studies, however, demonstrates that the behavior and experiences of ordinary pedestrians are filled with opportunities for empirical investigation and intricate theory building. But, why bring these studies together for synthesis in this volume? I suggest here that there are, in fact, several reasons that argue in favor of a timely focus on the apparently simple behavior of the pedestrian. First, the deceptive simplicity of the pedestrian experience provides an excellent empirical focus for examination {{of a wide range of}} topics prominent in recent work in the emerging field of human-environment studies. Readers unfamiliar with the scope and intensity of research in this interdisciplinary enterprise would do well to consult the pages of Environment and Behavior; Man Environment Systems; Environment and Planning; the annual proceedings of the Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA); and the topical volumes in the new review series entitled Human Behavior and Environment: Advances in Theory and Research, edited by Irwin Altman, Amos Rapoport, and Joachim Wohlwill. Even summary consideration of the many topics that have become the focus of considerable investigation in the last decade reveals that empirical and conceptual work regarding territoriality, crowding, privacy, personal space, sensory overload and deprivation, approach-avoidance, navigation and orientation, mental mapping, search processes, and environmental perception, evaluation, and decision making all bear on various facets of the pedestrian experience. Empirical verification of the viability of these conceptual ideas reveals a void which the study of the pedestrian helps to fill. The inner processes and complexity of pedestrian behavior are far greater, for example, than the outward simplicity suggested by the simple geometrical representation of a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trip</b> as a line connecting an origin and a destination. The complexity that lies behind this apparent simplicity provides a major challenge for the students of human-environment relations...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} support for {{improvements}} {{to the quality of}} the walking environment, including more investments to promote pedestrian travel. Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are improving regional travel demand forecasting models to better represent walking and bicycling and to expand the evaluative capacity of models to address policy-relevant issues like air quality, public health, and the smart allocation of infrastructure and other resources. This report describes an innovative, spatially disaggregate method to integrate walking activity into trip-based travel models. Using data for the Portland, OR, metropolitan area, the method applies trip generation at a new micro-scale spatial unit: a 264 -foot-by- 264 -foot (80 -meters-by- 80 -meters) pedestrian analysis zone (PAZ). Next, a binary logit walk mode split model — using a new pedestrian environment measure — estimates the number of walk trips generated. Non-walk trips are then aggregated up to larger transportation analysis zones (TAZs) for destination choice, mode choice, and traffic assignment. Finally, there are opportunities for choosing destinations and for routing of the PAZ <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trips.</b> This method improves travel models’ sensitivity to policy-and investment-related walking influences, and it could operate as a standalone tool for rapid scenario analysis. Care must be taken when applying this method with respect to scalability, forecasting, and operational challenges...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to define and evaluate a new methodology for pedestrians, in order to evaluate the total PM potential inhaled dose (PPID) and the energy consumption for different trips, according to PM concentration levels, pedestrian activity (external power requirements) and minute ventilation, considering street topography (slope), walking speed and pedestrian characteristics (weight, age, gender). This work introduces the Pedestrian Specific Effort (PSE) modal analysis. It is based on real-world measurements of urban trips to discretize VE and VO 2 according to external power requirements due to speed and slope. Trip segmentations is also introduced. Each segment has similar attributes for pedestrian speed, traffic characterization or road grade and also similar power requirements which enables {{the establishment of a}} relationship between external power and minute ventilation. This methodology was applied to a case study in Lisbon and the results were validated with experimental data. A portable laboratory was used to acquire the necessary information to characterize <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trips</b> (instant speed, PM concentration, GPS coordinates, etc.). Results show, as far as this methodology is concerned, good estimates of PM potential inhaled dose and energy consumption, when compared to in situ measurements, on a second by second basis, varying between - 6 to 6 % in PPID and - 9 % to 8 % regarding energy consumption.

40|$|Walking {{has long}} been {{neglected}} in urban-mobility research, but it is now making its way into numerous studies using various approaches. Empirical data are often processed in well-known models of flow allocation to study the behaviour of pedestrians and to identify their preferences. However, these models assume that route choices are predetermined {{at the start of}} each trip and do not admit any possible intervening decision along these trips. We propose to overcome this limitation through a new method for the analysis of pedestrian behaviour. This method, which we call ‘deviation analysis’ consists of (1)  identifying the intersections from which a pedestrian has chosen a route longer than the shortest path; (2)  defining the segments of the network which diverge from each deviation; (3)  testing the influence of the environmental variables of these segments on the choice of route by using a discrete choice model. Deviations are compared with the cases where pedestrians follow the shortest path (called ‘continuations’), which are assumed to be less strongly linked to environmental variables due to the ‘natural’ choice for minimising the distance travelled. This method is applied to a series of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>trips</b> recorded in the French city of Lille. Results show that the environmental variables used in this study contribute to explaining the route choices with more strength when the deviations involve a trip lengthening of at least 50  m. They also show that the influence of variables describing the visual aspect of urban landscape may influence the route choices and outline the positive role of the urban atmosphere linked to the commercial function of streets. ...|$|R

This study may enable researchers and industry practitioners to understand who moves in the environment, when trips are planned, and where they go, that consequently help them forecast and model the specific trip behaviors and daily activities of pedestrians as well as pedestrians’ trips, schedule, trip sequences, trip patterns and the origin and destination of trips to develop a comprehensive transportation model for the simulation of informal infrastructure formation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{is growing}} that the built {{environment}} {{has the potential to}} influence walking [...] both positively and negatively. However, uncertainty remains on the best approaches to representing the pedestrian environment in order to discern associations between walking and the environment. Research into the relationship between environment and walking is complex; challenges include choice of measures (objective and subjective), quality and availability of data, and methods for managing quantitative data through aggregation and weighting. In particular, little research has examined how to aggregate built environment data to best represent the neighborhood environments expected to influence residents' behavior. This study examined associations between walking and local pedestrian supports (as measured with an environmental audit), comparing the results of models using three different methods to aggregate and weight pedestrian features. Methods Using data collected in 2005 - 2006 for a sample of 251 adult residents of Montgomery County, MD, we examined associations between pedestrian facilities and walking behaviors (<b>pedestrian</b> <b>trips</b> and average daily steps). Adjusted negative binomial and ordinary least-squares regression models were used to compare three different data aggregation techniques (raw averages, length weighting, distance weighting) for measures of pedestrian facilities that included presence, condition, width and connectivity of sidewalks, and presence of crossing aids and crosswalks. Results Participants averaged 8. 9 walk trips during the week; daily step counts averaged 7042. The three aggregation techniques revealed different associations between walk trips and the various pedestrian facilities. Crossing aids and good sidewalk conditions were associated with walk trips more than were other pedestrian facilities, while sidewalk facilities and features showed associations with steps not observed for crossing aids and crosswalks. Conclusion Among three methods of aggregation examined, the method that accounted for distance from participant's home to the pedestrian facility (distance weighting) is promising; at the same time, it requires the most time and effort to calculate. This finding is consistent with the behavioral assumption that travelers may respond to environmental features closer to their residence more strongly than to more distant environmental qualities. </p...|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} two trip typologies. A trip by PICAV {{could be}} a direct trip on board a PICAV, or a sequence of shorter trips (multitask trip) where one accomplishes a number of short tasks that require short term parking along the street, before finally returning the unit. In both cases what is of interest for the proposed study is the overall duration of the trip. Given an origin, a destination, the path between them, and an average <b>pedestrian</b> density, the <b>trip</b> duration changes according to the trip typology.|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian travel {{offers a}} wide range of {{benefits}} to both individuals and society. Planners and public health officials alike have been promoting policies that improve the quality of the built environment for pedestrians: mixed land uses, interconnected street networks, sidewalks and other facilities. Whether such policies will prove effective remains open to debate. Two issues in particular need further attention. First, the impact of the built environment on pedestrian behavior may depend on the purpose of the trip, whether for utilitarian or recreational purposes. Second, the connection between the built environment and pedestrian behavior may be more a matter of residential location choice than of travel choice. This study aims to provide new evidence on both questions. Using 1368 respondents to a 1995 survey conducted in six neighborhoods in Austin, TX, two separate negative binomial models were estimated for the frequencies of strolling <b>trips</b> and <b>pedestrian</b> shopping <b>trips</b> within neighborhoods. We found that although residential self-selection impacts both types of trips, it is the most important factor explaining walking to a destination (i. e. for shopping). After accounting for self-selection, neighborhood characteristics (especially perceptions of these characteristics) impact strolling frequency, while characteristics of local commercial areas are important in facilitating shopping trips...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{increasing}} proportion of urban public transportation <b>trip,</b> <b>pedestrian</b> flow in transportation hub areas increased. For effectively improving the emergency handling ability of related management apartments and preventing the incident of pedestrian congestion, this paper studied the method of pedestrian flow forecast in Beijing transportation hub areas. Firstly, 34 typical sidewalks in Beijing transportation hub areas were surveyed to obtain 2200 valid data. Secondly, correlation {{analysis was used to}} analyze the relationship between pedestrian flow and its influential factors. 11 significant influential factors were extracted. Thirdly, forecasting model was established with modular neural network. The surveyed pedestrian flow sample was fuzzy clustered according to the regional land use where the transportation hub existed. Then, membership function based on the distance measure was constructed. Through fuzzy discrimination, online selection for the subnetwork of the information can be achieved. Consequently, the self-adaptation of the neural network on information processing was improved. Finally, this paper tested the pedestrian flow sample of a transportation hub in Beijing. It was concluded that the accuracy of pedestrian flow forecasting model using modular neural network was higher than other neural network models. There was also improvement in the adaptability to environment...|$|R
