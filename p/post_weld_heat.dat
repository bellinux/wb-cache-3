50|$|Dry welding {{is used in}} {{preference}} to wet underwater welding when high quality welds are required because of the increased control over conditions which can be exerted, such as through application of prior and <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> <b>heat</b> treatments. This improved environmental control leads directly to improved process performance and a generally much higher quality weld than a comparative wet weld. Thus, when a very high quality weld is required, dry hyperbaric welding is normally utilized. Research into using dry hyperbaric welding at depths of up to 1000 m is ongoing. In general, assuring the integrity of underwater welds can be difficult (but is possible using various nondestructive testing applications), especially for wet underwater welds, because defects are difficult to detect if the defects are {{beneath the surface of}} the weld.|$|E

Alloys from area (2) showed an increase in hardness in the FZ and HAZ areas due to the formation of α-prime or martensite, while alloys from area (3) experienced a reduction in hardness associated with dissolution of α phase leaving only retained β in the FZ.

Due to the martensitic microstructure, the hardness values of HAZ of P 91 steel are over 350 HV. However, the hardness value of the P 22 HAZ less than 350 HV. P 91 HAZ has a higher hardness value than P 22 HAZ because of its higher hardenability and due to phase transformation from martensite to ferrite.

Pipes are first heated by induction or ohmic resistance, and areforged together using an active shielding gas to reduce surface oxides. The solid statewelding requires lower peak temperatures than fusion welding, reducing the graingrowth. The low peak temperature also makes this technique possible on oil rigs andvessels where the explosion risk is high. The cooling of the pipes after welding can beset {{to a specific}} rate, providing control over the microstructures obtained. It is alsopossible to add <b>post</b> <b>welding</b> <b>heat</b> treatments to the welding cycle to further controlthe microstructures and properties of the weld. Forge welding has two main components; a thermal aspect and a deformation component,obtained during forging. The effect of the deformation is not considered in thisthesis. The thermal aspect can be simulated using a weld simulator, and gives valuableinformation {{on the effect of}} thermal cycles on the material to be welded. Thisthesis considers an X 65 steel, common in {{the oil and gas industry}} for pipelines. The goal of this thesis is to obtain information on the effect of different peak temperatures and cooling rates on the mechanical properties and the microstructure ofX 65 steel, and to recommend a welding procedure where unwanted properties andmicrostructures can be avoided. First, three different heating times were investigated to evaluate the effect on ferrite grain size. Combinations of two different peak temperatures, 1150 &# 176;C and 1300 &# 176;C, and cooling rates in the interval 1 &# 176;C/sec - 60 &# 176;C/sec were then investigated to study the effect on the microstructure and mechanical properties of weld simulated specimens. Two continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams, one for each peaktemperature, were sketched based on the dilatometer curves and microscopy imagesobtained. Based on the results from the mechanical testing, a study of the intercritical zone of the heat affected zone (HAZ) was carried out for two of the mostpromising cooling rates, 10 &# 176;C/sec and 60 &# 176;C/sec. This intercritical study gave detailed information on the mechanical properties and microstructures through theHAZ. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was done to analyze possiblemartensite/austenite (MA) phases, and to check the fracture surfaces of selected impacttoughness specimens. The results showed no appreciable effect of heating time on ferrite grain size. Resultsfrom all hardness, impact toughness and tensile testing for the intercritical studywere within the DNV-requirement [1]. SEM-analysis revealed possible MA-phasesin the intercritical zone when using cooling rate 60 &# 176;C/sec. This might be the reasonfor the reduced impact toughness measured here. Microstructures obtained for peaktemperatures 1150 &# 176;C and 1300 &# 176;C were ferrite and pearlite at low cooling rates, andupper bainite at higher cooling rates. A peak temperature of 1300 &# 176;C followed by lowcooling rates 1 &# 176;C/sec - 5 &# 176;C/sec gave very brittle results and should be avoided. Using peak temperature 1300 &# 176;C with cooling rates 10 &# 176;C/sec and 60 &# 176;C/sec gave good hardness results, but with a certain scattering in the impact toughness measurements,which must be considered.

An investigation {{was conducted on}} the microstructure evolution, fracture toughness and fatigue crack propagation behaviour of autogenous inertia welded Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 6 Mo. The microstructure and fatigue threshold behaviour of linear friction welded Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were also assessed in both the as-welded and the <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> <b>heat</b> treated conditions, and the fracture toughness was assessed at room temperature in <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> <b>heat</b> treated condition only. The fatigue threshold behaviour of the autogenous linear friction welded Ti- 64 in the as-welded condition was assessed to help understand the edge cracking phenomenon which was observed in the as-welded linear friction welded Ti- 6 Al- 4 V BLISK joints...|$|E
50|$|Consideration must {{be given}} to the <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> grain {{structure}} within the <b>weld</b> and <b>heat</b> affected zone. Together with such factors as the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion, the strength and ductility of the two dissimilar materials and the possibility of galvanic action between the two materials, or other connected component. In order to ensure that acceptable levels of local strain are not exceeded at the interface between the overlay and substrate, either during the welding/heat treatment cycle or during service, the relative thermal expansion coefficients must be carefully considered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Effects of <b>weld</b> <b>heat</b> {{input on}} microstructures of coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) {{were taken into}} account for bearing-Nb HF steel plate. For <b>weld</b> <b>heat</b> input from 12 to 20 KJ/cm, grain {{boundary}} ferrite, degenerate pearlite and acicular ferrite are produced for steel plate with the Si/Mn ratio of 0. 26. For higher input, bainite phase is found {{at the center of}} specimens. However, for the steel with the Si/Mn ratio of 6. 2, granular bainite is dominant at <b>weld</b> <b>heat</b> input from 12 to 20 KJ/cm. For further improving the <b>weld</b> <b>heat</b> input to 24 KJ/cm, bainite nucleation at prior austenite grain boundaries is suppressed in the considered steel. Nb addition has obvious influences on microstructure...|$|R
40|$|Laser <b>welding</b> and <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> laser {{treatment}} of modified 9 Cr- 1 MoVNb steels (Grade P 91) were performed in this preliminary study {{to investigate the}} feasibility of using laser welding process as a potential alternative to arc welding methods for solving the Type IV cracking problem in P 91 steel welds. The mechanical and metallurgical testing of the pulsed Nd:YAG laser-welded samples shows the following conclusions: (1) both bead-on-plate and circumferential butt welds made by a pulsed Nd:YAG laser show good welds that are free of microcracks and porosity. The narrow heat affected zone has a homogeneous grain structure without conventional soft hardness zone where the Type IV cracking occurs in conventional arc welds. (2) The laser weld tests also show that the same laser welder {{has the potential to}} be used as a multi-function tool for weld surface remelting, glazing or <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> tempering to reduce the weld surface defects and to increase the cracking resistance and toughness of the welds. (3) The Vicker hardness of laser welds in the <b>weld</b> and <b>heat</b> affected zone was 420 - 500 HV with peak hardness in the HAZ compared to 240 HV of base metal. <b>Post</b> <b>weld</b> laser treatment was able to slightly reduce the peak hardness and smooth the hardness profile, but failed to bring the hardness down to below 300 HV due to insufficient time at temperature and too fast cooling rate after the time. Though optimal hardness of weld made by laser is to be determined for best weld strength, methods to achieve the <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> laser treatment temperature, time at the temperature and slow cooling rate need to be developed. (4) Mechanical testing of the laser <b>weld</b> and <b>post</b> <b>weld</b> laser treated samples need to be performed to evaluate the effects of laser post treatments such as surface remelting, glazing, re-hardening, or tempering on the strength of the welds...|$|R
