40|$|Four monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) {{were trained}} to discnm-mate 0. 06 mg/kg of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) from saline in a two-key task in which correct {{responding}} was reinforced with food under a fixed ratio 32 schedule. The ED of LSD was 0. 01 1 mg/kg. The nonhallucinogenic ergot, lisuride, and the hallucinogen, 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, substituted completely for LSD (ED values were 0. 0098 and 0. 45 mg/kg, respectively). Mescaline (1 - 40 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (0. 1 - 0. 625 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0. 1 - 0. 5 mg/kg) did not substi-tute for LSD. In antagonism testing with ketanserin (1 - 1 0 mg/ kg) or <b>pirenperone</b> (0. 025 and 0. 05 mg/kg), only the highest dose of <b>pirenperone</b> attenuated the LSD stimulus effect (to 55 %). A 0. 1 -mg/kg dose of <b>pirenperone</b> produced nonresponding in three of four animals. The LSD cue was unaffected by clozapine (1 and 2 mg/kg), halopendol (0. 1 mg/kg) and pizotifen (0. 6 - 1. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} 5 -HT 2 A {{receptor}} blockers in CA 1 region of rat hippocampus on spatial learning were assessed in a T-maze, a spatial discrimination task. Rats were connulated and bilateral injection of vehicle (saline) and 5 -HT 2 A- selective antagonist, ketanserin (0. 6, 1. 2 or 2. 4 µg/ 0. 5 µl) were injected through the connulae 30 miutes before training each day. Results indicated that direct ketanserin and <b>pirenperone</b> injection did not affect spontaneous alternation. They also did not show a significant effect on trials to reach criterion and errors made by animals throughout spatial discrimination and reversal learning and reversal stages. During extiction, no change was observed in the choice of the previously reinforced arm in both ketanserin and <b>pirenperone</b> groups. The slope of latency in highest dose of ketanserin (2. 4 µg/ 0. 5 µ/l) compared to the sham operated group but not in the <b>pirenperone</b> group. These findings suggest that 5 -HT 2 A receptors blockade (ketanserin, not prienperone) in the CA 1 region may decrease decision time and increase behavioural flexibility in T-maz...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} D- 2 {{dopamine}} (DA) receptor blockade were mod ulated by ICI 169, 369, a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HTh receptor antagonist, and by other 5 -HT 2 antagonists. Specifically, {{it appears that}} blockade of 5 -HT 2 receptors can attenuate the effects of D- 2 receptor blockade on rat stnatal dopaminergic transmission. Thus, the blockade of D- 2 receptors by halopendol results in a compensatory increase in rat stnatal DA metabolism, which is enhanced by lCl 169, 369. By itself, ICI 169, 369 did not significantly alter DA metabolism. Conversely, several corn pounds which possess appreciable activity at 5 -HT 2 sites in ex vivo binding assays, but possess little activity at D- 2 sites (i. e., <b>pirenperone,</b> setoperone, fluperlapine and clozapine), all pro duced large increases in striatal DA metabolism. Therefore, {{these data suggest that}} the 5 -HT 2 component of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C agonist DOB, the {{selective}} 5 -HT 1 A agonist NDO 008 (3 -dipropylamino- 5 -hydroxychroman), and the two enantiomers of the selective 5 -HT 1 A agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (R(+) - 8 -OH-DPAT and S(−) - 8 -OH-DPAT) were studied in a step-through passive avoidance (PA) test in the male rat. The 5 -HT 1 A agonists injected prior to training (conditioning) produced a dose-dependent impairment of PA retention when examined 24 [*]h later. R(+) - 8 -OH-DPAT was four times more effective than S(−) - 8 -OH-DPAT to cause an impairment of PA retention. Both NDO 008 and the two enantiomers of 8 -OH-DPAT induced the serotonin syndrome at the dose range that produced inhibition of the PA response, thus, indicating activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Neither NDO 008 nor R(+) - 8 -OH-DPAT induced head-twitches, a behavioural response attributed to stimulation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 2 A receptors. In contrast, DOB induced head-twitches at the 0. 01 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 dose while a 200 times higher dose was required to produce a significant impairment of PA retention. The impairment of PA retention induced by both NDO 008 and R(+) - 8 -OH-DPAT was fully blocked by the active S(+) - enantiomer of the selective 5 -HT 1 A antagonist WAY 100135 and the mixed 5 -HT 1 A/β-adrenoceptor antagonist L(−) -alprenolol. In contrast, the mixed 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C antagonists ketanserin and <b>pirenperone</b> {{were found to be}} ineffective. Moreover, the β 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551, the β 1 -antagonist metoprolol as well as the mixed β-adrenoceptor blocker D(+) -alprenolol all failed to modify the deficit of PA retention by NDO 008 and R(+) - 8 -OH-DPAT. None of the 5 -HT 1 A or 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C receptor antagonists tested or the β-blockers altered PA retention by themselves. A 3 day pretreatment procedure (200 + 100 + 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) did not alter PA retention and did not prevent the inhibitory action of the 5 -HT 1 A agonists, indicating that their effects on PA do not depend on endogenous 5 -HT. The effects of NDO 008 on PA were also studied using a state-dependent learning paradigm. NDO 008 was found to produce a disruption of PA when given either prior to training or retention or both prior to training and retention but it failed to affect PA retention when given immediately after training. These findings indicate that the deficit of passive avoidance retention induced by the 5 -HT 1 A agonists is mainly a result of stimulation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors but not 5 -HT 2 A receptors. The 5 -HT 1 A receptor stimulation appears to interfere with learning processes operating at both acquisition and retrieval...|$|E
