5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, Qualcomm {{announced}} it would also compete against Intel in the netbook processor market with dual-core Snapdragon system-on-chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a Snapdragon processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced {{around the same time}} and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5GHz <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> was intended for developing markets.|$|E
5|$|In the pre-digital period, IBM offered Aldine, a font {{inspired}} by Bembo, as a font for the IBM Composer. This was an ultra-premium electric golfball typewriter system, intended for producing copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects, or for high-quality office documents. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, {{as it was}} displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, {{and then in the}} 1980s by word <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> general-purpose computers.|$|E
5|$|Itanium {{is aimed}} at the {{enterprise}} server and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle's and Fujitsu's SPARC <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> IBM's POWER microprocessors. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors.|$|E

5|$|The first (and only) {{production}} model (serial number S5, named Graywolf) was loaned to NCAR {{as a demonstration}} system in May 1993. NCAR's version was configured with 4 <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> a 128MWord (64-bit words, 1GB) common memory. In service, the static RAM proved to be problematic. It was also discovered that the square root code contained a bug that resulted in 1 in 60 million calculations being wrong. Additionally, {{one of the four}} CPUs was not running reliably.|$|E

5|$|Describing {{the system}} in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times {{performance}} increase would {{be made up of}} a three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due to the use of more processors. One of the problems with the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to limited bandwidth between the <b>processors,</b> <b>and</b> to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E
5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their competitors, and developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E

5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' on-board caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems do not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system {{the ability to use}} its own cache to store different things to work on.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro {{models were}} updated with Ivy Bridge <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apple’s only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2015, the 13-inch {{model was}} updated with Intel Broadwell processors, Iris 6100 graphics, faster flash storage, {{increased}} battery life, and a Force Touch trackpad. On May 19, 2015, the 15-inch model was also updated with similarly fast flash storage, increased battery life, the Force Touch trackpad, and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete graphics card on the higher-end model. The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120×2880 displays. The 15-inch models were released {{with the same}} Intel Haswell <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors.|$|E

5|$|The device uses a 65nm process, {{includes}} {{two to four}} cores, up to 24MB on-die caches, Hyper-Threading technology and integrated memory controllers. It implements double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory errors. Tukwila also implements Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus-based architecture. It has a peak interprocessor bandwidth of 96GB/s and a peak memory bandwidth of 34GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has integrated memory controllers and interfaces the memory directly, using QPI interfaces to directly connect to other <b>processors</b> <b>and</b> I/O hubs.

5|$|The {{project has}} pioneered {{the use of}} {{graphics}} processing units (GPUs), PlayStation3s, Message Passing Interface (used for computing on multi-core <b>processors),</b> <b>and</b> some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computing methods. As part of the client–server model network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's database servers, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areas—Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off the ceiling. Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers {{hung from the ceiling}} 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from the ceiling, and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake <b>Processors,</b> <b>and</b> time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E
