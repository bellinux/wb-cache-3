5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases: {{any of the three}} given circles can be shrunk to zero radius (a point) or expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> such as LORAN.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic trilateration, {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the Decca Navigator System and LORAN. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the speed of sound varies with direction (i.e., the transmission medium not isotropic).|$|E

A Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> module is able to accurately determine position without sensor drift, but its usage is limited in heavily urbanized environments and heavy vegetation. While high-cost tactical-grade Inertial Navigation <b>System</b> can determine <b>position</b> accurately, low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system Inertial Navigation System sensors are plagued by significant errors. Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> is coupled with Inertial Navigation System to correct the errors, while Inertial Navigation System itself {{can be used to}} provide navigation solution during a Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> outage. Data from Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> and Inertial Navigation System can be integrated by extensive Kalman filtering, using loosely coupled integration architecture to provide navigation solutions. In this study, real-time low-cost loosely coupled micro-electro-mechanical system Inertial Navigation System/Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> sensors have been used for pedestrian navigation. Trial runs of Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> outages have been conducted {{to determine}} the accuracy of the system described. The micro-electro-mechanical system Inertial Navigation System/Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> can successfully project a trajectory during a Global <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> outage and produces a root mean square error of 9. 35 [*]m in latitude direction and 10. 8 [*]m in longitude direction.

25|$|Far {{from being}} simply of {{theoretical}} interest, relativitistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement {{needs to take}} into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user and is thus in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> such as GPS, GLONASS, and the forthcoming Galileo, must account for all of the relativistic effects, such as the consequences of Earth's gravitational field, in order to work with precision.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga {{with the intention}} of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and dynamic <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While caisson-retained islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.|$|E

500|$|Beukelman and Mirenda {{emphasize}} that vocabulary selection also involves ongoing vocabulary maintenance; however, a difficulty in AAC is that users or their carers must program in any new utterances manually (e.g. names of new friends or personal stories) {{and there are}} no existing commercial solutions for automatically adding content. A number of research approaches have attempted to overcome this difficulty, these range from [...] "inferred input", such as generating content based on a log of conversation with a user's friends and family, to data mined from the Internet to find language materials, such as the Webcrawler Project. Moreover, by making use of Lifelogging based approaches, a device's content can be changed based on events that occur to a user during their day. By accessing more of a user's data, more high-quality messages can be generated at a risk of exposing sensitive user data. For example, by making use of global <b>positioning</b> <b>systems,</b> a device's content can be changed based on geographical location.|$|E
500|$|Future {{directions}} for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing {{the cognitive and}} linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction. AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use. The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies {{has the potential to}} radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices; [...] however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users. Android and other open source operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required. Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using speech recognition systems. Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development. Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions. Natural language generation techniques have been investigated, including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners, data from a user's schedule and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches, as well as information about location from global <b>positioning</b> <b>systems</b> and other sensors. However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: [...] "The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs".|$|E
