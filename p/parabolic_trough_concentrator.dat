40|$|Application {{of solar}} {{collectors}} for hot water supply, space heating, and cooling plays {{a significant role}} in reducing building energy consumption. For conventional solar collectors, solar radiation is absorbed by spectral selective coating on the collectors’ tube/plate wall. The poor durability of the coating can lead to an increased manufacturing cost and unreliability for a solar collector operated at a higher temperature. Therefore, a novel nanofluid-based direct absorption solar collector (NDASC) employing uncoated collector tubes has been proposed, and its operating characteristics for medium-temperature solar collection were theoretically and experimentally studied in this paper. CuO/oil nanofluid was prepared and used as working fluid of the NDASC. The heat-transfer mechanism of the NDASC with <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> <b>concentrator</b> was theoretically evaluated and compared with a conventional indirect absorption solar collector (IASC). The theoretical analysis results suggested that the fluid’s temperature distribution in the NDASC was much more uniform than that in the IASC, and an enhanced collection efficiency could be achieved for the NDASC operated within a preferred working temperature range. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NDASC, experimental performances of an NDASC and an IASC with the same <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> <b>concentrator</b> were furthermore evaluated and comparatively discussed.

These treatments were compared to no solar (control) and solarized (using a 50 µm-thick transparent polyethylene sheet) plots. Experiments performed in the summers of 2004 and 2005 showed that: 1) the temperatures reached and the energy accumulated in the soil- and therefore the disinfestation capacity- were greater with either of the active solar treatments (40 - 60 ºC and 10. 222. 438 – 18. 102. 054 J, respectively) than with solarization (< 40 ºC and 6. 628. 760 J, respectively) and 2) the tem-peratures reached using the <b>parabolic</b> <b>trough</b> <b>concentrators</b> (50 - 60 ºC) were higher than those achieved with the flat plate solar collectors (40 - 50 ºC).

Each TEM array was bonded with a solar selective absorber plate and directly positioned on the focal axis of the parabolic concentrator.

Simulations show that the performance of such a system strongly depends on ambient conditions such as solar insolation, atmospheric temperature and wind velocity. As each of these factors increases, the thermal losses of the STECG system also increase, resulting in reduced solar conversion efficiency, despite the increased radiation absorption. However, the impact of these factors is relatively complicated. Although the electrical efficiency of the system increases with increasing solar insolation, it decreases with increasing ambient temperature and wind velocity.
