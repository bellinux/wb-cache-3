40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation is}} {{conducted to examine}} the effect of the various parameters that influence the compression stroke of a direct injection diesel engine. A method has been developed for the thermodynamic determination of the engine TDC position based on a comparison between the theoretical and the measured compression <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram.</b> In addition information is obtained for the condition of the engine cylinder tightness through the blowby rate which determines the wear. The compression stroke is strongly influenced by, the initial conditions at the inlet valve closure, the heat exchange mechanism and the effective compression ratio of the engine. In most cases these values are not known, so that a method has been developed far their estimation by the present authors. The present work attempts to examine the influence of each parameter separately and determines the error introduced in the location of the TDC position and in the tightness of the engine cylinder. Errors in the calculation of the compression stroke of the engine, will also affect the predicted <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> during the combustion/expansion period.

40|$|The {{cylinder}} <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> is {{a valuable}} source of information for reciprocating internal combustion engines. If processed, it provides information concerning the combustion process inside the engine cylinder. During this process, a problem that usually arises is the proper mounting of the pressure sensor on the cylinder head. The optimum is to flush-mount the transducer to the cylinder head {{so that it can}} be directly in contact with the gas. Unfortunately, in many cases, and mainly in small size, high speed commercial engines, this is not always possible. For this reason, the engineer must position the transducer in a location away from the cylinder head to bring it to continuous contact with the cylinder gas through a duct. From experiments, we find that this may result in errors in the measured values of the gas pressure that differ from the actual ones inside the combustion chamber. In the case of spark ignition engines, we face this problem by using pressure sensors mounted on the engine spark plug, but in the case of Diesel engines, we must mount the transducer separately. The main scope of the present work is to examine the effect of the transducer position on the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> in high speed diesel engines. For this purpose, in the present work, a theoretical investigation is conducted using a simulation model developed by the authors, where the unsteady Bow problem in the connecting pipeline from the combustion chamber to the transducer is solved using a finite difference scheme. A simple combustion model is used to simulate the operation of a high speed diesel engine at various conditions. The theoretical investigation involves the study of the effect of the connecting pipe geometry (diameter and length) and engine speed and load on the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> and on the parameters derived from it. From this investigation, important results are obtained that enable us to determine the magnitude of the error in pressure measurement that results from the positioning of the transducer away from the combustion chamber. The results reveal the limits within which the pressure measurements are reliable and may be possibly used to develop a method for correcting the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram.</b> (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. As recognized by various researchers the most important source of information for a reciprocating internal combustion engine is the cylinder <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram.</b> Its validity for direct injection (DI) diesel engines is extremely important since the engineer can estimate and understand the effect of various operating or design parameters on the combustion mechanism. But, since the measured cylinder <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> {{is the result of}} various thermo-physical processes taking place inside the combustion chamber it cannot provide direct information concerning the combustion rate of fuel. For this reason techniques have been developed to estimate the rate at which energy is released inside the combustion chamber by processing the cylinder <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram.</b> These techniques are referred to as "Heat Release Rate Analysis" and are used to estimate the combustion rate of fuel inside the combustion chamber. During its estimation various errors may arise due to either the cylinder pressure measurement or inadequate description of the various mechanisms, i. e. heat transfer etc. In the present investigation the heat release rate estimation procedure is analyzed at the fundamental level using a detailed simulation model and available experimental data. A source of error is indicated that is higher compared to any of the conventional ones. From the anal is, it is shown that {{it is not possible to}} estimate the actual rate of heat release inside the combustion chamber of DI diesel engines from the measured cylinder pressure trace using existing heat release rate analysis techniques even if all mechanisms are described accurately. From the employment of the simulation technique the actual source of this error is revealed. ksb 201...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} to the engine cylinder is essential for internal combustion, engine simulation, especially under motored conditions. If the heat loss rate is correctly estimated, it is then easy {{to determine if a}} low maximum compression pressure is due to increased blowby or not. This paper proposes a method to determine the heat flux rate to the combustion chamber walls of a motored DI diesel engine and evaluate the heat transfer model used. The method is based on processing the measured <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> Li the engine cylinder using a time step equivalent to 0. 15 ° CA. The measured <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> is a P-t diagram, and thus the TDC (top dead centre) of the engine must be determined precisely in order to be converted to a P-V diagram. The TDC is measured using a magnetic pickup device mounted on the engine flywheel and is also determined, in cases where this is impossible, using a modified version of a thermodynamic method developed by the author. The heat flux determination method is applied on a modified Ricardo E- 6 engine in the author's laboratory over a range of engine speeds under cold and warm conditions. There is very good coincidence between the measured and calculated heat flux rates at all speeds examined, revealing the validity of the heat transfer model used. The results are promising and compare very well with experimental results published in the literature...|$|E
40|$|A new {{criterion}} for {{the determination of}} the start of combustion (SOC) from the diesel engine in-cylinder <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> was developed. It is defined asthe maximum of the third-order derivative of the cylinder pressure with respect to the crank angle. This criterion declares SOC more precisely than other previously published criteria based on pressure diagnostics. This fact was proven analytically and was discernable from the analysis of the experimental data. Besides its accuracy it is also robust enough to allow automatic evaluation of the SOC during processing of the pressure data for a large number of cycles. By applying the first law of thermodynamics analysis to the engine cylinder it was discovered that the third-order derivative of the in-cylinder pressure with respect to the crank angle is the most suitable {{criterion for}} determination of the SOC from the in-cylinder <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram.</b> Subsequently, the criterion was validated through experimental data analysis of the in-cylinder pressure diagrams for various engine speeds and loads.

The cylinder pressure was measured with an advanced piezoelectric sensor at the resolution 0. 1 deg CA. Top dead center was determined with the capacitive top dead centersensor.

40|$|The {{compression}} curve of a DI (Direct Injection) diesel engine {{is affected by}} various parameters, such as heat loss, initial temperature and pressure, speed, compression ratio and blowby. Usually the engineer makes use of the measured motored <b>pressure</b> <b>diagram</b> and especially of the maximum compression pressure value to determine the engine condition (wear). However, {{in order to have}} an accurate indication of the engine condition, one must consider accurately all the previous mechanisms. This poses a very difficult task since, for example, not even the compression ratio is usually accurately known for an operating engine. Thus, a low maximum compression pressure value may not be caused by increased blowby rate, and so this may lead to a wrong indication of cylinder condition. The present work introduces a new method for determining cylinder condition (wear) and especially the blowby rate. The method is based on the determination of the position of the maximum compression pressure value relative to the TDC (Top Dead Centre) position. The maximum pressure position (before TDC) varies greatly with blowby rate, but is practically unaffected by heat losses, initial temperature and pressure and compression ratio. Experiments have been conducted on a Ricardo E- 6, DI diesel engine for various compression ratios, engine speeds and operating temperatures (cold and warm operation) under motoring conditions. Pressure has been measured using a time step equivalent to 0. 1 -degree-CA, while the TDC position has been determined using a magnetic pickup device. A mathematical simulation accounting for heat losses and blowby has been used to examine the effect of various parameters on maximum compression pressure and its position relative to TDC. The results from both experiments and simulation are found to be in good agreement concerning pressure curves, maximum pressure position and their variation with the parameters examined.
