50|$|During the War of the Spanish Succession Churchill {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a capable military commander, and in 1702 he was elevated to the dukedom of Marlborough. During the war he won series of victories, including the Battle of Blenheim (1704), the Battle of Ramillies (1706), the Battle of Oudenarde (1708), and the Battle of Malplaquet (1709). For his victory at Blenheim, the Crown bestowed upon Marlborough the tenancy of the royal manor of Hensington (situated on the site of Woodstock) to site the new palace, and Parliament voted a substantial sum of money towards its creation. The rent or <b>petit</b> <b>serjeanty</b> due to the Crown for the land was set at the peppercorn rent or quit-rent of one copy of the French royal flag to be tendered to the Monarch annually on the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim. This flag is displayed by the Monarch on a 17th-century French writing table in Windsor Castle.|$|E
50|$|The land {{forfeited}} to the Conqueror was re-granted by {{him to be}} held by knight-service due to the king, not to the {{mesne lord}} as in European continental feudalism. In 1086 at the council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty to the crown. In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were either free or not free. The free inhabitants held their lands either by free tenure or by a tenure which was originally that of a non-free inhabitant, but attached to land {{in the possession of}} a free man. Free tenure was either military tenure, called also tenure in chivalry, or socage (including burgage and <b>petit</b> <b>serjeanty),</b> or frankalmoin, by which ecclesiastical corporations generally held their land. The non-free inhabitants were called in the Domesday Book servi, cotarii, or bordarii, and later nativi or villani, the last name being applied to both free men and serfs. All these were in a more or less dependent condition. The free tenures all exist at the present day, though, as will appear later, the military tenures have shrunk into the unimportant and exceptional tenure of grand serjeanty. The non-free tenures are to a certain extent represented by copyhold.|$|E
5000|$|The germ of {{the later}} {{distinction}} between [...] "grand" [...] (French: grand, [...] "large") and [...] "petty" [...] (French <b>petit,</b> [...] "small") <b>serjeanty</b> {{is found in the}} Magna Carta of 1215, the king there renouncing the right of prerogative wardship in the case of those who held of him by the render of small articles. The legal doctrine which developed that serjeanties were inalienable (i.e. non-transferrable) and impartible, led during the reign of King Henry III (1216-1272) to the arrentation of those serjeanties the lands of which had been partly alienated, which were thereby converted into socage tenures (i.e. paying money rents), or in some cases, tenures by knight-service. Gradually the gulf widened, and [...] "petty" [...] serjeanties, consisting of renders, together with serjeanties held of mesne lords, sank into socage, while [...] "grand" [...] serjeanties, the holders of which performed their service in person, became alone liable to the burden of wardship and marriage. In Littleton's Tenures (15th century), this distinction appears as well defined, but the development was one of legal theory.|$|R
