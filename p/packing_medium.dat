The column reactor was packed with spirally wound fibrous sheet material on which a consortium of microorganisms selected from activated sludge was immobilized. The first stage of this work comprised a preliminary study that aimed at investigating the feasibility of the fibrous bed bioreactor for treatment of odorous volatile fatty acids (VFAs). In this stage, {{the performance of a}} fibrous bed bioreactor at increasing mass loadings ranging from 9. 7 to 104. 2 g/(m 3 · h) was studied. VFA removal efficiencies above 90 % were achieved at mass loadings up to 50. 3 g/(m 3 · h). At a mass loading of 104. 2 g/(m 3 · h), removal efficiency was found to be 87. 7 %. In the second stage of the work, the process was scaled up with design and operational considerations, namely, <b>packing</b> <b>medium,</b> process condition, and configuration selections. A trickling biofilter with synthetic fibrous <b>packing</b> <b>medium</b> was selected. It was operated under countercurrent flow of gas and liquid streams. The effects of inlet concentration and empty bed retention time on bioreactor performance were studied: The bioreactor was effective in treating odorous VFAs at mass loadings up to 32 g/(m 3 · h), at which VFAs started to accumulate in the recirculation liquid, indicating that the biofilm was unable to degrade all the VFAs introduced. Although VFAs accumulated in the liquid phase, the removal efficiency remained above 99 %, implying that the biochemical reaction rate, rather than gas-to-liquid mass transfer rate, was the limiting factor of this process. The bioreactor was stable for long-term operation; no clogging and degeneration of the <b>packing</b> <b>medium</b> was observed during the 4 -mo operation.

The column reactor was packed with spirally wound fibrous sheet material on which a consortium of microorganisms selected from activated sludge was immobilized. The bioreactor was operated under counter-current flow of gas and liquid streams. Odorous VFA, butyric and valeric acids were introduced into the bioreactor at various inlet concentrations and flow rates. The effects of inlet VFA concentration and gas empty bed retention time (EBRT) on bioreactor performance were investigated. The effect of inlet concentration was studied by increasing the gaseous VFA concentrations at fixed EBRTs of 90, 60, 45 and 30 s. While the effect of EBRT was investigated by increasing the gas superficial velocity or shortening EBRT, at different inlet VFA concentrations of 0. 08, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 7 g/m 3.

40|$|La connaissance, actuellement très limitée, du métabolisme des bactéries acétogènes intervenant dans la biodégradation anaérobie de l'acide butyrique et d'un de ses sous-produits, l'acide crotonique, est à l'origine de cette étude. Après avoir mis au point un réacteur anaérobie à biomasse fixée, cette dernière a, dans un premier temps, été adaptée à la biodégradation {{exclusive}} du butyrate. La dégradation du crotonate a ensuite été étudiée, selon différents protocoles expérimentaux (pulses de crotonate en alimentation continue avec du butyrate puis alimentation continue avec du crotonate). Des injections de crotonate ont également été effectuées en circuit fermé, avec une biomasse adaptée dans un premier temps à la dégradation d'un mélange d'AGV, le réacteur étant ensuite alimenté avec du propionate puis du butyrate seuls. Contrairement à ce que laissait penser la bibliographie, il a été constaté que les bactéries adaptées à la dégradation exclusive du butyrate sons très rapidement à même de dégrader le crotonate. Les résultats obtenus permettent d'approcher les spécificités bactériennes, la voie catabolique suivie par le crotonate, son mode de régulation enzymatique et les équilibres qui la gouvernent. C'est ainsi qu'il est possible de proposer un modèle explicatif relativement simple du mécanisme de biodégradation du crotonate. Volatile Fatty Acids (VFAs) are intermediate metabolites {{formed in}} the anaerobic biodegradation of organic matter. They are commonly found in sewage, municipal sanitary landfill leachate and effluents from agricultural and food-processing industries. A good knowledge of the microorganisms involved in VFA biodegradation is necessary to operate satisfactory biotreatment of those effluents. The objective {{of the present study}} is to better understand the metabolism of the anaerobic bacteria responsible for the degradation of butyric acid and one of its metabolites (crotonic acid), which is still poorly known. Syntrophomonaswolfei {{is one of the few}} butyrate-degrading acetogenic bacteria that bas been documented. First studios have shown that this microorganism is not capable of degrading crotonic acid (MCINERNEY et al., 1979, 1981). This is surprising since crotonyl-Coenzyme A, in its activated form, is an intermediate metabolite of n-butyrate ß-oxidation, which is the most common mechanism of butyrate biodegradation. In addition, ß-oxidatlon of crotonate is thermodynamically possible, even under standard conditions. These observations are al the origin of the present study, which investigates the anaerobic biodegradation of crotonate. Other Investigators have followed a similar approach and isolated S. wolfei in pure culture on crotonate. The degradation of crotonate was studied in a bench-scale up-flow anaerobic filter of twenty liters, operated in the dark, at 35 °C. A first set of experiments was carried out with a biomass exclusively adapted to the biodegradation of butyrate. Heat-expansed vermiculite was used as a <b>packing</b> <b>medium.</b> Various experimental protocols were successive followed. First, pulses of crotonate were injected into the reactor under conditions of continuous feeding with butyrate, and then, the reactor was continuously fed with crotonate. The objective was to determine whether a bacterial population exclusively adapted to butyrate biodegradation would be capable of degrading crotonate. It was found that crotonate was actually biodegraded in the reactor. Woth the first protocol, when pulses of crotonate were injected into the reactor, crotonate was totally removed in 55 hours (fig. 3). Butyrate and acetate concentrations increased as crotonate was degraded, but no significant increase in biogas production was observed. On the other hand, under the same conditions, it was found that iso-butyrate was not degraded, which is consistent with other published data (MCINERNEY et al., 1979, 1981; STIEB and SCHINK, 1985, 1989). With the second protocol (continuous feeding with crotonate at 5. 2 gg/l), crotonate was totally biodegraded in 48 hours after a 24 hours lag period. This biodegradation resulted in the accumulation of acetate and, in a lower extend, butyrate (fig. 4). Following this stage, the reactor was fed with a higher crotonate concentration (12 g/l), and it was observed that crotonate was totally degraded in 20 hours, without any lag period (fig. 5). These results showed that butyrate-degrading bacteria were capable of degrading crotonate effectively after a short period of adaptation. Further experiments were conducted with a biomass previously adapted to the degradation of a mixture of VFAs (acetate, propionate, iso-butyrate, butyrate and caproate). Berl saddles were used as a support for bacterial growth. The reactor was operated in a recirculated batch mode and spiked with crotonate. Finally, the reactor was successively fed for four weeks with propionate and for two weeks with butyrate, before being spiked with crotonate. In all these experiments, crotonate biodegradation was observed, but, in contrast to the results obtained with the “vermiculite reactor”, no butyrate accumulation occured (fig. 6). These results show that a bacterial population adapted to the degradation of a mixture of VFAs or to the degradation of individual VFAs such as propionate and n-butyrate, is capable of degrading crotonate. Based on the present study and on literature data, the following mechanism can be proposed for the biodegradation of crotonate (fig. 7). The first stage is the activation of crotonate into crotonyl-Coenzyme A by an acetyl-CoA/crotonyl-CoA transferase, as recently isolated from S. wolfei (BEATY and MCINERNEY, 1987). When present at low concentrations, crotonate is probably directly degraded into acetate, as shown by the results obtained with the “selles de Berl reactor”, in which no intermediate metabolite has been detected. At higher concentrations, enzymatic sites may be saturated and an equilibrium be established with butyrate, which is then released into the medium. This has been shown by the accumulation of butyrate under conditions of continuous feeding with crotonate. In addition, another intermediate metabolite has been formed, which has not been identified in the present study. This product is most probably poly-ß-hydroxy-butyrate, which has been found in S. wolfei (MCINERNEY et al, 1979) although if is not very common in chemiotrophic bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Water and {{sanitation}} {{are two of}} the world's most urgent current challenges (Elimelech, 2006). With a population racing towards seven billion people, over one sixth of the human population does not have access to adequate water {{and sanitation}}. Drinking water is inaccessible for approximately 783 million people living in the developing world (WHO, 2014). This is especially critical for people at risk of exposure to deadly pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae, Shigella, and Salmonella, such as those living in Haiti as Vibrio cholerae is now ubiquitous (Enserink, 2010). On the sanitation side, more than 2. 5 billion people in the world still lack access to adequate resources (WHO, 2014). Almost half of these people have access to no sanitation facilities at all and practice open defecation (WHO, 2014). Thousands of small children still die every day from preventable diseases caused by inadequate sanitation (WHO, 2014). As global climate change is expected to exacerbate these issues, there is an urgent need for the development of sustainable treatment technologies to ensure a better tomorrow for our world (Ford, 1999). Safe water and sanitation technologies, while often disjointed, should be considered together as pathogens transmitted via drinking water are predominantly of fecal origin (Ashbolt, 2004; Montgomery, 2007). In this dissertation project, I explore the use of both drinking water and wastewater treatment technologies which are cost effective and rely on locally available materials in low-income countries. For the drinking water treatment side, I focus on the use of biosand filters in Haiti with a specific interest in understanding their ability to remove the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent for cholera. The wastewater treatment technology consists of biofilters packed with cocopeat, a waste product generated during coconut husk processing, and I investigate their use for the treatment of septic tank effluent in Vietnam. Both of these projects combine lab and field work. The specific objectives of this dissertation project are to 1) compare the removal efficiency of V. cholerae to indicator bacteria in field biosand filters and determine the parameters controlling removal; 2) investigate the correlation between removal efficiency of pathogens in field biosand filters having operated for varying lengths of time to schmutzdecke bacterial composition and influent water characteristics; 3) determine the effect of number of charges, total organic carbon loading, and schmutzdecke composition on V. cholerae removal efficacy; 4) isolate the effect of biological removal mechanisms and physical/chemical removal mechanisms on V. cholerae removal efficiency and determine the correlation to TOC concentration in water; 5) evaluate cocopeat as a <b>packing</b> <b>medium</b> for biofilters in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus and biological oxygen demand removal from simulated wastewater as compared to other traditional packing media; and 6) conduct an assessment of cocopeat-packed, vertical flow constructed wetlands treating septic tank effluent in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, biosand filters in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti, the epicenter of the cholera epidemic, were tested for total coliform and V. cholerae removal efficiencies. In addition, schmutzdecke samples were collected in order to measure the amount of EPS in the biofilm, as well as characterize the microbial community. Total coliform and V. cholerae concentration were measured using novel membrane filtration technique methods. It was found that total coliform concentration does not indicate V. cholerae concentration in water, and total coliform removal efficiency does not indicate V. cholerae removal efficiency within biosand filters. Additionally, parameters controlling biosand filter performance include: schmutzdecke composition, time in operation, and idle time. In the second part of this dissertation, V. cholerae challenge tests were performed on laboratory-operated biosand filters receiving high, medium or low TOC influents in order to determine the effect of number of charges, total organic carbon loading, and schmutzdecke composition on V. cholerae removal efficacy, as well as to isolate the effect of biological removal mechanisms and physical/chemical removal mechanisms on V. cholerae removal efficiency and determine the correlation to TOC concentration in water. To this end, three biosand filters were operated in the lab. Each received lake water or diluted lake water with high, medium or low concentrations of TOC. After being charged once per day for 6 days, the filters were charged with four consecutive charges of pure cultures of V. cholerae suspended in PBS buffer, at concentrations of 10 2, 10 3, 10 5, and 10 7 cfu/mL. This challenge was repeated each time the filters received an additional 6 charges, up to 66 total charges. This was done to determine how number of charges, TOC loading, and schmutzdecke composition affects removal efficiency. Schmutzdecke was analyzed for amount of EPS and microbial community. It was found that parameters controlling biosand filter performance include: TOC loading, schmutzdecke composition, time in operation, and physical/chemical attachment. Additionally, it was shown that physical/chemical attachment is critical during startup, especially at low TOC concentrations. At steady state, physical/chemical attachment is more important than schmutzdecke effects in filters receiving low TOC, and schmutzdecke effect is more important than physical/chemical attachment in filters receiving high TOC. For the third section of this dissertation, columns packed with cocopeat, celite, or sphagnum peat were charged with simulated wastewater and removal efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus, and biological oxygen demand were measured. Additionally, different redox zones were tested to determine if cocopeat could successfully accomplish nitrification and denitrification. It was found that cocopeat is comparable to traditional packing media and can successfully accomplish nitrification and denitrification in the treatment of synthetic wastewater. In the final section of this dissertation, constructed wetlands were built and packed with cocopeat to determine if cocopeat is a suitable packing media in constructed wetlands treating wastewater in Vietnam. Removal efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus, and biological demand were measured. Microbial community samples were collected periodically in order to analyze community shifts between wetlands and over time. This work concluded that cocopeat can be used successfully as a packing media in constructed wetlands treating wastewater for the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and total coliform. Overall, this dissertation work contributes to the body of knowledge on point-of-use water and wastewater technologies. The biosand filter was studied in both lab and field conditions and it was found that total coliform is not a reliable indicator for V. cholerae, and that there are several factors controlling biosand filter performance, including idle time, TOC, filter time in operation, physical/chemical attachment, and schmutzdecke composition. Cocopeat was studied for its ability to promote nitrification and denitrification in lab-scale vertical flow columns treating synthetic wastewater. It was shown that cocopeat achieved similar levels of nitrification and denitrification as traditional packing media. Finally, cocopeat packed vertical flow constructed wetlands were operated in Vietnam for the treatment of septic tank effluent. This setup proved effective for the removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and total coliform in the treatment of wastewater. Dissertatio...|$|E

The evolution of dispersion right from time zero is studied by using the generalized dispersion theory of Gill and Sankarasubramanian and the non-Darcy effect on dispersion is clearly depicted. The dispersion equation {{is used to calculate}} the mean concentration distribution of a solute in a porous medium under non-Darcy flow conditions and is expressed as a function of dimensionless axial distance and time. It is computed for different values of Darcy and Reynolds numbers. Results of several other works are obtained as limiting cases of the present study...|$|R

The Darcy model {{is used to}} describe the flow in porous medium. A coordinate transformation is used to incorporate the waviness in governing equa- tions, and the resultant boundary layer equations are solved by employing Local Non-similarity method. The obtained numerical results for fluid flow characteristics and Nusselt number are presented graphically for different values of ratio of solid thermal conductivity and fluid conductivity, porosity {{at the edge of the}} boundary layer and amplitude of the wavy surface for two cases uniform permeability (UP) and variable permeability (VP) ...|$|R
50|$|Field <b>Pack</b> (<b>medium)</b> - The field pack is made {{of water}} {{repellent}} treated nylon duck and webbing, spacer fabric, and metal hardware. It {{can be used with}} or without the LC-1 Field Pack Frame. The main compartment closes by means of a drawstring secured by a plastic cord clamp. A radio pocket is located against the back on the inside. The size of the pack may be decreased for smaller loads by means of three para-cord ties, stitched to the inside bottom of the pack, and three metal D-rings located directly below the internal radio pocket. Three pockets on the outside, with strap and buckle adjustable closures and with snap fasteners for quick access, are provided for miscellaneous items. The top flap has a pocket with a hook and pile fastener tape sealed closure. Equipment hangers are located above each outside pocket and on each side. Drainage eyelets are provided {{in the bottom of the}} main compartment and the outside pockets. An envelope pocket is located at the top, back of the pack and padded with spacer cloth, into which the field pack frame is inserted when the field pack is used on the field pack frame. Buckles and straps at each side near the bottom are used for anchoring the field pack to the field pack frame. Two rectangular wire loops located at the top back of the field pack and D rings on each side at the bottom of the field pack are used to provide shoulder strap attachment when the field pack is carried without the field pack frame. A waterproof bag is supplied for the main compartment and each of the three outside pockets for keeping equipment dry.|$|R

50|$|Born in Newton Abbot, Coldwell was a Devonian {{who played}} Minor Counties cricket before being signed by Worcestershire in 1955. Coldwell bowled mainly in-swingers and varied both pace and line {{depending}} on the stance of the batsman. Inclined to be expensive in his early years, and one of a <b>pack</b> of <b>medium</b> to fast-medium bowlers competing to be Flavell's new-ball partner at Worcester, {{he came to the}} fore in 1960 when his rivals, Aldridge and Pearson, were accused of having suspect bowling actions. In 1961, Flavell and Coldwell bowled Worcestershire to fourth in the Championship, and Flavell was picked for Tests. In 1962, when Flavell was injured for part of the season, Coldwell bowled more than 1,100 overs and was himself picked for two Tests, and the county finished second, its highest ever position at that time.|$|R
40|$|The {{reactivity}} of zero-valent iron (Fe 0) on the dechlorination of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) and the hydraulic {{behaviors of the}} Fe 0 <b>packed</b> <b>medium</b> were investigated through laboratory-scale flow-through columns and a field-scale permeable reactive barrier (PRB). Full-scale study {{of the performance of}} the funnel-and-gate Fe 0 PRB installed at the Vapokon site, Denmark indicates that contaminated groundwater flowed preferentially through the PRB at a seepage velocity of 99. 5 m/yr probably owing to the clogging of the PRB. An average Peclet number of 7. 30 showed the significance of both advection and dispersion on governing contaminant transport inside the PRB. Based on the past 4 years of field data obtained from the Vapokon site, effective CAH dechlorination by the PRB was observed. Although there was continuous decrease in dissolved ions in the groundwater along the PRB, no noticeable deterioration of the Fe 0 reactivity was examined. Instead, there was climatic variation of the Fe 0 reactivity on CAH dechlorination. Study of the performance of laboratory Fe 0 packed column (LFPC) gave a Peclet number of 488, thereby indicating the domination of advection over dispersion on governing the contaminant transport inside. Comparison of the performances of the fullscale PRB and LFPC showed that there was a high likelihood of overestimating the performance of a full-scale PRB on CAH dechlorination if the results from the LFPC are directly used for the design of PRB thickness. In consequence, a correction factor of 2. 94 was practically determined for the correction of the disparity in the performance between the LFPC and field PRB. In addition, laboratory-scale investigation of the rate-limiting step of the reductive dechlorination reaction of CAHs by Fe 0 indicated an activation energy in a range of 38. 6 to 70. 3 kJ/mol. As a result, electron transfer rather than mass transfer process is the dominant rate-limiting step for the dechlorination reaction.

40|$|Modelling {{variable}} {{density flow}} problems under heterogeneous porous media conditions requires very long computation time and high performance equipments. In this work, the DASPK solver for temporal resolution {{is combined with}} advanced spatial discretization schemes {{in order to improve}} the computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The spatial discretization is based on a combination of Mixed Finite Element (MFE), Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Multipoint Flux Approximation methods (MPFA). The obtained non-linear ODE/DAE system is solved with the Method of Lines (MOL) using the DASPK time solver. DASPK uses the preconditioned Krylov iterative method to solve linear systems arising at each time step. Precise laboratory-scale 2 D experiments were conducted in a heterogeneously <b>packed</b> porous <b>medium</b> flow tank and the measured concentration contour lines are used to evaluate the numerical model. Simulations show the high efficiency and accuracy of the code and the sensitivity analysis confirms the density dependence of dispersion. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V.
