The union strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a strike ballot, which enabled a minority to keep working and kept other unions from supporting it.|$|E

5000|$|The {{government}} of Edward Heath initially enjoyed {{a strong economy}} and relatively low unemployment, and on 1 January 1973 the United Kingdom became a member state of the European Communities, principally the European Economic Community (the Common Market). But then came the 1973 oil crisis, and just before Christmas, Heath declared a [...] "three day week" [...] in which the use of offices, factories and most public buildings was reduced to three days a week. He also faced a battle with the unions over <b>pay</b> freezes and <b>restraints,</b> which sparked a rise in strikes. The economy also entered a recession.|$|R
5000|$|Boudinot and Watie, {{with the}} help of {{attorneys}} A. Pike, R. W. Johnson, and B.F. Butler, argued that they were exempt from paying the tax on the tobacco. They used the argument that Article 10 of the Treaty of 1866 with the Cherokee Nation stated, “Every Cherokee and freed person resident in the Cherokee nation shall have the right to sell any products of his farm, including his or her live stock or any merchandise or manufactured products, and to ship and drive the same to market without <b>restraint,</b> <b>paying</b> any tax thereon which is now or may be levied by the United States on the quantity sold outside of the Indian Territory.” They used this part because to them it meant that any Cherokee and freed person living in Cherokee Nation had the right to do whatever they wished with their products of their farms and had the right to do so without being taxed.On the other hand, Amos Akerman, U.S. Attorney General, and Benjamin Bristow, Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States, argued that, the 107th section of the Internal Revenue Act of July 20, 1868, states that, [...] "The internal revenue laws imposing taxes on distilled spirits, fermented liquors, tobacco, snuff, and cigars, shall be construed to extend to such articles produced anywhere within the exterior boundaries of the United States, whether the same shall be within a collection district or not," [...] In other words that under the Internal Revenue Act of 1868, the United States had the right to tax anyone within the countries boundaries as well as within the exterior boundaries. Also because this act was passed two years after the Cherokee Nation Treaty, it overruled any previous acts.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} process and impact {{evaluation}} of a multifaceted education-based pilot program targeting correct use of age-appropriate restraints in a regional setting with {{a high proportion of}} Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. Methods: The program was delivered in 2010 in 3 early learning centers where 31 percent of the children were of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. Each component of the program was assessed for message consistency and uptake. To measure program effectiveness, participating children were matched 1 : 1 by age, language spoken at home, and annual household income with 71 children from the control arm of a contemporaneous trial. The outcome measure in the control and program centers (a 4 -category ordinal scale of restraint use) was compared using ordinal logistic regression accounting for age of the parent. Results: Process evaluation found that though program components were delivered with a consistency of message, uptake was affected by turnover of all staff at one center and by parents experiencing difficulty in <b>paying</b> for subsidized <b>restraints</b> at each of the centers. Impact evaluation found that children from the centers receiving the program had nearly twice the odds of being in a better restraint category than children matched from the control group (adjusted odds ratio [OR adj] = 2. 06, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 09 - 3. 90). Conclusions: This was a pragmatic study reflecting the real-life issues of implementing a program in preschools where 57 percent of families had a low income and turnover of staff was high. Despite these issues, impact evaluation showed that the integrated educational program showed promise in increasing correct use of age-appropriate restraints. The findings from this pilot study support the use of an integrated educational program that includes access to subsidized restraints to promote best practice child restraint use among communities that include a high proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families in New South Wales. Future trials in similar settings should consider offering more support in centers with high turnover of staff and offering alternative methods of payment when families experience financial difficulties in purchasing the subsidized restraints. If proven in larger trials, this approach could reduce death and injuries in child passengers in this vulnerable group. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

50|$|The {{return of}} a Conservative-led {{government}} in 2010 coincided with another deterioration in industrial relations. The introduction of further private sector involvement in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 provoked mass demonstrations led by health workers, and some NHS workers also participated in a national strike over <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> in 2014. 2016 also saw major industrial action by junior doctors, protesting at {{the imposition of a}} new contract aiming to extend weekend working.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Michael Clapham [...] (1912 - 2002) was a {{prominent}} British Industrialist who {{served as president of}} the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in the mid-1970s during a period of significant economic turmoil and as a senior executive of ICI throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. As CBI president he witnessed the fall of the administration of Edward Heath in the wake of the miners' strike, and the re-emergence of the Labour Party under Harold Wilson. He was directly involved, along with CBI director-general Campbell Adamson, in intense and volatile debate on voluntary <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> and price controls with Heath and trade union leaders.|$|E
5000|$|Pay {{increases}} {{have been}} capped at 1% per year though inflation {{is higher than}} that. NHS Providers claims this makes recruiting and retaining staff difficult and puts patient safety at risk. Chris Hopson of NHS Providers said, [...] "Growing problems of recruitment and retention are {{making it harder for}} trusts to ensure patient safety. Unsustainable staffing gaps are quickly opening up." [...] Seven years of <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> together with stressful work had a bad effect on the workforce. Hopson said further, [...] "Pay is becoming uncompetitive. Significant numbers of trusts say lower paid staff are leaving to stack shelves in supermarkets rather than carry on working in the NHS." [...] Uncertainty over Brexit signified that [...] "vital recruitment from EU countries is dropping rapidly. <b>Pay</b> <b>restraint</b> must end and politicians must therefore be clear about when during the lifetime of the next parliament it will happen and how.” Hopson repeated NHS Providers request for £25bn in additional funds and warned staff are also leaving through exhaustion because of constant work to meet unprecedented demands for care. Trainee doctors are 'propping 'hospitals due to lack of consultants. Shortages of family doctors are feared in areas like Kent, Medway and Somerset where many doctors are over 55 years old and therefore likely to retire. [...] Unfilled vacancies have reached record levels and rose by 12% in the year to 2017. There is particular shortage of nurses and midwives. [...] More GP's are leaving the profession than are entering despite a government drive to recruit GP's.|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} sectors, {{industrial}} relations under the Thatcher Government {{continued to be}} conflictual. Successive Health Ministers looked to hold down pay {{in the public sector}} and to outsource ancillary staff where possible. Following the 1983 Griffiths Report, the NHS also tried to import a business model more similar to the private sector with professional managers taking over cost control, reducing the power of the medical profession. There were disputes over all of these policies. In 1982 there was another conflict over <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> involving ancillaries and nurses. Campaigning by NUPE, COHSE and RCN won an interim pay rise for nurses who were also granted their own independent pay review body, as the doctors had been 20 years earlier. The status and pay for registered nurses subsequently tended to improve, particularly when nurse education was shifted to university degree courses under Project 2000 in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Major strike {{action by}} British unions during the 1978 - 1979 Winter of Discontent {{contributed to the}} {{downfall}} of the Labour government of James Callaghan. Callaghan, himself a trade-unionist, had previously appealed for unions to exercise <b>pay</b> <b>restraint,</b> as part of the British Government's policies at the time to try to curb rampant inflation. His attempt to try to limit unions to a 5% pay rise led to widespread official and unofficial strikes across the country during the winter of that year. Official and unofficial strike action by lorry drivers, rail workers, nurses and ambulance drivers precipitated a feeling of crisis in the country. The effects of the union action caused a major swing in voting intention. In November 1978, a Gallup poll suggested a 5% Labour lead in the opinion polls. Following the union action that Winter, in February 1979, the Conservatives had a 20% lead.|$|E
50|$|Having {{prepared}} for the imminent end of the incomes policy, global inflation supervened and was coming towards record levels during the 1978-82 period on 21 July 1978 Denis Healey introduced a new White Paper which set a guideline for pay rises of 5% in the year from 1 August. The TUC voted overwhelmingly on 26 July to reject the limit and insist on a return to free collective bargaining as they were promised. Unexpectedly, on 7 September, Prime Minister James Callaghan {{announced that he would}} not be calling a general election that autumn but seeking to go through the winter with continued <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> so that the economy would be in a better state in preparation for a spring election. The pay limit was officially termed 'Phase IV' but most referred to it as 'the 5% limit.' Although the government did not make the 5% limit a legal requirement, it decided to impose penalties on private and public government contractors who broke the limit.|$|E

50|$|The general {{election}} {{at the end}} of February 1974 resulted in a hung parliament where Labour had slightly more seats than any other party but no overall majority. The Conservatives tried to negotiate a coalition with the Liberal Party but failed and Edward Heath's government resigned. Labour came to power in March 1974, its leader Harold Wilson having accepted the Royal invitation to form a minority government. Wilson called a second election for October 1974, which gave Labour a wafer-thin majority of three MPs. The Labour Government implemented <b>pay</b> <b>restraint</b> to control global inflation, coupled with stagnation and unemployment at record post-war levels. Wilson resigned in 1976 in poorer health, on turning 60, and James Callaghan became Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister. By-elections and defections whittled away Labour's majority, which technically was non-existent by April 1976 in the House of Commons after a by-election defeat, the defection of two Labour MPs to form the Scottish Labour Party and the defection of backbencher John Stonehouse.|$|E

40|$|The UK {{economy is}} in recession, with the {{recovery}} yet to be secured. GDP is more than 4 percent lower {{than it was in}} 2008 with output per capita now 14 percent below its pre-crisis trend. As a result of this stalled recovery, confidence remains weak and uncertainty high. The CBI forecast for growth has been revised down to minus 0. 3 percent in 2012 and 1. 2 % in 2013. Given the significant downside risks from the Eurozone – which now seems to be acting as a drag on the broader global economy – uncertainty continues to dampen business confidence. Although the labour market has continued to outperform expectations, overall fragility persists, with the performance we have seen in recent quarters expected to deteriorate. The CBI forecasts unemployment to continue to rise, averaging 8. 4 percent, or 2. 69 million people, in 2013. Productivity levels are yet to recover, with the risk that if productivity continues to fall employers will look to cut back on jobs in order to stem further declines. <b>Pay</b> <b>restraint</b> continues {{to play an important role}} in supporting employment and slack in the labour market is set to continue to bear down on wage growth meaning a cautious approach to the rate of the NMW will reflect wider labour market practice, with NM...|$|E
