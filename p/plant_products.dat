5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of salicylic acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E

40|$|Introduction and {{aim of the}} study: Chronic prostatitis/chronic {{pelvic pain}} {{syndrome}} (CP/CPSS) is a pathology of high prevalence in Italian male population, difficult to diagnose and to treat and with poor response to conventional therapy. Aim {{of this study was}} to review the evidence of the literature about the therapeutic effects of a <b>plant</b> <b>product</b> containing flower pollen extracts and group B vitamins on symptoms resolution and amelioration of CP/CPPS patients’ quality of life and to investigate the knowledge among practicing urologists about the clinical application of this product. Materials and methods: A group of 38 urologists was submitted to an investigational survey of the knowledge of the clinical applications of a <b>plant</b> <b>product</b> containing flower pollen extracts and group B vitamins Results: 71 % of the urologists interviewed prescribed the <b>plant</b> <b>product</b> for CBP and CP/CPPS at least one time in a month and 11 % prescribed it more than 5 times; 67 % had evidence of clear ameliorations in pain relief and on patient's quality of life and 47 % reported that the effectiveness is comparable to NSAIDs; 39 % also reported a significant effect for the improvement of the urinary symptoms of patients. No gastric or general side effects have been noticed during the administration period of this <b>plant</b> <b>product.</b> Finally, the cost of the product has always reported to be sustainable for the patients. Conclusions: From the results of this investigational survey, we can state that the <b>plant</b> <b>product</b> containing flower pollen extracts and group B vitamins is well-known and demonstrated beneficial effects on symptoms resolution and amelioration of quality of life in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome...|$|R

Some chemical compounds, although not synthesized from pyridine, contain its ring structure. They include B vitamins niacin and pyridoxine, the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid, nicotine and other nitrogen-containing <b>plant</b> <b>products.</b> Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar and as a byproduct of coal gasification. However, increased demand for pyridine resulted in the development of more economical methods of synthesis from acetaldehyde and ammonia, and more than 20,000 tonnes per year are manufactured worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} of dietary iron is a variable and dynamic process. The amount of iron absorbed {{compared to the}} amount ingested is typically low, but may range from 5% {{to as much as}} 35% depending on circumstances and type of iron. The efficiency with which iron is absorbed varies depending on the source. Generally the best-absorbed forms of iron come from animal products. Absorption of dietary iron in iron salt form (as in most supplements) varies somewhat according to the body’s need for iron, and is usually between 10% and 20% of iron intake. Absorption of iron from animal products, and some <b>plant</b> <b>products,</b> {{is in the form of}} heme iron, and is more efficient, allowing {{absorption of}} from 15% to 35% of intake. Heme iron in animals is from blood and heme-containing proteins in meat and mitochondria, whereas in plants, heme iron is present in mitochondria in all cells that use oxygen for respiration.|$|E

Many feed on economically important plants and stored <b>plant</b> <b>products,</b> including trees, cereals, tobacco, and dried fruits. Some, such as the boll weevil, which feeds on cotton buds and flowers, can cause extremely serious damage to agriculture. The boll weevil crossed the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, to enter the United States from Mexico around 1892, and had reached southeastern Alabama by 1915. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the US, traveling [...] per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. Mississippi State University has estimated, since the boll weevil entered the United States, it has cost cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.|$|E
