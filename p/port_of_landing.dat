40|$|In Belgium, {{centralized}} {{reporting on}} landings of sea fisheries at the species level started in 1929. This paper summarizes {{the process and}} the results of integrating time-series, based on fragmented and disperse data sources for the period 1929 – 1999. The resulting database contains data by species (41), by <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> in Belgium (4) and in ‘foreign ports,’ and by fishing area of origin (31). After quality control, total reported landings over the period 1929 – 2008 amounted to 3, 320, 518 tonnes, of which 90 % was landed in the Belgian ports. After a maximum of 75, 370 tonnes in 1947, annual landings declined steadily to only 26 % of this peak by 2008. Currently, landings are below those achieved in 1929. The most important species in terms of landings (1929 – 1999) were cod (17 % of all landings) and herring (16 %). In terms of economic value, sole (31 %) and cod (15 %) were the most valuable. Close to 73 % of all landings originated from 5 of the 31 fishing areas. Twenty percent of all landings (1929 – 1999) originated from the ‘coastal waters’, while these waters contributed nearly 60 % of all landed pelagic species and 55 % of all landed ‘molluscs and crustaceans’. Compared to the currently available ICES data, this local database offers advantages in temporal coverage (data from 1929 onwards), temporal scale (monthly values), and at the taxonomic level. It also provides more detailed information at the spatial scale of the southern and central North Sea, and it is the only source of historical information on landings originating from the coastal waters. Given the importance of the shallow and productive ‘Flemish banks’ as a local source of food in historical and recent times, this data is valuable for further research on the productivity of the coastal ecosystem and the local impact of fisheries. The database broadens the historical view on fisheries, underlines the decline in landings since reporting started, and serves as a basis for further (fisheries) research and policy-making in Belgium...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the New England Otter Trawl Fishery between 1982 and 1998 {{and the potential}} economic impacts of regulations on the Northeastern Multispecies Groundfish Fishery (MGF). ^ The study uses primary data collected by the author and secondary data obtained from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). This research required extensive econometric analysis of both value landed and cost data. The landed value {{is influenced by the}} vessel 2 ̆ 7 s physical characteristics, <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>landing,</b> seasonal choices of fishing gear-species combinations, days at sea and distance from shore, and the captain 2 ̆ 7 s skill (also referred to as the “skipper effect”). The vessel-cost model is composed of several equations, each corresponding to one of the following annual cost items: Trip Expenses - Other Variable Costs - Indivisible Operating Costs - 5 year Overhaul - Depreciation and Interests - Crew Benefits and Crew Bonuses. The estimated equations are used to synthesize an economic model of vessel behavior, which can be used to examine the economic consequences of alternative scenarios. ^ This model was used to examine the impacts of selected regulations on the fishing industry. The results indicate differential impacts, which affect larger vessels (especially above 90 feet). The statistics show that some vessels modify their fishing habits by re-targeting their catch to different species and/or by changing how far they are willing to go fishing. These changes affected essentially geographic and seasonal effort distribution for both large and small trawlers. Larger vessels are fishing more inshore than before and for less valuable species thus bringing more pressure on inshore fish stocks. The results also shed light on the relative efficiency of large and small vessels, although they suggest that the issue is ill phrased!—small (50 to 60 ft) vessels appear more efficient than larger vessels when both are operating near shore. However, smaller vessels are not sufficiently seaworthy to compete with larger (3 ̆e 80 ft) vessels in offshore environments. This finding is pertinent to concerns often expressed about the survival of small vessels under an individual transferable quota (ITQ) regime. ^ These results also confirm the findings by Griffith and Dyer (1996) who concluded that recent regulations especially affected communities relying on specialized fishing fleets with larger than average vessels. ^ Finally {{it was found that the}} method of data collection which started in 1994 (i. e. the use of the fishers logbook in lieu of the port agents and dealers 2 ̆ 7 data) was inadequate in capturing the value landed because it recorded landings at the docks before being priced by a dealer. As a consequence, the lack of systematic ex-vessel price data after 1993 required matching the logbook information with the already shrinking dealer information to estimate an ex-vessel price by species, month and port. This structural change in the data series confounds the effects of regulatory changes and stock declines. ...|$|E
40|$|Time {{series on}} {{landings}} of marine fisheries in Flanders {{were reported as}} early as 1767 (1767 - 1780; 1836 - 1906) for herring, salted cod and ‘fresh fish’ (unidentified species). Our literature screening for time-series on landings and the economic value of these landings indicated that structurally embedded reporting in Belgium (Flanders) started in 1929 with an acceptable degree of consistency and continuity ever since. The final target of the present exercise will be to reconstruct time series at the lowest taxonomic level and spatial scale, based on the available systematic and consistent reporting. Thus, the present study details the data-structure and data integration for the final reconstruction exercise. The beginning of structural reporting on fisheries and landings coincided with the period where most states in Europe developed a statistical approach to underpin policy development. Historical data on (value of) landings before 1998 were only available in printed hard copy {{and none of the}} data or time-series contained in the reports were available electronically in the public domain. No legal or other data policy restrictions were indicated or applicable. The present exercise demonstrates the feasibility of constructing a standardized and integrated database. By means of this standardization and integration, time series for the period 1929 - 1999 were covered on a detailed level by species (n = 41), by <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> (four in Belgium, two in France, and one ‘foreign port’), by fishing area of origin (n = 31). Detailed landings in foreign ports covered the period 1950 - 1999. The total amount of reported landings covered by the integrated historical fisheries database (‘HiFiDatabase’) over the period 1929 - 1999 amounts to 3, 107, 638 metric tonnes, of which 2, 830, 815 tonnes (91 %) were landed in Belgian ports and 256, 566 tonnes in ‘foreign ports’, with an additional 20, 256 tonnes in Dunkerque and Gravelines (France) during World War II. The total value of these landings amounts to € 2, 277, 999, 993 which recalculated to account for inflation represents € 6, 075, 090, 365 in 2007 Euro. The most important species in terms of landings were cod and herring (respectively 17 % and 16 % of total landings). In terms of indexed value, sole (31 %) and cod (15 %) were the most valuable species. Close to 73 % of all landed species originated from five fishing areas: Coastal waters (shallow waters off Belgium, northern France and the Netherlands), the southern North Sea, the areas around Iceland, and the central North Sea. Twenty percent of all landed species originated from the shallow coastal waters. The southern North Sea and the Icelandic waters follow closely with 17 % and 16 %, respectively. The coastal waters contributed nearly 60 % of all landed pelagic species and 55 % of all landed molluscs and crustaceans reported for the period 1929 - 1999. The integrated database allows broadening our historical view of fisheries. It underlines the strong decline in landings since reporting started in Belgium, and allows further analysis by particular species and fishing grounds. The integration of the data also allowed additional quality control, based on visual analysis. The amount of time and effort needed to construct exchangeable formats and quality controlled, integrated time-series based on the currently available sources, provided an indication of why the historical component of marine fisheries is practically absent in ecological science and fisheries management...|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} as Northern California Marine Sport Fish Survey, Dingell-Johnson Project F- 12 -R. The State of California {{is responsible for}} regulating, protecting, enhancing, and assessing the fish and game resources of California. Estimating the existing and potential take of marine resources {{is one of the}} tasks of the Marine Resources Operations unit of the Department of Fish and Game. Basic life history information on important species, total catch estimates by species, and enumeration of boats, angler effort, and facilities are compiled and published by this unit. Commercial catch records are gathered, compiled, and published for each year, and give data by month and <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>landing.</b> All commercial landings are recorded by species or major groupings at the time of sale to fish buyers. These landings are submitted monthly to the Terminal Island statistical unit. The sport catch, however, has not been assessed except for the partyboat catch which is recorded on logs. An ever-increasing demand placed on marine resources by expanding commercial and sport operations has necessitated a more complete evaluation of all segments of the sport fishery. Popular species such as king salmon,[1] striped bass, and lingcod were known to be important in central and northern California. Information on catch of all species was needed so research funds could be allocated more intelligently and recommendations could be made as to future marine sportfishing improvements projects. Upon completion of the Ocean Salmon Study (Dingell-Johnson project F- 12 -R) the project was amended to assess total sport catch and effort from Oregon to Point Arguello. Although a routine annual tabulation of catch and effort, as has been conducted on partyboat and commercial catches, could not be perpetuated, one "base" year's data were gathered. Thus, future surveys could reveal trends of effort and catch for any or all segments of the sport fishery. Short-cut methods could be adopted using basic data gathered during the base year survey. The objectives of this assessment survey, the Northern California Marine Sport Fish Survey, were: (1) To estimate the total average annual fishing effort, in angler days, for each fishing method (i. e. party boat, skiff, pier, skindiving, and shore fishing, including surf casting, rocky shore fishing, fishing from jetties, and surf netting). (2) To estimate the total catch by numbers and species for each fishing method. (3) To estimate the total catch by weight for certain fisheries. (This objective was added to the project in 1959.) (4) To compute catch-per-unit-of-effort values for each fishing method. (5) To record length composition of all species taken by partyboat fishermen, skiff fishermen, and skindivers. (6) To enumerate and describe all marine sportfishing facilities. (7) To develop sampling techniques and fish identification guides. All catch and effort data were grouped by monthly intervals at each port or fishing locality, and then summarized into yearly totals for each unit of area. Originally, the objectives included an economic survey of the sport fishery, including amount of money spent per trip, distance traveled, etc., such as was conducted in Florida (Ellis, Rosen, and Moffett, 1958). Also, a survey of San Pablo and San Francisco bays was included. The first 6 months of shore coverage, wherein all fishing methods were sampled, revealed the usual array of ensuing problems, and led to re-evaluation of objectives and methodology. The economic survey was discontinued because, though valuable, it was not essential in a biological approach to management. In addition to estimates of annual average effort and catch, biological information, usable in setting up research programs and as "base year" information, was needed. Since the total shoreline of the many bays of the study area was extensive, only skiff facilities, partyboat operations, and certain piers were included. Shore fishing, skindiving, and fishing from small piers were not surveyed in bays and estuaries. Night surf netting and night pier fishing were not included because the project was unable to provide coverage for night work. The need to collect several series of data per fishing method precluded simultaneous survey of all fishing methods. A complete study in 1 year covering all methods was highly desirable, but our limited budget would not permit such an approach. Thus, pier, shore (primarily surf casting), and surf net fishing were surveyed in 1958; skiff fishing in 1959; and partyboat, rocky shore fishing, and skindiving in 1960 – 61. Some series' of data were collected throughout the 3 years to make it possible to evalute yearly variations in catch and effort. No exceptional physical environmental changes, which may have materially altered biological relationships between species, occurred during the survey. The data from several consecutive years have been collated to represent average annual estimates for all parameters. Had this study been conducted during the 3 previous years (1955 – 1957), the sudden warming of ocean waters in 1957, and concurrent influx of southern forms, would have presented unique problems in treating the data in this way. From 1958 – 1961 there was gradual cooling and a return to a more normal physical environment, with consequent reduced occurrences of southern forms in central and northern California, such as barracuda which, in 1957, ranged as far north as Canada. Results of this survey have been summarized in three different ways: (i) as an administrative report, which included a complete set of typed raw data tables along with a narrative description of each fishery and methods used at each locality; (ii) as this report, which includes much of the original data, but in several cases annual summaries have been given in lieu of monthly summaries, and length frequency data are summarized; (iii) as four fishing maps covering 10 counties from Oregon to Santa Barbara County, Calif. These maps list all fishing facilities, public camping sites, and areas where shore fishing, skindiving, clamming, abalone picking, and surf netting are conducted. Also included are details as to the best times of year to fish, gear and bait to use, and notes on life history and behavior of certain fishes...|$|E
