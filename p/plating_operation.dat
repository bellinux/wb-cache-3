The optical axis of the birefringent waveguide is rotated due to the impact of an artificial stress field created by an additional modification close to the waveguide. By adjusting this length of the defect along the waveguide, the retardation between ordinary and extraordinary field components is precisely tunable including half-wave plate and quarter-wave <b>plate</b> <b>operations.</b> Our approach demonstrates the full range control of orientation and strength of the induced birefringence and thus allows arbitrary wave <b>plate</b> <b>operations</b> without affecting the degree of polarisation or introducing additional losses to the waveguides.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{for the removal}} and recycling of hexavalent chromium from electroplating industries was developed. It involves a two-phase process which consists of (1) {{the use of an}} activated carbon bed for the accumulation of chromium onto the surface of activated carbon followed by (2) the regeneration of the carbon leading to a concentrated chromium solution with potential for reclamation or reuse within the <b>plating</b> <b>operation.</b> Results from continuous flow experiments showed that in excess of 99 % chromium removal efficiency can be achieved. It was also revealed that regeneration of the exhausted carbon under acidic conditions recovered chromium in the trivalent state with concentrations as high as 3 g dm− 3, more than 12 times the influent concentration. The adsorption capacity of the activated carbon was found to increase with successive cycles of adsorption/regeneration. However, when regeneration was achieved under alkaline conditions, the chromium was recovered in the hexavalent state with concentrations as high as 8 · 4 g dm− 3, in excess of 33 times the chromium influent concentration. In addition, under caustic regeneration conditions, the data showed that the adsorption capacity in this case decreases with the increased number of exhaustion cycles. Mass balance calculation for both acid and caustic regeneration indicated that in both cases the regeneration process was incomplete with a recovery efficiency averaging around 50 %. In an attempt to maximise the recovery efficiency, a combination of caustic followed by acid regeneration was applied to the exhausted activated carbon and the results led to a drastic improvement in the total recovery process (85 – 98 %). These results clearly show that activated carbon is a viable candidate for the removal and recovery of chromium from electroplating industries. The critical advantage in the use of activated carbon is (1) the ability to regenerate and thus prepare a concentrated chromium solution for potential reclamation or recycle to the <b>plating</b> <b>operation,</b> and (2) the potential of avoiding the generation of hazardous sludge for land disposal...|$|E

Industrial robots are attracting {{more and more}} attention for the deburring applications. However, Each wheel path program was taking eight to ten weeks to create because the position and orientation of the deburring tool must be accurately identified based on the curvature of the wheel. To solve this problem, we developed a practical 6 DOF robot path generation method using hybrid force and visual servoing methodology. The force servoing keeps the robot tool continuously contacting with the wheel surface and the visual servoing controls the robot tool to follow a marked tool path on the wheel while the position and orientation are controlled and recorded. A robot path is then generated from the recorded data.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) can be manufactured by processes involving final sintering. This research investigated a novel alternative method which relies on the electroless co-deposition of yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) or ceria-stabilised zirconia (CeSZ) and nickel onto a YSZ substrate. This process allows complex or simple shaped substrates to be coated, thereby replacing the high temperature sintering and reduction stages with a single <b>plating</b> <b>operation,</b> which is substantially more cost effective and greatly simplifies the manufacture of any cell design. The technique also eliminates the production of larger nickel grains (which occurs during sintering), thus improving cell performance. Through a series of multifactoral experiments, a successful method was established and optimised for the deposition of the metal-ceramic composite which was successfully used in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack. The typical process involves degreasing and chemical pre-treatment of the substrates, followed by electroless co-deposition of the cermet coating, using either proprietary based chemicals or standard analytical reagents which have been specially formulated. Through the metallurgical examination of the experimental samples {{it has been shown}} that the ratio of the metal to ceramic can be varied, thus catering to a potentially large customer base, and that a composition gradient can be achieved through the coating. Additional parameters such as porosity and electrical conductivity have also been evaluated and the results have been so encouraging that there has been significant commercial interest in the process.

40|$|Introduction: Water {{shortage}} in arid and semiarid {{regions of}} the world is a cause of serious concerns. The severe water scarcity urges the reuse of treated wastewater effluent and marginal water as a resource for irrigation. Mobarake Steel Complex has been using treated industrial wastewater for drip-irrigation of trees in about 1350 ha of its green space. However, wastewater may contain some amounts of toxic heavy metals, which create problems. Excessive accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils through wastewater irrigation may not only result in soil contamination, but also affect food quality and safety. Improper irrigation management, however, can lead to the loss of soil quality through such processes as contamination and salination. Soil quality implies its capacity to sustain biological productivity, maintain environmental quality, and enhance plants, human and animal health. Soil quality assessment is a tool that helps managers to evaluate short-term soil problems and appropriate management strategies for maintaining soil quality in the long time. Mobarakeh Steel Complex has been using treated wastewater for irrigation of green space to combat water shortage and prevent environmental pollution. This study was performed {{to assess the impact of}} short- middle, and long-term wastewater irrigation on soil heavy metal concentration in green space of Mobarake Steel complex. Materials and Methods: The impacts of wastewater irrigation on bioavailable and total heavy metal concentrations in the soils irrigated with treated wastewater for 2, 6 and 18 years as compared to those in soils irrigated with groundwater and un-irrigated soils. Soils were sampled from the wet bulb produced by under-tree sprinklers in three depths (0 - 20, 20 - 40 and 40 - 60 cm). Soil samples were air-dried, and crushed to pass through a 2 -mm sieve. Plant-available metal concentrations were extracted from the soil with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-CaCl 2 -triethanolamine (DTPA-TEA). To determine the total concentration of heavy metals, the soil samples were digested in 6 M HNO 3. Concentrations of heavy metals in the extracts were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Finally, available metal micronutrient levels in the soil were compared with the critical deficiency ranges suggested for calcareous soils. Also, total concentrations of the metals in the soils were compared with the standards of the Iranian Environmental Protection Agency to assess possible contamination of soils with heavy metals in the studied area. Results and discussion: The results of this study showed significant increases of plant-available Fe in the soils irrigated with wastewater for 6 and 18 years as compared to the unplanted control. Regardless of the type of irrigation water used, available Mn and Ni were significantly increased in all forested areas as compared to the unplanted soils. Available Zn fraction was significantly higher in the soils with history of 6 and 18 years of wastewater irrigation. Increase in available Cu concentration was statistically significant only in the soils irrigated with wastewater for 18 years. As the metal concentration in the wastewater used for irrigation was very low, it seems that the major source of metal accumulation in the soils is particulate fallout or emissions directly from the dump sites and metal <b>plating</b> <b>operation.</b> Furthermore, irrigation and forestation practices might have improved bioavailability of micronutrient metals in the soils of green space of Mobarakeh Steel complex through increasing organic matter content of the soils which enhances metal chelation reactions. Total concentrations of the metals in the forested soils also increased as compared to those of the control. Total Fe, Mn, and Zn concentrations were notably higher in all soils of the green space area as compared to those in the unplanted control sites. Wind-driven particle transport from dumping site to nearby soils may be the main reason for metal build-up in the green space soils. Total concentration of Cu showed no significant difference among the soils of the treatments and the control. Although metal accumulation has been occurring in the soils of the Mobarakeh Steel complex green space, total concentrations in the soils were still considerably lower than the allowable levels recommended by the Iranian Environmental Protection Agency. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that metal accumulation has been occurring in the green space soils of the Mobarakeh Steel complex. Considering the short distance of the dumping and metal smelting sites with the green space and very low concentrations of metals in wastewater, in may be concluded that fall out of metallic particles on the soil surfaces from the dumping and smelting sites is the main route for metals accumulation in the soils of the green space areas...|$|E
