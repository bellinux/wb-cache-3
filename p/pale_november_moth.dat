50|$|The <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita christyi) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is a fairly common species in Western Europe {{including}} the British Isles.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} almost {{identical}} to its relatives the November moth and autumnal moth and {{it is almost impossible}} to identify them without examination of the genitalia. In general, although melanism occurs regularly in this species it is less prevalent than in the November moth. The <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> flies at night from September to November [...] and is attracted to light.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the November moth and <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> and {{identification}} is usually only possible by examining the genitalia. In general this is the least variable of the three with melanic forms occurring less often. It is also usually on the wing earlier in the year, flying in September and October , although the flight seasons of all three species overlap.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita dilutata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. The species {{can be found in}} the Palearctic ecozone in Western Europe from Central Scandinavia to the Mediterranean the Caucasus and Western Russia.|$|R
60|$|In {{the days}} that followed, when Gyp, robbed of memory, hung between life and death, Winton hardly left her room, that low room with creepered windows whence the river could be seen, gliding down under the <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> {{sunshine}} or black beneath the stars. He would watch it, fascinated, as one sometimes watches the relentless sea. He had snatched her as by a miracle from that snaky river.|$|R
60|$|The <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> sun had {{struggled}} {{out of its}} misty coverings, and touched the pinnacles and towers of the old Abbey with delicate gleams of golden grey. Slowly the crowd moved on, {{some of the more}} venturesome or more enthusiastic townsfolk, the 'prentices, and younger men, lingered round the precincts to see the great personages come out and to give a final cheer for His Grace of Wessex.|$|R
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> <b>moth,</b> mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 38-44 mm, the forewings being variably {{marked with}} alternating pale and dark bands.The forewing ground colour is pale with darker grey and tinted brown. It has wavy lines.The hindwing is white-grey with 2 lines. The distal fascia points {{in to the}} discal spot. Melanism is common and in some locations all-dark individuals make {{up the majority of}} the population. The species is extremely similar to two of its relatives, the <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> and autumnal moth, and they cannot usually be separated without examination of the genitalia. The November moth flies at night from September to November and is attracted to light and sometimes to nectar-rich flowers.|$|E
60|$|The rain came {{steadily}} {{down for}} {{the best part of}} an hour. But the time seemed really very short. When the clouds parted and a burst of <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> sunshine fell athwart the harbor and the pines Anne and her companion walked home together. By the time they had reached the gate of Patty's Place he had asked permission to call, and had received it. Anne went in with cheeks of flame and her heart beating to her fingertips. Rusty, who climbed into her lap and tried to kiss her, found a very absent welcome. Anne, with her soul full of romantic thrills, had no attention to spare just then for a crop-eared pussy cat.|$|R
50|$|If {{the weather}} is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, {{and if it is}} unseasonably wet or if the plums are not {{harvested}} as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called brown rot. Brown rot is not toxic, and very small affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera, including <b>November</b> <b>moth,</b> willow beauty and short-cloaked moth.|$|R
5000|$|The synagogues, some centuries old, {{were also}} victims of {{considerable}} violence and vandalism, with the tactics the Stormtroops practised on {{these and other}} sacred sites described as [...] "approaching the ghoulish" [...] by the United States Consul in Leipzig. Tombstones were uprooted and graves violated. Fires were lit, and prayer books, scrolls, artwork and philosophy texts were thrown upon them, and precious buildings were either burned or smashed until unrecognisable. Eric Lucas recalls {{the destruction of the}} synagogue that a tiny Jewish community had constructed in a small village only twelve years earlier: [...] It did not take long before the first heavy grey stones came tumbling down, and the children of the village amused themselves as they flung stones into the many coloured windows. When the first rays of a cold and <b>pale</b> <b>November</b> sun penetrated the heavy dark clouds, the little synagogue was but a heap of stone, broken glass and smashed-up woodwork.' ...|$|R

40|$|The Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa) migrates {{annually}} {{to the highest}} peaks in the Southern Alps where millions spend the hot summer months aestivating in deep, dark crevices in rock caves among granite boulders. Parliament House disrupts the flight of the moths, writes Bill McCormick, and acts as a giant light trap for moths migrating through the Canberra area during October and <b>November.</b> The <b>moths</b> treat the building as a temporary camp and it is often necessary to reduce the building 2 ̆ 7 s lighting to allow the moths to continue their migration south...|$|R
50|$|The first brewery to {{successfully}} commercialize {{the use of}} significant quantities of American hops {{in the style of}} APA was the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, which brewed the first experimental batch of Sierra Nevada <b>Pale</b> Ale in <b>November</b> 1980, distributing the finished version in March 1981. Another pioneer of the hoppy American pale ale was Bert Grant of Yakima Brewing.|$|R

40|$|Cydia toreuta {{population}} densities, prolonged diapause behavior, parasitism {{and adult}} emergence patterns were examined {{over four years}} at two red pine locations in Wisconsin. Last-instar densities ranged from 0. 54 to 3. 18 per cone. This was considered a wide range for this species in red pine. Population clumping was evident at last-instar densities below 2. 90, however no consistent pattern was evident between years. Clumping disappeared at populations greater than 2. 90 last-instars. Prolonged diapause varied from 7. 8 to 38. 9070. Parasitism rates var­ ied from 10. 9 to 46. 6 %. Phanerotoma toreuta (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was the most abundant parasite at both sites and emerged in unison with male C. toreuta. Estimation of percent of last-instars undergoing prolonged diapause prior to spring emergence can be accomplished using forced emergence though cones should be collected after 31 January. Estimation of percent parasitism can be made as early as <b>November.</b> Resident <b>moth</b> populations could be estimated prior to spring flight utilizing this information. Emergence occurred over an approximately 2 week period between mid-May and early June. The majority of male moths emerged prior to females...|$|R
60|$|Albinia laughed, but at {{that moment}} the sounds of the hunt again {{occupied}} them, and all were interpreted by Ulick with the keenest interest, but he would not run away again, though she exhorted him not to regard her. Presently it swept on out of hearing, and by-and-bye they reached the summit of the hill, and looked forth on the dark pine plantations on the opposite undulation, standing out in black relief against a sky golden with a <b>pale,</b> pure, pearly <b>November</b> sunset, a 'daffodil sky' flecked with tiny fleeces of soft bright-yellow light, reminding Albinia of Fouque's beautiful dream of Aslauga's golden hair showing the gates of Heaven to her devoted knight. She looked for her companion's sympathy in her admiration, but the woods seemed to oppress him, and his panting sigh showed how real a thing was he-men.|$|R
5000|$|Some credit Oskar Blues as {{the creator}} of the [...] "first {{released}} canned craft beer in the United States" [...] with the release of their Dale's <b>Pale</b> Ale in <b>November</b> 2002. Other writers point to an earlier beer, Chief Oshkosh Red Lager which was brewed and canned at an existing brewery, as the [...] "first canned craft beer" [...] in June 17, 1991, although its producer, the Mid-Coast Brewing company, closed in 1994. [...] Four other companies produced canned craft beers prior to Oskar Blues, although the canning was done by larger companies under contract. [...] Regardless of the first, by 2011 about 50 U.S. craft brewers were issuing craft beer in cans. [...] In 2009, Oskar Blues Brewery sponsored an event called [...] "Burning Can" [...] which brought together other craft brewers who were using cans for their beers.|$|R
50|$|American Pale Ale (APA) was {{developed}} around 1980. The brewery {{thought to be}} the first to successfully use significant quantities of American hops in the style of APA and use the name Pale Ale, was the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, which brewed the first experimental batch of Sierra Nevada <b>Pale</b> Ale in <b>November</b> 1980, distributing the finished version in March 1981. Anchor Liberty Ale, a 6% abv ale originally brewed by Anchor Brewing Company as a special in 1975 to commemorate Paul Revere's midnight ride in 1775 which marked the start of the American War of Independence, was seen by writer on beverages, Michael Jackson, as the first modern American ale. Fritz Maytag, the owner of Anchor, visited British breweries in London, Yorkshire and Burton upon Trent, picking up information about robust pale ales, which he used when he made his American version using just malt rather than the malt and sugar combination common in brewing at that time, and making prominent use of the American hop, Cascade. The beer was popular, and became a regular in 1983. Other pioneers of a hoppy American pale ale were Jack McAuliffe of the New Albion Brewing Company and Bert Grant of Yakima Brewing.|$|R
