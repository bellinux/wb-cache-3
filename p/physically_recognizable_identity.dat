We have previously determined that {{the performance of the}} unbiased amplification technique which is operational at our institute, VIDISCA- 454, is efficient when respiratory samples are used as input. The performance of the assay is, however, not known for other clinical materials like blood or stool samples.

The performance of VIDISCA- 454 in serum samples was equal to its performance in respiratory material, with an estimated lower threshold of 1, 000 viral genome copies. The estimated threshold in feces-suspension is around 200, 000 viral genome copies.

The {{conceptualisation}} of {{the female}} body as a sexual and reproductive object has been {{for a long time}} a focus of both law’s and science regulation. Considering the specific sexual objectification of the phenomenon of prostitution in Portugal, we aim to analyse how the cultures of law and science, which claim to be self-regulating and independent from other knowledges and practices, are in fact mutually constitutive and jointly produce dominant ideas about women’s bodies, women’s sexuality and women’s place in society. According to this, we intend to emphasize how the social phenomenon of female prostitution can be described as a “boundary object”, since it is plastic enough to adapt itself to both law and science procedures, and yet robust enough to maintain a common and <b>recognizable</b> <b>identity</b> trough those two different institutions. The representations of law and science as different but complementary enterprises towards female prostitution create constantly negotiable boundaries and a clear fluidity of work divisions that have in common the feature of providing the basis to define the prostitute as out of the regulated and authorized boundaries of proper feminine behaviour. The position of law and science in a hierarchy of knowledges allows a very direct control over the prostitutes’ bodies and behaviours in such ways that it reinforces the reproduction of women in a sexualised, subjugated and disqualified way...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} cancer {{has long been}} an issue of vital {{importance}} to Canadians. In an attempt to arrest the spread of cancer, radiation therapy emerged early in the 20 th century as an effective tool in combating the disease and prompted a new hope that a cure for cancer would be realized in the not too distant future. However, due to the expense of obtaining naturally occurring radioactive elements, radiation therapy was limited to a select group of patients. The onset of the Great Depression further exposed the inability of patients to pay for treatment and led the Saskatchewan government to establish a cancer program that provided consultative, diagnostic and radiation therapy at a cost largely incurred by the state. This thesis deals with the causative factors for the government to expand into the cancer care arena more than thirty years before the adoption of publicly funded universal health care. It argues that the fuel to provide cancer care was as much a desire to benefit the sick as it was to building a <b>recognizable</b> <b>identity</b> for the province. Legislators in Saskatchewan believed that they had a responsibility to mold an image for the province and ensuring that patients had access to increasingly specialized and technological treatments for cancer was a means through which the state could forge an identity as a progressive society dedicated to {{the health and well-being of}} its citizens...|$|R

40|$|Our {{dress is}} our identity. In dress, we live, move and have our social being. This book {{shows how the}} dressed body {{is central to the}} {{construction}} of a <b>recognizable</b> <b>identity</b> and provides accessible accounts of the particular dress 'ways' associated with a considerable variety of lifestyles. Churchgoers, ballerinas, Muslim schoolgirls, glamour models, 'vampires', monks and country gents all fashion a social self through dress. These cultures all have characteristic forms of displaying the dressed body for social visibility - whether in religion, sex, performance, or on the street. In contrast to much of the literature on dress, which often assumes a lack of agency {{on the part of the}} wearer, contributors to this book focus on the conscious manipulation of dress to reflect an identity that is designed to look 'different'. Why do people choose to mark themselves off socially from others? What are the costs and benefits? For every dress 'identity', there is a corresponding set of entitlements and expectations as to behaviour and belief. 'Priestly' bodies inhabit a different universe of response from strippers, just as 'Gothic' bodies experience the public gaze differently from 'Methodist' ones. Where one look commands respect in one setting, in another it can incite antipathy and rejection. Contributors tackle head-on this 'paradox of dress' - its potent power to unite and divide. Evidence of the dressed body's social ambiguity as a medium of consensus, on the one hand, and conflict, on the other, provides a glimpse through dress into an elementary condition of social and cultural life that has all too rarely been part of historical and sociological discourse...|$|R
