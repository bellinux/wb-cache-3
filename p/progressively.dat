5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are {{contained within the}} ventricles of the brains, {{but not in a}} nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become <b>progressively</b> more complex, the system of absorption becomes <b>progressively</b> more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a <b>progressively</b> smaller and smaller role.|$|E
5|$|When {{the onset}} or coda of a root {{contains}} a consonant cluster, the consonants in this cluster must be ordered {{according to their}} sonority. The vowel constitutes a sonority peak, and the sonority must <b>progressively</b> rise in the onset and <b>progressively</b> fall in the coda.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{reserved}} {{the right}} not to be bound to <b>progressively</b> introduce free secondary and higher education, the right to strike for public servant and the remuneration on public holidays.|$|E
5|$|Joysticks, keypads, tablets {{and other}} human-interface devices (HIDs) are also <b>progressively</b> {{migrating}} from MIDI, and PC game port connectors to USB.|$|E
5|$|Phase I and Phase II {{routes and}} {{stations}} opened <b>progressively</b> from 5 December 2002 and 3 June 2008 respectively, and become completely operational on 11 November 2006 and 27 August 2011 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{new century}} saw an {{increasing}} number of multi-platform releases. The move to 3D game engines, along with constant improvements in graphic quality, led to <b>progressively</b> detailed and realistic game worlds.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} {{particularly}} fourth season received <b>progressively</b> more negative reviews, as the show's plot diverged from its origin story of {{breaking out of}} prison, and focused more on conventional elements of a government conspiracy drama series.|$|E
5|$|To {{study the}} frescoes <b>progressively,</b> to analyse any discoveries and utilise the {{appropriate}} technical responses.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can <b>progressively</b> lead to stupor and coma. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as <b>progressively</b> heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to <b>progressively</b> heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
5|$|After the {{emergence}} of the first or second group of offspring, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae. The colony grows <b>progressively</b> larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became <b>progressively</b> more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Darby Creek is {{a popular}} site for angling. It is stocked {{annually}} by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, and {{by a number of}} local sportsman organizations. The former has been stocking <b>progressively</b> fewer trout every year for some time.|$|E
5|$|Drilling at low speed: The {{pilot hole}} is {{expanded}} by using <b>progressively</b> wider drills (typically {{between three and}} seven successive drilling steps, depending on implant width and length). Care is taken not to damage the osteoblast or bone cells by overheating. A cooling saline or water spray keeps the temperature low.|$|E
5|$|During May 1926, the {{approach}} road between Wentworth and {{the bridge was}} being <b>progressively</b> metalled, but could not be completed in its entirety until construction of the bridge itself was complete. In June, construction was halted due to contract requirements not being met.|$|E
5|$|Elvis Is Back! {{topped the}} UK Albums Chart and reached number two in Billboard's Top LP's. Initially, the release {{received}} mixed reviews, but over subsequent years its critical reception became <b>progressively</b> more positive. Elvis is Back! was certified Gold on July 15, 1999, by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|E
5|$|Events {{are put on}} for {{the benefit}} of the players, who take on roles called player {{characters}} (PCs) that the players may create themselves or be given by the gamemasters. Players sometimes play the same character repeatedly at separate events, <b>progressively</b> developing the character and its relations with other characters and the setting.|$|E
5|$|In Gippsland the Orbost {{line was}} {{constructed}} {{as an extension}} of suburban lines between 1877 and 1888 to Bairnsdale, and extended eastwards to Orbost in 1916. The line between Dandenong and Traralgon was electrified in 1954, but electrification was cut back <b>progressively</b> to Pakenham between 1987 and 2001. V/Line passenger trains now run as far as Bairnsdale.|$|E
5|$|In theaters, {{the film}} was given a {{platform}} release: on August 23, it was released in Los Angeles and New York City, expanding the next weekend to Phoenix, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Boston and Berkeley, and <b>progressively</b> expanding to more cities until its widest release on September 13.|$|E
5|$|Initially incarcerated in Utah in 1975 for aggravated {{kidnapping}} and attempted criminal assault, Bundy became {{a suspect in}} a <b>progressively</b> longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in Florida in 1978. He received three death sentences in two separate trials for the Florida homicides.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's cinema {{offers a}} {{different}} definition of film. According to film professors such as Jamsheed Akrami, {{unlike many other}} contemporary filmmakers Kiarostami has consistently attempted to redefine film by forcing the audience's increased involvement. In recent years he has also <b>progressively</b> trimmed down {{the size of his}} films, which Akrami believes reduces the film making experience from a collective endeavor to a purer, more basic form of artistic expression.|$|E
5|$|Left untreated, Wilson's disease {{tends to}} become <b>progressively</b> worse and is {{eventually}} fatal. With {{early detection and}} treatment, most of those affected can live relatively normal lives. Liver and neurologic damage that occurs prior to treatment may improve, but it is often permanent.|$|E
5|$|Like the Colosseum, {{the three}} façades have a {{different}} order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic on the piano nobile and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, {{the style of the}} building thus becoming <b>progressively</b> more ornate as it rises.|$|E
5|$|London {{had been}} a Roman {{settlement}} for four centuries and had become <b>progressively</b> more crowded inside its defensive city wall. It had also pushed outwards beyond the wall into squalid extramural slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Marion Wormer – Seemingly {{unemployed}} in Chicago. She tells Landis of how {{her husband}} Vernon accepted {{the blame for}} the parade debacle, and was subsequently fired, leading to their divorce. She becomes <b>progressively</b> more tipsy throughout the interview, eventually falling off her chair.|$|E
5|$|Market {{research}} had revealed {{that many of}} Concorde's existing business customers had their tickets purchased by their employers and thought {{that the cost of}} a journey on Concorde was higher than it actually was; thus ticket prices were <b>progressively</b> raised to match these perceptions. It is reported that British Airways then ran Concorde at a profit, unlike their French counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne Airport {{has five}} car parks, {{all of which}} operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The short-term, {{multi-level}} long-term, business and express carparks are covered, while the long-term parking is not. The main multi-level carpark {{in front of the}} terminal was built in the late 1990s, replacing the pre-existing ground-level car parking. It has been <b>progressively</b> expanded ever since.|$|E
5|$|Noh actors wear silk costumes called shozoku (robes) {{along with}} wigs, hats, and props {{such as the}} fan. With {{striking}} colors, elaborate texture, and intricate weave and embroidery, Noh robes are truly works of art in their own right. Costumes for the shite in particular are extravagant, shimmering silk brocades, but are <b>progressively</b> less sumptuous for the tsure, the wakizure, and the aikyōgen.|$|E
5|$|Short-distance {{passerine}} migrants {{have two}} evolutionary origins. Those that have long-distance migrants {{in the same}} family, such as the common chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, are species of southern hemisphere origins that have <b>progressively</b> shortened their return migration {{to stay in the}} northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} <b>progressively</b> {{more critical of}} Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and his campaign to eliminate {{what was left of}} the old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E
5|$|The 767 {{has been}} {{produced}} in three fuselage lengths. These debuted in <b>progressively</b> larger form as the 767-200, 767-300, and 767-400ER. Longer-range variants include the 767-200ER and 767-300ER, while cargo models include the 767-300F, a production freighter, and conversions of passenger 767-200 and 767-300 models.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The most important in this context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by <b>progressively</b> more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts.|$|E
5|$|The game {{follows the}} adventures of the eponymous half-genie Shantae, who must travel across Sequin Land, {{the setting of the}} series, to foil the {{domination}} plans of the evil lady pirate Risky Boots.

5|$|The major {{development}} of {{weapons in the}} early modern and modern periods occurred with firearms, which became <b>progressively</b> more efficient. Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general ballistic technology improved. Initially, iron round shot replaced the earlier stone balls for cannon then, latterly, different types of shot were invented.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} scheme covered all six greenhouse gases {{specified in the}} Kyoto Protocol and was intended to <b>progressively</b> apply to all {{sectors of the economy}} including agriculture. 'Participants' (who would account for their emissions) were to be few, and high in the production chain of each sector. Their compliance obligation would have been to surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} boulevards {{created by the}} project– Hainaut Boulevard (now Maurice Lemonnier Boulevard), Central Boulevard (now Boulevard Anspach), North Boulevard (now Adolphe Max Boulevard), and Senne Boulevard (now Émile Jacqmain Boulevard)– were <b>progressively</b> opened to traffic from 1871 to 1873.|$|E
