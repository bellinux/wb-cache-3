5|$|Eastwood {{composed}} Changelings jazz-influenced score. Featuring lilting {{guitars and}} strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of brass instruments evokes film noir, <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film's setting {{in a city}} controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with {{an increasing number of}} sustains and rises. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Lennie Niehaus. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label Varèse Sarabande.|$|E
5|$|While at university, Taborn toured and {{recorded}} with jazz saxophonist James Carter. Taborn {{went on to}} play with numerous other musicians in electronic and acoustic settings, while also building {{a reputation as a}} solo pianist. He has a range of styles, and often adapts his <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nature of the instrument and the sounds that he can make it produce. His improvising, particularly for solo piano, often adopts a modular approach, in which he begins with small units of melody and rhythm and then develops them into larger forms and structures.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} tour, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park {{for the first}} time on 20 August 1988, <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> largest crowd in the festival's history (107,000). Also included on the bill were Kiss, David Lee Roth, Megadeth, Guns N' Roses and Helloween. The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; {{the following}} year's festival was cancelled as a result. The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England. Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards. Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's Brave New World.|$|E

25|$|Curtis {{has been}} criticised for pandering to the American market by <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{stereotype}} of the English as posh, socially awkward eccentrics. This hasn't stopped the films generally being a huge success in the American and British cinema box office charts. Other films which have followed in Curtis's footsteps include Sliding Doors (1998), Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence (1998), About a Boy (2002), Wimbledon, and the American film What a Girl Wants (2002). Londinium (2001) used locations in Berkeley Square, Mayfair, Hyde Park, Primrose Hill Park and at Waterloo station.|$|E
25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, {{that no one else}} will intervene, that they are both <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E

500|$|From {{an early}} age Wilton was {{considered}} cerebral and introspective; his colleagues in adulthood found him to have an incisive mind, high standards, and little inclination or capacity for small talk. His serious demeanour earned him the ironic nicknames [...] "Happy Jack", [...] "Smiling John" [...] and [...] "Sir Jovial", though {{he was capable of}} thoughtful gestures and flashes of humour. Major General Paul Cullen, the Citizen Military Forces member of the Military Board from 1964 to 1966, described Wilton as [...] "very stiff, very regular, very formal—but a pleasant man". Korean War historian Robert O'Neill contended that [...] "One of the most remarkable aspects of his career was that he rose so far through a highly competitive profession without ever <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gallery." ...|$|E

In May 2006, the city renamed a park near its Central District Jimi Hendrix Park, in his honor. [...] In 2012, an official historic marker was erected {{on the site of the}} July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron, Georgia.

Congressional Quarterly columnist and CBS commentator Craig Crawford found Colbert's performance hilarious, but observed that most other people at the dinner did not find the speech amusing. Time magazine TV critic James Poniewozik thought that Colbert's critics missed the point: [...] "Colbert wasn't <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room, I suspect, but to the wide audience {{of people who would}} later watch on the Internet. If anything, he was playing against the room." [...] Poniewozik called the pained, uncomfortable reactions to Colbert's jokes [...] "the money shots. They were the whole point." ...|$|E

500|$|McCarthy {{admired the}} [...] "outstanding" [...] script, calling it ambitious and deceptively simple. He said Eastwood {{respected}} the script by not <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> melodramatic aspects and not telegraphing the story's scope from the start. Honeycutt wrote {{that due to}} its close adherence to the history the drama sagged at one point, but that the film did not feel as long as its 141 minutes because the filmmakers were [...] "good at cutting to the chase". Ansen said Straczynski's dialogue tended to the obvious, but that while the film lacked the moral nuance of Eastwood's others, the well-researched screenplay was [...] "a model of sturdy architecture", each layer of which built audience disgust into a [...] "fine fury". He said, [...] "when the tale is this gripping, why resist the moral outrage?" ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} night, the group {{performed}} {{a mix of}} new and older material for {{the third and fourth}} shows. [...] The contrast {{between the first and second}} nights has been noted by Hendrix biographers. [...] Based on interviews with Cox and Miles, concert reviews, and film footage, McDermott and Shadwick conclude that Hendrix was less animated during the third and fourth shows, when he stood mostly in place until the final encores, seemingly concentrating on recording. [...] In frequent interviews and in his autobiography, Bill Graham claimed that his criticism of Hendrix for <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience (although he seems to confuse which shows) spurred him on. However, according to McDermott, Hendrix was already determined to deliver suitable performances to finally settle the bitter legal dispute with Ed Chalpin. [...] All of the six songs that were chosen for Band of Gypsys were recorded during these two shows. When it was all done, Hendrix cut loose for his last encores with [...] "Wild Thing", [...] "Hey Joe", and [...] "Purple Haze".|$|E

[...] Around this time, Windham Hill Records, which had previously released the [...] songwriter compilation, put a call out to the music industry asking for songwriter submissions to be considered for the follow-up [...] compilation. [...] After the Old Vienna Kaffeehouse sent one of Paul's tapes to Windham Hill, Paul's [...] "Ashes to Dust" [...] from Urban Folksongs was chosen to be on the compilation. [...] In the interview with Wood, Paul stated that he felt very excited to be on the Windham Hill release because it served as a calling card that every DJ and folk promoter in the country would recognize. Legacy II was released in 1992 and included songs performed by Patty Larkin, Patty Griffin, Greg Brown, Cheryl Wheeler and several others. [...] Legacy II was Paul's first national exposure.|$|E

500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet. Mit Gas was recorded after they toured {{with the band}} Tool, whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances. Denison has likened the experience of <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to [...] "being pro-choice at a [...] Bush rally {{and trying to make}} your point". Subsequently, the band opted to organize their own tour in support of the album, choosing to work with Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Speaking about the planning required to stage a four-act tour, Patton stated [...] "that's a lot of music. That's {{a lot of time to}} be sitting in some stinking-ass club with some guy puking in your purse". Tool's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video, but the offer was declined by the band. Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album, although the song was not on the final track listing.|$|E
500|$|Modern Vampires of the City was {{an attempt}} Vampire Weekend to {{distance}} themselves from the sounds featured on their debut record and Contra. [...] "Whenever we came up with something familiar sounding, it was rejected", said Rechtshaid. Pitch shifting was a major component of recording the album. For tracks such as [...] "Step", drums were recorded on a Varispeed Tape deck set to a lower speed so that they would play back faster and more high pitched. Drummer Chris Tomson would then re-record the drums <b>playing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sped-up recording to get an uptempo live take. This second recording was then slowed back down to original speed to create an [...] "underwater" [...] effect. The effect is featured prominently on vocals as well. Ezra Koenig's vocals were run through Eventide H949 and 910 on tracks such as [...] "Diane Young", with both the pitch and formant shifted changed to manipulate the sound of recorded vocals. Bass guitar was also recorded straight to tape [...] "with a fairly ambient miking approach where the mic was three feet away from the cabinet". Vocals were recorded with Soundelux U99 Microphones, in combination with 1176 Classic limiter plug-in, Fairchild 670 Compressor and Elektro-Mess-Technik 140 Plate Reverb, giving the vocals a quality Batmanglij described as [...] "buttery". For guitar sounds, Batmanglij chose not to mic his guitar and instead plugged his Les Paul direct-in to ProTools through a SansAmp Amp Emulation Pedal, a technique used by Jimmy Page.|$|E
