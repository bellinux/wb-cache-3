When all acceptances had been counted at March 9, and after the Greek parliament subsequently had decided to activate a collective action clause for the bonds covered by Greek law, the overall share of Greek government bonds to face a <b>debt</b> <b>swap</b> had reached 95.7% (equal to €197bn).

40|$|As one of Kyoto’s three {{flexibility}} {{mechanisms for}} reducing the cost of compliance, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows the issuance of Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits from offset projects in non-Annex I countries. Whilst much attention {{has focused on the}} widespread use of the mechanism by China and India, the complex project cycle, and the lack of convincing baselines, little {{attention has been paid to}} the financing of CDM projects. In this paper we assess the extent to which CDM projects with public bodies should utilise <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> as a form of finance. The paper does this through analysing the use of a <b>debt</b> <b>swap</b> between Uruguay and Spain within a CDM wind farm project in Uruguay. The paper assesses this transaction according to a simple framework by which <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> can be evaluated: whether it delivers additional resources to the debtor country and/or debtor government budget; whether it delivers more resources for climate purposes; whether it has a sizeable effect on overall debt burdens (thereby creating ‘indirect’ benefits); and whether it adheres to the principles of alignment with government policy and systems (key elements within the new aid approach). ...|$|R

Some losses by private creditors are likely to be part of any resolution of the debt crisis, and such losses are implicit in some of the many proposals for dealing with the crisis. However, through a combination of self interest and public policy the current impasse in the debt crisis should be overcome. This may be done partly through large scale <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> sponsored by private or public agencies. <b>Debt</b> <b>swaps</b> are already being implemented bilaterally in small steps and through a variety of instruments, including debt conversions and buybacks.

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{worldwide}} commitments to meet global basic learning needs made at the 1990 United Nations Conference on Education for All (EFA) in Jomtien, the 2000 World Education Forum in Dakar and the 2000 United Nations Millennium Summit in New York, UNESCO has established a Working Group on <b>Debt</b> <b>Swaps</b> for Education which has met on two occasions so far, in 2006 and 2007. Drawing on experiences of bilateral donors such as Spain and Germany, this UNESCO Working Group is now promoting debt-for-education swaps, constructions whereby external debt is cancelled by the creditor {{in exchange for the}} debtor government’s commitment to mobilise domestic resources for education sector spending. The experience with <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> in the mid 1990 s was, however, far from positive, and recent improved insight in the economics of debt relief suggests extreme caution. In reviewing debt-for-education swaps between Germany and Indonesia and between Spain and El Salvador, this paper examines to what extent these second- generation <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> differ from their contested predecessors. We argue that, while the Paris Declaration’s principles of policy and system alignment appear to have been fairly well implemented on education sector level in both case studies considered, it is mainly the macro-economic nature of such swaps that remains problematic. For debt relief to hold at least some promise of translating into an efficient and effective instrument of development, it should be large and comprehensive, {{as in the case of}} the HIPC Initiative and its successor the MDRI. ...|$|R
40|$|In any <b>debt</b> <b>swap,</b> {{a country}} must {{surrender}} {{an asset to}} extinguish a liability. To retire its foreign debt, government must first purchase internationally traded assets from the domestic private sector. How this purchase is financed has important macroeconomic implications. Money-financed swaps can induce depreciation of the parallel exchange rate, temporary current-account deficit, and reserve losses. Bond-financed swaps can increase interest payments, since domestic debt typically carries higher real interest than foreign <b>debt.</b> If <b>swaps</b> lead to sustained domestic debt accumulation, which agents perceive will be monetized, the inflation rate will rise {{as soon as the}} swap program begins.

A <b>debt</b> <b>swap</b> is defined as a game.

Cross-border coalitions may compound the pattern of conflict and co-operation. Issue linkage has been observed too. Specific design of a swap, comprising project selection and procurement rules among other things, determines whose interests are directly served by its mechanism, whose are left to the market forces, and whose are not served at all. Thus alternative design features, discussed in the paper, are reflected in payoffs from the game. The analytical model developed is applied to the Polish <b>debt</b> <b>swap</b> negotiated with the Paris Club in 1991. Under the agreement on the official debt forgiveness (50 percent) and rescheduling, Poland has been authorised to negotiate additional swaps (up to 10 percent) in a series of bilateral and voluntary deals with creditor countries. The government decided to: (1) seek debt-for-environment swaps only, and (2) co-ordinate all the bilateral contracts through a multilateral facility, the EcoFund, operated by the contributing creditor countries and Poland on a "club basis". Even though the EcoFund proved successful in its role serving global environmental protection and creditors' commercial interests, its development has been slow. Two countries took advantage of the full 10 percent swap option, three more participate with lower contributions and few others are still considering their membership in the "club".

40|$|Abstract: The Debt 2 Health Conversion Scheme of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria {{is used to}} {{reassess}} a range of recent initiatives that propose debt relief in exchange for spending in the health sector. The experience with <b>debt</b> <b>swaps</b> in the mid 1990 s was far from positive, and recent improved insight in the economics of debt relief suggests extreme caution. We argue that the recent spade of <b>debt</b> <b>swap</b> proposals, even if targeting countries and debt titles that fall outside current major international debt relief mechanisms, share most of the design faults of previous initiatives. Proposals such as Debt 2 Health do not constitute efficient vehicles to increase net transfers to poor countries, to reduce the economic disadvantages of indebtedness, or to strengthen public health systems of partner countries. For debt relief to constitute a valuable mechanism to provide aid, it should be designed as a large-scale and comprehensive operation, with spending earmarked to broad country-established priorities, and reinforce rather than undermine national implementation systems...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Debt</b> {{for nature}} <b>swaps</b> are usually {{actioned}} by an indebted nation's elite, not the peasantry who may traditionally have owned {{or at least}} used the land in question.
