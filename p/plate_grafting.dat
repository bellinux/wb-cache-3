40|$|Introduction: Close {{reduction}} and intra medullary nailing {{has been established}} as the treatment for femoral shaft fractures with a nonunion rate of 0. 9 - 1. 1 %; though, it is still controversial. Currently, the most accepted method for treatment of non union is exchange nailing. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate treatment of femoral shaft fractures non union via 2 methods of exchange nailing with bone graft and nail removal, and <b>plating</b> with bone <b>graft.</b> Methods: In this case series study, we included all patients with aseptic nonunion femoral fracture who referred to Rasool-Akram hospital from 2007 to 2012 and were clinically indicated for reoperation for nonunion after primary intra medullary nailing. Patients were assessed clinically and radiologically. The patients were treated via either method according {{to the type of}} nonunion (atrophic, oligotrophic, hypertrophic). Collected data were recorded in check lists and analyzed with SPSS V. 18 software. Results: Of 23 patients with mean age of 30. 4 ± 8. 5 years, 13 (56 %) were treated by exchange nailing with bone graft and 10 (44 %) treated by <b>plating</b> and bone <b>graft.</b> Complete union was achieved in 85. 7 % of patients treated by exchange nailing and bone graft and in 90. 9 % of patients treated with <b>plating</b> with bone <b>graft.</b> No leg length discrepancy, pain and infection were reported. Conclusion: This study suggests that treatment results of nonunion femoral fractures with <b>plating</b> bone <b>graft</b> method is as good as or even better than exchange nailing with bone graft.

In this study, we evaluated several criteria of human skin fibroblasts when cultured with DGL of generations 2, 3 and 4, with linear PLL polymer as reference. In aqueous phase, DGLs and PLL displayed a similar cytotoxicity towards fibroblasts. Plastic culture <b>plates</b> <b>grafted</b> with DGLs were further characterized as homogeneous surfaces by atomic force microscopy and surface characterization by amino density estimation by colorimetric assay. Proliferation of fibroblasts was increased when cultured onto PLL and DGLs monolayers when compared with crude plates. Cellular adhesion was increased by 20 % on DGLs in comparison to PLL. Integrin α 5 subunit protein expression level was increased after 48 h of culture on DGLs, in comparison to control or PLL-coated surfaces. The presence of DGLs did not lead to overexpression or activation of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Finally, fibroblasts adhesion was increased by 40 % on poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) matrices functionalized with DGLs when compared to PLL.

40|$|Abstract: In this work, triethyl {{phosphate}} (TEP) {{was used to}} bioactivating titanium. Titanium <b>plates</b> <b>grafted</b> with TEP were immersed in a two times concentrated simulated body fluid (2 SBF) to investigate deposition of hydoxyapatite (HA) on the surface. A phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) {{was used to evaluate}} adsorption of protein on the grafted titanium surface. The morphology, component and structure of samples were examined by scanning electronic microscopy, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction respectively. The concentration change of BSA in adsorption test was examined with the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra (UV). The analyses showed that TEP grafted onto the titanium surface. In 2 SBF, calcium and phosphate ions deposited spontaneously onto the grafted titanium surface and formed a HA coating with a network-like microporous structure after being immersed for 3 days. The coating consisted of HA particles with 180 - 265 nm in thickness and 72 - 85 nm in width. The diameter of the micropores was about 200 nm. The HA coating appeared better uniformity than that on the modified titanium using phosphoric acid. BSA rapidly adsorbed onto the grafted titanium surface at first half an hour and then the adsorption quantity almost kept constant. These results indicate that TEP grafting is an effective approach to modify bioactivity of titanium...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Medial open wedge high tibial {{osteotomy}} is {{a well-established}} procedure {{for the treatment}} of unicompartmental osteoarthritis and symptomatic varus malalignment. We hypothesized that different fixation devices generate different fixation stability profiles for the various wedge sizes in a finite element (FE) analysis. METHODS Four types of fixation were compared: 1) first and 2) second generation Puddu plates, and 3) TomoFix plate with and 4) without bone graft. Cortical and cancellous bone was modelled and five different opening wedge sizes were studied for each model. Outcome measures included: 1) stresses in bone, 2) relative displacement of the proximal and distal tibial fragments, 3) stresses in the plates, 4) stresses on the upper and lower screw surfaces in the screw channels. RESULTS The highest load for all fixation types occurred in the plate axis. For {{the vast majority of the}} wedge sizes and fixation types the shear stress (von Mises stress) was dominating in the bone independent of fixation type. The relative displacements of the tibial fragments were low (in μm range). With an increasing wedge size this displacement tended to increase for both Puddu plates and the TomoFix <b>plate</b> with bone <b>graft.</b> For the TomoFix <b>plate</b> without bone <b>graft</b> a rather opposite trend was observed. For all fixation types the occurring stresses at the screw-bone contact areas pulled at the screws and exceeded the allowable threshold of 1. 2 MPa for at least one screw surface. Of the six screw surfaces that were studied, the TomoFix <b>plate</b> with bone <b>graft</b> showed a stress excess of one out of twelve and without bone graft, five out of twelve. With the Puddu plates, an excess stress occurred in the majority of screw surfaces. CONCLUSIONS The different fixation devices generate different fixation stability profiles for different opening wedge sizes. Based on the computational simulations, none of the studied osteosynthesis fixation types warranted an intransigent full weight bearing per se. The highest fixation stability was observed for the TomoFix plates and the lowest for the first generation Puddu plate. These findings were revealed in theoretical models and need to be validated in controlled clinical settings...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} augmentation of shallow urethral <b>plate</b> by lingual <b>graft</b> in repair of distal penile hypospadias. Patients and methods: Between June 2008 and May 2011, the procedure was performed on 23 patients with mean age 2. 3 years (range 1 – 3). All patients had distal penile hypospadias; 11 sub coronal and 12 coronal. The urethral plate was less than 8  mm in all patients and 3 of them had history of previous hypospadias surgery. All procedures were carried out under general anesthesia using 4 × magnifying loupe. After penile degloving and dorsal incision of the urethral <b>plate,</b> the lingual <b>graft</b> was harvested and sutured {{to the edges of}} the incised urethral plate from the hypospadias opening to the tip of the penis. The neourethra was closed and an intervening flap was fixed over the neourethra as a barrier against fistula formation. Results: Success rate was 87 % as 20 / 23 patients were cured without any permanent complication throughout the follow up period. None of patients suffered meatal stenosis or required regular urethral dilatation. Three patients developed urethrocutaneous fistula, of which two closed spontaneously and one required surgical repair 6 months later.

40|$|AbstractDuring development, {{inferior}} olivary axons {{cross the}} floor plate and project from the caudal to the rostral hindbrain, whence they grow into the cerebellar plate. We {{have investigated the}} axon guidance signals involved {{in the formation of}} this projection in vitro. When the cerebellar <b>plate</b> was <b>grafted</b> ectopically along the margin of the hindbrain in organotypic cultures, inferior olivary axons could pathfind to the ectopic cerebellum, establishing a topographically normal projection. Following rostrocaudal reversal of a region of tissue in the axon pathway between the inferior olive and the cerebellum, olivary axons still navigated towards the cerebellum. Moreover, olivary axons could cross a bridging tissue explant (spinal cord) to reach a cerebellar explant. In collagen gel cultures of inferior olive explants, olivary axon outgrowth increased significantly in the presence of cerebellar explants and axons deflected towards the cerebellar tissue. These results show that the cerebellum is a source of diffusible axon guidance signals for olivary axons. We also found that, in organotypic cultures, olivary axons which had crossed the floor plate showed an increased tendency to respond to cerebellar cues. Taken together, these results indicate that the cerebellum is the source of cues that are chemoattractant and growth-promoting for inferior olivary axons; prior exposure to the floor plate increases responsiveness to these cues...|$|R

The global objective of this project is to enhance the bioactivity of biomaterials such as implantable devices and 3 D scaffolds by adding extracellular matrix components and therefore facilitate the adhesion, growth and survival of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in biomaterials for tissue repair and tissue engineering applications. In this project chondroitin sulfate (CS) and growth factors were studied for their effect on hMSC in biomaterials. First, {{the effect of these}} biomolecules was tested in solution. Then, two kinds of biomaterials were created: bioactive surfaces for enhancing bioactivity of implantable devices and bioactive hydrogels which can be used as 3 D scaffolds for cell encapsulation and delivery. A pro-survival effect of the growth factors studied in this project (epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor) was not observed when tested in solution, therefore the project further focused on CS effect only. Interestingly, CS did not affect cell growth in media containing serum, while inducing cell detachment from substrate in serum free conditions. For the bioactive surfaces construction, CS was grafted to either an amine-rich plasmapolymerized coating created on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films (further referred as LP) or to commercial cell culture plates functionalized with amino groups. The bioactive surfaces were characterized by different techniques such as contact angle, atomic force microscopy, Orange II dye and Toluidine Blue O dye colorimetric assays (for amino group and CS quantification respectively) and finally, cell culture experiments (adhesion, growth and survival). Results confirmed the presence of CS grafted on both substrates. Commercial amine <b>plates</b> <b>grafted</b> almost five times more CS compared to LP. This rendered the surface antifouling for proteins and cells as confirmed by protein adsorption and cell culture assays. Cell culture assays on bioactive surfaces based on LP demonstrated improved cell adhesion and growth when compared to tissue culture plates or bare PET films in serum containing conditions. Chitosan based hydrogels containing CS at a concentration of 500 μg/ml resulted in a cohesive hydrogel which supported hMSC viability up to 7 days. However increasing CS concentration to high level such as 10000 μg/ml led to decrease of cell viability after 4 or 7 days, probably due to lack of porosity and water since the hydrogel precipitates upon formation and expulses water. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that CS immobilization can enhance the biological interactions of hMSC with biomaterials used for implantable devices such as PET. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possible effect of CS on hMSC differentiation and phenotype. Hydrogels with CS could be very interesting for tissue engineering applications such as cartilage formation...|$|R
