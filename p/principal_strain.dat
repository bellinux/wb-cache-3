5000|$|Strain {{in three}} dimensions: Basically, any object or body is three dimensional, {{and can be}} {{deformed}} in different directions simultaneously. Strain {{can be described as}} a tensor with three principal strains (εx, εy and εz in a Cartesian coordinate system), and six shear strains components. In the heart, it has been customary to describe the three <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> components as longitudinal (in the direction of the long axis of the ventricles), circumferential (in the direction of the ventricular circumference), and transmural (the deformation across the wall. Transmural deformation has also been called [...] "radial", but this is unfortunate as in ultrasound in general the term radial describes [...] "in the direction of the ultrasound beam"). However, as the heart muscle is incompressible, the three <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> must balance; (εx + εy + εz = 1. As the ventricle contracts in systole, there is longitudinal shortening (negative strain), circumferential shortening (negative strain) and transmural (wall) thickening (positive strain). Due to this, {{and the fact that the}} left ventricle in normal conditions contract with a relatively invariant outer contour, the longitudinal strain contains the main information, while transmural strain (wall thickening) is a function of wall shortening, wall thickness and chamber diameter, while circumferential shortening is mainly a function of wall thickening. It has been shown clinically that longitudinal strain rate and wall thickening are diagnostically equivalent.|$|E

40|$|Robust {{indices of}} {{regional}} and global cardiac function {{are a key}} factor in detection and treatment of heart disease as well as understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of a healthy heart. Myocardial elastography provides a noninvasive method for imaging and measuring displacement and strain of the myocardium for the early detection of cardiovascular disease. However, two-dimensional in-plane axial and lateral strains measured depend on the sonographic view used. This becomes especially critical in a clinical setting and may induce large variations in the measured strains, potentially leading to false diagnoses. A novel method in myocardial elastography is proposed for eliminating this view dependence by deriving the polar, principal and classified <b>principal</b> <b>strains.</b> The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed by employing 3 D finite-element left-ventricular models of a control and an ischemic canine heart. Although polar strains are angle-independent, they are sensitive to the selected reference coordinate system, which requires the definition of a centroid of the left ventricle (LV). In contrast, <b>principal</b> <b>strains</b> derived through eigenvalue decomposition exhibit the inherent characteristic of coordinate system independence, offering view (i. e., angle and centroid) -independent <b>strain</b> measurements. Classified <b>principal</b> <b>strains</b> are obtained by assigning the principal components in the physical ventricular coordinate system.

MethodsEight porcine mitral valves were tested in a physiologic left heart simulator under normal hemodynamic conditions. Leaflet strain was measured by tracking the displacement of a 5 × 8 marker array located on the central region of the anterior leaflet. Local leaflet strain and strain rates were calculated from measured displacements. The experiments were conducted in 4 different annular configurations associated with saddle height/commissural diameter ratios of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 %. All experiments were conducted in the normal papillary muscle position.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have highlighted}} {{the shortcomings of}} traditional thinking about faults and fault patterns. The slip model of faulting, developed by Ze'ev Reches, suggests that four sets of faults, arranged in orthorhombic symmetry about the <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> axes, can accommodate general, three-dimensional strain. Classic conjugate faults are simply a special case of plane strain. Careful analysis of orthorhombic fault patterns and the tenets of the slip model {{has led to the}} development of a practical method for decoding the strain significance of fault systems developed in three-dimensional strain fields. The methods are implicit in a model here called the odd-axis model. This new model calls special attention to the odd axis: the one <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> with sign opposite the other two, assuming a constant volume deformation. Odd-axis medel equations relate fault set geometry to <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> magnitudes or ratios, the internal friction angle, φ, and the ratio of average fault slip to average spacing between faults of the same set, R. For systems where R < 0. 1, the three <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> ratios are given by tan²α, -sin²α, and -COS²α, where α is the strike of the fault set(s) measured in the plane perpendicular to the odd axis. The model also predicts slip vector orientations as functions of <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> ratios and orientations. The kinematic implications of the odd-axis model are compatible with those of the slip model. In this first quantitative field test, both fault models are applied to the Chimney Rock array, a system of orthorhombic faults in the northern San Rafael Swell of central Utah. The odd-axis model uses fault plane and slip vector data from Chimney Rock to predict <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> ratios (ε(y) /ε(x), ε(y) /ε(z), and ε(x) /ε(z)) of. 20, -. 16, and -. 84. These compare extremely well with the observed values, based on fault separation measurements, of. 17, -. 15, and -. 85. The value of ε(y) /ε(z) predicted by the slip model, -. 16, matches exactly the value predicted by the odd-axis model and nearly matches the observed value, which is -. 15. The success of the field test at Chimney Rock, and the conceptual agreement of both models, suggest that the new theory can accurately relate orthorhombic fault geometries and three-dimensional strain fields. Furthermore, the results underscore how important it is for geologists to recognize the sensitivity of fault geometry and kinematics to three-dimensional strain...|$|E

An extensive parametric analysis has been performed {{for a range of}} values of droplet equivalence ratio (ϕd), droplet diameter (ad) and turbulence intensity (u′). The results have been analysed to analyse the statistical behaviours of the alignments of the gradients of mixture fraction and reaction progress variable and of the vorticity vector (ω→) with the local <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> rates. The resulting alignments of reactive scalar gradient and vorticity with local <b>principal</b> <b>strain</b> rates in droplet-laden flames have been compared to those observed for a gaseous stoichiometric premixed flame under the same turbulent flow conditions.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the ability of subtle differences in LV <b>principal</b> <b>strains</b> to characterize features of subclinical LV dysfunction in patients with systemic hypertension and apparently preserved LV systolic function. Methods 2 -dimensional echocardiographic (2 DE) images of the LV were acquired in apical 4 -chamber and parasternal short-axis at the basal, mid, and apical levels in 59 subjects, including 25 healthy controls (33  ±  4  yrs, 14 male) and 34 patients with systemic hypertension (36  ±  3  yrs, 24 male). Longitudinal (LS), circumferential (CS) and radial strains (RS) were quantified in an 18 -segment model using a novel speckle tracking system (2 D Cardiac Performance Analysis, TomTec Imaging System, Munich, Germany). ResultsIn comparison with normal controls, peak LS was markedly attenuated in the subendocardial and subepicardial regions in patients with systemic hypertension. However, circumferential strain was reduced only in subepicardial region; radial strain was not significantly different in the two groups. The subendocardial-to-subepicardial gradient of circumferential deformation correlated with the radial strains in both controls and hypertensive patients (R =  0. 87, p <  0. 001).

To examine {{transmural}} finite deformation in {{the wall}} of the canine left ventricle, closely spaced columns of lead beads were implanted at a single site on the left ventricular free wall. The three-dimensional coordinates of these myocardial markers were obtained with high-speed biplane cineradiography. Any four noncoplanar markers forming small tetrahedral volumes («* 0. 1 cc) were used to calculate finite normal and shear strains with respect to a cardiac coordinate system at end diastole. Due to the symmetry of the finite strain tensor, the algebraic eigenvalue problem could be solved to compute <b>principal</b> <b>strains</b> and the directions of the principal axes of deformation with respect to the reference coordinates. An examination of the <b>principal</b> <b>strains</b> in a number of tetrahedra in five animals indicates that deformation increases with depth beneath the epicardium.

Furthermore, shortening and thickening strains at midwall and deeper are too large (0. 10 to 0. 40) to be described accurately by infinitesimal theory.
