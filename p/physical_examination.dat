5|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>examination</b> of {{a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns {{symptoms}} of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a <b>physical</b> <b>examination.</b> As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} by <b>physical</b> <b>examination</b> {{alone can}} be difficult (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence.

A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{endometrial cancer}} is made first by a <b>physical</b> <b>examination</b> and {{dilation}} and curettage (removal of endometrial tissue; D).

Non-hereditary recurrent pneumothorax and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a <b>physical</b> <b>examination.</b> In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E

5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} <b>physical</b> <b>examinations</b> by assessment of correlation between <b>physical</b> <b>examinations</b> and CT measurements in children with intoeing gait and the causes of intoeing gait by age using CT measurements. Method Twenty-six children with intoeing gait participated in this study. The internal and external hip rotation, thigh-foot angle and transmalleolar angle were measured. In addition, femoral anteversion and tibial torsion of the subjects were assessed using a CT scan. The measurements of torsional angles were performed twice by two raters. The correlation coefficients between <b>physical</b> <b>examinations</b> and CT measurements were calculated using Pearson correlation. The data was analyzed statistically using SPSS v 12. 0. Results The correlation coefficients between <b>physical</b> <b>examinations</b> and CT measurements were not high. Before 5 years of age, intoeing gait was caused by femoral anteversion in 17. 86 %, tibial torsion in 32. 29 % and the combination of causes in 35. 71 % of cases. After 6 years of age, the contributions changed to 29. 17 %, 8. 33 % and 45. 83 %, respectively. Conclusion Before 5 years of age, the common cause of an intoeing gait was tibial torsion, whereas after 6 years of age it was femoral anteversion. Regardless of age, {{the most common cause}} of intoeing gait was a combination of causes. This study shows poor correlation between <b>physical</b> <b>examinations</b> and CT.

5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and <b>physical</b> <b>examination</b> have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|A <b>physical</b> <b>examination</b> {{and medical}} history are {{generally}} not enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. Septic prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of septic arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E

5|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>examination</b> {{findings}} typically include jaundice {{and right}} upper quadrant tenderness. Charcot's triad {{is a set}} of three common findings in cholangitis: abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. This was assumed in the past to be present in 50–70% of cases, although more recently the frequency has been reported as 15–20%. Reynolds' pentad includes the findings of Charcot's triad with the presence of septic shock and mental confusion. This combination of symptoms indicates worsening of the condition and the development of sepsis, and is seen less commonly still.|$|E
5|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>examination</b> {{typically}} reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
