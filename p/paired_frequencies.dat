The 1090 MHz frequency (paired with 1030 MHz) is also used by Mode S transponders, which ADS-B augments when operated at this frequency.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{differences}} between LTE-TDD and LTE-FDD: how data is uploaded and downloaded, and what frequency spectra the networks are deployed in. While LTE-FDD uses <b>paired</b> <b>frequencies</b> to upload and download data, LTE-TDD uses a single frequency, alternating between uploading and downloading data through time. The ratio between uploads and downloads on a LTE-TDD network can be changed dynamically, depending on whether more data needs to be sent or received. LTE-TDD and LTE-FDD also operate on different frequency bands, with LTE-TDD working better at higher frequencies, and LTE-FDD working better at lower frequencies. Frequencies used for LTE-TDD range from 1850 MHz to 3800 MHz, with several different bands being used. The LTE-TDD spectrum is generally cheaper to access, and has less traffic. Further, the bands for LTE-TDD overlap with those used for WiMAX, which can easily be upgraded to support LTE-TDD.|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{properties of}} the dendrites in prepositus hypoglossi neurons are involved in maintenance of eye position. The biophysical {{properties of the}}se neurons are essential for {{the operation of the}} vestibular neural integrator that converts a head velocity signal to one that controls eye position. A novel method named QSA (quadratic sinusoidal analysis) for voltage clamped neurons was used to quantify nonlinear responses that are dominated by dendrites. The voltage clamp currents were measured at harmonic and interactive frequencies using specific stimulation frequencies, which act as frequency probes of the intrinsic nonlinear neuronal behavior. These responses to <b>paired</b> <b>frequencies</b> form a matrix that can be reduced by eigendecomposition to provide a very compact piecewise quadratic analysis at different membrane potentials that otherwise is usually described by complex differential equations involving a large numbers of parameters and dendritic compartments. Moreover, the QSA matrix can be interpolated to capture most of the nonlinear neuronal behavior like a Volterra kernel. The interpolated quadratic functions of the two major prepositus hypoglossi neurons, namely type B and D, are strikingly different. A major part of the nonlinear responses is due to the persistent sodium conductance, which appears to be essential for sustained nonlinear effects induced by NMDA activation and thus would be critical for the operation of the neural integrator. Finally, the dominance of the nonlinear responses by the dendrites supports the hypothesis that persistent sodium conductance channels and NMDA receptors act synergistically to dynamically control the influence of individual synaptic inputs on network behavior...|$|E

40|$|The {{involvement}} of acetylcholine (ACh) in the induction of neuronal sensory plasticity is well documented. Recently we {{demonstrated in the}} somatosensory cortex of the anesthetized rat that ACh is also involved in the expression of neuronal plasticity. Pairing stimulation of the principal whisker at a fixed temporal frequency with ACh iontophoresis induced potentiations of response that required re-application of ACh to be expressed. Here we fully characterize this phenomenon and extend it to stimulation of adjacent whiskers. We show that these ACh-dependent potentiations are cumulative and reversible. When several sensori-cholinergic pairings were applied consecutively with stimulation of the principal whisker, the response at the <b>paired</b> <b>frequency</b> was further increased, demonstrating a cumulative process that could reach saturation levels. The potentiations were specific to the stimulus frequency: if the successive pairings were done at different frequencies, then the potentiation caused by the first pairing was depotentiated, whereas {{the response to the}} newly <b>paired</b> <b>frequency</b> was potentiated. During testing, the potentiation of response did not develop immediately on the presentation of the <b>paired</b> <b>frequency</b> during application of ACh: the analysis of the kinetics of the effect indicates that this process requires the sequential presentation of several trains of stimulation at the <b>paired</b> <b>frequency</b> to be expressed. We present evidence that a plasticity with similar characteristics can be induced for responses to stimulation of an adjacent whisker, suggesting that this potentiation could participate in receptive field spatial reorganizations.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{by which}} homologous chromosomes pair is currently unknown. Here, we use fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} in combination with three-dimensional optical microscopy to show that homologous pairing of the somatic chromosome arm 2 L in Drosophila occurs by independent initiation of pairing at discrete loci rather than by a processive zippering of sites along the length of chromosome. By evaluating the <b>pairing</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 11 loci on chromosome arm 2 L over several timepoints during Drosophila embryonic development, we show that all 11 loci are paired very early in Drosophila development, within 13 h after egg deposition. To elucidate whether such pairing occurs by directed or undirected motion, we analyzed the pairing kinetics of histone loci during nuclear cycle 14. By measuring changes of nuclear length and correlating these changes with progression of time during cycle 14, we were able to express the <b>pairing</b> <b>frequency</b> and distance between homologous loci as a function of time. Comparing the experimentally determined dynamics of pairing to simulations based on previously proposed models of pairing motion, we show that the observed pairing kinetics are most consistent with a constrained random walk model and not consistent with a directed motion model.

40|$|Epistatic genetic {{interactions}} are key {{for understanding the}} genetic contribution to complex traits. Epistasis is always defined with respect to some trait such as growth rate or fitness. Whereas most existing epistasis screens explicitly test for a trait, {{it is also possible}} to implicitly test for fitness traits by searching for the over- or under-representation of allele pairs in a given population. Such analysis of imbalanced allele <b>pair</b> <b>frequencies</b> of distant loci has not been exploited yet on a genome-wide scale, mostly due to statistical difficulties such as the multiple testing problem. We propose a new approach called Imbalanced Allele <b>Pair</b> <b>frequencies</b> (ImAP) for inferring epistatic interactions that is exclusively based on DNA sequence information. Our approach is based on genome-wide SNP data sampled from a population with known family structure. We make use of genotype information of parent-child trios and inspect 3 × 3 contingency tables for detecting pairs of alleles from different genomic positions that are over- or under-represented in the population. We also developed a simulation setup which mimics the pedigree structure by simultaneously assuming independence of the markers. When applied to mouse SNP data, our method detected 168 imbalanced allele pairs, which is substantially more than in simulations assuming no interactions. We could validate a significant number of the interactions with external data, and we found that interacting loci are enriched for genes involved in developmental processes...|$|R

40|$|Pulsation {{frequencies}} of acoustic modes are calculated for realistic rotating stellar models using both a perturbative and a two-dimensional approach. A {{comparison between the}} two yields validity domains which {{are similar to those}} previously obtained in Reese et al. for polytropic models. One can also construct validity domains based on polynomial fits to the frequencies from the two-dimensional approach, and these also turn out to be similar, thus further confirming the agreement between the perturbative and the two-dimensional approaches at low rotation rates. Furthermore, as was previously shown in Espinosa et al., adjacent frequencies in multiplets come close together, thus forming pairs. This phenomenon, exclusive to two-dimensional calculations, is shown to be an unlikely explanation of the close <b>frequency</b> <b>pairs</b> observed in δ Scuti stars. A systematic search for all close <b>frequency</b> <b>pairs</b> in the calculated spectrum is also carried out.

Clustering algorithms demonstrate further that profiles of middle-base pairing in the synthetase antisense alignments are correlated along the sequences from one species-pair to another, whereas {{this is not the case}} for similar operations on sets representing the null hypothesis. Most probable reconstructed sequences for ancestral nodes of maximum likelihood trees show that middle-base <b>pairing</b> <b>frequency</b> increases to approximately 0. 42 ± 0. 002 as bacterial trees approach their roots; ancestral nodes from trees including archaeal sequences show a less pronounced increase. Thus, contemporary and reconstructed sequences all validate important bioinformatic predictions based on descent from opposite strands of the same ancestral gene. They further provide novel evidence for the hypothesis that bacteria lie closer than archaea to the origin of translation.
