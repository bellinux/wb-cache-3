5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a top speed of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for a top speed of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond the capabilities of 464-29.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made {{its way into the}} finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E

Throughput, maximum transmit power, and sensitivity of multi-band UWB system is varied with respect to the number of Sub-Bands. In addition, because of Multi-path effect, if PRF(Pulse Repetition Frequency) is changed, the Multi-path link margin is happened to compensate for Multi-path Energy Loss which is contributed by increasing of the Link Margin. According to Multi-path Margin, the variation of the resistance with respect to sensitivity and interference signal is observed and analyzed through the simulation. ope...|$|R

5|$|The four tenders {{resulting}} from the study were submitted during October and November 1986. Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the initial inspection, the evaluation team found that the German proposal was less attractive than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN's <b>performance</b> <b>requirements,</b> the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums' proposal conceded {{that they did not}} meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The evaluation team recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines to a common baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums' figures revised upwards, and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted in growing support for the Type471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, who questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.|$|E

40|$|A {{new problem}} {{formulation}} is presented for the Gaussian interference channels (GIFC) with {{two pairs of}} users, which are distinguished as primary users and secondary users, respectively. The primary users employ a pair of encoder and decoder that were originally designed to satisfy a given error <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> {{under the assumption that}} no interference exists from other users. In the scenario when the secondary users attempt to access the same medium, we are interested in the maximum transmission rate (defined as accessible capacity) at which secondary users can communicate reliably without affecting the error <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> by the primary users under the constraint that the primary encoder (not the decoder) is kept unchanged. By modeling the primary encoder as a generalized trellis code (GTC), we are then able to treat the secondary link and the cross link from the secondary transmitter to the primary receiver as finite state channels (FSCs). Based on this, upper and lower bounds on the accessible capacity are derived. The impact of the error <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> by the primary users on the accessible capacity is analyzed by using the concept of interference margin. In the case of non-trivial interference margin, the secondary message is split into common and private parts and then encoded by superposition coding, which delivers a lower bound on the accessible capacity. For some special cases, these bounds can be computed numerically by using the BCJR algorithm. Numerical results are also provided to gain insight into the impacts of the GTC and the error <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> on the accessible capacity.

40|$|Ellipsoidal unfalsified {{control is}} a plant-model-free, {{data-driven}} control design method. It recursively checks, using available data, whether {{the ability of a}} controller to meet a predefined <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> is (un) falsified. The set of unfalsified controllers is described by an ellipsoid in the control parameter space. The update of the ellipsoid employing new measurements can be computed analytically, hence, it is computationally cheap. This adaptive scheme is applied to an experimental motion system, namely to an industrial inkjet printer at a sample rate of 1 kHz. The results clearly show that the algorithm updates the control parameter set when the <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> is not met with the currently implemented one. The resulting closed-loop behavior resembles the predefined reference model in the dominant frequency range...|$|R
