5|$|In August 1844, in {{the midst}} of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then {{unequivocally}} committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election. The victorious Democrats were <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of Manifest Destiny, rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, with Union troops under Ulysses S.

On about April 12, Davis received Robert E. Lee's letter announcing surrender.

5|$|On the continent, the {{extension}} of the Empire's borders beyond the Rhine hung in the balance for some time, with the emperor Caligula apparently <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> invade Germania in 39 AD, and Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo crossing the Rhine in 47 AD and marching into the territory of the Frisii and Chauci. Caligula's successor, Claudius, ordered the suspension of further attacks across the Rhine, setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire's expansion in this direction.|$|E
5|$|Sizable reinforcements—the 6th Battalion—came to Naguib {{only when}} his 9th Battalion was <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> attack Nitzanim.

5|$|The Japanese army {{advanced}} swiftly southward {{through the}} Malay Peninsula, crushing or bypassing Allied resistance. The Allied forces {{did not have}} tanks, which they considered unsuitable in the tropical rainforest, and their infantry proved powerless against the Japanese light tanks.

By 31 January 1942, a mere 55 days {{after the start of}} the invasion, the Japanese had conquered the entire Malay Peninsula and were <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> attack Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> become a state park in 1903, but a veto by Governor Richard Yates {{prevented}} that from occurring.

In 1927 the park was established with help from supporters in the Chicago media. The park contains two freshwater streams, dolomite rock formations, {{and a variety of}} activities generally associated with Illinois state parks.

5|$|After five {{straight}} championship wins in the AAFC and NFL, the Browns appeared <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> bring another trophy home in 1951. The team finished {{the regular season}} with 11 wins and a single loss {{in the first game}} of the season. Cleveland faced the Rams on December 23 in a rematch of the previous year's title game. The score was deadlocked 17–17 in the final period, but a 73-yard touchdown pass by Rams quarterback Norm van Brocklin to wide receiver Tom Fears broke the tie and gave Los Angeles the lead for good. The 24–17 loss was the Browns' first in a championship game.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction to the trail system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during this phase of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with cluster bomb units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Emerald, Pandour, and Drake {{then pushed}} up the river, {{sometimes}} in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived {{close to the}} forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching {{under the cover of}} the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts. By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.|$|E
5|$|In 951, the Later Zhou emerged, {{the last}} of the five {{short-lived}} dynasties making up the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The founding emperor of the Later Zhou died in 954 and was succeeded by his adopted son, who would rule with the name Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou. Shizong believed that the Liao dynasty was <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> invade the Zhou, and in 958 he launched a preemptive military campaign against the Liao, aiming to take the sixteen prefectures ceded to the Liao by Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin in 938. Emperor Shizong died in 959, before his army had even met the Liao forces. In 960 the commander-in-chief of the Later Zhou palace guard, Zhao Kuangyin, usurped the throne, then occupied by Emperor Shizong's seven-year-old son, and proclaimed himself the founder of the Song dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Warner Bros. {{released}} The Jazz Singer, {{the first}} feature-length talking picture.

The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) controlled an advanced optical sound-on-film system, RCA Photophone, recently developed by General Electric. However, its hopes of joining in the anticipated boom in sound movies faced a major hurdle: Warner Bros. and Fox, Hollywood's other vanguard sound studios, were already financially and technologically aligned with ERPI, a subsidiary of AT's Western Electric division. The industry's two largest major studios, Paramount and Loew's/MGM, with two other studios Universal and First National, were <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> contract with ERPI for sound conversion as well.|$|E

Zardari was <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> grant pardon but Lahore High Court issued a stay order against potential Presidential pardon, which remains in force till date.

5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda.

The remainder of the battalion was <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> move {{and most of it}} had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E

Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage and seems <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> attack the villagers, but Nausicaä uses a small bullroarer to calm it and guides {{it away from the}} village.|$|E
