50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture fuel vapors displaced while refueling, and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II vapor recovery system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the fill pipe seal in ORVR systems, prevents fuel vapors from entering the fuel tank fill pipe. That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any fuel vapors that come up that fill pipe, during the refuelling process. If the car's own vapor recovery system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of fuel vapors into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

For SIMPLE, SIMPLER and SIMPLEC, extensions for collocated grids and {{for treatment of}} flows at all speeds have already been proposed. For IDEAL, only an extension for collocated grids has been found, and an extension for treatment of flows at all speeds is proposed here. Extended versions of SIMPLE and SIMPLER are implemented in Brilliant, a multiphysics CFD-program developed by Petrell AS. These implemented algorithms are compared to the existing solution procedure in Brilliant, an extended version of the SIMPLEC algorithm. As expected, SIMPLE and SIMPLEC gave almost identical solutions for all the three presented test cases. The values given by the SIMPLER algorithm differed slightly from the values given by the two other algorithms. When simulating a shock tube, all three algorithms showed large deviations from the quasi-analytical solution in some regions of the shock tube. The SIMPLER algorithm spent the least CPU time for this simulation example, while SIMPLE and SIMPLEC spent less CPU time than SIMPLER when simulating methane flow in a pipe. Even though the CPU time was not registered for the last simulation example, a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>pipe,</b> it was noticed that the time consumption was much greater for the SIMPLER algorithm than for SIMPLE and SIMPLEC. </p...|$|E

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> devices. The most critical characteristics of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes).

40|$|Abstract- <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} devices used on the security of pipelines, since it is responsible to guarantee the integrity of the installations. Generally, the response and behavior of a relief valve during its transient is unknown by users, who employ simplified and static analysis to design the pipeline, further, the information provided by manufactures is limited. The flow-pressure, displacement-time and pressure –time relationships are an important external characteristic of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve and the hydraulic circuit. So, many engineers have been put an effort on this topic for its significant impact on the overall hydraulic system. Most of them are focused on the influences of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valves, their selections and applications. It is very important to select, size, locate properly and maintain the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> systems to prevent or minimize the losses from major incidents. Detail of selection and sizing of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve is shown the following sections of this study. In order to help the circuit operators, a few flow charts are also included. <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> system is used to protect piping and equipment against excessive overpressure for equipment and personnel safety...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts {{has often}} been {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} reducing pressure fluctuations and of improving passenger comfort on board high-speed trains in tunnels. The recently opened rail-link between Mattstetten-Rothrist in Switzerland {{is one of the first}} rail projects where such shafts became an integral part of the project right from the design stage. The effectiveness of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts has been proven during the commissioning phase of this 45 km long new rail-link. Several aerodynamic measurements were conducted in different tunnels with and without <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts and with different train types. One example is the double-track Emmequerung tunnel with a free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 76 m 2 with two <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts (Ashaft = 12. 25 m 2). The same tunnel without any <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts would have required a larger free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 105 m 2 in order to satisfy the project specific comfort criteria for various train types (∆ptrain < 1. 5 kPa within 4 s). In general, smaller tunnel cross-sections lead to reduced construction costs. Furthermore <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts can be combined with additional functions (egress path, smoke extraction, climate improvement, etc.). These advantages must be balanced with possible disadvantages (noise emissions, increased local air flows in the tunnel, etc.) and the limitations (ground overburden). The experience gained from the new Swiss rail-link shows that under certain conditions <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts are effective and reasonable. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Offloading plantar {{pressure}} {{is a key}} strategy for the prevention or healing of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetes. Non-removable walking casts, such as total contact casts, are currently considered the gold-standard for offloading this type of wound. However, alternative methods for offloading that are more cost effective {{and easier to use}} are continually being sought. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the capacity of the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ to offload high pressure areas under the neuropathic foot in diabetes. Methods A within-subjects, repeated measures design was used. Sixteen participants with diabetic peripheral neuropathy were recruited and three footwear conditions were evaluated in a randomised order: a canvas shoe (the control), the participants’ own standard shoe, and the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™. The primary outcome was peak plantar pressure, measured using the pedar-X® mobile in-shoe system between the three conditions. Results Data analysis was conducted on 14 out of the 16 participants because two participants could not complete data collection. The mean peak pressure values in kPa (±SD) for each condition were: control shoe 315. 9 (± 140. 7), participants’ standard shoe 273. 0 (± 127. 1) and DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ 155. 4 (± 89. 9). There was a statistically significant difference in peak plantar pressure between the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ compared to both the control shoe (p [*]=[*] 0. 002) and participants’ standard shoe (p [*]=[*] 0. 001). The DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ decreased plantar pressures by 51 % compared to the control shoe and by 43 % compared to participants’ standard shoe. Importantly, for a couple of study participants, the DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ appeared unsuitable for day-to-day wearing. Conclusions The DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ reduced plantar pressures more than the other two shoe conditions. The DH <b>Pressure</b> <b>Relief</b> Shoe™ may be a useful alternative to current offloading modalities used in clinical management of diabetic foot ulceration. However, clinical trials are needed to test their effectiveness for ulcer healing and to ensure they are useable and safe for patients in everyday activities. </p...|$|R
