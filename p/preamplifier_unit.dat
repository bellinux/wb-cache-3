5000|$|Practice amps {{often have}} an {{auxiliary}} line-in jack, {{so that the}} bassist can plug in a recorded music signal (often via an 1/8" [...] jack), to practice along with a recording. The line-in jack {{can also be used}} to plug a drum machine into the amp, also for practice purposes. Some practice amps have a level control knob for the line-in input. Practice amps often have a headphone jack, with a feature that turns off the power amplifier when headphones are connected. This feature enables bassists to practice silently at night, to avoid disturbing others in adjoining rooms or apartments. Higher-priced practice amps aimed at pro bassists may have a DI out jack, so that the amp's preamplifier signal can be connected directly to a mixing board for a live show's sound reinforcement system or for a sound recording session. DI out-equipped units effectively turn the practice amp into a <b>preamplifier</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractConventional readout {{electronics}} for radio-frequency SQUIDs exhibit long-term instabilities {{due to a}} temperature-dependent frequency drift of their voltage controlled oscillator. A novel electronics with a quartz-controlled synthesizer was developed to solve this problem. The frequency can be adjusted from 450 to 900 MHz with 2 ppm frequency stability, the amplitude range covers more than 60 dB. An adjustable phase shifter for demodulation is implemented to compensate for variable cable length. The total amplification is about 100 dB. The electronics with touchpanel and remote USB control is commercially available with up to three <b>preamplifier</b> <b>units.</b> Because thermal drift is eliminated, it is well suited for outdoor applications, e. g. in geophysics...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on {{development}} of scanning probe microscope systems, especially {{development and implementation of}} quartz resonator probes. The quartz resonator probes, compared to the standard silicon cantilevers, have several advantages. It is in particular their mechanical properties and possibility of direct electrical readout of the deflection signal. Due to the fact, the probes are easy to implement even into more complex SPM systems. The thesis deals with development of universal and open SPM control system electronics. The electronics consist of the commercial SPM control and oscillation units, the development of the other electronic parts (such as the high voltage amplifier and the <b>preamplifier</b> <b>units)</b> is described in the thesis. Further, the thesis reports on development of the qPlus UHV LT SPM microscope system that was carried out at Universit√§t Hamburg. Part of it was development of the qPlus preamplifier able to operate at liquid helium temperature. The third topic of the thesis is the implementation of qPlus technology into the UHV VT SPM microscope suitable to operate in situ with a scanning electron microscope. The qPlus sensors and the universal UHV preamplifier were designed and manufactured. Test measurements were conducted on all of the developed systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{properties}} of a vacuum phototriode (VPT) and <b>preamplifier</b> <b>unit</b> {{designed for the}} electromagnetic calorimeter of the PANDA experiment being built at FAIR are investigated. With the use of lead tungstate and lanthanium bromide scintillators the VPT properties are studied at low photon energies, from tens of key in the lanthanium bromide measurements and between 10 MeV and 60 MeV in the lead tungstate measurements. At these energies {{the noise of the}} VPT unit can be expected to influence its performance significantly. It is shown that the noise contribution to the measured energy resolution, under optimal conditions, is consistent with a fluctuation of (one standard deviation) approximately 200 electrons at the VPT anode. For a lead tungstate crystal this is equivalent to a noise of 1. 2 MeV. For lanthanium bromide this makes it possible to use VPTs for gamma ray spectroscopy above a few hundreds of keV without noticeable effects on the energy resolution compared to measurements with a standard photomultiplier.

40|$|This file {{contains}} three final reports: 1. ion detector CoMA: Within {{the developmental}} {{frame of the}} CoMA-experiment which was planned to fly on the CRAF mission an ion detector was developed for the Design Verification Unit (DVU). It was shown that an ion detector with sufficient time resolution (2 ns) could be realized. The detector system consists of 2 units which are mechanically integrated: Dual Multichannelplate Detector; Nonlinear <b>Preamplifier</b> <b>Unit.</b> Among others, the following topics especially important under space flight aspects have been covered: finalizing investigations on the problem area of multiple pulses, development of an ESD protection circuitry, investigations on lifetime and of redundancy concepts, pulse-width coding of double pulses. 2. ion optics of the primary ion source: The COMA (Cometary Matter Analyzer) - instrument is a high mass resolution time - of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. The DVU (design verification unit) has been constructed and the TOF - section has been tested successfully using an external pulsed ion gun. In the DVU, the principal direction of the primary beam is parallel {{to that of the}} secondary beam due to mechanical design constraints. Therefore, the primary beam has to be deflected out of the main direction in order to hit the target in front of the secondary extraction lens. As in all high resolution TOF - SIMS, the primary beam pulse length should be of the order of a few nanoseconds. In addition, the COMA design goal for the primary beam spot size is 10 - 20 #mu#. The pre-target primary beam deflection therefore has to be designed for local and temporal beam crossover at the target position. Two basic deflection geometries have been suggested for this purpose: (a) a 'symmetric reflectron loop' consisting of two symmetrically situated parallel - plate condensors as 'ion mirrors' separated by drift spaces; and (b) an electrostatic sectorfield preceded by a transversal buncher, compensating to first order, the energy dispersion of the sector. 3. Components of the primary ion source CoMA: This last report contains a compilation of operating data on liquid metal indium ion emitters. The compilation covers operating experience on single emitters and on single emitter - and multi -emitter ion source modules obtained during ground tests as well as during flight tests on the space station MIR.

50|$|An active DI <b>unit</b> {{contains}} a <b>preamplifier.</b> Active DI <b>units</b> can therefore provide gain, and are inherently {{more complex and}} versatile than passive units. Active DI units require a power source, which is normally provided by batteries or a standard AC outlet connection, and may contain the option for phantom power use. Most active DI units provide switches to enhance their versatility. These may include gain or level adjustment, ground lift, power source selection, and mono or stereo mode. Ground lift switches often disconnect phantom power. Some active DI units also have electronic effects units.|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} one-inch {{diameter}} {{sound pressure level}} sensors, which are candidates for monitoring ambient noise in the shuttle orbiter crew compartment during rest periods, were exposed to temperature, passive humidity, and vibration. One unexposed sensor of each type served as a reference unit. Except for the humidity exposures, {{each of the three}} capacitive microphones was individually tested in sequence with the essential voltage power supply and <b>preamplifier.</b> One <b>unit</b> exibited anomalous characteristics after the humidity exposure but returned to normal after being dried in an oven at 115 deg for two hours. Except for the humidity exposures, each of the three piezoelectric microphones was individually tested with a laboratory type amplifier. Two apparent failures occurred during these tests. The diaphragm on one was found ruptured after the fourth cycle of the humidity test.

5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for Coexist and mute certain elements during its production. Croft {{felt that this}} would help make the music more playable live {{instead of having to}} reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed Coexist, wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects <b>unit,</b> <b>preamplifiers,</b> and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other desks and left doors open during the recording to let sounds from outside the studio bleed into the mix. The xx finished recording Coexist in May 2012.|$|R
40|$|Digital audio {{networks}} are becoming the preferred {{solution for the}} interconnection of professional audio devices. Prominent amongst their advantages are: reduced noise interference, signal multiplexing, {{and a reduction in}} the number of cables connecting networked devices. In the context of professional audio, digital networks have been used to connect devices including: mixers, effects <b>units,</b> <b>preamplifiers,</b> breakout boxes, computers, monitoring controllers, and synthesizers. Such {{networks are}} governed by protocols that define the connection management rocedures, and device synchronization processes of devices that conform to the protocols. A wide range of digital audio network control protocols exist, each defining specific hardware requirements of devices that conform to them. Device parameter control is achieved by sending a protocol message that indicates the target parameter, and the action that should be performed on the parameter. Typically, a device will conform to only one protocol. By implication, only devices that conform to a specific protocol can communicate with each other, and only a controller that conforms to the protocol can control such devices. This results in the isolation of devices that conform to disparate protocols, since devices of different protocols cannot communicate with each other. This is currently a challenge in the professional music industry, particularly where digital networks are used for audio device control. This investigation seeks to resolve the issue of interoperability between professional audio devices that conform to different digital audio network protocols. This thesis proposes the use of a proxy that allows for the translation of protocol messages, as a solution to the interoperability problem. The proxy abstracts devices of one protocol in terms of another, hence allowing all the networked devices to appear as conforming to the same protocol. The proxy receives messages on behalf of the abstracted device, and then fulfills them in accordance with the protocol that the abstracted device conforms to. Any number of protocol devices can be abstracted within such a proxy. This has the added advantage of allowing a common controller to control devices that conform to the different protocols...|$|R
