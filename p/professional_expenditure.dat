This study describes the school 2 ̆ 7 s restructuring effort, {{the ways in which}} professional development in the school supports the effort, {{and the ways in which}} the school reallocated resources to create funds for professional development spending. We then apply the framework of professional development costs proposed by Odden, Archibald, Fermanich and Gallagher (forthcoming) to the <b>professional</b> development <b>expenditures</b> in the school. Information regarding <b>professional</b> development <b>expenditures</b> was obtained from budget and planning documents as well as interviews with school and district personnel. These data revealed that teachers in this school on average received 9, 711 of professional development resources with 98...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Health related {{needs and}} {{services}} are stratified by ethnicity in UK. The Chinese community is Scotland’s second-largest minority ethnic group but a relatively under-researched one. This study aimed to explore the views and experiences of smoking cessation and related services among Chinese community members in Glasgow and to inform them about smoking cessation interventions. Methods: This cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 2016 using a qualitative research method. Purposive sampling methods were used to recruit 15 Chinese community members in Glasgow. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and data transcribed, translated, and thematically analysed. Results: Many factors influenced participants’ smoking: concern for personal health, advice from medical <b>professionals,</b> <b>expenditure,</b> family pressure, tobacco-control policies, nicotine dependence, self-efficacy, and acculturation. Smoking initiation and relapse were influenced by interpersonal relations, emotional factors, Chinese social norms, and acculturation. Barriers reported to accessing and participating in cessation services included: excessive or inflexible working hours, low confidence in cessation services, language barriers, cultural barriers and unsuitability of cessation services for Chinese smokers. Employing community resources, improving language support, working with cultural values, and accommodating degrees of acculturation may improve services and their uptake. Conclusions: Smoking-cessation services should consider the culture of this ethnic minority population to improve cessation uptake. Further investigation of this community’s needs and expectations is needed to tailor smoking-cessation interventions for Chinese immigrants in Glasgow...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to track the {{expenditures}} made by a school district and three of its primary centers for teacher professional development and further analyze the purposes of those expenditures to determine if the district and school financial investments supported quality features of professional development. ^ District and school level data on <b>professional</b> development <b>expenditures</b> were collected and categorized using the professional development cost structure developed by Odden, Archibald, Fermanich, and Gallagher (2002). The Odden et al. (2002) cost structure includes six cost elements: (1) teacher time, (2) training and coaching, (3) administration of professional development, (4) materials, equipment, and facilities, (5) travel and transportation, and (6) tuition and conference fees. Each expenditure was further coded as to purpose using two additional coding schemes developed by Miles, Bouchard, Winner, Cohen, and Guiney (1999) and Miles and Hornbeck (2000) and Thayer (2004). Totals of the coded expenditures were compared with components of quality professional development to determine whether the district and school investments were made on effective professional development strategies. ^ This study examined district and school level spending for professional development in three primary schools in an urban district in northern Indiana. Within the last five years, the district has implemented a major redistricting and program restructuring effort including the implementation of a comprehensive, systemic professional development program in its primary centers. ^ The findings of this study revealed that this district and its three Title I primary centers spent 1, 208, 297 for professional development which averaged 12, 192 per teacher. The highest <b>professional</b> development <b>expenditure</b> was training and coaching and the second highest expenditure was teacher time. ^ In addition, based on the analysis of the purposes for the expenditures, most of this district 2 ̆ 7 s and its schools 2 ̆ 7 investments supported features of high quality professional development. ^ This study is unique and adds to existing literature because it quantifies and qualifies expenditures made for a professional development program implemented in an urban district and provides schools and district with a realistic estimate of the costs required for a quality, effective professional development plan. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how much is spent on teachers' professional development.   A review of the literature finds two problems that have frequently led to inaccurate estimates of professional development spending: 1) the accounting codes that are used in many studies provide little description of spending, and 2) studies generally focus on district or state <b>expenditures</b> for <b>professional</b> development, but do not collect data on school-level spending.   These problems are {{compounded by the fact that}} studies define professional development spending differently, and thus it is difficult to compare findings across studies.   In an effort to begin to address this problem, this study utilizes a detailed cost structure to analyze both district and school site <b>expenditures</b> on <b>professional</b> development across cost categories.   The study found that school-level expenditures were a significant source of professional development for teachers.   This has implications for the methodologies used to estimate current <b>professional</b> development <b>expenditures</b> and what level of expenditures would be necessary to generate dramatic improvements in student achievement...|$|R
40|$|Public {{subsidies}} for sports stadiums and arenas are often justified {{as a means}} to boost the local economy. The argument relies on historical local economic impact multipliers that misrepresent the effect of consumer <b>expenditures</b> on <b>professional</b> sports. Sports <b>expenditures</b> are subject to extraordinary consumer substitution away from other local expenditures, and they suffer unusually large first round leakages from the local economy because, inter alia, players export their earnings to the locale of their permanent residence. This note illustrates the extent of such leakages using information about the permanent residence of players in the National Basketball Association. While 93 % of average employees live in the area where they work, only 29 % of NBA players do the same. The illustration shows that a standard local economic impact multiplier exaggerates the stimulative effect of sports expenditures by over 400 %. ...|$|R

"Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Paul Watkins. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 62 - 65). The {{purpose of}} this quantitative study was to increase the knowledge base {{on the relationship between}} categorical educational spending and how resource allocation impacts district effectiveness. The independent variables are overall expenditures per ADA, average teacher salary, expenditures on instructional salary per pupil, expenditures on instructional support salary per pupil, and <b>expenditures</b> on <b>professional</b> development per pupil. The dependent variable for the study was district effectiveness as measured by MSIP V scores, the method by which school districts in Missouri are accredited. Data was used from all K- 12 school districts in Missouri for the 2012 - 2013 school year. The variable that had the most significant positive impact on district effectiveness was expenditures on instructional salary per pupil. This variable can be compared to a student to teacher ratio. There was a significant positive relationship between districts with higher expenditures on instructional salary per pupil and district effectiveness. Average teacher salary and expenditures on instructional support salary had no significant impact on district effectiveness. Overall expenditures per ADA and <b>professional</b> development <b>expenditures</b> per pupil had a significant negative impact on district effectiveness. These negative relationships could be explained by how districts are funded and also the absence of time consideration for this study...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the design and {{implementation}} of an automated usability evaluation method for iOS applications. In contrast to common usability testing methods, it is not explicitly necessary to involve an expert or subjects. These circumstances reduce costs, time and personnel <b>expenditures.</b> <b>Professionals</b> are replaced by the automation tool while test participants are exchanged with consumers of the launched application. Interactions of users are captured via a fully automated capturing framework which creates a record of user interactions for each session and sends them to a central server. A usability problem {{is defined as a}} sequence of interactions and pattern recognition specified by interaction design patterns is applied to find these problems. Nevertheless, it falls back to the user input for accurate results. Similar to the problem, the solution of the problem is based on the HCI design pattern. An evaluation shows the functionality of our approach compared to a traditional usability evaluation method...|$|R

Because many investigators as well as fitness <b>professionals</b> consider kcal <b>expenditure</b> when creating training protocols, energy costs during both RT and aerobic training must be considered. PURPOSE: To develop a regression equation to predict kcal expenditure for a RT bout involving each major muscle group using VO 2 max, height, weight, lean body mass, fat mass, and total exercise volume (TV=sets*reps*wt) as independent variables. METHODS: Twelve subjects (7 men, 5 women, age 21 - 25 yrs) were tested using the standard Bruce treadmill protocol for VO 2 max, and strength tested to determine their 3 - 5 repetition max (RM) on Keiser® RT equipment 1 week prior to their experimental RT bout. Body composition was assessed using DEXA. For their experimental RT bout, a warm-up set followed by 2 - 3 sets of 8 - 12 reps at 60 - 70...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of {{type 1 diabetes}} in childhood is increasing by 3 % per year, placing growing demands on healthcare <b>professionals</b> and medical <b>expenditures.</b> Aim of this study wars to assess the organization of care to children with diabetes in Italy. Methods: During 2012 a structured questionnaire was sent {{to all of the}} members of Italian Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology (ISPED). Questions examined organizational structure of Centers, personnel dedicated to the care of children with diabetes, number of subjects followed, local legal legislation supporting centers. Results: A total of 68 centers taking care to 15, 563 children and adolescents with diabetes under 18 years of age were identified with a prevalence of 1. 4 per 1, 000 people. A wide variation in the organizational background was also reported. Forty four centers were organized as outpatient departments, 17 as simple units, 5 as complex units and 2 as simple departmental structures. Most centers had a multidisciplinary team. Ten out of twenty Italian regions had introduced supportive regional legislation, but it was fully applied only in six of them. Conclusion: Great differences between regions were found in organizational structures, staffing levels and supportive legislation. The national legislation on diabetes was broadly implemented throughout the country regions. Further efforts are needed to improve standards and consistency of pediatric diabetes care in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Promotion by {{pharmaceutical}} company often {{takes advantage of}} mental shortcuts. Significant deficiencies {{have been found in}} student’s knowledge about pharmaceutical marketing <b>expenditures,</b> <b>professional</b> ethics and accuracy of drug information. The purpose of study was to assess the attitudes of medical students towards relationship with pharmaceutical companies and drug promotion by them. Methods: To assess the attitudes, a prevalidated questionnaire consisting of 18 questions was designed. Questionnaire was istributed when a series of lectures were scheduled for the entire medical class (253 medical students). Completed questionnaires werecollected {{at the end of the}} session and analysis was done using statistical methods. Results: Overall 81 % of the medical students were of the opinion that pharmaceutical companies should be allowed to interact with them at the college level. About 95 % believe that the information given by MRs is reliable and confirmation of the claims is not required (75 % students). Overall 68 % students believe that drug promotional offers never compromise the decision making of the physicians. About 70 % students think that physicians should be compensated with gifts by medical representatives whenever their drugs are prescribed. Conclusion: The medical students are generally not opposed to interact with MR at some point of time or receive gifts from them. Also many students may not be conscious potential subconscious expectations of give-and-take relationship. Perhaps, the insight gained from our study will be used to reinforce the existing teaching curriculum with added emphasis on this issue...|$|R
40|$|Cohort {{study found}} that being insured and having longer {{exposure}} of health insurance significantly increased migrant workers' likelihood to use professional healthcare in Shenzhen, decreased their total occasions of professional healthcare utilisation, and were causally associated with a decrease in <b>professional</b> healthcare <b>expenditures</b> which were paid out-of-pocket in the 6 months of follow-up by migrant workers. Internal migration has become a more and more prominent societal and economic phenomenon in mainland China and Shenzhen {{is one of the}} most frequently selected locales for rural-urban migrants. This thesis aims 1) to assess health status and to describe patterns of healthcare utilisation amongst migrant factory workers, 2) to follow up the sample over 6 months to understand the impact of health insurance participation on health service utilisation and health expenditures, and 3) to assess the implications for health policies. Our results suggest that health strategies should take into consideration the specific health needs of the highly mobile factory migrant workers. Through insurance coverage, local health authorities may be able to help improve rural-urban migrant workers' health by improving services at community level, and incorporating psychological care in the services provided by Community Health Centres. Questionnaire surveys were used in a representative sample from factory workers in Shenzhen. The baseline and follow-up studies were conducted during April to December 2009 in Shenzhen, China. Results show that migrant factory workers in Shenzhen represent a broad combination of geographic complexity and have special socio-demographic characteristics. The results have specified some association between self-rated health and SES, and major correlates of depressive symptoms amongst migrant factory workers. The seroprevalence of antibodies to rubella amongst female migrant workers is too low to provide immunity in the population. Sex, age, education, sleeping hours and internet use were associated with being a current smoker. The crude two-week illness rate was 21. 6 %. More than half and 11. 6 % of sick migrant workers chose self-treatment or neglected their sickness, respectively. Self-perception of disease being not severe, lack of time and economic difficulties were the major explanations for not utilizing professional care. Mou, Jin. Adviser: Sian Meryl Griffiths.

5000|$|The prison {{sentence}} of 4 years {{was based on}} charges of tax evasion and fraud. The prosecution had accused Prinz von Anhalt of tax evasion of 1.5 million Euros. The prosecution had put forward an estimation of monetary damages for the tax authorities by Anhalt of Euro 747,000 and another attempt to evade taxes of Euro 820,000. In particular, the prosecution accused von Anhalt that he declared the private usage of his 14 luxury cars (all of a value of at least 1 Million Euros) and vacations in Las Vegas as <b>professional</b> and business <b>expenditures</b> towards the tax authorities. Von Anhalt argued that [...] "his glamorous lifestyle" [...] {{is part of his}} profession as a [...] "TV star" [...] and that therefore, he merely used his luxury cars for [...] "representational" [...] reasons, stating: [...] "Driving in my Porsche, Ferrari and Rolls-Royce and traveling to a show in Las Vegas occurred for professional reasons only." [...] In addition, von Anhalt attempted to persuade the judge and the prosecution that if he did commit tax evasion, then it must have been unintentional as he did not fully understand the German tax laws at the time concerned, stating: [...] "I know that the German tax laws are extremely complicated and maybe even the most complicated in the world. Some people may be able to understand the German tax laws but he is not one of them; but he knows how to successfully manage a brothel". The judges did not believe von Anhalt's explanations and consequently imposed a {{prison sentence}} of 4 years. Von Anhalt had declared previously that [...] "he does not see a criminal offense in his case" [...] and that the sums he supposedly evaded from tax authorities are [...] "petty" [...] and [...] "ridiculous" [...] given that [...] "his brothels and disco clubs generate revenues in the two digit million range." ...|$|R
