5|$|Pilecki's <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> {{has never}} been found but {{is thought to be}} somewhere within Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery. After the fall of {{communism}} in Poland a symbolic gravestone was erected in his memory at Ostrowa Mazowiecka Cemetery. In 2012, Powązki Cemetery was partially excavated in an effort to find Pilecki's remains.|$|E
5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village {{and not in the}} mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} accounts for Pulaski's time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> vary considerably. According to several contemporary accounts there were witnesses, including Pulaski's aide-de-camp, that Pulaski received a symbolic burial in Charleston on October 21, sometime {{after he was}} buried at sea. Other witnesses, including Captain Samuel Bulfinch of the Wasp however, claimed that the wounded Pulaski was actually later removed from the ship and taken to the Greenwich plantation {{in the town of}} Thunderbolt, near Savannah, where he died and was buried.|$|E

50|$|Based on this {{information}} and historical documents from various archives, it became possible, above all in the 1990s, for various descendants of concentration camp survivors to clarify and/or reconstruct {{the history of their}} family members or their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial.</b>|$|R
50|$|Earlier peoples {{living in}} Britain during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages had also {{constructed}} barrows {{for use as}} <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> something that was recognised by the Anglo-Saxon burial builders, who in many cases re-used these earlier barrows for their own uses.|$|R
5|$|After the Reformation, the Mass and Purgatory were {{rejected}} by the Kirk, along with the efficacy of good works and prayers for the dead. In place of elaborate processions and masses at a funeral there was a simple service, where the body was taken to its resting place without singing and readings and interred soberly without ceremony. Unlike other reformed churches the Kirk also rejected burial inside the church, which were now seen as unseemly for a house of prayer. This caused friction with traditional rights, particularly of local notables, to be buried with their ancestors. The use of burial aisles, an extension projecting for {{the main body of}} the church, almost exclusively used for burial and commemoration, represented a uniquely Scottish solution to this problem. For most ranks in society the kirkyard remained the desired <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial.</b> From the seventeenth century burials were increasingly marked by gravestones, often including inscriptions that indicated affection for and the virtues of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|After the {{partition}} Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He {{spent the rest}} of his days in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on August 8, 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress with the loss of a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He {{is said to have been}} escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and was locked in a small family's mansion which he would never leave up till his death. Eventually he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (most detailed accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave.|$|E
5|$|The cross Vladimir held {{when he was}} {{beheaded}} is also {{regarded as}} a relic. Traditionally {{under the care of}} the Andrović family from the village of Velji Mikulići in southeastern Montenegro, the cross is only shown to believers on the Feast of Pentecost, when it is carried in a procession to the summit of Mount Rumija. Jovan Vladimir is regarded as the first Serbian saint and the patron saint of the town of Bar in Montenegro. His earliest, lost hagiography was probably written sometime between 1075 and 1089; a shortened version, written in Latin, is preserved in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. His hagiographies in Greek and Church Slavonic were first published, respectively, in 1690 and 1802. The saint is classically depicted in icons as a monarch wearing a crown and regal clothes, with a cross in his right hand and his own head in his left hand. He is fabled to have carried his severed head to his <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial.</b>|$|E
50|$|Instead of graveyards, {{completely}} new <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> were established away from {{heavily populated areas}} and outside of old towns and city centers. Many new cemeteries became municipally owned or were run by their own corporations, and thus independent from churches and their churchyards.|$|R

25|$|Funeral rites {{took place}} {{at home and at}} the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> which was located outside the city to avoid the {{pollution}} of the living. The funeral procession (pompa funebris) transited the distance between the two.|$|E
25|$|Medieval {{collections}} of the Lavra sacristy attracted thousands of visitors. In Sergiyev Posad, the monastery maintained several sketes, {{one of which is}} a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> for the conservative philosophers Konstantin Leontiev and Vasily Rozanov.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tower is}} said to be [...] "bosomed high in tufted trees". From the tower, a short walk by a burn leads to the moor; fishing is {{available}} on 3 mi of riverbank along the Rede. Several spots are marked with stones set in circles, indicating ancient <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial.</b> Otterburn Hall, a fortified country house hotel, Otterburn Mill, and a quarry are nearby.|$|R

25|$|Polhill Anglo-Saxon {{cemetery}} is a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> {{that was}} used in the seventh and eighth centuries CE. It is located close to the hamlet of Polhill, near Sevenoaks in Kent, South-East England. Belonging to the Middle Anglo-Saxon period, {{it was part of the}} much wider tradition of burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England.|$|E

He {{was one of the first}} to permit the use of machinery in baking Matzah.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} burial {{place of}} the Manners family was St Mary the Virgin's Church, Bottesford. Since elevation to the dukedom in 1703 most Dukes have been buried in {{the grounds of the}} mausoleum at Belvoir Castle. The mausoleum at Belvoir Castle was built by John Henry Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland, following the death of his wife, Elizabeth Howard (1780-1825), daughter of the 5th Earl of Carlisle. After its construction, most of the 18th century monuments in Belton Church were moved to the mausoleum which then became the family’s main <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial.</b>|$|E
50|$|Penns Valley Area School Board set {{property}} tax {{rates for the}} 2015-16 school year at 46.6986 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The {{property tax}} is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship, <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes.|$|R
5000|$|Property {{tax rates}} in 2014-15 were set, by the West Greene School Board, at 19.5000 mills. [...] A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's {{assessed}} value. Irregular property reassessments {{have become a}} serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship, <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal).

40|$|Review of the {{physical}} evidence for the early church in Scotland. Characterises {{the nature of the}} evidence for ecclesiastical sites, landmarks in past study, key recent developments, and explores six key emerging themes: the development <b>of</b> cemeteries as <b>placed</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> for local Christian communities; {{the physical}} manifestations of saints’ cults; the desire to build in stone as an expression of alignment with the Roman church; the scale, complexity and diversity of ‘church’ forms and functions; the structured use of space at church settlements; and the associated crafts, industries and technologies...|$|R
25|$|The Fordcroft {{cemetery}} {{contained a}} mixture of cremation and inhumation burials. The two forms of burial were interspersed within the cemetery, leading excavators {{to believe that they}} were contemporary with each other. Archaeologists have discovered a total of 19 cremations and 52 inhumations from the site. Due to the grave goods found at the site, Tester suggested that the site was probably active as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> between circa 450 and 550 CE. He noted that culturally, the artefacts and forms of burial were similar to those found around the Thames Valley.|$|E
25|$|The {{first to}} be {{constructed}} was the Whispering Knights, a dolmen that dates to the Early or Middle Neolithic period and which was {{likely to have been}} used as a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial.</b> This was followed by the King's Men, a stone circle which was constructed in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age; unusually, it has parallels to other circles located further north, in the Lake District, implying a trade-based or ritual connection. The third monument, the King Stone, is a single monolith, and although it is not known when it was constructed, the dominant theory amongst archaeologists is that it was a Bronze Age grave marker.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} the Sunderland area were Stone Age hunter-gatherers and artifacts from this era have been discovered, including microliths found during excavations at St Peter's Church, Monkwearmouth. During {{the final phase of}} the Stone Age, the Neolithic period (c. 4000 – c. 2000 BC), Hastings Hill, on the western outskirts of Sunderland, was a focal point of activity and a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> and ritual significance. Evidence includes the former presence of a cursus monument. It is believed the Brigantes inhabited the area around the River Wear in the pre- and post-Roman era. There is a long-standing local legend that there was a Roman settlement on the south bank of the River Wear on what is the site of the former Vaux Brewery, although no archaeological investigation has taken place.|$|E
