40|$|Introduction Preservatives in {{ophthalmic}} preparations {{are known}} to cause ocular surface damage. Excipients can also contribute to oxidative stress in the compromised ocular surface. We evaluated commonly used topical glaucoma medications to ascertain pH levels and the intrinsic presence of free radicals. Methods Samples of 27 topical glaucoma preparations were analysed for total free radical presence using a Randox Kit for total antioxidant status. Analytical grade indicator paper was used to ascertain pH levels. Results Free radical concentrations for these 27 glaucoma preparations ranged from 0 to 4. 54 [*]mmol/l, with a median value of 0. 66 [*]mmol/l (mean value of 0. 662 [*]mmol/l, SD 0. 839). Levels of pH ranged from 4. 0 to 7. 4, with a median value of 6. 5 (mean 6. 252, SD 0. 826). There {{was no evidence of}} a direct correlation between these two variables (r= 0. 232, P= 0. 275). Conclusion This study is the first to document the range of pH and concentrations of free radicals intrinsically present in commonly used glaucoma medications. Long-term exposure to <b>preservatives,</b> <b>free</b> radicals, and pH levels could all contribute to ocular surface damage. The effect of excipients could be responsible for patient intolerance when changing products in the compromised ocular surface...|$|E

Methods: Triamcinolone acetonide, in its trade and <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> formulations, along with the preservative vehicle were added to ARPE 19 cell cultures in various concentrations (0. 01 – 1. 0 mg/ml). Cell viability was assessed using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay at day 5 after exposure. Functionality of the cultured ARPE 19 cell line was confirmed by exposure to a previously characterised toxic agent, tamoxifen. Results: The ARPE 19 cell line behaved as predicted with exposure to tamoxifen. All formulations caused significant reductions in ARPE 19 cell viability at the highest concentrations (1. 0 mg/ml for triamcinolone preparations and undiluted vehicle).

40|$|Purpose: Increased intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) {{is the most}} important modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma. This underlines the need for a potent and save IOP lowering therapy. The introduction of <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> prostaglandins offers a new treatment possibility using a potent topical drug without the disadvantages of a coadministered preservative. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of an 8 week treatment with <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> tafluprost on IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Methods: 16 patients with either primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with an uncontrolled {{intraocular pressure}} (IOP) ≥ 30 mmHg were included in the study. A washout period with a duration between 2 and 4 weeks was scheduled for all patients before study start. IOP was measured at 8 : 00 am and 6 : 00 pm on each study day. IOP measurements were performed after the washout period as well as 4 and 8 weeks after start of topical drug treatment. Results: After the 2 - 4 weeks washout period average IOP was 35. 6 ± 4. 5 mmHg at 8 : 00 am and 32. 9 ± 5. 4 mmHg at 6 : 00 pm. After 4 weeks administration of <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> tafluprost, IOP decreased by 31 % ± 12 % to 24. 4 ± 4. 6 mmHg (p< 0. 01) and by 34 % ± 14 % to 21. 6 ± 4. 6 mmHg (p< 0. 01) at the morning and evening, respectively. At 8 weeks of tafluprost treatment IOP was 24. 3 ± 4. 6 mmHg at 8 : 00 am(- 31 % ± 13 % compared to baseline, p< 0. 01) and 21. 9 ± 3. 9 mmHg at 6 : 00 pm (- 32 % ± 16 % compared to baseline, p< 0. 01).

40|$|AIM—A crossover, {{randomised}} {{double blind}} study was undertaken in 30  healthy volunteers, {{in order to}} compare the tolerance of 2 % carteolol with and without preservative in short term use.  METHODS—Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed before and 30,  60, and 180  minutes after instillation of one drop of the solution, and after 3  days of preservative treatment. After a 5  day washout, the same examinations were done with the second drug.  RESULTS—Results showed good general tolerance for both formulations. No significant difference in subjective tolerance, corneal aesthesiometry, punctuate keratitis, Schirmer's test, intraocular pressure (IOP) decrease (about 25 % {{in the two groups}} at 3  hours, 10 % after 3  days of treatment), resting cardiac frequency, or blood pressure was observed. However, break up time was significantly reduced from baseline by preserved carteolol both at 3  hours (10. 40  (5. 9) seconds to 6. 15  (3. 9) seconds, p= 0. 001) and after 3  days (7. 72  (5. 5) seconds, p= 0. 04). <b>Preservative</b> <b>free</b> carteolol did not significantly change the break up time (baseline 9. 08  (5. 7) seconds; 3  hours =  7. 88  (5. 5) seconds, not significant; day 3  =  8. 35  (5. 8), non-significant).  CONCLUSIONS—These results confirm that carteolol is well tolerated, either with or without <b>preservative.</b> The <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> group showed better stability of the tear film, without loss of effect on IOP.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of side effects between eyedrops with or without preservatives, in terms of subjective symptoms and objective signs in patients with open-angle glaucoma. METHODS: In a multicenter cross-sectional epidemiologic survey in four European countries, ophthalmologists in private practice enrolled 9658 nonconsecutive patients using preservative (P) or preservative-free (PF) beta-blocking eyedrops between June 1997 and December 2003. Subjective symptoms, conjunctival and palpebral signs, and superficial punctate keratitis were explored before and after a change in therapy. For statistical analysis, a Chi-square {{test was used to}} calculate the differences in {{the prevalence of}} symptoms and signs with or without preservatives. RESULTS: A total of 74 % of the patients used P, 12 % PF, 10 % a P-PF combination, and in 4 % the type of medication was unknown. Each recorded symptom and all the palpebral, conjunctival, and corneal signs were significantly more frequent (p< 0. 0001) in the P-group than in the PF-group, such as pain or discomfort during instillation (48 vs 19 %), foreign body sensation (42 vs 15 %), stinging or burning (48 vs 20 %), and dry eye sensation (35 vs 16 %).

METHODOLOGY: We retrieved data on the type and cost of dry eye treatment in Singapore National Eye Centre from pharmacy and clinic inventory databases over a 2 year period (2008 - 2009) retrospectively. According {{to the type of}} treatment, data were sorted into 7 groups; meibomien gland disease (MGD) treatment, <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> lubricant eye drops, preserved lubricant eye drops, lubricant ointments and gels, cyclosporine eye drops, oral supplements and non-pharmacological treatments/procedures. Each recorded entry was considered as one patient episode (PE). Comparisons in each group between two years were carried out using Pearson Chi-Square test. Significance level was set at alpha  =  0. 05. RESULTS: Cost data from 54, 052 patients were available for analysis. Total number of recorded PEs was 132, 758. Total annual expenditure on dry eye treatment for year 2008 and 2009 were US$ 1, 509, 372. 20 and US$ 1, 520, 797. 80 respectively. Total expenditure per PE in year 2008 and 2009 were US$ 22. 11 and US$ 23. 59 respectively. From 2008 to 2009, there was a 0. 8 % increase in total annual expenditure and 6. 69 % increase in expenditure per PE. Pharmacological treatment attributes to 99. 2 % of the total expenditure with lubricants accounting for 79. 3 % of the total pharmacological treatment expenditure. Total number of units purchased in <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> lubricants, cyclosporine eye drops and MGD therapy have increased significantly (p< 0. 001) whereas number of units purchased in preserved lubricants and ointments/gels have reduced significantly (p< 0. 001) from 2008 to 2009.

Preservative-free artificial tears (0. 5 % tamarind seed polysaccharide 0. 5 ® eye drops single-dose <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> [Oftagen]) were prescribed thrice per day. The participants were subjected to clinical and instrumental evaluation at baseline (T 0), after 1 month (T 1) and after 3 months (T 3) of treatment. All patients were examined with a digital corneal confocal laser-scanning microscope (HRT II Rostock Cornea Module; Heidelberg Engineering GmbH) and Cochet-Bonnet corneal esthesiometer. Results: After the artificial substitute, corneal and conjunctival sensitivity significantly (P< 0. 001) improved at T 1 and T 3 compared to the baseline. A significant correlation was found between break-up time and both central corneal sensitivity {{and the number of}} fibers. Conclusion: The use of a preservative-free artificial substitute in association with a topical therapy with chronic preservative could increase the compliance of patients...|$|R
40|$|Spinal anaesthesia, {{which is}} one of the {{techniques}} for infraumbilical surgeries, is most commonly criticized for limited duration of postoperative analgesia. Several adjuvants have been tried along with local anesthetic for prolonging the duration of analgesia. In this study, we have observed the effect of midazolam as an adjuvant in patients undergoing infraumbilical surgery. In this prospective, randomized, double blinded, and parallel group and open label study of 90 adult patients aged 18 – 60 years, of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II, scheduled for elective infraumbilical surgery, were randomly allocated in two groups. Each patient in group “B” received hyperbaric bupivacaine 12. 5 [*]mg along with 0. 4 [*]mL of normal saline in the subarachnoid block, and patients of group “BM” received 12. 5 [*]mg hyperbaric bupivacaine along with <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> midazolam 0. 4 [*]mL (2 [*]mg). We found that use of midazolam as adjuvant with the local anesthetic in spinal anaesthesia significantly increases the duration of analgesia (median 320 [*]min versus 220 [*]min) and motor block (median 255 [*]min versus 195 [*]min) but decreases the incidence of postoperative nausea-vomiting (PONV) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dry {{eye disease}} (DED) is multifactorial, {{affecting}} 5 - 34 % {{of the global}} adult population and reducing quality of life. The artificial tears or lubricants are the therapy most used {{for the treatment of}} DED, due to their low side effect profile, which attempt to modify the properties of the tear film. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a fixed combination of xanthan gum and chondroitin sulfate <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> on the ocular surface of patients with dry eye disease during 60 days of intervention. Methods: A phase III, double-blind, masked, controlled, multicenter, clinical trial of 148 subjects, randomized to either a fixed combination of xanthan gum 0. 09 % and chondroitin sulfate 0. 1 % (XG/CS) ophthalmic solution (n = 76) or a fixed combination of polyethylene glycol 400 0. 4 % and propylene glycol 0. 3 % (PEG/PG) (n = 72). Subjects self-dosed four times daily during 60 days. Follow-up was set on days 2, 7, 15, 30 and 60. Assessments of anterior/posterior segment ocular signs were performed. The outcome measures included Schirmer test, tear film break-up time and OSDI score. Security variables included intraocular pressure, lisamine green and fluorescein ocular surface stains. Results: The primary efficacy endpoints were similar between groups at baseline. After intervention time Schirmer test increased in both groups compared to baseline, XG/CS (6. 4 +/- 2. 2 vs 11. 0 +/- 6. 6; p = 0. 002) and PEG/PG (6. 5 +/- 2. 5 vs 10. 5 +/- 5. 6; p = 0. 019) respectively. Similar results were reported in the tear film break-up time in XG/CS (5. 5 +/- 2. 1 vs 7. 4 +/- 2. 9; p = 0. 027) and PEG/PG (5. 2 +/- 2. 0 vs 7. 4 +/- 2. 7; p = 0. 046) respectively. The OSDI score decreased to normal values in both groups, XG/CS (19. 3 +/- 7. 4 vs 7. 3 +/- 5. 9; p = 0. 001) and PEG/PG (19. 3 +/- 7. 5 vs 7. 9 +/- 8. 2; p = 0. 001) respectively. There was no significant difference between treatments for any parameter. Moreover, both groups decreased the presence of burning sensation, tearing, foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperemia and photophobia. The adverse events were not related to the interventions. Conclusions: Xanthan gum/chondroitin sulfate <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> showed similar clinical efficacy, evaluated with OSDI score, TBUT and Schirmer test compared to polyethylene glycol/propylene glycol in the treatment of dry eye disease...|$|R
40|$|Intravenous {{regional}} anaesthesia is a simple, safe technique of anaesthesia of extremities for short procedures. The major fear {{with the use}} of the technique is local anaesthetic toxicity associated with high volumes of local anaesthetic used. Hence we decided to use reduced volume of local anaesthetic in the peripheral artery to produce satisfactory anaesthesia. A total of twelve patients scheduled to undergo short procedures of upper limb were taken for this study. After exsanguination and tourniquet application on the arm 1. 5 mg/kg of <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> lignocaine as 0. 5 % solution was injected into the cannulated radial artery. The onset of analgesia was 89. 92 ± 17. 54 seconds. The anaesthesia was satisfactory in all cases except in two patients where there was a minimal discomfort with bony manipulation, which settled with 20 mg of iv pentazocine. The mean duration of surgery was 34. 54 ± 4. 5 minutes. The mean volume of lignocaine used was only 15. 58 ± 0. 95 ml. No significant side effects were noted. We conclude that intraarterial {{regional anaesthesia}} is a useful procedure in patients where there is a fear about local anaesthetic toxicity and the problem of difficult venous access. Intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) is...|$|R
30|$|Accurate needle {{placement}} {{into the}} epidural space was accomplished utilizing C-arm fluoroscopy. Patients {{were treated with}} either a transforaminal or interlaminar epidural with the injection route determined by the examination and review of imaging. Detailed injection procedures have been previously described (Cohen 2011; Wilkinson and Cohen 2012). Once the needle {{was placed in the}} final target location and confirmed with fluoroscopy, Iodixanol (Visipaque, NDC# 0407 – 2223 - 06) radiographic contrast was injected to confirm flow into the epidural space. The final injectate consisted of PL 50 % by volume, 4 % lidocaine (NDC# 0409 – 4283 - 01) at 25 % by volume, and compounded <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> 100 – 200  ng/ml hydrocortisone (obtained via different compounding pharmacies) at 25 % by volume. For transforaminal and interlaminar injections, 3 - 5  cm 3 volume was injected. PL injectate was filtered at the time of injection with a 0.22 -μm filter (Millex-GP, Millipore express PES membrane) to remove all remaining lysed platelet membrane debris. The nanogram amount of hydrocortisone used with PL is one million times less than what is commonly used for ESI injections and is used for its anti-inflammatory properties at levels similar to endogenous glucocorticoids (Jung et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} nebulised iso-osmolar, <b>preservative</b> <b>free,</b> but acidic {{salbutamol}} solution was studied in 34 acutely wheezing infants aged 1 - 17 months. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO 2) and oxygen saturation (SO 2) fell significantly {{during the first}} five minutes after nebulisation with further deterioration at 15 - 20 minutes. Ten of these infants were followed up for another two hours and showed slight improvement. Even after the second hour TcPO 2 had not reached baseline values. Three months later the response to salbutamol and a placebo of equal acidity (pH 3. 9) was studied in 11 infants from the same group, now free of symptoms. Lung function tests were included and showed no significant changes in specific conductance and volume corrected maximum expiratory flows (Vmax at functional residual capacity/thoracic gas volume). However, hypoxaemia occurred after the acidic placebo with a significant drop of TcPO 2 (mean 0. 9 kPa); SO 2 decreased similarly but this did not reach significance. After salbutamol there was a further significant deterioration of mean TcPO 2 (1. 4 kPa) and of SO 2. These results show that beside a possible pharmacological effect of salbutamol the acidity of the aerosol also induces hypoxaemia in infants...|$|R
40|$|Recently, in vivo {{confocal}} microscopy is used {{to examine}} the human corneal nerve fibers morphology. Corneal nerve fiber architecture and its role are studied in healthy and pathological conditions. Corneal nerves of rats were studied by nonspecific acetylcholinesterase (NsAchE) staining. NsAchE-positive subepithelial (stromal) nerve fiber {{has been found to be}} insensitive to capsaicin. Besides, NsAchE-negative but capsaicin-sensitive subbasal nerve (leash) fibers formed thick mesh-like structure showing close interconnections and exhibit both isolectin B 4 - and transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 1 - (TRPV 1 -) positive. TRPV 1, TRPV 3, TRPA (ankyrin) 1, and TRPM (melastatin) 8 are expressed in corneal nerve fibers. Besides the corneal nerve fibers, the expressions of TRPV (1, 3, and 4), TRPC (canonical) 4, and TRPM 8 are demonstrated in the corneal epithelial cell membrane. The realization of the importance of TRP channels acting as polymodal sensors of environmental stresses has identified potential drug targets for corneal disease. The pathophysiological conditions of corneal diseases are associated with disruption of normal tissue innervation, especially capsaicin-sensitive small sensory nerve fibers. The relationships between subbasal corneal nerve fiber morphology and neurotrophic keratopathy in corneal diseases are well studied. The recommended treatment for neurotrophic keratopathy is administration of <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> eye drops...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{pupil dilation}} with intra-cameral injection of preservative-free lidocaine 1 % (ICL) versus topical eye midriatics during phacoemulsification. Methods: This case-control study included 40 patients with similar bilateral senile cataract scheduled for phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. patient’s first eye received topical midriatic eye drops as control group and next eye operated by intra cameral <b>preservative</b> <b>free</b> lidocaine 1 % without any preoperative or intraoperative midriatics. We did not add epinephrine to the irrigating solution in either group. The first eyes received 3 drops of cyclopentolate 1 % and tropicamide 1 % each 5 minutes, with first dose 60 minutes before surgery. The horizontal pupil diameter was measured {{before and after}} pupil dilation using the same caliper with operation microscope total surgical time was recorded in both groups. Results: Patients included 20 male and 20 female with mean age of 72 and 70. 9 years old. 4 patients were diabetic and 11 cases had pseudo-exfoliation. Pupil diameter increased in both case and control groups significantly (P value< 0. 0) but the difference between mean increase in pupil size wasn’t significantly different. Mean increase in pupil size was significantly greater in patients without pseudo-exfoliation (4. 10 mm vs 3. 85 mm, independent t test, P< 0. 05).
