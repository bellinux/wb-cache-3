40|$|Pressure {{reducing}} {{devices are}} the essential and critical {{components of a}} pneumatic system. But the energy lose due to the pressure reducing process is considerably huge {{when there is a}} high pressure difference. Aiming at this issue, firstly, the mechanism and quantification method of the energy loss in the throttling reducing process is analyzed based on pneumatic power theory. Then, a power recovery type (PRT) pressure reducer which can output shaft power during the reducing operation is proposed. The basic mechanical structure and the working principle of the PRT reducer are described. For evaluating the feasibility of the design, a thermodynamic model of the PRT reducer is established. And under specific parameter settings, simulations on the PRT reducer’s power output characteristics and the pressure regulating ability are carried out. On this basis, the principle structure of an energy recycling high pressure pneumatic system is proposed. This research is the theoretical foundation of the prototype design of a PRT high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E
40|$|Demand-side {{management}} (DSM) {{is a set}} {{of actions}} taken by an electric utility to influence the electricity usage by a customer. Typical DSM activities include rebates for higher efficiency appliances and discounted electric rates for electric customers whose service can be interrupted on short notice. This paper explores two more subtle DSM activities: using turbine "let-downs" and thermal storage. High efficiency and adjustable speed drive (ASD) electric motors have long been considered as demand-side management strategies for industrial consumers of electricity. An alternative strategy to replacing aging electric motors with high efficiency or ASD motors is a turbine let-down. A turbine letdown is a turbine which uses pressure reduction to produce useful work. A typical application of this type of turbine would be to replace both a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>device</b> and an electric motor driven pump. Air conditioning is a primary contributor to peak electric loads in Texas. One of the ways to solve this problem is to move the loads from peak to off-peak periods without changing overall electricity consumption. By using cool storage systems, energy consumption for businesses and industry can be shifted, reducing electricity costs to the consumer and reducing the electric utility's need to build more power plants...|$|E
30|$|While the {{analysis}} of pump energy usage was widely considered, only seven of the papers reviewed considered the source of electricity [C 9] consumed by pumping activities (Pr 25, Pr 26, Pr 30, Pr 34, Pr 36, Pr 38, Pr 48). These papers commonly accounted for the types of electricity generation by considering their associated emissions factors. This consideration allows the emissions factor for a specific electricity generation region to be evaluated, allowing for increased accuracy when evaluating GHG emissions. Stokes and Horvath (2005) (Pr 38) used life cycle analysis (LCA) to evaluate the energy use and GHG emissions for two case-study WDSs in California. GHG emissions were evaluated for multiple activities throughout {{the life of the}} WDSs; including through the use of electricity for pumping, which was calculated considering the mix of electricity generation types for the state of California. Lundie et al. (2006) (Pr 30) also used LCA to evaluate the environmental impacts of Sydney Water’s activities, including the WDS used to supply the city. In this study, both conventional and alternative power sources, including the combustion of biosolid remains from wastewater treatment, were considered. Ramos et al. (2011) (Pr 34) compared operational management optimization while considering different power sources, including from the electricity grid, a water turbine used to recover energy normally lost through a <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>device</b> and a wind turbine used to provide renewable energy generation. The results of this study concluded that using renewable energy (in the form of a wind turbine) can significantly reduce GHG emissions, as significantly less electricity is sourced from the electricity grid. Herstein et al. (2009 a; Lundie et al. 2004) (Pr 25, Pr 26) included the consideration of electricity generation sources during the optimization of case-study WDSs, in which system cost and environmental impact were evaluated. The environmental impact objective used considers several factors, including air pollution and non-renewable resource depletion, {{associated with the use of}} electricity. The consideration of electricity generation source was used in the evaluation of these factors, where the type of generation impacts the amount of pollution and resource depletion.|$|E

50|$|A <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> zone <b>device</b> (RPZD, RPZ, or RPZ valve) {{is a type}} of {{backflow}} prevention device used {{to protect}} water supplies from contamination.

40|$|Hydrogen {{fuel cell}} {{electric}} vehicle (FCEV) can achieve zero exhaust emission and zero pollution. In {{order to make}} FCEV reach a farther travel distance, greater demands are put on its <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system. In this paper, a two-step high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system for FCEV is proposed. The system {{is made up of}} two parts, a new high multi-stage <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> valve (HMSPRV) and a multi-stage muffler. As a new system, its feasibility has to be verified. Since the valve opening condition has a great effect on hydrogen flow, pressure reduction and energy consumption, different valve opening conditions are taken as the research point. The flow field analysis of the new HMSPRV is conducted on three aspects: pressure field, velocity field and energy consumption. It can be found that both the <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> and velocity increasing gradients mainly reflect at those throttling components for all valve openings. For energy consumption, in the comprehensive study of flow vortexes and turbulent dissipation rate, it can be found that the larger of the valve opening, the larger of energy consumption. Then, a thermo-fluid-solid coupling analysis is conducted on the new HMSPRV, and it is concluded that the new system meets strength requirement. Furthermore, as the second step of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> system, the flow and pressure fields of multi-stage muffler are investigated. The five-stage muffler is exactly designed to complete the whole <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> process. This study can provide technological support for achieving pressure regulation in the hydrogen transport system of FCEV when facing complex conditions, and it can also benefit the further research work on energy saving and multi-stage flow of <b>pressure</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
50|$|In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) holds {{local water}} {{suppliers}} responsible for maintaining {{a certain amount}} of purity in potable water systems. Many states and/or local municipalities require annual testing of backflow prevention assemblies. In most cases, the law requires a double check (DC), <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> principle <b>device</b> (RP) device, or an air gap when backflow prevention is mandated.|$|R
50|$|The {{double check}} valve {{assembly}} is suitable for prevention of back pressure and back siphonage, but is not suitable for high hazard applications. It is commonly used on lawn irrigation, fire sprinkler and combi-boiler systems. If the hazard is higher, even a relatively low hazard such as using antifreeze in the fire sprinkler system, then a more reliable check valve such as a <b>reduced</b> <b>pressure</b> zone <b>device</b> may be mandated.|$|R

There is a variety of manufacturers of these gauges, but most utilize either a three-valve or a five-valve design to test the RPZD in different ways.|$|R
40|$|Question: Does {{the use of}} an {{oscillating}} positive expiratory <b>pressure</b> (PEP) <b>device</b> <b>reduce</b> postoperative pulmonary complications in thoracic {{and upper}} abdominal surgical patients? Design: A multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis, blinding of some outcomes, and concealed allocation. Participants: A total of 203 adults after thoracic or upper abdominal surgery with general anaesthesia. Intervention: Participants in the experimental group used an oscillating PEP device, thrice daily for 5 postoperative days. Both the experimental and control groups received standard medical postoperative management and early mobilisation. Outcome measures: Fever, days of antibiotic therapy, length of hospital stay, white blood cell count, and possible adverse events were recorded for 28 days or until hospital discharge. Results: The 99 participants in the experimental group and 104 in the control group were well matched at baseline and there was no loss to follow-up. Fever affected a significantly lower percentage of the experimental group (22 %) than the control group (42 %), with a RR of 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 36 to 0. 87, NNT 6). Similarly, length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the experimental group, at 10. 7 days (SD 8. 1), than in the control group, at 13. 3 days (SD 11. 1); the mean difference was 2. 6 days (95 % CI 0. 4 to 4. 8). The groups did not differ significantly in the need for antibiotic therapy, white blood cell count or total expense of treatment. Conclusion: In adults undergoing thoracic and upper abdominal surgery, postoperative use of an oscillating PEP device resulted in fewer cases of fever and shorter hospital stay. However, antibiotic therapy and total hospital expenses were not significantly reduced by this intervention. Trial registration: NCT 00816881.

40|$|Today {{there are}} a large variety of drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> for heavy trucks that are {{commonly}} used, for example roof deflectors, cab side extenders and chassis fairings. These devices are often proven to be efficient, reducing the total aerodynamic resistance for the vehicle. However, the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> are usually identical for a specific pulling vehicle, independent of {{the layout of the}} vehicle combination. In this study, three vehicle combinations were analyzed. The total length of the vehicles varied between 10. 10 m and 25. 25 m. The combinations consisted of a rigid truck in combination with one or two cargo units. The size of the gap between the cargo units differed between the vehicle combinations. There were also three configurations of each vehicle combination with different combinations of roof deflector and cab side extenders, yielding a total number of nine configurations. The aim of this investigation was to determine the aerodynamic effects of the roof deflector and cab side extenders {{as a function of the}} type of vehicle combination. Important factors were the total length of the vehicle combination and the influence of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> further downstream. The investigation was performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results from the investigation showed that the effect of the two drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> analyzed was different depending on the type of vehicle combination. It was established that the roof deflector and cab side extenders were always efficient in reducing drag both in 0 ° yaw and 5 ° yaw but the magnitudes differed between the configurations. The largest effects of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> were seen for the truck including the 1 st cargo unit; the influence of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> on the 2 nd cargo unit was smaller. The aerodynamic reductions were diminishing downstream, why it was concluded that it is of great importance to improve the aerodynamic design of the rest of the vehicle to maintain the positive effects of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
