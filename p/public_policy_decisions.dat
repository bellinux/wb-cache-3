40|$|Web-based {{interactions}} {{to support}} participation and deliberative democracy, called e-participation and e-democracy, are coming and coming fast. In some instances, the Internet is already permeating politics. However, {{it is far}} from clear if the processes involved in these interactions are meaningful and valid, and most of the research in the field has focused largely on the technologies to facilitate or automate the standard democratic instruments involved, such as e-voting or e-debating. This book, though, uses {{the point of view of}} the Group Decision and Negotiation approach to thoroughly discuss how web-based decision support tools can be used for <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> making. e-Democracy is structured into five main parts. The first part places democracy in context and reviews participatory instruments already in use in the physical world. The second part reviews methodologies that may be used to support groups in <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> making with a view on discussing how they may be used in the virtual world. The third part reviews tools already available on the web to support <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> making, such as debating, negotiating, voting and supporting decisions; it also identifies their various strengths and weaknesses. The fourth part includes a number of recent case studies, and the final part identifies challenges ahead.

30|$|Understanding time {{preferences}} {{is vital}} to understanding governmental policy. For example, high time discount rates contribute to governmental emphasis on acute care, rather than preventative care. Of course, there are facets of governmental policy other than time preferences that can further complicate <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> making. Subsidizing treatments and fee-based systems contribute to inefficiency through the overuse of some treatments and overconsumption of treatments in general, respectively (Watts and Segal 2009).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how marketing management tools {{can be used}} to shape <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> and solve problems in the public sector. Marketing management focuses on utility transfer through transaction processes. Governments increasingly listen to its citizens, for instance through governance networks, where citizens try, often by invitation, to influence decisions to be made by public organisations. Frequent privatization of utilities, which often implies that citizens have a choice among suppliers, requires a systematic approach to the pubic <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> making. Globalisation also means that in essence every supplier in the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> sector is in competition with all other suppliers in the global marketplace. <b>Public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>decision</b> makers are beginning to employ many of the decision making tools used by marketing managers and deem marketing decision making tools suitable for the public sector. This is an exploratory paper that attempts to connect two separate sectors; public and private. BACKGROUND The public sector has grown steadily for many decades.
