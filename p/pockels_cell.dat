2500|$|The driver {{consists}} {{of a number of}} [...] "beamlines" [...] containing [...] amplifiers {{at one end of the}} building. Just prior to firing, the glass is [...] "pumped" [...] to a high-energy state with a series of xenon flash tubes, causing a population inversion of the neodymium (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via stimulated emission when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a fibre optic, is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power. When this process is complete, a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> [...] "switches" [...] the light out of the cavity. One problem for the HiPER project is that Nd:glass is no longer being produced commercially, so a number of options need to be studied to ensure supply of the estimated 1,300 disks.|$|E
2500|$|The Wheeler {{version of}} the {{interferometer}} experiment could not be performed in a laboratory until recently because of the practical difficulty of inserting or removing the second beam-splitter in the brief time interval between the photon's entering the first beam-splitter and its arrival at the location provided for the second beam-splitter. This realization of the experiment is done by extending the lengths of both paths by inserting long lengths of fiber optic cable. So doing makes the time interval involved with transits through the apparatus much longer. A high-speed switchable device on one path, composed of a high-voltage switch, a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell,</b> and a Glan–Thompson prism, {{makes it possible to}} divert that path away from its ordinary destination so that path effectively comes to a dead end. With the detour in operation, nothing can reach either detector by way of that path, so there can be no interference. With it switched off the path resumes its ordinary mode of action and passes through the second beam-splitter, making interference reappear. This arrangement does not actually insert and remove the second beam-splitter, but it does make it possible to switch from a state in which interference appears to a state in which interference cannot appear, and do so in the interval between light entering the first beam-splitter and light exiting the second beam-splitter. If photons had [...] "decided" [...] to enter the first beam-splitter as either waves or a particles, they must have been directed to undo that decision and to go through the system in their other guise, and they must have done so without any physical process being relayed to the entering photons or the first beam-splitter because that kind of transmission would be too slow even at the speed of light. Wheeler's interpretation of the physical results would be that in one configuration of the two experiments a single copy of the wavefunction of an entering photon is received, with 50% probability, at one or the other detectors, and that under the other configuration two copies of the wave function, traveling over different paths, arrive at both detectors, are out of phase with each other, and therefore exhibit interference. In one detector the wave functions will be in phase with each other, and the result will be that the photon has 100% probability of showing up in that detector. In the other detector the wave functions will be 180° out of phase, will cancel each other exactly, {{and there will be a}} 0% probability of their related photons showing up in that detector.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> {{was used}} by MCA Disco-Vision (DiscoVision) {{engineers}} in the optical videodisc mastering system. Light from an argon-ion laser was passed through the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> to create pulse modulations corresponding to the original FM video and audio signals to be recorded on the master videodisc. MCA used the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> in videodisc mastering until the sale to Pioneer Electronics. To increase {{the quality of the}} recordings, MCA patented a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> stabilizer that reduced the second-harmonic distortion that could be created by the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> during mastering. MCA used either a DRAW (Direct Read After Write) mastering system or a photoresist system. The DRAW system was originally preferred, since it didn't require clean-room conditions during disc recording and allowed instant quality checking during mastering.

5000|$|One {{application}} is so-called boxcar switching of a <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell.</b> Four Marx generators are used, {{each of the}} two electrodes of the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> being connected to a positive pulse generator and a negative pulse generator. Two generators of opposite polarity, one on each electrode, are first fired to charge the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> into one polarity. This will also partly charge the other two generators but not trigger them, because they have been only partly charged beforehand. Leakage through the Marx resistors needs to be compensated by a small bias current through the generator.

50|$|When a pulse with {{vertical}} polarization {{is reflected}} off the polarizer, after a double {{pass through the}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> it will become horizontally polarized and will be transmitted by the polarizer. After a double pass through the amplification medium, having the same horizontal polarization, the pulse will be transmitted by the polarizer. If no voltage {{is applied to the}} <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell,</b> a double pass through it will change the polarization of the pulse to vertical, so the pulse will be reflected off the polarizer and will exit the cavity. If a voltage is applied, then a double pass through the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> will not change the polarization and the pulse will get trapped inside the cavity of the resonator. The pulse can stay in the cavity until it reaches saturation or until it extracts most of the energy stored in the gain medium.

40|$|Laser guide star systems {{based on}} Rayleigh {{scattering}} require some means {{to deal with}} the flash of low altitude laser light that follows immediately after each laser pulse. These systems also need a fast shutter to isolate the high altitude portion of the focused laser beam to make it appear star-like to the wavefront sensor. We describe how these tasks are accomplished with UnISIS, the Rayleigh laser guided adaptive optics system at the Mt. Wilson Observatory 2. 5 -m telescope. We use several methods: a 10, 000 RPM rotating disk, dichroics, a fast sweep and clear mode of the CCD readout electronics on a 10 µs timescale, and a <b>Pockel’s</b> <b>cell</b> shutter system. The <b>Pockel’s</b> <b>cell</b> shutter would be conventional in design if the laser light were naturally polarized, but the UnISIS 351 nm laser is unpolarized.

5000|$|Preventing the {{feedback}} of a laser cavity {{by using a}} polarizing prism. This prevents optical amplification by directing light of a certain polarization out of the cavity. Because of this, the gain medium is pumped to a highly excited state. When the medium has become saturated by energy, the <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> is switched, and the intracavity light is allowed to exit. This creates a very fast, high-intensity pulse. Q-switching, chirped pulse amplification, and cavity dumping use this technique.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the type}} and {{orientation}} of the nonlinear crystal, and on {{the direction of the}} applied electric field, the phase delay can depend on the polarization direction. A <b>Pockels</b> <b>cell</b> can thus be seen as a voltage-controlled waveplate, and it can be used for modulating the polarization state. For a linear input polarization (often oriented at 45° to the crystal axis), the output polarization will in general be elliptical, rather than simply a linear polarization state with a rotated direction.|$|E

40|$|Two {{approaches}} to the creating of pulse-shaping techniques that meet the requirements associated with operation of a large fusion laser are examined. These techniques are passive pulse-shaping with double-etalone devices that coherently add or stack short pulses from a modelocked oscillator, and active pulse-shaping with <b>pockels</b> <b>cells</b> to carve a shaped pulse from a much longer pulse generated by a q-switched oscillator. The passive pulse shaper consists of two high-reflectivity mirrors and a wedge with partially transmitting coatings and produces a train of pulses from a single input pulse. The principal advantage of the passive approach is that timing, pulse shape and attenuation depend solely on the device geometry and coatings. <b>Pockels</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been used for}} many years to slice a variable-width pulse from a longer q-switched pulse. Pulse-shaping applications require optical-pulse rise times under 200 ps. Measurements of optical rise times in cylindrical ring-electrode <b>pockels</b> <b>cells</b> of potassium-dideuterium phosphate indicate that 200 - to 300 -ps rise times can be reached in existing devices and somewhat shorter rise times can be achieved in the future.

40|$|Multifrequency-phase and {{modulation}} fluorometry {{allows for}} accurate analysis of fluorescence decay {{in the frequency}} domain. Essential to these frequency domain methods is a high-frequency modulation of the light source. Techniques for generating wide-band modulation of light are currently limited {{to the use of}} <b>Pockel's</b> <b>cells</b> and intrinsically modulated sources such as mode-locked lasers and synchrotron radiation. We present a method that employs two acousto-optic modulators in series for use with cw light sources. This modulator system gives two orders of magnitude more intensity output than the <b>Pockel's</b> <b>cell</b> modulator and requires less than one-tenth of the rf driving power. In addition, the <b>Pockel's</b> <b>cell</b> system is limited to modulation frequencies less than 250 MHz, whereas the particular implementation discussed here gives a quasicontinuous distribution of modulation frequencies from dc to 320 MHz. To obtain this range of frequencies, acoustic standing waves are set up simultaneously in each modulator, and the desired modulation frequency is achieved by choosing the proper combination of the two standing-wave frequencies. Light modulation is obtained at twice each of the individual standing-wave frequencies and at the sum and difference of twice the two acoustic frequencies. Data are presented to illustrate the use of this system for the measurement of phosphorescence as well as fluorescence decay...|$|R

The same technique can be used to impress information on the beam by modulating the rotation between 0° and 90°; the exiting beam's intensity, when viewed through the polarizer, contains an amplitude-modulated signal. This modulated signal can be used for time-resolved electric field measurements when a crystal is exposed to an unknown electric field.|$|E
50|$|The {{electro-optic}} effect relates {{to a change}} in the optical properties of the medium, which is usually a change in the birefringence, and not simply the refractive index.In a Kerr cell, the change in birefringence is proportional to the square of the electric field, and the material is usually a liquid.
