5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the primary transcript is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail</b> to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E
25|$|The alphaviruses are small, spherical, enveloped viruses with a genome of {{a single}} {{positive}} sense strand RNA. The total genome length ranges between 11,000 and 12,000 nucleotides, and has a 5’ cap, and 3’ <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail.</b> The four non-structural protein genes are encoded in the 5′ two-thirds of the genome, while the three structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mRNA colinear with the 3′ one-third of the genome.|$|E
25|$|As Pol II {{reaches the}} end of a gene, two protein {{complexes}} carried by the CTD, CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) and CSTF (cleavage stimulation factor), recognize the poly-A signal in the transcribed RNA. Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then polyadenylation. Poly-A polymerase adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template. The long <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail</b> is unique to transcripts made by Pol II.|$|E

30|$|Quartz-seq was {{developed}} to improve reproducibility and sensitivity of SCS methods to quantify the heterogeneity of gene expression between cells. Quartz-seq focuses on limiting the amplification of unwanted byproducts by removing excess primer with exonuclease I before second-strand synthesis, restricting <b>poly-A</b> <b>tailing,</b> and using suppression PCR, which permits short DNA fragments to form a hairpin structure that cannot be amplified [23]. Similar to other <b>poly-A</b> <b>tailing</b> methods for WTA of single cells, Quartz-seq shows a weak 3 ′-bias but is capable of detecting differentially expressed genes between different cell types.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{tests for}} {{circular}}ity: (1) Treated samples with RNase R, an enzyme which degrades linear RNAs but not circular RNAs, and (2) Tested {{for the presence}} of <b>poly-A</b> <b>tails</b> (shouldn’t be present in a circular molecule) ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{transfer}} RNA (tRNA), for example, the 5' sequence is removed by RNase P, whereas the 3' end is removed by the tRNase Z enzyme and the non-templated 3' CCA tail is added by a nucleotidyl transferase. In {{the case of}} micro RNA (miRNA), miRNAs are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-miRNA with a cap and <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail</b> and processed to short, 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-miRNA in the cell nucleus by the enzymes Drosha and Pasha. After being exported, it is then processed to mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease Dicer, which also initiates {{the formation of the}} RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), composed of the Argonaute protein.|$|E
25|$|Flaviviruses have a (+) sense RNA genome and {{replicate}} in the cytoplasm of {{the host}} cells. The genome mimics the cellular mRNA molecule in all aspects except {{for the absence of}} the poly-adenylated (<b>poly-A)</b> <b>tail.</b> This feature allows the virus to exploit cellular apparatus to synthesise both structural and non-structural proteins, during replication. The cellular ribosome is crucial to the replication of the flavivirus, as it translates the RNA, in a similar fashion to cellular mRNA, resulting in the synthesis of a single polyprotein. In general, the genome encodes 3 structural proteins (Capsid, prM, and Envelope) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). The genomic RNA is modified at the 5′ end of positive-strand genomic RNA with a cap-1 structure (me7-GpppA-me2).|$|E
2500|$|... mRNA capping in eukaryotes {{have shown}} to exist {{and have been}} studied {{extensively}} regarding the 5’ 7-methylguanylate cap and its <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail.</b> It provides RNA stability, processing, localization and translational efficiency. Recently, researchers have proven a similar mechanism in RNA pre-processing in prokaryotes. In prokaryotic (E.coli) mRNA, the 5’ is capped with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ or NADH) or 3’-desphospho-coenzyme A (dpCoA). It was previously thought that the NAD+,NADH, dpCoA modification occurs after transcription analogously with the 7-methylguanylate cap; however, recently {{it has been shown}} that modifications are incorporated during transcription initiation by acting as a non-canonical initiating nucleotides (NCIN) for de novo transcription by cellular RNA polymerase. RppH and NudC pyrophosphohydrolases cleaves specific phosphate bonds to eliminate the cap modification. ATP was initially known to cap an RNA product in prokaryotes while NAD+, NADH and dpCoA was still being studied. RppH specifically cleaves 5’-triphosphate and 5’-diphosphate RNAs to 5’-monophosphate RNA products which only targets the ATP capped RNAs. On the other hand, NudC cleaves 5’-(NADH,NAD+,dpCoA) capped RNAs to 5’-monophosphate RNAs but does not cleave ATP capped RNAs. This discovery of two specific hydrolases that target specific products lead to the discovery of NCIN-mediated transcription.|$|E

50|$|G&T {{sequencing}} {{separates the}} mRNA from the gDNA using an unbiased global amplification procedure described previously. First, mRNA is isolated on specialized oligo-dT (5’-biotin-triethyleneglycol-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC(T)30VN-3’) conjugated to streptavidin-coupled paramagnetic beads. The oligo-dT binds to the <b>poly-A</b> <b>tails</b> of processed mRNA, fishing them {{out from the}} pool of genomic material. Next, the paramagnetic beads are spatially isolated by magnetization. The genomic material remaining in the supernatant is extracted and physically separated from the mRNA.|$|R
50|$|Humans and {{chimpanzees}} share ten NANOG pseudogenes, all in {{the same}} places: one duplication pseudogene and nine retropseudogenes. Of the nine shared NANOG retropseudogenes, two lack the <b>poly-(A)</b> <b>tails</b> characteristic of most retropseudogenes, indicating copying errors occurred during their creation. Due to the high improbability that the same pseudogenes (copying errors included) would exist in the same places in two unrelated genomes, evolutionary biologists point to NANOG and its pseudogenes as providing formidable evidence of common descent between humans and chimpanzees.|$|R
50|$|In eukaryotes, {{polyadenylation}} further modifies pre-mRNAs {{during which}} a structure called the <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail</b> is added. Signals for polyadenylation, which include several RNA sequence elements, are detected {{by a group}} of proteins which signal the addition of the <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail</b> (approximately 200 nucleotides in length). The polyadenylation reaction provides a signal for the end of transcription and this reaction ends approximately a few hundred nucleotides downstream from the <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail</b> location.|$|E

In eukaryotes, a <b>poly-(A)</b> <b>tail</b> (consisting of a long sequence of adenine nucleotides) distinguishes mRNA from tRNA and rRNA and can therefore be used as a primer site for reverse transcription. This has the problem that not all transcripts, such as those for the histone, encode a <b>poly-A</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{sensitivity}} of an RNA-Seq experiment {{can be increased}} by enriching classes of RNA that are of interest and depleting known abundant RNAs. The mRNA molecules can be separated using oligonucleotides probes which bind their <b>poly-A</b> <b>tails.</b> Alternatively, ribo-depletion {{can be used to}} specifically remove abundant but uninformative ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) by hybridisation to probes tailored to the taxon's specific rRNA sequences (e.g. mammal rRNA, plant rRNA). However, ribo-depletion can also introduce some bias via non-specific depletion of off-target transcripts. Small RNAs such as micro RNAs, can be purified based on their size by gel electrophoresis and extraction.|$|R
30|$|TTAS is {{independent}} of the content or complexity of template sequences. DNA fragments are tailed nonspecifically by TdT to form <b>poly-A</b> <b>tails</b> for binding future primers. In the PCR step, the primers bind to the universal sequences that were introduced during two rounds of linear amplifications. This design guarantees uniform amplification across the whole genome and also endows TTAS a versatile method to amplify different types of DNA material. The tailing strategy also preserves the sequence information of the ends of DNA fragments. These regions are particularly desired for some short DNA sequencing applications, such as the identification of DNA damage hotspots and DNA replication stalling sites (Zhou et al., 2013).|$|R

40|$|Microarrays have {{established}} as instrumental for bacterial detection, identification, and genotyping {{as well as}} for transcriptomic studies. For gene expression analyses using limited numbers of bacteria (derived from in vivo or ex vivo origin, for example), RNA amplification is often required prior to labeling and hybridization onto microarrays. Evaluation of the fidelity of the amplification methods is crucial for the robustness and reproducibility of microarray results. We report here the first utilization of random primers and the highly processive Phi 29 phage polymerase to amplify material for transcription profiling analyses. We compared two commercial amplification methods (GenomiPhi and MessageAmp kits) with direct reverse-transcription as the reference method, focusing on the robustness of mRNA quantification using either microarrays or quantitative RT-PCR. Both amplification methods using either <b>poly-A</b> <b>tailing</b> followed by in vitro transcription, or direct strand displacement polymerase, showed appreciable linearity. Strand displacement technique was particularly affordable compared to in vitro transcription-based (IVT) amplification methods and consisted in a single tube reaction leading to high amplification yields.

40|$|The hyperthermophilic archaeum, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, grows optimally at 100 degrees C with a {{doubling}} time of 180 min. It {{is a member}} of the phylogenetically ancient Thermoproteales order, but differs significantly from all other members by its facultatively aerobic metabolism. Due to its simple cultivation requirements and its nearly 100 % plating efficiency, it was chosen as a model organism for studying the genome organization of hyperthermophilic ancient archaea. By a G+C content of the DNA of 52 mol%, sequence analysis was easily possible. At least some of the mRNA of P. aerophilum carried <b>poly-A</b> <b>tails</b> facilitating the construction of a cDNA library. 245 sequence tags of a poly-A primed cDNA library and 55 sequence tags from a 1 - 2 kb Sau 3 AI-fragment containing genomic library were analyzed and the corresponding amino acid sequences compared with protein sequences from databases. Fourteen percent of the cDNA and > 9 % of genomic DNA sequence tags revealed significant similarities to proteins in the databases.

40|$|With few exceptions, current {{methods for}} short read mapping {{make use of}} simple seed {{heuristics}} {{to speed up the}} search. Most of the underlying matching models neglect the necessity to allow not only mismatches, but also insertions and deletions. Current evaluations indicate, however, that very different error models apply to the novel high-throughput sequencing methods. While the most frequent error-type in Illumina reads are mismatches, reads produced by 454 ’s GS FLX predominantly contain insertions and deletions (indels). Even though 454 sequencers are able to produce longer reads, the method is frequently applied to small RNA (miRNA and siRNA) sequencing. Fast and accurate matching in particular of short reads with diverse errors is therefore a pressing practical problem. We introduce a matching model for short reads that can, besides mismatches, also cope with indels. It addresses different error models. For example, it can handle the problem of leading and trailing contaminations caused by primers and <b>poly-A</b> <b>tails</b> in transcriptomics or the length-dependent increase of error rates. In these contexts, it thus simplifies the tedious and error-prone trimming step. For efficient searches, our method utilizes index structures in the form of enhanced suffix arrays.

Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on SOLiD instruments to a depth of> 40 million reads, using linearly amplified, ribosomally depleted RNA.

By sequencing PCR products amplified using primers designed to span the deleted regions, we determined the exact size and genomic position of the deletions in all affected samples.
