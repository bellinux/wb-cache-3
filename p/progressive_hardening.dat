40|$|Abstract Fracture in ductile glassy {{polymers}} {{is usually}} preceded by noticeable and extensive plastic deformation, as shear yielding {{takes place in}} the form of shear bands that are limited by <b>progressive</b> <b>hardening</b> of materials at continuous deformation. In the case of a notched specimen, this induces a noticeable crack blunting before the failure. We use a constitutive law that captures realistically the stress-strain fields of solid glassy polymers. In particular, we account for a rate dependent yield stress followed by intrinsic softening and <b>progressive</b> <b>hardening</b> at continued deformation. We analyzed the 3 D crack tip fields around a blunted notch loaded under mode I. With an increasing ratio between thickness versus notch tip radius, the shape of crack tip area evolves from a flame like zone characteristic of plane stress conditions to slip lines when plan strain conditions prevail. For a constitutive law representing the response of polycarbonate, we identified a critical thickness vs notch radius value that indicates the transition between plane stress to plane strain dominant loading conditions. The implication for the geometry necessary to derive material toughness experimentally is pointed out and an examination of the mean stress constraint related to the onset of failure by crazing is reported...|$|E

An objective of these efforts is to combine X-ray and other data on solar flares, coronal mass ejections and interplanetary particle events in order to obtain a more comprehensive recognition of signatures, and understanding of interplanetary proton events. Thus, part of these efforts are to investigate if signatures seen in hard X-rays and microwaves can lead to better predictions of interplanetary proton events that can be dangerous to astronauts and spacecraft. The original proposal was written in May, 2000 and it discusses a three-pronged approach for data comparisons with three new types of instrumentation observing at X-ray, microwave and optical wavelengths. The major impetus behind this work and the proposal is that the P. I. discovered a strong correlation between a particular type of hard X-ray signature seen in spectral evolutions and interplanetary proton events (Kiplinger, 1995). The basic signature is that hard X-ray flux peaks either exhibit spectra that soften on their decays (Le. show fewer and fewer high energy X-rays with time) or they harden during decays (i. e. high energy X-rays decay significantly slower that lower energy X-rays). This signature is called <b>progressive</b> <b>hardening.</b> Studies were conducted over an eight-year period of data from the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS) of the Solar maximum mission.

Furthermore, and contrary to common belief, it is found from the interfacial stress history that, using realistic material parameters, the rubber particle continues to significantly affect plasticity in the matrix in the post-cavitation regime, i. e. after it has cavitated, so that cavitated particles cannot always be considered to be equivalent to particle-sized voids. ...|$|R

Two plastic mechanisms are introduced in the model: one is to reproduce the ther-moplasticity involving thermal expansion and contraction observed at high over-consolidation ratios and the second one describes the temperature effect on the yield behavior. The model adopts additional yield surfaces, namely inner yield surfaces that are associated with the two proposed plastic mechanisms to account for the plastic behavior inside the existing conventional thermomechanical yield surface namely yield surfaces. The general expressions of the yield surfaces and plastic potentials in p′–q–T space are introduced. A <b>progressive</b> plastic <b>hardening</b> mechanism associated with the inner yield surface is defined, enabling the plastic modulus to vary smoothly during thermomechanical loadings inside the yield surfaces.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a study of voids in {{amorphous}} glassy polymers that exhibit elastic-viscoplasticity with rate dependent yield, intrinsic softening and <b>progressive</b> strain <b>hardening</b> at large strains. The study is motivated by the plastic deformation in voided polymer-rubber blends caused by cavitation of the rubber particles, and thus attempts {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the toughening mechanisms in blends. Axisymmetric cell analyses are presented to study the plastic deformation around initially spherical voids and their resulting growth in terms of size and shape up to large overall strains. This void growth is demonstrated to inherit particular properties from the typical features of plasticity in glassy polymers, viz. small strain softening and large strain hardening. The role of strain localization into shear bands and their subsequent propagation in controlling void growth is highlighted. Furthermore, an approximate constitutive model is presented for the description of the macroscopic overall behaviour of porous glassy polymers. This model includes a modification of existing porous plasticity models to account for elasticity effects on the initiation of overall plasticity, which are important in polymers because of their relatively high yield strain. Its predictions are compared with the results from the numerical cell analyses. ...|$|R

The as-deposited multilayers consist of carbon-encapsulated FePt nanoparticles (average size ∼ 3 nm) with a disordered face-centered-cubic structure. The effects of thermal annealing on the structural and magnetic properties are investigated by using dedicated ex situ and in situ techniques, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, extended x-ray absorption fine structure, magnetometry, and coupled grazing incidence small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray diffraction. Our structural data show that the particle size and interparticle distance increase slightly with annealing at temperatures below 790 K by thermally activated migration of Fe and Pt atoms. We find that thermal annealing at temperatures above 870 K results in the dramatic growth of the FePt nanoparticles by coalescence and their gradual L 10 ordering. In addition, we observe a preferential graphitization of the carbon matrix, which provides protection against oxidation for the FePt nanoparticles.

40|$|Most {{theoretical}} {{descriptions of}} the production of solar flare bremsstrahlung radiation assume the collision of dilute accelerated particles with a cold, dense target plasma, neglecting interactions of the fast particles with each other. This is inadequate for situations where collisions with this background plasma are not completely dominant, as {{may be the case}} in, for example, low-density coronal sources. We aim to formulate a model of a self-interacting, entirely fast electron population {{in the absence of a}} dense background plasma, to investigate its implications for observed bremsstrahlung spectra and the flare energy budget. We derive approximate expressions for the time-dependent distribution function of the fast electrons using a Fokker-Planck approach. We use these expressions to generate synthetic bremsstrahlung X-ray spectra as would be seen from a corresponding coronal source. We find that our model qualitatively reproduces the observed behaviour of some flares. As the flare progresses, the model's initial power-law spectrum is joined by a lower energy, thermal component. The power-law component diminishes, and the growing thermal component proceeds to dominate the total emission over timescales consistent with flare observations. The power-law exhibits <b>progressive</b> spectral <b>hardening,</b> as is seen in some flare coronal sources. We also find that our model requires a factor of 7 - 10 fewer accelerated electrons than the cold, thick target model to generate an equivalent hard X-ray flux. This model forms the basis of a treatment of self-interactions among flare fast electrons, a process which affords a more efficient means to produce bremsstrahlung photons and so may reduce the efficiency requirements placed on the particle acceleration mechanism.

While GRS records several smaller enhancements after the main peak, the high coronal source observed by RHESSI shows a long exponential decay (t p 135 � 5 s) with <b>progressive</b> spectral <b>hardening.</b> The emissions from the high corona originate from an extended source (∼ 1. 5 # 105 km in diameter) that expands � 1 � 1 (390 � 70 km s) and moves upwards (750 � 80 km s) {{in the same direction}} as the CME. These observations reveal the existence of energetic electrons in the high corona in closed magnetic structures related to the CME that are accelerated at the same time as the main energy release in the flare. Although the number of energetic electrons in the high corona is only a small fraction of the total accelerated electrons, about 10 % of all electrons in the high coronal source are nonthermal (110 keV) ...|$|R
40|$|Fracture in {{amorphous}} glassy polymers involves two {{mechanisms of}} localized deformations: shear yielding and crazing. We here investigate {{the competition between}} these two mechanisms and its consequence on the material’s fracture toughness. The mechanical response of the homogeneous glassy polymer is described by a constitutive law that accounts for its characteristic softening upon yielding and the subsequent <b>progressive</b> orientational strain <b>hardening.</b> The small scale yielding, boundary layer approach is adopted to model the local finite-deformation process {{in front of a}} mode I crack. The concept of cohesive surfaces is used to represent crazes and the traction-separation law incorporates craze initiation, widening and breakdown leading {{to the creation of a}} microcrack. Depending on the craze initiation sensitivity of the material, crazing nucleates at the crack tip during the elastic regime or ahead of the crack. As the crazes extend, plasticity develops until an unstable crack propagation takes place when craze fibrils start to break down. Thus, the critical width of a craze appears to be a key feature in the toughness of glassy polymers. Moreover, the opening rate of the craze governs the competition between shear yielding and brittle failure by crazing. ...|$|R
