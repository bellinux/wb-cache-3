30|$|Drought {{avoidance}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important strategies for maintaining crop yields in water-limited environments.

Compared to vegetative growth and yield, root traits have not been popular breeding objectives, partly due to the labor-intensive nature of root system phenotyping under agronomically relevant conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND Plants {{depend on}} their root systems to acquire the water and {{nutrients}} necessary for their survival in nature, and for their yield and nutritional quality in agriculture. Root systems are complex {{and a variety of}} root <b>phenes</b> have been identified as contributors to adaptation to soils with low fertility and aluminium (Al) toxicity. Phenotypic characterization of root adaptations to infertile soils is enabling plant breeders to develop improved cultivars that not only yield more, but also contribute to yield stability and nutritional security in the face of climate variability. SCOPE In this review the adaptive responses of root systems to soils with low fertility and Al toxicity are described. After a brief introduction, the purpose and focus of the review are outlined. This is followed by a description of the adaptive responses of roots to low supply of mineral nutrients [with an emphasis on low availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and on toxic levels of Al]. We describe progress in developing germplasm adapted to soils with low fertility or Al toxicity using selected examples from ongoing breeding programmes on food (maize, common bean) and forage/feed (Brachiaria spp.) crops. A number of root architectural, morphological, anatomical and metabolic <b>phenes</b> contribute to the superior performance and yield on soils with low fertility and Al toxicity. Major advances have been made in identifying root <b>phenes</b> in improving adaptation to low N (maize), low P (common bean) or high Al [maize, common bean, species and hybrids of brachiariagrass, bulbous canarygrass (Phalaris aquatica) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) ]. CONCLUSIONS Advanced root phenotyping tools will allow dissection of root responses into specific root <b>phenes</b> that will aid both conventional and molecular breeders to develop superior cultivars. These new cultivars will {{play a key role in}} sustainable intensification of crop–livestock systems, particularly in smallholder systems of the tropics. Development of these new cultivars adapted to soils with low fertility and Al toxicity is needed to improve global food and nutritional security and environmental sustainability. Peer Revie...|$|R

6000|$|It {{is further}} {{apparent}} that Browning's characters are never merely types, but {{must always be}} reckoned with as individuals. It was his belief that no two beings were ever made similar in head and heart; hence, even where there are external similarities the essential elements are strongly differentiated. Take, for instance, three poems in which the situations are not unlike. In [...] "My Last Duchess," [...] "The Flight of the Duchess," [...] and The Ring and the Book, we have a portrayal of three men of high lineage, but cold, egotistic, cruel, who have married very young and lovely women over whom the custom of the times gives them absolute power. But there the likeness ends. We cannot for a moment class together the polished, aesthetic, well-bred aristocrat of the first poem, the absurd little popinjay of the second, and the [...] "tiger-cat" [...] of the third. Less strongly, but as clearly are the wives differentiated. To the innocent gaiety of heart, the bright, sweet friendliness of the hapless lady in [...] "My Last Duchess" [...] must be added for the lady in [...] "The Flight of the Duchess" [...] a native force of character which, when roused by {{the call of the}} gypsy-queen, enables her to break the yoke imposed on her by the Duke and his mother and go forth into a life of adventure, freedom, and love. The delicate, flower-like Pompilia in The Ring and the Book has also power to initiate and carry through a plan of escape, but her incentive is no call to romantic freedom. Her passive endurance changes to active revolt only when motive and energy are supplied by her love for her child. Or take Pippa and <b>Phene</b> in Pippa Passes, two beautiful young girls brought up in dangerous and evil surroundings, but both innately pure. In character and experience they are, however, as unlike as two girls could be. <b>Phene,</b> undeveloped in mind and heart, the easily duped agent of a cruel trick, appeals to us by her slow, incredulous, but eager response to goodness and aspiration, the tremulous opening of her soul to love. But Pippa, with her observant love of nature, her gay, sportive, winsome fancies, her imaginative sympathy with the lives of others, her knowledge of good and evil, her poise, her bright steadiness of soul, carries us into a different and much more highly evolved world of thought and feeling. So we might go through the great assemblage of Browning's characters to find that each one stands out by himself as a person with his own qualities, possibilities, and problems.|$|E

40|$|While it is {{generally}} agreed {{that the concept of}} homology refers to individuated traits that have been inherited from common ancestry, we still lack an adequate account of trait individuation or inheritance. Here I propose that we utilize a counterfactual criterion of causation to link each trait with a developmental-causal (DC) gene. A DC gene is made up of the genetic information (which might or might not be physically contiguous in the genome) that is needed for the production of the organismic attributes that comprise the trait. I argue that individuated traits—phenes—correspond to organismic features that are caused by DC genes. Using such an approach, we can define a DC map, which shows the relations between each pair of <b>phenes</b> and provides a succinct summary of genotype-phenotype relationships and phenotypic complexity. <b>Phenes</b> in parents and offspring are judged to be homologous if their DC genes are composed of orthologous genetic factors. When comparing more distantly related organisms, traits are homologous when linked by a chain of parent-offspring homologs along the path of ancestry that links the two organisms. There are three possible ways to deal with the potential for multiple equivalent DC genes: maximal, minimal, and consensus homology. Whereas maximal homology has limited utility, the other two approaches have value and can help to guide research at the intersection of evolution and development...|$|R

The genotypes include controls such as the drought sensitive IR 64 and Nipponbare, along with the drought resistant Nagina 22 (N 22) and Bengal landraces to identify distinguishing phenotypic features of resistant accessions. Anatomical traits studied include total areas of the cross-sections of the stele, cortex, aerenchyma, cortical-cell, and xylem tissue; the number of aerenchyma, xylem vessels, cortical cell file number and size that together describe a number of root <b>phenes,</b> or individual traits that can be analyzed genetically. To make paired comparisons in size using cross-section area the ratio of xylem to stele, stele to cortex, cortex to cross-section, stele to cross-section, cortical cell area to cortex, and aerenchyma to cortical cell area were calculated. Architectural traits were evaluated for root diameter, number of crown roots, lateral root densities, root length and root angles. To study the expression of genes with known function in root traits, the intrinsic gene expression levels of ten candidate genes under optimal growth conditions were estimated by qRT-PCR, which was then used in correlation studies with the data on phenotypic variation.
