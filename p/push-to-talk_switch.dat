50|$|Duplex {{systems can}} be divided into two types. The term {{half-duplex}} refers to systems where use of a <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>switch</b> is required to communicate. Full duplex refers to systems like mobile telephones with a capability to simultaneously receive and transmit. Repeaters are by nature full duplex, most mobiles and almost all handhelds are half duplex.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{communications}} between posts and controls were made using former Army-issue head-and-breast communication sets via above-ground telephone lines, these being manually switched by telephone engineers prior to use. Army head-and-breast sets were replaced in 1964 by metal housed “Teletalk” units which only permitted one-way communications when the <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>switch</b> was depressed. The Teletalk units also used manually switched telephone lines, but with integral transistorisation to boost transmission and reception power. In 1981 a new design of Teletalk (AD8010) {{was introduced by}} British Telecom together with underground, permanently wired, landline connections that were hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear bursts.|$|E
5000|$|IMTS {{base station}} sites {{generally}} covered an area 40-60 miles in diameter. This extended range {{was due to}} both their large transmitter power {{and in many cases}} higher antenna placement at anywhere from 100-500 ft. IMTS base stations in larger cites had as many as 7 or 8 channels while rural stations had as few as one or two channels. Each telephone conversation (connection) required the exclusive use of a channel for the duration. Because of this limitation these systems had a much lower capacity than cellular systems and all channels busy conditions were common. In larger cities this dictated a very limited number of simultaneous calls. Each subscriber was given a packet of dialing and use instructions. Roaming (receiving calls out of the [...] "home area") was achieved by selecting the specific channels used by the tower and service provider the user was traveling in and dialing a three-digit code, thereby logging the user's land number at that location. This process had to be repeated at each tower which, as noted, usually had a range of 40-60 miles. Some areas only had half-duplex (one-way) communications and required the <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>switch</b> in the handset, between the mouthpiece and the earpiece. Two lights on the [...] "head" [...] indicated busy (red) if no channels were idle and in-use (green) if connected to the tower, or depressing the <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>switch.</b> There was no encryption and all conversations were public.|$|E
50|$|The {{directional}} control was by two hand control grips with firing buttons. The left foot controlled the reflector sight range reticle. The right foot operated a <b>push-to-talk</b> intercom <b>switch.</b> The turret was electrically powered in azimuth and altitude. An emergency hand crank could {{be attached to}} reposition the turret from inside the aircraft fuselage. In {{the event of a}} power failure another crewman would use this to crank the turret into the vertical position to allow the gunner to exit.|$|R
5000|$|An {{enhanced}} mini-USB (EMU) connector {{is a type}} {{of hybrid}} electrical connector which carries Universal Serial Bus data and power as well as other connections such as bidirectional audio. It was invented for and is mainly used on mobile phones. Motorola, HTC Corporation, and other mobile phone manufacturers use EMU connectors. [...] There is more than one standard for EMU connectors, which are incompatible between manufacturers, but all are physically and electrically compatible with standard mini-USB connectors. The EMU connector has five pins for USB on one side. While regular USB connectors are empty on the other side, EMU has more pins intended for headsets. In HTC's version, two pins are for the microphone, three are for stereo sound, and one is for the <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Commercial {{and general}} {{aviation}} (GA) civil airplane headset plugs are similar, but not identical. A standard [...] in monaural plug, type PJ-055, {{is used for}} headphones, paired with special tip-ring-sleeve, 0.206 inch diameter plug, type PJ-068, for the microphone. On the microphone plug the Ring {{is used for the}} microphone 'hot' and the sleeve is common or microphone 'Lo'. The extra (tip) connection in the microphone plug is often left unconnected but is also sometimes used for various functions, most commonly an optional <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>switch,</b> but on some aircraft it carries headphone audio and on others a DC supply. On many newer GA aircraft the headphone jack is a standard [...] in phone connector wired in the standard unbalanced stereo configuration instead of the PJ-055 to allow stereo music sources to be reproduced.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{floor-mounted}} cyclic sticks {{between the}} pilot's knees, the R22 uses a unique teetering [...] "T-Bar" [...] control {{connected to a}} stick that emerges from the console between the seats. This {{makes it easier for}} occupants to enter and exit the cabin and reduces chances for injury {{in the event of a}} hard landing. The teetering bar has a hand grip on both sides that hangs down between the pilots' legs. Thus, if teetered to the right, the right side pilot would be flying and the left grip would be about 12 inches above the left pilot's lap. R22 flight instructors quickly learn how to fly with their hand in the air. The left part of the bar, left collective control, and left tail rotor pedals can be removed if the left seat occupant is not certified to fly the R22 or if the space is needed for technical or observer duties. A floor-mounted foot-activated <b>push-to-talk</b> <b>switch</b> facilitates intercom communications for the left seat occupant, although some later models may be equipped with a voice activated intercom system.|$|E
