40|$|Abstract. Project {{portfolio}} management involves multiple <b>projects,</b> of which <b>risk</b> regulation {{is different from}} the risk regulation of single projects especially in information technology application. In addition to considering each <b>project's</b> own <b>risk,</b> it must consider <b>risk</b> of <b>project</b> portfolio from a broader perspective. Issues of risk regulation are more complex, therefore its risk regulation requires new management approaches. This paper draws on Hall's three-dimensional management structure, respectively, from the four aspects: project {{portfolio management}} process, <b>project</b> portfolio <b>risk</b> regulation process, <b>project</b> portfolio <b>risk</b> regulation approach and <b>project</b> portfolio <b>risk</b> regulation organization, to establish a <b>project</b> portfolio <b>risk</b> regulation four-dimensional system (tlkc system) by applied-information technology.

40|$|A Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) {{water supply}} project {{typically}} involves {{a plethora of}} risks. Because a PPP is nothing other than a transfer of <b>project</b> <b>risks</b> traditionally borne {{by the government to}} the private sector, proper risk identification and allocation is a key to successful PPP project implementation. This paper presents and discusses the industry's perception of the optimal risk allocation in the context of Indonesian PPP water supply projects. The paper has identified a total of 39 <b>project</b> <b>risks,</b> classified them into six categories. Qualitative assessments of individual risks were elicited from an industry survey of respondents' opinions via a mail-based questionnaire. The central tendency of risk allocation as measured by the mode value confirms the intuition and theory that risk must better rest with the party who has control or better manage it. However, the findings also suggest that balancing <b>project</b> <b>risks</b> remain elusive, which is indicated by a high disagreement level amongst respondents. Full Tex...|$|R

[...] The RiskyProject suite provides software for both single desktop users to a client/server enterprise system that allows for project portfolio risk analysis and management. The RiskyProject suite of products includes RiskyProject Lite, RiskyProject Professional, and RiskyProject Enterprise. RiskyProject is a scalable solution. The users may enable basic risk analysis on a project level with RiskyProject Lite, then implement more advanced <b>project</b> <b>risk</b> analysis using RiskyProject Professional, and finally connect RiskyProject Lite and Professional to the database to implement a portfolio risk analysis with common set of risks across an organization. Intaver Institute's RiskyProject software is also performs <b>project</b> <b>risk</b> analysis and risk management as part of broader portfolio management solutions offered by other companies.

50|$|Dr. Rasool Mehdizadeh has {{developed}} a methodology for a dynamic, multi-scale and multi-perspective risk management of construction projects. This method {{is based on the}} application of tailor-made risk breakdown structures (RBS) which are well adapted to: (1) the stage and degree of development of project, (2) specific requirements and objectives of project stakeholders, and (3) required level of details. Using this method, each of the project stakeholders, at each stage of the project, considering his/her special view to <b>project</b> <b>risks,</b> can build his/her own specific RBS. Moreover, the RBS can also be tailored as a shared support for all the project stakeholders in order to facilitate understanding and discussing <b>project</b> <b>risks.</b> Using these tailored RBSs which are all generated using a unique procedure and knowledge database, each of project stakeholders can identify, analyze and represent the <b>project</b> <b>risks</b> regarding his/her point of view and requirements.
