25|$|MotoGP-class {{motorcycles}} are {{not restricted}} to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; {{the weight of the}} extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap. This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable bore to stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater <b>piston</b> <b>area</b> and a shorter stroke. The increased <b>piston</b> <b>area</b> permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing more air and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same piston speed, allowing the engine to pump still more air and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series use this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration.|$|E

Also, pistons may be of several sizes so pad force can be controlled {{across the face of}} the pad, especially when the pad is long and narrow.

We specifically consider the problem of maximizing the minimum fundamental frequency of a hydraulic excavator with respect to various actuator and structural design parameters, i. e. the <b>piston</b> <b>areas</b> of the hydraulic cylinders, and the masses and inertias of the mechanical links. An analytic gradient-based optimization algorithm, together with the design sensitivity equations, are derived. Detailed case studies involving a prototype hydraulic excavator are presented...|$|R

40|$|Standard {{analytic}} {{linear model}} of hydraulic cylinder usually comes from assumptions of identical action <b>piston</b> <b>areas</b> {{on both sides}} of hydraulic cylinder (double piston rod) and suitable operation point, which is usually chosen in the middle of piston. By reason of that volumes inside of cylinder are than same. Moreover for control of that arrangement of hydraulic cylinder, usually controlled by 4 / 3 servovalve, the same mount of flows comes in and comes out to each of chambers of hydraulic cylinder. Presented paper deal with development of extended form of analytic linear model of single piston rod hydraulic cylinder which respects different action <b>piston</b> <b>areas</b> and volumes inside of chambers of hydraulic cylinder and also two different input flows of hydraulic cylinder. In extended model are also considered possibilities of different dead volumes in hoses and intake parts of hydraulic cylinder. Dead volume has impact on damping of hydraulic cylinder. Because the system of hydraulic cylinder is generally presented as a integrative system with inertia of second order: eq, we can than obtain time constants and damping of hydraulic cylinder for each of analytic form model. The model has arisen for needs of model fractionation on two parts. Part of behaviour of chamber A and part of behaviour of chamber B of cylinder. It was created for the reason of analysis and synthesis of control parameters of regulation circuit of multivalve control concept of hydraulic drive with separately controlled chamber A and B which could be then used for...|$|R

50|$|On instroke, {{the same}} {{relationship}} between force exerted, pressure and effective {{cross sectional area}} applies as discussed above for outstroke. However, since the cross sectional area {{is less than the}} <b>piston</b> <b>area</b> the relationship between force, pressure and radius is different. The calculation isn't more complicated though, since the effective cross sectional area is merely that of the piston surface minus the cross sectional area of the piston rod.|$|E
50|$|For double-acting, double-rod {{cylinders}}, {{when the}} <b>piston</b> surface <b>area</b> is equally {{covered by a}} rod of equal size {{on both sides of}} the head, there is no force difference. Such cylinders typically have their cylinder body affixed to a stationary mount.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{example of}} one of those {{important}} kinds is pressure-volume work. The pressure of concern is that exerted by the surroundings {{on the surface of the}} system, and the volume of interest is the negative of the increment of volume gained by the system from the surroundings. It is usually arranged that the pressure exerted by the surroundings on the surface of the system is well defined and equal to the pressure exerted by the system on the surroundings. This arrangement for transfer of energy as work can be varied in a particular way that depends on the strictly mechanical nature of pressure-volume work. The variation consists in letting the coupling between the system and surroundings be through a rigid rod that links <b>pistons</b> of different <b>areas</b> for the system and surroundings. Then for a given amount of work transferred, the exchange of volumes involves different pressures, inversely with the <b>piston</b> <b>areas,</b> for mechanical equilibrium. This cannot be done for the transfer of energy as heat because of its non-mechanical nature.|$|R
50|$|The Stirling {{cycle engine}} {{has the highest}} {{theoretical}} efficiency of any thermal engine {{but it has a}} low output power to weight ratio, therefore Stirling engines of practical size tend to be large. The size effect of the Stirling engine is due to its reliance on the expansion of a gas with an increase in temperature and practical limits on the working temperature of engine components. For an ideal gas, increasing its absolute temperature for a given volume, only increases its pressure proportionally, therefore, where the low pressure of the Stirling engine is atmospheric, its practical pressure difference is constrained by temperature limits and is typically not {{more than a couple of}} atmospheres, making the piston pressures of the Stirling engine very low, hence relatively large <b>piston</b> <b>areas</b> are required to obtain useful output power.|$|R
50|$|Single action {{calipers}} have brake pistons {{that operate}} {{on one side}} only. This type has a floating pin design which allows the piston side of the caliper to push onto the disc surface and pull the other side into contact as well.Dual action, or opposed calipers, are fixed into position to reduce flex.

The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and <b>piston</b> <b>area.</b> The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, belts, pulleys, camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|E

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} cylinder without a piston {{or with a}} piston without seals is called a plunger cylinder. A plunger cylinder can only {{be used as a}} pushing cylinder; the maximum force is <b>piston</b> rod <b>area</b> multiplied by pressure. This means that a plunger cylinder in general has a relatively thick piston rod.|$|R
50|$|If a {{preloaded}} {{system is}} used the force between the Cylinder Shaft and Piston Head is initially the Piston Head Retainer preload value. Once pressure is applied this force will reduce.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new MotoGP era in 2002, 500 cc two-stroke or 990 cc four-stroke bikes were specified to race. The enormous power advantage of the twice as large displacement four-stroke engine over the half the size two-stroke meant that by the following season, no two-stroke bikes were racing. In 2007, the maximum engine capacity was reduced to 800 cc without reducing the existing weight restriction. MotoGP-class motorcycles are not restricted to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; the weight of the extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap.

50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{is not required}} to host valves, allowing the spark plug to be placed in the best possible location for efficient ignition of the combustion mixture. For very big engines, where flame propagation speed limits both size and speed, the swirl induced by ports, as described by Harry Ricardo can be an additional advantage. In his research with two-stroke single sleeve valve compression ignition engines, Harry Ricardo proved that an open sleeve was feasible, acting as a second annular piston with 10% of the central <b>piston</b> <b>area,</b> that transmitted 3% of the power to the output shaft through the sleeve driving mechanism.

50|$|Pompanos engines were {{a unique}} {{prototype}} of the H.O.R. engine, having 8 cylinders. An inherent problem with double-acting cylinders, owing to the piston rod reducing the <b>piston</b> <b>area</b> on one side, is an imbalance in the force {{on each side of}} the piston. The H.O.R. engines were plagued by vibration and other problems as a result. While Pompano was still being built, the Salmon class submarines were ordered. Three of these were built by Electric Boat, with a 9-cylinder development of the same H.O.R. engine. The 9-cylinder arrangement was an attempt to re-balance the engine, so reducing the overall effect of vibration across the engine. Although not as great a failure as Pompanos engines, this version was still troublesome and the boats were later re-engined with the same General Motors 16-248 two-stroke V16 Diesel engines as their sister boats. Other Electric Boat constructed submarines of the Sargo and Seadragon classes were also built with these 9-cylinder H.O.R. engines, but later re-engined.|$|E

Hybrid systems which combine elements of both categories are also possible. This paper reports {{an analysis of the}} most elementary of systems from each of these categories. The analysis uses a coupled hydrodynamic-hydraulic time domain model. The model is used to assess the effectiveness of the hydrodynamic power absorption and the efficiency of the hydraulic power transmission. The results show that, in each case, the hydraulic motor performance is a critical consideration and the optimal configuration of any one system is dependent on motor selection.
