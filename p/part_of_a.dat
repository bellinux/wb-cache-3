And therefore the distance of the edges of the Knives at the meeting of these dark Lines was the 160th <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch. For as four Inches to the eighth <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch, so is any Length of the edges of the Knives measured from the point of their concourse to the distance of the edges of the Knives at the end of that Length, and so is the fifth <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch to the 160th Part. So then the dark Lines above-mention'd meet in the middle of the Light which passes between the Knives where they are distant the 160th <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch, and the one half of that Light passes by the edge of one Knife at a distance not greater than the 320th <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the Fringes of the Shadow of that Knife, and the other half passes by the edge of the other Knife, at a distance not greater than the 320th <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the Fringes of the Shadow of the other Knife. But if the Paper be held at a distance from the Knives greater than the third <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch, the dark Lines above-mention'd meet at a greater distance than the fifth <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch from the end of the Light which passed between the Knives at the concourse of their edges; and therefore the Light which falls upon the Paper where those dark Lines meet passes between the Knives where the edges are distant above the 160th <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch.|$|R
