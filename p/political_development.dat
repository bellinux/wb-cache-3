5|$|In the October 1917 elections, the Social Democrats {{lost their}} {{absolute}} majority, which radicalized {{the labor movement}} and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution in January 1918 on their own, but together with <b>political</b> <b>development</b> based on the commoners' interpretation of the ideas of Fennomania and socialism, the events were decisive for the goals of a Finnish revolution. In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of <b>political</b> <b>development.</b> Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E

The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the mainstay of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{there had}} been rapid <b>political</b> <b>development</b> in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and by 630, he had {{successfully}} united most of the Arabia under a single political authority. When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was elected Caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, when several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr, who declared war against the rebels. In {{what became known as}} the Ridda wars of 632–633, Abu Bakr managed to unite Arabia under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Constitution of the Roman Republic is {{a study of the}} ancient Roman Republic that traces the {{progression}} of Roman <b>political</b> <b>development</b> from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC until the founding of the Roman Empire in 27 BC. The constitutional {{history of the}} Roman Republic can be divided into five phases. The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Kingdom in 510 BC, and the final phase ended with the revolution which overthrew the Roman Republic, and thus created the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the history of the republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the struggle between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Filitti {{completed}} his Proprietatea solului în Principatele române până la 1864 ("Land Ownership in the Romanian Principalities to 1864") and Contribuții la istoria diplomatică a României în secolul al XIX-lea ("Contributions to the Diplomatic History of Romania in the 19th Century"). In Vechea organizare fiscală a Principatelor Române până la Regulamentul Organic ("On the Ancient Fiscal Order of the Romanian Principalities to Regulamentul Organic"), he discussed {{the proliferation of}} state taxes over the centuries, and the measure to which the Orthodox clergy was exempted. A fourth book, on literary history, saw print with the title Cărți vechi privitoare la români ("Old Books Relating to the Romanians"). Also in 1935, he released a selection of his memoirs, as Câteva amintiri ("Some Recollections"), and set in print his conferences for the state Radio Company: Dezvoltarea politică a României moderne ("The <b>Political</b> <b>Development</b> of Modern Romania"). Building on his previous research in Arhiva Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, Filitti also contributed {{an article about the}} Romanian origins of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue (Adevărul daily, September 29, 1935) and edited for print the letters of Oltenian engineer Petrache Poenaru (Arhivele Olteniei, 74-76/1934).|$|E

5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early <b>political</b> <b>development</b> was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|The History of the Roman Constitution is a {{study of}} Ancient Rome that traces the {{progression}} of Roman <b>political</b> <b>development</b> from {{the founding of the}} city of Rome in 753 BC to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. The constitution of the Roman Kingdom vested the sovereign power in the King of Rome. The king did have two rudimentary checks on his authority, which took the form of a board of elders (the Roman Senate) and a popular assembly (the Curiate Assembly). The arrangement was similar to the constitutional arrangements found in contemporary Greek city-states (such as Athens or Sparta). These Greek constitutional principles probably came to Rome through the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia in southern Italy. The Roman Kingdom was overthrown in 510 BC, according to legend, and in its place the Roman Republic was founded.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} <b>political</b> <b>development</b> and feudalisation of Bulgaria in the 13th century {{resulted in}} a rising number of serfs, {{as well as an}} increase {{in the power of the}} landed nobility. This, in turn, led to aspirations for more self-rule among the most influential nobles. Many of them established semi-independent fiefdoms that nominally recognized the emperor in Tarnovo and greatly reduced the capacity of the central authorities to deal with external threats. In the second half of the 13th century, the peasantry was losing personal privileges to the benefit of the secular and religious feudal lords, which in turn reduced the peasants' income and opportunities, worsening their lives. In parallel, the inability of Constantine Tikh to terminate the constant Mongol incursions in the north-east of the country shattered the pillars of the state institutions in Dobrudzha and contributed to the outbreak of the uprising and its swift success. The Mongol raids were carried out by the semi-independent chief Nogai Khan, who was more powerful than the legitimate ruler of the Golden Horde, Mengu-Timur (r. 1266–1280), and ruled over the steppes of modern Moldova and Ukraine.|$|E
