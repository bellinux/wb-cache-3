30|$|Until very recently, in Spain the {{insolvency}} procedures {{available for}} self-employed individuals and entrepreneurs (i.e., managers/owners of small firms) were {{governed by the}} same rules than {{in the case of}} large businesses such as a limited liability companies. In September 2013 the Spanish Parliament approved a law that will create some sort of special bankruptcy regime for them. 64 The law contemplates introducing some limitation of the liability of the entrepreneur / self-employed individual through the new figure of entrepreneur with limited liability (emprendedor de responsabilidad limitada). This figure will allow that part of the assets of the entrepreneur will be exempted in case of insolvency, namely EUR 300, 000 invested in its primary residence. The law also introduces a partial “fresh start”: the entrepreneur will be discharged of her pre-bankruptcy debts as longs as she pays in full the preferential, secured and <b>privileged</b> <b>credit</b> and at least a 25  % of the ordinary credit. 65 Finally, the law establishes a new insolvency procedure, the acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos, an extrajudicial debt workout coordinated by a public mediator. If no agreement is reached between the debtor and her creditors, a judicial bankruptcy procedure (concurso consecutivo) will follow, but the negotiation attempt will increase the fresh start: no ordinary credit will have to be reimbursed.|$|R
30|$|The study further reveals some {{factors that}} {{significantly}} influence farmers’ resource use abilities. One {{of the significant}} factors associated with efficiency is the off-farm work variable. Because cotton production requires full concentration all year, farmers who engage in off-farm work achieved a lower efficiency. This {{is especially true for}} those who have university and college educations. The study also finds that easier access to agricultural credit has a positive impact on resource utilization. Notably, providing <b>privileged</b> <b>credit</b> {{in the context of the}} state quota system helps farmers to purchase the required inputs and use them on time, thus avoiding possible crop losses. The findings also show that big farms are more efficient in resource use. Thus, a state’s decision to consolidate farms further is plausible. The model’s results further point to some other variables that improve TE, including access to adequate irrigation, frequency of weeding, application of organic manure, better WUA services, and renovated drainage systems. The study also confirmed that farmers’ knowledge attributes have the potential to impact the farmers’ resource use pattern. It is also interesting to note that formal education (university degree and educational background in agriculture) and informal education (participation in seminars) are associated with efficiency-improving results. Interestingly, the results indicate that a basic education is not sufficient to achieve higher efficiency in cotton production. In this regard, a state policy to establish colleges in rural and remote areas is well placed under the current situation and brings about significant returns in the near future.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a new dataset {{to examine}} {{the issue of how}} the design of {{privatization}} affects outcomes. Prior studies of Czech privatization have focused largely on how the widespread distribution of shares through vouchers may have motivated the new owners to strip assets from privatized firms. We find evidence for static asset stripping, but also for what Akerlof and Romer (1993) call looting borrowing heavily with no intent to repay in order to use the loans for private purposes. This occurred because the larger privatized companies had <b>privileged</b> access to <b>credit</b> from state controlled banks that had little incentive to enforce debt contracts. This finding has significant policy implications, namely that financial incentives and regulation are as important as ownership structure in privatization design. 1...|$|R

Earlier studies of privatization in the Czech Republic focused largely on how the broad distribution of shares through vouchers may have motivated the new owners to strip assets from the privatized firms. The authors find evidence for static asset stripping, but also for what Akerlof and Romer (1993) call looting - borrowing heavily with no intent to repay and using the loans for private purposes.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the propensity of Chinese publicly listed firms {{to invest in}} response to financial factors, according to the a priori degree of a firm’s information problems: industry sector, ownership structure and firm size. The firms in primary and tertiary industries {{are found to be}} liquidity-constrained in their investment decisions. The investment-cash flow sensitivity of the firms in secondary industry indicates that they lost <b>privileged</b> access to <b>credit</b> in the course of China’s market transition. However, we find no evidence that financial liberalization resulted in an easing of financing constraints for small- and medium-sized firms. Our result indicates that agency problems, stemming from a state-controlling pyramidal ownership structure, are responsible for the misallocation of internal funds. The importance of bankruptcy and agency costs in relation to debt finance for certain types of borrowers reflects the transitional nature of the financial environment facing Chinese firms...|$|R
5000|$|Set in a dystopian future {{where much}} of the {{environment}} has been ruined, the government is run by corporations, and only the <b>privileged</b> have enough <b>credits</b> to live a life of luxury in sprawling mansions in the country. Everyone else is forced to live in ruined cities, where they face starvation, or CorpCities, where they are all but slaves. Lia Kahn is one of the privileged, until an unexpected car accident leaves her fatally injured. Her family decides to enlist the services of BioMax, a company that takes scans of Lia's brain and downloads her mind into a mechanical body, known to the general public as [...] "skinners," [...] despite preferring to be called [...] "mechs." [...] Lia must deal with the trials of a new type of existence, including the revulsion society feels for [...] "skinners," [...] the prospect of immortality, and the balance of her new life with her former one.|$|R

40|$|The marked {{development}} in stock {{markets and the}} commercialisation of banking sector {{in the course of}} economic transition may have influenced the investment behaviours of Chinese companies. Using company accounts data in the period of 1998 - 2004, we estimate an error-corrected accelerator model to analyze how these changes alter the financing decisions on fixed investment of the newly-corporatized Chinese firms. The results show that the market-oriented reform measures that China adopted have influenced the propensity of listed firms to invest by industry, ownership and size. For primary and tertiary industries, we find, as in well-developed market economies, that firms are liquidity constrained in their investment decisions. For secondary industry, the reliance on internal funds increased, consistent with the interpretation that the firms lost <b>privileged</b> access to <b>credit</b> in the course of financial deregulation. Findings support the hypothesis that state-holding structure and associated corporate governance are responsible for managerial-discretion problems in China. However, we didn’t find evidence that financial liberalization resulted in an easing of financing constraints for some, in particular, small firms, suggesting that the government’s change in focus towards SMEs has not been effective over the sample period. The study also shows that demand-pull variables are important factors in the determination of investment behaviours, suggesting that firms started to behave consistently with profit maximization. The findings reflect the transitional nature of the Chinese corporate environment...|$|R
