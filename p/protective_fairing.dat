5000|$|The Mystery Ship {{influenced}} the fully faired look of modern sportbikes. Cycle World said this of the design: The Mystery Ship's styling certainly did anticipate {{attempts by the}} Japanese manufacturers to integrate a <b>protective</b> <b>fairing</b> with the bodywork of sporting machines. Honda's technological tour de force 1981 CX500 Turbo was the bike that followed most closely in its wake. Not far behind were the turbo bikes of Yamaha, Suzuki, and Kawasaki--all of which were attempts to merge style and rider protection with performance. And this trend, when crossed with the full-fairing style of GP bikes, gave us the look of today's sportbikes. American Motorcyclist said the Mystery Ship [...] "set the stage for specialty motorcycle companies like Bimota." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) is {{the major}} ma-chinery used in the Internet for fair {{scheduling}} of application packets. Various Internet applications, in particular Web appli-cations are inherently bursty. In this work we show that WFQ cannot provide fair service to bursty applications {{in the presence of}} aggressive users, (users who exploit the network by placing continuous high demands on it). We demonstrate that the pure WFQ mechanism cannot protect the typical bursty user from the aggressive users and thus is doomed to receive poor QoS. We propose a new WFQ-like mechanism called Aggressiveness <b>Protective</b> <b>Fair</b> Queuing (APFQ) that solves this problem by dynamically decreasing the weight of the aggressive users. The actual weight used for a flow is a dynamically varying variable reflecting the past bandwidth usage of the flow. We show that under heavy load (deterministic model), APFQ significantly restricts the amount of traffic an aggressive user can send and bounds it to at most twice the amount of traffic sent by a polite (regular) user. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of APFQ under a stochastic environment. I...|$|R
30|$|When fillers {{are poor}} or fair matches to the {{perpetrator}} (Fig.  2, panels a and b), {{the number of}} fillers has no effect. But as the fillers become stronger competitors (panel c), we see evidence consistent with the claims of filler siphoning theory (note that Fig.  2, panel c is similar in parameter values to Fig.  1, panel b). However, the claim by Wells, Smalarz, et al. (2015, p. 315) that fillers should be more <b>protective</b> in <b>fair</b> than in biased lineups was not apparent. Instead, fillers have different consequences for fair (Fig.  1) and biased (Fig.  2) lineups. When the innocent suspect is just another filler (SSP[*]=[*]SSF, as in Fig.  1), increasing lineup size {{does not affect the}} discriminability of the different lineup sizes, it only serves to truncate the ROCs. But when the innocent suspect is a better match to memory than the fillers (biased lineups), increasing the number of fillers did increase the level of the ROC as lineup size increases (although it also truncates it).|$|R
40|$|Professor Bratton {{examines}} judicial {{regulation of}} issuer-bondholder {{conflicts of interest}} within three different, but closely related doctrinal frameworks: neoclassical contract interpretation; contract avoidance; and corporate law fiduciary restraint. After discussing the elements of convertible bond valuation and their interaction with issuer actions giving rise to conflicts of interest, he evaluates the case for judicial intervention to protect bondholder interests. He concludes that ·bondholder <b>protective</b> intervention is <b>fair</b> and tolerably efficient, provided it is kept {{within the bounds of}} contract interpretation. But he finds that more aggressive judicial intervention under the frameworks of contract avoidance and fiduciary restraint carries an unnecessary risk of causing substantial costs in the marketplace. Thus, he advocates that intervention under the latter two approaches be avoided...|$|R
50|$|When {{launched}} by the Ariane 4 the satellite would be mounted to a SPELDA adapter (a satellite payload carrier system), which is mounted {{on the top of}} the Ariane 4 rocket. A <b>protective</b> shroud or <b>fairing</b> covers the satellite and upper stage and protects it from aerodynamic forces (high speed air flow) during launch. The fairing is jettisoned when the rocket has reached the upper atmosphere and the aerodynamic forces are no longer significant. When the upper stage has finished firing and is coasting, the upper stage (and satellite) was spun up to 5 rpm prior to release of the satellite. This provides initial stability for the satellite after release from the rocket upper stage. The Ariane 4 put the Intelsat VI satellites directly into a transfer orbit. Ground commands would fire the apogee engines for circularizing of the initial orbit and stabilization at the desired geostationary orbital location. Ground commands would then also be used to command the satellite to spin up to its normal spin rate.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present an {{overview}} of the flight test objectives and performance of the Orion Launch Abort System during Exploration Flight Test- 1. Exploration Flight Test- 1, the first flight test of the Orion spacecraft, was managed and led by the Orion prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, and launched atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. This flight test was a two-orbit, high-apogee, high-energy entry, low-inclination test mission used to validate and test systems critical to crew safety. This test included the first flight test of the Launch Abort System preforming Orion nominal flight mission critical objectives. NASA is currently designing and testing the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV). Orion will serve as NASA's new exploration vehicle to carry astronauts to deep space destinations and safely return them to earth. The Orion spacecraft is composed of four main elements: the Launch Abort System, the Crew Module, the Service Module, and the Spacecraft Adapter (Fig. 1). The Launch Abort System (LAS) provides two functions; during nominal launches, the LAS provides protection for the Crew Module from atmospheric loads and heating during first stage flight and during emergencies provides a reliable abort capability for aborts that occur within the atmosphere. The Orion Launch Abort System (LAS) consists of an Abort Motor to provide the abort separation from the Launch Vehicle, an Attitude Control Motor to provide attitude and rate control, and a Jettison Motor for crew module to LAS separation (Fig. 2). The jettison motor is used during a nominal launch to separate the LAS from the Launch Vehicle (LV) early in the flight of the second stage when it is no longer needed for aborts {{and at the end of}} an LAS abort sequence to enable deployment of the crew module's Landing Recovery System. The LAS also provides a Boost <b>Protective</b> Cover <b>fairing</b> that shields the crew module from debris and the aero-thermal environment during ascent. Although the Orion Program has tested a number of the critical systems of the Orion spacecraft on the ground, the launch environment cannot be replicated completely on Earth. A number of flight tests have been conducted and are planned to demonstrate the performance and enable certification of the Orion Spacecraft. Exploration Flight Test 1, the first flight test of the Orion spacecraft, was successfully flown on December 5, 2014 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 37. Orion's first flight was a two-orbit, high-apogee, high-energy entry, low-inclination test mission used to validate and test systems critical to crew safety, such as heat shield performance, separation events, avionics and software performance, attitude control and guidance, parachute deployment and recovery operations. One of the key separation events tested during this flight was the nominal jettison of the LAS. Data from this flight will be used to verify the function of the jettison motor to separate the Launch Abort System from the crew module so it can continue on with the mission. The LAS nominal jettison event on Exploration Flight Test 1 occurred at six minutes and twenty seconds after liftoff (See Fig. 3). The abort motor and attitude control motors were inert for Exploration Flight Test 1, since the mission did not require abort capabilities. A suite of developmental flight instrumentation was included on the flight test to provide data on spacecraft subsystems and separation events. This paper will focus on the flight test objectives and performance of the LAS during ascent and nominal jettison. Selected LAS subsystem flight test data will be presented and discussed in the paper. Exploration Flight Test - 1 will provide critical data that will enable engineering to improve Orion's design and reduce risk for the astronauts it will protect as NASA continues to move forward on its human journey to Mars. The lessons learned from Exploration Flight Test 1 and the other Flight Test Vehicles will certainly contribute to the vehicle architecture of a human-rated space launch vehicle...|$|R
