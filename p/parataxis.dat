He says that words that appear to form a clause in the example are actually a separate unembedded sentence, which, in context, expresses the same {{thought that would be}} expressed by a clause in English. He gives evidence for this based on the lack of specialized words for clause-formation, the pattern of coreferring tokens in the purported clause-constructions, and examples where the purported clause is separated {{from the rest of the}} sentence by other complete sentences.|$|E

500|$|The {{simplicity}} of his style is deceptive. Bloom writes {{that it is}} the effective use of <b>parataxis</b> that elevates Hemingway's prose. Drawing on the Bible, Walt Whitman and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Hemingway wrote in deliberate understatement and he heavily incorporated <b>parataxis,</b> which in some cases almost becomes cinematic. His skeletal sentences were crafted in response to Henry James's observation that World WarI had [...] "used up words," [...] explains Hemingway scholar Zoe Trodd, who writes that his style is similar to a [...] "multi-focal" [...] photographic reality. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic [...] "snapshot" [...] style creates a collage of images. Hemingway omits internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) in favor of short declarative sentences, which are meant to build, as events build, {{to create a sense of}} the whole. He also uses techniques analogous to cinema, such as cutting quickly from one scene to the next, or splicing one scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap as though responding to instructions from the author and create three-dimensional prose. Biographer James Mellow writes that the bullfighting scenes are presented with a crispness and clarity that evoke the sense of a newsreel.|$|E

[...] Marven notes that Müller's collages, which the critic says are [...] "central to Müller's œuvre," [...] show the same fragmentation, and says that her [...] "increasingly readable" [...] prose, coupled with recent collages moving toward narrative, might suggest that there is [...] "a possibility of overcoming trauma."(Grazziella Predoui also noted that Müller's prose is developing from <b>parataxis</b> toward more complicated syntax.) ...|$|E
