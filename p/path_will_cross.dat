2500|$|This proof {{depends on}} a trick known as André's {{reflection}} method, which was originally used in connection with Bertrand's ballot theorem. (The reflection principle has been widely attributed to Désiré André, but his method did not actually use reflections; and the reflection method is a variation due to Aebly and Mirimanoff.) We count the paths which start and end on the diagonal of the n × n grid. All such paths have [...] n rightward and n upward steps. Since we can choose which of the 2n steps are upward (or, equivalently, rightward) ones, there are [...] total monotonic paths of this type. A bad <b>path</b> <b>will</b> <b>cross</b> the main diagonal and touch the next higher (fatal) diagonal (depicted red in the illustration). We flip {{the portion of the}} path occurring after that touch about that fatal diagonal, as illustrated; this geometric operation amounts to interchanging all the rightward and upward steps after that touch. In the section of the path that is not reflected, there is one more upward step than rightward steps, so the remaining section of the bad path has one more rightward than upward step (because it ends on the main diagonal). When this portion of the path is reflected, it will also have one more upward step than rightward steps. Since there are still 2n steps, there must now be n + 1 upward steps and n - 1 rightward steps. So, instead of reaching the target (n,n), all bad paths (after the portion of the path is reflected) will end in location (n - 1, n + 1). As any monotonic path in the n - 1 × n + 1 grid must meet the fatal diagonal, this reflection process sets up a bijection between the bad paths of the original grid and the monotonic paths of this new grid because the reflection process is reversible. The number of bad paths is therefore, ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the DLR-project "Wetter und Fliegen" is to develop and analyse new flight control and {{guidance}} functions in order to avoid or to mitigate the impact of wake vortex encounters. Two strategies are addressed in the project: One is an automatic impact attenuation system detecting that the aircraft is flying through a wake vortex and counteracting the effects of the wake encounter by giving corresponding commands to the flight control system. The other system detects that the aircraft flight <b>path</b> <b>will</b> <b>cross</b> a wake vortex in the near future and calculates an evasion trajectory. The corresponding evasion manoeuvre to avoid wake vortex encounter may be flown manually by the pilot or automatically by the aircraft autopilot. A concept for the human machine interface is presented in this report for both system approaches. It deals also with the operational aspects of such systems from "a cockpit point of view". As flight tests within the project are planned with the A 320 -ATRA research aircraft future systems have to be integrated in an "Airbus-like" cockpit environment. Therefore it is assumed that the Wake Vortex Impact Attenuation and Evasion systems are additional functions of a conventional Airbus A 320 flight control and guidance system. Design of the human machine interface is influenced by existing systems like TCAS, wind shear protection function and flight envelope protections. A main source of information for this report was the A 320 Flight Crew Operating Manual and designs developed in the European project FLYSAFE. The report starts with a short overview of the conventional A 320 indicating displays in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 operational concept and displays of the Wake Impact Attenuation System are explained. This is followed by an operational description and indications of the Wake Avoidance System in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 draws some conclusions about the design concept presented in this report. Appendix A lists all sections of the Flight Crew Operations Manual affected by the intergration of a Wake Vortex Impact Attenuation and a Wake Avoidance System. An example of a lateral evasion manoeuvre activated by the Wake Avoidance System is illustrated and explained in Appendix B...|$|E

50|$|A useful type of out-of-plane {{maneuver}} {{employed to}} decrease AOT are various barrel rolls called displacement rolls, {{in order to}} shift the aircraft laterally from its projected flight path onto a new flight path. By controlling the roll rate the pilot can control the degree of displacement.

By displacing the turn, the two aircraft's flight <b>paths</b> <b>will</b> eventually <b>cross.</b> The AOT <b>will</b> then decrease until {{the nose of the}} attacker's aircraft points momentarily at the defender, and then ahead of the defender.

40|$|Long {{distance}} {{road and}} rail transportation of hazardous materials in Europe often include the passage through tunnels. Generally speaking, road and rail transportation of such products is ruled by ADR and RID codes, respectively; however, these documents {{do not provide}} any indications related {{to the passage of}} vehicles carrying dangerous goods through tunnels. As a matter of fact, a study concerning road tunnels (OECD, 1997) showed that, in most of the 21 investigated Countries, no general code exists, but only a few regulations relevant to specific tunnels: hazardous materials are divided into classes, whose passage in the tunnel may be free, limited or forbidden. It is clear that the subject is rather complex and that a sound approach to the problem should be based on risk analysis. In fact, forbidding to hazardous materials the passage through tunnels, from one hand will increase the safety of tunnel users, but, on the other one, will submit to additional risk the population living or travelling along the alternative (and, usually, long) route followed by the vehicle to avoid the passage through tunnels; generally, these alternative <b>paths</b> <b>will</b> <b>cross</b> a number of urban sites where the consequences of an accident may affect a greater number of people with respect to tunnel users. The paper will present some comparison between the transport of different hazardous materials along possible alternative road and rail route including or not including tunnels, based on the calculation of the respective societal risk curves. To this end a software for risk assessment and management, TrHazGis (Bubbico et al, 2004), will be used. The tool, which presently include all needed information (probabilities and impact areas of the accidental scenarios, local incident rates, weather conditions, on-route and off-route population) for open sections, will be modified to account for the values of these parameters in tunnels. In particular, the impact areas will be calculated for some tunnels typologies using simplified models (OECD, 2003), and specific values of incident rate, accidental scenarios probabilities and on-route population will be estimated. The study will give useful information to properly select minimum risk routes for hazardous materials transportation, when the passage through tunnels may be involve...|$|R

30|$|The {{equipment}} {{present in}} a data center, including the LAN devices, can be more realistically identified {{than the number of}} devices in a transport network to another data center. For the former we chose the same internal architecture for both data centers being compared; this allows us to purely focus on the sustainability of both. The latter instead depends not only on the type of network, Internet or light path, but also on the geographical location of both data centers. Therefore, our framework makes use of network models {{depending on the type of}} network and on the location of both endpoints to give an estimate of the minimal number of hops in the network. Furthermore, the geographical location of both endpoints determines the possible countries crossed by the shortest path transport network. These estimates make it possible to attach a CO 2 emission to the transport network. Data on the energy types used by different European countries is available. If the transport network e.g., connects a data center in the Netherlands with one in Austria, a considerable part of the shortest <b>path</b> network <b>will</b> <b>cross</b> Germany. So the energy cost can be divided in three contributions, according to the distance spanned in each of the countries crossed. For each country we can calculate a mean CO 2 emission based on the types of energy sources used in that country [6 – 11].|$|R

40|$|Motion {{paths of}} cable-driven hexapods must {{carefully}} be planned {{to ensure that}} the lengths and tensions of all cables remain within accept-able limits, for a given wrench applied to the platform. The cables cannot go slack –to keep the control of the robot – nor excessively tight –to prevent cable breakage – even in the pres-ence of bounded perturbations of the wrench. This paper proposes a path planning method that accommodates such constraints simulta-neously. Given two configurations of the robot, the method attempts to connect them through a path that, at any point, allows the cables to counteract any wrench lying in a predefined uncertainty region. The feasible C-space is placed in correspondence with a smooth mani-fold, which facilitates the definition of a contin-uation strategy to search this space systemat-ically from one configuration, until the second configuration is found, or path non-existence is proved at the resolution of the search. The force Jacobian is full rank everywhere on the C-space, which implies that the computed <b>paths</b> <b>will</b> naturally avoid <b>crossing</b> the forward sin-gularity locus of the robot. The adjustment of tension limits, moreover, allows to maintain a meaningful clearance relative to such locus.
