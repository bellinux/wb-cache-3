The combination of the Xbox and DirectX technologies proved especially popular due to the two systems' architectural similarities, as well as their common set of programming tools. Multimedia and art assets, which account for a greater proportion of the development budget than in the <b>past,</b> <b>are</b> easily transferable between multiple platforms.|$|E
