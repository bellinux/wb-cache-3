The interrelated {{geographic}} and temporal variability seen {{in more than}} seven years of tropical and subtropical upper tropospheric (215 hPa) ozone, carbon monoxide and cloud ice water content (IWC) observations by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) are presented.

40|$|International audienceTo better assess inter-annual {{variance}} {{changes in}} ozone time series, we study and propose a statistical procedure based on {{recent advances in}} wavelet multi-resolution analysis. This approach, novel {{to the field of}} ozone analysis, has the advantages of detecting significant changes in variance and of characterizing the distribution of these changes, including not only their timings but also their strengths. As a test case for our method, we study total ozone column time series from the TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) Version 7 in the Arctic region over the period 1981 – 1992. This statistical procedure allows us to analyse the well-known winter–spring transition and the inter-annual variability behaviour. For this specific example, two distinct types of winter–spring transition can be clearly identified for the ozone series. As expected from dynamical studies of the vortex evolution, the first type is constituted of the years for which there exists a very abrupt and temporally localized ozone variability change. More precisely, we detect a significant <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> variance at two multi-resolution wavelet levels. The second type is characterized by smooth ozone variance changes over time and space. Moreover, the Arctic vortex breakdown timing seems to occur, on average, 1 month earlier than our detected changes in ozone variability. These results suggest a potential link between these two phenomena...|$|E

Previously-reported phenomena such as the ozone "wave one" feature are clearly seen in the MLS observations, as is a double <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> abundance over tropical East Africa, with enhanced abundances in both May to June and September to November. While repeatable seasonal cycles are seen in many regions, they are often accompanied by significant interannual variability. Ozone seasonal cycles in the southern tropics and subtropics tend to be more distinct (i. e., annually repeatable) than in the northern. By contrast, carbon monoxide shows distinct seasonal cycles in many northern subtropical regions, notably from India to the Eastern Pacific. Deep convection (as indicated by large values of IWC) is typically associated with reductions in upper tropospheric ozone. Convection over polluted regions is seen to significantly enhance upper tropospheric carbon monoxide. While some regions show statistically significant correlations among ozone, carbon monoxide and IWC, simple correlations fall well short of accounting for the observed variability. The observed interrelated variations and metrics of annual and interannual variability described here represent a new resource for validation of atmospheric chemistry models...|$|E

The definitive version ("Ozone photochemistry and elevated isoprene during the UK heatwave of August 2003 ") is available from [URL]). A wide range of chemical and physical parameters have been observed {{over the course of}} a severe Europe-wide air pollution episode in August 2003. Detailed surface observations made at the rural perimeter edge of London, U. K. indicated significantly elevated levels of primary VOCs, ozone (> 110 ppb), other photochemical by-products such as PAN, HCHO, and higher oxygenates but not NOx. Reactive organic tracers in combination with surface Doppler wind radar and back trajectory analysis have been used to establish that initial rapid morning rises in O 3 during the episode were caused by entrainment of air from aloft, polluted on regional scales from mainland Europe. Total VOC reactivity to OH approximately doubled during this episode, with similar distribution between functional groups, but showing a temperature dependant exponentially increasing contribution from biogenic isoprene (max 1. 2 ppbV). In addition to entrainment of regional air pollution, ozone formation rates within the U. K. boundary layer on the day of observation have been determined using measured peroxy radicals in combination with other chemical data. Under episodic conditions total peroxy radicals in excess 120 pptV were observed in late afternoon with strong correlation to a later and higher <b>peak</b> <b>in</b> <b>ozone</b> when compared to non-episodic conditions. During the daytime under episodic conditions alkyl peroxy radical formation was dominated by PAN thermolysis, whose afternoon lifetime averaged only 18. 3 min, but which was sustained at a concentration greater than 750 pptV. Low episodic wind speeds resulted in a relatively small possible spatial footprint for emissions of reactive precursors to PAN, and a strong correlation between isoprene and PAN production rate suggest this species may have contributed to the later afternoon increases seen in surface O 3...|$|E

We investigated the following diseases, as coded in the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases: hypertensive disease (codes 401 - 405); ischemic heart disease (codes 410 - 414); other cardiac diseases, including heart failure (codes 426 - 428); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions, including bronchitis and asthma (codes 490 - 496); and pneumoconiosis and other lung diseases due to external agents (codes 500 - 507). We evaluated ozone data from air quality monitoring stations in the study area, together with data collected through HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model analysis of air mass circulation and synoptic-scale zonal wind from National Centers for Environmental Prediction data. High <b>ozone</b> levels <b>in</b> rural areas were attributed to the dispersion of pollutants induced by local circulation, as well as by mesoscale and synoptic scale processes. The fires of 2005 increased the levels of pollutants resulting from the direct emission of gases and particles into the atmosphere, especially when there were incoming frontal systems.

However, observations do not indicate any significant change <b>in</b> surface <b>ozone</b> levels since early 1990 s, except in the region of Zurich where there is a small negative trend. On the other hand, the model predictions match very well the spatial variability of the trends but the calculated trends are around 0. 5 ppb year(- 1) lower than those observed. This difference is similar to the background ozone increase as suggested by the long-term observations at the high Alpine station Jungfraujoch.

In summer, up to 84 % of long-term variations <b>in</b> <b>peak</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations may be accounted for by changes in the seasonally averaged daily maximum temperatures and seasonally averaged wind speeds. The <b>ozone</b> episodes <b>in</b> the Kanto region are dominated by three major patterns, of which Patterns I and II are regular summertime pressure patterns with a 26 % and 16 % frequency of occurrence, respectively. A detailed process analysis of ozone formation under urban heat island (UHI) at two areas in the Kanto region – urban and rural area – indicates that ozone formation is mainly controlled by chemistry, dry deposition, vertical transport, and horizontal transport processes. The groundlevel ozone concentrations are enhanced mainly by the vertical mixing of ozone-rich air from aloft, whereas dry deposition process mainly depletes ozone. Horizontal transport and chemistry processes play opposite roles in the net change of ozone concentration between the two areas. The results of numerical simulations also indicate that the sea breeze has significant effects on the ozone accumulation and distribution in the Kanto area. The high ozone was first observed in urban area and then was transported to the rural area by sea breeze.

Three episode types were identified that explain the conditions encountered: ''O 3 -South'', ''Cold Surge'' and ''O 3 -North''. These can be diagnosed {{from a combination of}} synoptic and basin observations based on whether the day was predominantly cloudy, or whether the O 3 <b>peak</b> was <b>in</b> the north or south of the basin. O 3 -South days have weak synoptic forcing due to an anti-cyclone over the eastern Pacific. Strong solar heating leads to northerly flows in the basin and an evening shift due to a gap flow from the south-east. <b>Peak</b> <b>ozone</b> concentrations are <b>in</b> the convergence zone in the south of the city.
