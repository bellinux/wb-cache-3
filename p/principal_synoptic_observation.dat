40|$|Abstract—Obtaining <b>synoptic</b> <b>observations</b> {{of dynamic}} ocean {{phenomena}} such as fronts, eddies, oxygen minimum zones and blooms has been challenging {{primarily due to}} the large spatial scales involved. Traditional methods of ob-servation with manned ships are expensive and, unless the vessel can survey at high-speed, unrealistic. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robotic platforms that have been making steady gains in sampling capabilities and impacting oceanographic observations especially in coastal areas. However, their reach is still limited by operating constraints related to their energy sources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently introduced in coastal and polar oceanographic experiments have added to the mix in observation strategy and methods. They offer a tantalizing opportunity to bridge such scales in operational oceanog-raphy by coordinating with AUVs in the water-column to get in-situ measurements. In this paper, we articulate the principal challenges in operating UAVs with AUVs making <b>synoptic</b> <b>observations</b> for such targeted water-column sampling. We {{do so in the}} context of autonomous control and operation for networked robotics and describe novel experiments while articulating the key challenges and lessons learned. I...|$|R

The first overwintering team at the Dome Fuji Station conducted year-round surface <b>synoptic</b> <b>observations</b> under extremely {{cold weather}} conditions which had not been experienced by any other Japanese project before. <b>Synoptic</b> <b>observation</b> data of surface pressure, temperature, wind direction, wind speed and flux of global solar radiation were automatically recorded every one minute. These automated observation data were obtained without trouble throughout the overwintering period. This was made possible by development of special instruments protected against frost and snow accretion, which had been the major difficulty in automated observation in the antarctic area. Visibility, total cloud amount, cloud forms, atmospheric phenomena and present weather conditions were visually observed everyday at 09, 15 and 21 o 2 ̆ 7 clock in local time. We obtained these visual observations year-round at Dome Fuji Station for the first time. During our one-year stay at the Station, from March 1995 to February 1996,an annual mean temperature of - 53. 9 ℃ was observed. The lowest temperature of - 79. 6 ℃ for this period was marked on 18 August 1995. Annual mean surface pressure was 598. 2 hPa and annual mean wind speed was 5. 8 m/s. Except in summer, a rather strong wind speed of about 6 m/s was steadily observed throughout the year and the gust ratio was very small. That was a distinctive characteristic of the wind at the Dome Fuji Station. No prevailing wind direction was observed at the Station. The most frequent surface wind direction of each month corresponded well with the monthly averaged geostrophic wind direction at 500 hPa height. Annual mean total cloud cover was about 40...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} drivers for this project is the {{requirement}} to complement other high-quality surface data-sets with surface wind data for use in climate change detection and attribution studies. The high-quality data may {{also be used to}} analyse trends in storminess. Investigations highlighted the following three issues: Over the last two decades Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) have been installed at a large number of locations over the Australian region. The majority of newly installed wind instruments are rotating cup anemometers (Synchrotac), in many cases replacing older types, such as pressure tube anemometers (Dines). The corresponding changes in instrumentation alone can significantly change the characteristics of observed wind speed. Daylight Saving Time (DST) is in effect in the majority of Australian States, typically for a period from late October to late March. During this period, observations are taken according to DST rather than Local Standard Time (LST). Observations taken one hour earlier (compared with LST) can significantly affect the measured wind speed relative to climatology at a particular time. Estimates of daily mean wind speed depend on the frequency of <b>synoptic</b> <b>observations.</b> The frequency of these observations typically increases towards {{the latter part of the}} record, in some cases from two observations (at 0900 and 1500) to eight observations a day (at three-hourly intervals).
