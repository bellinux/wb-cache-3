5000|$|Planning â€” general flight {{planning}} information, including flight plans and position reports, airspace, lists of significant new towers and other obstructions, chart updating, <b>preferred</b> <b>IFR</b> <b>routes,</b> and similar information.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} three {{standard}} service volumes (SSV): terminal, low, and high (standard service volumes {{do not apply to}} published instrument flight rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>routes).</b>|$|R
50|$|In United States aviation, tower {{en route}} control (TEC) is a {{collection}} of published low-altitude, short-distance <b>IFR</b> <b>routes</b> through large metropolitan areas that require no level of air traffic control higher than approach-control facilities.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{altitude}} limits of each route are not depicted on ordinary charts, the numbering system partially reveals this information. Routes are first designated as either VFR (VR) or <b>IFR</b> (IR) <b>routes.</b> Then, a numeric code identifies the individual route. A route with a 4-digit code contains no segment higher than 1,500 feet AGL, while a 3-digit code indicates {{that one or}} more segments of the route exist at altitudes higher than 1,500 feet AGL. [...] For example, the route VR1234 would indicate a VFR route exclusively below 1,500 feet AGL, while IR567 would indicate an <b>IFR</b> <b>route</b> {{with at least one}} segment higher than 1,500 feet AGL.|$|R
50|$|Legacy {{en route}} {{navigation}} aids required land-based sites where power was available and maintenance crews had access. This land-based system {{resulted in a}} traditional <b>IFR</b> <b>route</b> structure that was not optimized for the terrain or typical small aircraft users in Southeast Alaska. The technology that changed this and put the routes and approaches where they were needed, at low altitudes over the fjords, was the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).|$|R
50|$|The Polen Special is a low-wing {{monoplane}} with retractable conventional landing gear. The retractable gear is {{hydraulically operated}} from a T-33 sequencing valve with electric powered gear doors. The fuselage and wings are all aluminum with flush riveting. The ailerons and elevators use push-pull tubes, with cable {{control for the}} rudders. The aircraft is specifically designed to fly at high altitude on <b>IFR</b> <b>routes</b> with the pilot using supplemental oxygen to achieve maximum speed with the turbocharged engine.|$|R
50|$|WAAS {{provides}} the safety-critical navigation {{system that will}} allow the Capstone program to design airways and approaches where they can be best-used by the aviation industry in Southeast Alaska. Capstone utilized WAAS receivers in all participating aircraft. The WAAS signal was the basis for new <b>IFR</b> <b>routes</b> and procedures that were designed to serve low-flying aircraft throughout Southeast Alaska. The first air-carrier validation flights by Harris Air, located at Sitka, Alaska, took place in March 2005 and resulted in FAA approval.|$|R
50|$|Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) {{navigation}} {{is similar}} to Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight planning except that the task is generally made simpler {{by the use of}} special charts that show <b>IFR</b> <b>routes</b> from beacon to beacon with the lowest safe altitude (LSALT), bearings (in both directions) and distance marked for each <b>route.</b> <b>IFR</b> pilots may fly on other routes but they then have to do all of these calculations themselves with the LSALT calculation being the most difficult. The pilot then needs to look at the weather and minimum specifications for landing at the destination airport and the alternate requirements. The pilot must also comply with all the rules including their legal ability to use a particular instrument approach depending on how recently they last performed one.|$|R
40|$|Helicopter <b>IFR</b> <b>routes</b> at hub {{airports}} {{have been}} investigated in an air-traffic-control system simulation involving a piloted helicopter simulator, computer-generated air traffic, and air traffic controllers. Problems studied included: (1) pilot acceptance of the approach procedure and tracking accuracy; (2) ATC procedures for handling a mix of helicopter and fixed-wing traffic; and (3) utility of the Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) for the helicopter. Results indicate that the helicopter routes were pilot acceptable and were noninterfering with fixed-wing traffic. Merging and spacing maneuvers using CDTI were successfully {{carried out by the}} pilots, but controllers had some reservations concerning CDTI...|$|R
50|$|Class E {{airspace}} is delimited {{in different}} ways depending on its lower altitude limit. Airspace in this class that begins at the default altitude of 14500 ft MSL is not delimited. Class E airspace that begins at 1200 ft AGL is delimited by a broad, shaded cyan border. Class E airspace that begins at 700 ft AGL is delimited by a broad, shaded magenta border. Airspace in class E that begins at the surface is delimited by a thin, dashed magenta line (this type of class E is most often seen as an extension to class D airspace that facilitates control of <b>IFR</b> <b>routes</b> to and from an airport).|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of independent helicopter <b>IFR</b> <b>routes</b> at hub airports {{was investigated in}} a real time {{air traffic control system}} simulation involving a piloted helicopter simulator, computer generated air traffic, and air traffic controllers. The helicopter simulator was equipped to fly area navigation (RNAV) routes and microwave landing system approaches. Problems studied included: (1) pilot acceptance of the approach procedure and tracking accuracy; (2) ATC procedures for handling a mix of helicopter and fixed wing traffic; and (3) utility of the cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) for the helicopter in the hub airport environment. Results indicate that the helicopter routes were acceptable to the subject pilots and were noninterfering with fixed wing traffic. Merging and spacing maneuvers using CDTI were successfully carried out by the pilots, but controllers had some reservations concerning the acceptability of the CDTI procedures...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{exposes the}} procedures and results {{obtained for the}} design of a complete rotorcraft <b>IFR</b> <b>route</b> with PinS procedures under the framework of the HEDGE NEXT project, which is framed into the European 7 th Framework Programme and the European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Agency activities. One of the project goals is completing the operational implementation of EGNOS operations into the rotorcraft domain, by supporting the certification of vehicles and validation of EGNOS enhanced operations from different operators spread over Europe. The main objective of this project is to design PinS approach at HELICSA's Albacete heliport, PinS departure at Muchamiel heliport and the <b>IFR</b> <b>route</b> joining these procedures. The procedure design process is performed under the highest levels of integrity, so the design itself and its associated data could be delivered to an AIP manager for publication. To achieve the objective, the first task was to review the current regulation and draft documents concerning the design of procedures for rotorcrafts. On the other hand, it was necessary to make some research of on-going projects addressing these or similar tasks. The design of the procedures was made in accordance with ICAO Doc 8168 and the available draft material in the IFPP working papers. CAD, spread sheet tools and GIS software were used to draw and keep record and control of the calculations, respectively. The existing spread sheets, used to obtain different parameters of the segments of the procedure, were improved with the formulae of the ICAO Doc 8168 and with new custom functions with the objective of automatizing the calculations to design the desired procedure. The obtained results show that the goal of defining EGNOS based procedures has been achieved. The approach's OCA/H was fixed at 2750 (520) feet. The departure's MCA was fixed at 2650 feet. It is expected that the above results may be improved in the future due to the open issues identified along the procedure design process...|$|R
50|$|A STAR is an ATC-coded <b>IFR</b> arrival <b>route</b> {{established}} for application to arriving IFR aircraft destined for certain airports. Area navigation (RNAV) STAR/FMSP procedures for arrivals serve {{the same purpose}} but are used only by aircraft equipped with FMS or GPS. The purpose of both is to simplify clearance delivery procedures and facilitate transition between en route and instrument approach procedures.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{published}} procedure, the greater {{of these two}} altitudes is the altitude which must be adhered to during that segment, and is called the Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA). However, on an <b>IFR</b> en <b>route</b> chart, an asterisk appears next to the MOCA if {{there is also a}} MRA on that part of the route that uses a significantly higher altitude. One may choose to fly the lower MOCA altitude, but must keep in mind navaid reception is unlikely. One may do this if utilizing GPS and does not require navaids to navigate and would like the lower altitude.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{a minimum}} {{crossing}} altitude, or MCA, {{is the lowest}} altitude at which a navigational fix can be crossed when entering or continuing along an airway that will allow an aircraft to clear all obstacles while carrying out a normal climb to the required minimum en <b>route</b> <b>IFR</b> altitude (MEA) of the airway in question beyond the fix.|$|R
25|$|Air Wisconsin Flight 671 was a {{regularly}} scheduled flight from Chicago, Illinois, to Appleton, Wisconsin, with a stopover at Sheboygan County Memorial Airport west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Operating a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, it departed Chicago at 9:28 a.m. CDT on June 29, 1972, bound for Sheboygan under an instrument flight rules (<b>IFR)</b> plan; en <b>route,</b> {{the flight crew}} abandoned its IFR plan and completed {{the first leg of}} the flight under VFR.|$|R
50|$|A Military Training Route is a {{specific}} route allowing high speed, low-level flight by military aircraft for training purposes. Specifically, these routes allow participating military aircraft to exceed the normal 250 knot speed limit which applies to all aircraft operating below 10,000 feet MSL. MTRs are depicted on VFR sectional charts and <b>IFR</b> low-altitude en <b>route</b> charts to assist pilots in locating and avoiding them, but nonparticipating pilots are not restricted from flying within an MTR.|$|R
