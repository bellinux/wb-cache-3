40|$|Abstract: The {{relatively}} {{rapid development}} of microbial resistance after {{the entry of}} every new antimicrobial into the marketplace necessitates a constant supply of new agents to maintain effective pharmacotherapy. Despite extensive efforts to identify novel lead compounds from molecular targets, only the <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (PDIs) have shown any real promise, with some advancing to phase I human trials. Bacterial <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase,</b> which catalyzes {{the removal of the}} N-formyl group from N-terminal methionine following translation, is essential for bacterial protein synthesis, growth, and survival. The majority of PDIs are pseudopeptide hydroxamic acids and two of these (IV BB- 83698 and oral NVP LBM- 415) entered phase I human trials. However, agents to the present have suffered from major potential liabilities. Their in vitro activity has been limited to gram-positive aerobes and some anaerobes and has been quite modest against the majority of such species (MIC 90 values ranging from 1 – 8 mg/L). They have exerted bacteriostatic, not bacteriocidal, activity, thus reducing their potential usefulness in the management of serious infections in the immunocompromised. The relative ease with which microorganisms have been able to develop resistance and the multiple available mechanisms of resistance (mutations in fmt, defB, folD genes; AcrAB/TolC efflux pump; overexpression of <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase)</b> are worrisome. These could portend a short timespan of efficacy after marketing. Despite these current liabilities, further pursuit of more potent and broader spectrum PDIs which are less susceptible to bacterial mechanisms of resistance is still warranted...|$|R

40|$|Previous genetic {{analysis}} of Haemophilus influenzae revealed two mechanisms associated with decreased susceptibility {{to the novel}} <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> LBM 415 : AcrAB-TolC-mediated efflux and Fmt bypass, resulting from mutations in the pump repressor gene acrR and in the fmt gene, respectively. We have isolated an additional mutant, CDS 23 (LBM 415 MIC, 64 μg/ml versus 4 μg/ml against the parent strain NB 65044) that lacks mutations in the acrR or fmt structural genes or in the gene encoding Def, the intracellular target of LBM 415. Western immunoblot analysis, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and tryptic digestion combined with mass spectrometric identification showed that the Def protein was highly overexpressed in the mutant strain. Consistent with this, real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed {{a significant increase in}} def transcript titer. No mutations were found in the region upstream of def that might account for altered expression; however, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggested that a genetic rearrangement of the region containing def had occurred. Using a combination of PCR, sequencing, and Southern blot analyses, it was determined that the def gene had undergone copy number amplification, explaining the high level of target protein expression.

Insertional inactivation of the H. influenzae acrB or tolC gene in strain NB 65044 (Rd strain KW 20) increased susceptibility to LBM 415, confirming a role for the AcrAB-TolC pump in determining resistance. Consistent with this, sequencing of a PCR fragment generated with primers flanking the acrRA region from an LBM 415 -hypersusceptible H. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acrA. Inactivation of acrB or tolC in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to LBM 415 (MIC of 16 μg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. Examination of acrR, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. Supporting this, NB 65044 acrR mutants selected by exposure to LBM 415 at 8 μg/ml had susceptibilities to LBM 415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in the fmt gene (encoding formyl {{methionine}} transferase) that eliminate formylation of initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(i)) confer {{resistance to the}} novel antibiotic class of <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (PDFIs) while concomitantly reducing bacterial fitness. Here we show in Salmonella typhimurium that novel mutations in initiation factor 2 (IF 2) located outside the initiator tRNA binding domain can partly restore fitness of fmt mutants without loss of antibiotic resistance. Analysis of initiation of protein synthesis in vitro showed that with non-formylated Met-tRNA(i) IF 2 mutants initiated much faster than wild-type IF 2, whereas with formylated fMet-tRNA(i) the initiation rates were similar. Moreover, the increase in initiation rates with Met-tRNA(i) conferred by IF 2 mutations in vitro correlated well {{with the increase in}} growth rate conferred by the same mutations in vivo, suggesting that the mutations in IF 2 compensate formylation deficiency by increasing the rate of in vivo initiation with Met-tRNA(i). IF 2 mutants had also a high propensity for erroneous initiation with elongator tRNAs in vitro, which could account for their reduced fitness in vivo in a formylation-proficient strain.

40|$|An assay was {{developed}} to determine the activity of <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> (PDF) <b>inhibitors</b> under conditions {{as close as possible}} to the physiological situation. The assay principle is the detection of N-terminal [35 S]methionine labeling of a protein that contains no internal methionine. If PDF is active, the deformylation of the methionine renders the peptide a substrate for methionine aminopeptidase, resulting in the removal of the N-terminal methionine label. In the presence of a PDF inhibitor, the deformylation is blocked so that the N-formylated peptide is not processed and the label is detected. Using this assay, it is possible to determine the PDF activity under near-physiological conditions in a cell-free transcription-translation system as well as in intact bacterial cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} P. aeruginosa PAO 1 to the <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (PDF-I) LBM 415 was {{mediated by the}} MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM efflux pumps, the latter of which was strongly induced by LBM 415. Single-step exposure of PAO 1 deleted for mexAB-oprM (therefore lacking both MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM functions) to PDF-Is selected for nfxB mutants, which express the MexCD-OprJ efflux pump, indicating that these compounds are also substrates for this pump. Selection of resistant mutants by use of levels of LBM 415 greater than that accommodated by efflux yielded two additional groups of mutations, in the methionyl-tRNAfmet formyltransferase (fmt) and folD genes. Both mechanisms are known to impose an in vitro growth deficit (also observed here), presumably due to impairment of protein synthesis. We surmised that this inherent impairment of protein synthesis would upregulate expression of mexXY in a fashion similar to upregulation by LBM 415 or by ribosome inhibitory compounds. Transcriptional profiling and/or mexX::lux promoter fusion analysis revealed that fmt and folD mutants were strongly upregulated for mexXY and another gene known to be required for upregulation of the pump, PA 5471. Complementation of the fmt mutation in trans reversed this constitutive expression. This supports the notion that MexXY has a natural physiological function responding to impairment of ribosome function or protein synthesis and that fmt mutation (Fmt bypass) and folD mutation generate the intracellular mexXY-inducing signal...|$|E
40|$|Deformylase inhibitors {{belong to}} a novel {{antibiotic}} class that targets peptide deformylase, a bacterial enzyme that removes the formyl group from N-terminal methionine in nascent polypeptides. Using the bacterium Salmonella enterica, we isolated mutants with resistance toward the <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> actinonin. Resistance mutations were identified in two genes that are required for the formylation of methionyl (Met) initiator tRNA (tRNAi) fMet: the fmt gene encoding the enzyme methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase and the folD gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate-dehydrogenase and -cyclohydrolase. In the absence of antibiotic, these resistance mutations conferred a fitness cost that was manifested as a reduced growth rate in laboratory medium and in mice. By serially passaging the low-fitness mutants in growth medium without antibiotic, the fitness costs could be partly ameliorated either by intragenic mutations in the fmt/folD genes or by extragenic compensatory mutations. Of the extragenically compensated fmt mutants, approximately one-third carried amplifications of the identical, tandemly repeated metZ and metW genes, encoding tRNAi. The increase in metZW gene copy number varied from 5 - to 40 -fold and {{was accompanied by a}} similar increase in tRNAi levels. The rise in tRNAi level compensated for the lack of methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase activity and allowed translation initiation to proceed with nonformylated methionyl tRNAi.

GSK 1322322 demonstrated a uniform activity against the intracellular forms of all S. aureus strains tested, disregarding their resistance phenotypes, with a maximal relative efficacy (Emax) of a 0. 5 to 1 log 10 CFU decrease compared to the original inoculum within 24 h and a static concentration (Cs) close to its MIC in broth. Influx and efflux were very fast (< 5 min to equilibrium), and accumulation was about 4 -fold, with no or a mini-mal effect of the broad-spectrum eukaryotic efflux transporter inhibitors gemfibrozil and verapamil. GSK 1322322 was recovered in the cell-soluble fraction and was dissociated from the main subcellular organelles and from bacteria (in infected cells). The results of this study show that GSK 1322322, as a typical novel deformylase inhibitor, may act against intracellular forms of S. aureus. They also suggest that GSK 1322322 has the ability to freely diffuse into and out of eukaryotic cells as well as within sub-cellular compartments...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of community-acquired pneumonia. We {{evaluated}} the efficacy of LBM 415, a novel <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> antimicrobial agent, for the treatment of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in a mouse model. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated once with 107 CFU of M. pneumoniae. Groups of mice were treated with LBM 415 (50 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo subcutaneously daily for 13 days, starting 24 h after inoculation. Groups of mice were evaluated at the baseline; at days of treatment 1, 3, 6, and 13; and at 7 days after treatment. The MIC of LBM 415 against M. pneumoniae was < 0. 005 μg/ml. LBM 415 -treated mice had significantly lower bronchoalveolar lavage fluid M. pneumoniae concentrations than placebo-treated mice on days 6 and 13 of treatment. Compared with placebo treatment, therapy with LBM 415 significantly decreased lung histopathology scores at days 3, 6, and 13 of treatment and at 7 days after treatment. Airway obstruction was significantly lower in LBM 415 -treated mice than in placebo-treated mice on days 1, 3, and 6 of treatment and after 7 days of therapy, while airway hyperresponsiveness was significantly lower only on day 3 of therapy. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 12, KC (functional IL- 8), monocyte chemotactic protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α, monokine induced by IFN-γ, and IFN-inducible protein 10 were significantly reduced in LBM 415 -treated mice compared with the levels in placebo-treated mice. There were no differences in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10 between the two groups of mice. LBM 415 therapy had beneficial microbiologic, histologic, respiratory, and immunologic effects on acute murine M. pneumoniae pneumonia...|$|E
40|$|LBM 415 is an {{antibacterial}} agent {{belonging to the}} <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> class of compounds. It has previously been shown to demonstrate good activity in vitro against a range of pathogens. In this study, the in vivo efficacy of LBM 415 was evaluated in various mouse infection models. We investigated activity against a systemic infection model caused by intraperitoneal inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin [meticillin] susceptible [MSSA] and methicillin resistant [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin susceptible [PSSP] and multidrug resistant [MDRSP]), a thigh infection model caused by intramuscular injection of MRSA, and a lung infection produced by intranasal inoculation of PSSP. In the systemic MSSA and MRSA infections, LBM 415 was equivalent to linezolid and vancomycin. In the systemic PSSP infection, LBM 415 was equivalent to linezolid, whereas against systemic MDRSP infection, the LBM 415 50 % effective dose (ED 50) was 4. 8 mg/kg (dosed subcutaneously) and 36. 6 mg/kg (dosed orally), compared to 13. 2 mg/kg for telithromycin and > 60 mg/kg for penicillin V and clarithromycin. In the MRSA thigh infection, LBM 415 significantly reduced thigh bacterial levels compared to those of untreated mice, with levels similar to those after treatment with linezolid at the same dose levels. In the pneumonia model, the ED 50 to reduce the bacterial lung burden by > 4 log 10 in 50 % of treated animals was 23. 3 mg/kg for LBM 415, whereas moxifloxacin showed an ED 50 of 14. 3 mg/kg. In summary, LBM 415 showed in vivo efficacy in sepsis and specific organ infection models irrespective of resistance to other antibiotics. Results suggest the potential of peptide deformylase inhibitors as a novel class of therapeutic agents against antibiotic-resistant pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Neutrophil granulocytes play a {{vital role}} in the host {{surveillance}} system and form the first line of defense against microbial infections. The migration of neutrophils to an infected/inflamed tissue is guided by chemoattractants released either from intruding microbes or from activated/damaged host cells. Chemoattractants are recognized by neutrophils through chemoattractant receptors that belong to a large family of pertussis toxin-sensitive, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Ligand occupation of GPCRs generates signals that activate also the bactericidal systems in neutrophils such as secretion and production of superoxide anion. Being as the principal structure of the neutrophil peripheral cytoplasm, the cytoskeleton serves as the motor for all mechanical responses induced by chemoattractants including adhesion, locomotion, cell spreading and secretion. Inappropriate receptor activation and/or deactivation events may impair host defense and cause tissue damage. Thus, neutrophil GPCR activation is under tight control and regulated by various mechanisms at multiple levels. One such mechanism is the cytoskeleton-directed process that desensitizes the activated receptors and shuts the signaling off. Accumulating experimental evidences in neutrophil research have outlined crucial new implications for the role of actin cytoskeleton in neutrophil GPCR activation. The physical segregation of the activated receptors from the signaling G-proteins and coupling to the cytoskeleton forms one basis for GPCR desensitization. Desensitized GPCRs can be reactivated by subsequent addition of a cytoskeleton-disrupting agent, resulting in superoxide production. Apart from agonist-dependent neutrophil GPCR activation, agonist-independent GPCR activation/reactivation has also been observed. Chemoattractant mediated intracellular Ca 2 + transients have long been considered essential for neutrophil activation, however, the reactivation of GPCRs occurs without any intracellular Ca 2 + transient. Despite the large structural similarities and similar cellular responses they induced, some fundamental differences exist between different GPCRs with respect to receptor desensitization/reactivation and intracellular signaling. Even the two very closely related formyl peptide receptors, FPR and FPRL 1, use distinct signaling pathways to activate neutrophils. The pro-inflammatory effect mediated through FPR may possibly be used as a new approach to antimicrobial chemotherapy, as suggested by the fact that certain antibiotics (bacterial <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> <b>inhibitors)</b> promote the bacterial release of FPR-activating peptides...|$|R

We studied the pharmacokinetics and safety of LBM 415, a novel PDF inhibitor, administered as a single oral dose at 100 - 3, 000 mg in the fasted state and at 1, 000 mg in the fed state in healthy volunteers. LBM 415 was then administered at dosages ranging from 100 mg q. d. to 1, 000 mg t. i. d. for 11 days. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics was observed, with a peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of 17. 85 ± 5. 96 µg/ml at 1, 000 mg b. i. d. (the projected therapeutic dose) and an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) (0 - 24 h) of 36. 83 ± 10. 36 µg/ml·h. The half-life, as determined after a 1, 000 -mg single dose, was 2. 18 ± 0. 61 h. The compound was well tolerated at low doses, but at the highest dose, 1, 000 mg t. i. d., reversible cyanosis and low oxygen saturation, attributable to methemoglobinemia, were detected on day 11. Oxygen saturation was as low as 88 % in one subject on day 11. P Rolan, H Sun, C MacLeod, K Bracken, and TG Evan...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{emergence of}} multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is compromising the successful treatment of serious mi-crobial infections. GSK 1322322, a novel <b>peptide</b> <b>deformylase</b> (PDF) <b>inhibitor,</b> shows good in vitro antibacterial activity and has demonstrated {{safety and efficacy}} in human proof-of-concept clinical studies. In vitro studies were performed to determine the frequency of resistance (FoR) to this antimicrobial agent in major pathogens that cause respiratory tract and skin infections. Resistance to GSK 1322322 occurred at high frequency through loss-of-functionmutations in the formyl-methionyl transferase (FMT) protein in Staphylococcus aureus (4 / 4 strains) and Streptococcus pyogenes (4 / 4 strains) and via missense mutations in Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 / 21 strains), but the mutations were associated with severe in vitro and/or in vivo fitness costs. The overall FoR to GSK 1322322 was very low in Haemophilus influenzae, with only one PDFmutant being identified in one of four strains. No target-based mutants were identified from S. pyogenes, and only one or no PDFmutants were isolated {{in three of the}} four S. aureus strains studied. In S. pneumoniae, PDF mutants were isolated from only six of 21 strains tested; an additional 10 strains did not yield colonies on GSK 1322322 -containing plates. Most of the PDFmutants characterized from those three organ-isms (35 / 37 mutants) carried mutations in residues at or in close proximity to one of three highly conserved motifs {{that are part of the}} active site of the PDF protein, with 30 of the 35 mutations occurring at position V 71 (using the S. pneumoniae numbering system).
