30|$|A {{spindled}} lathe {{was used}} to peel the logs {{in the current study}} but spindleless lathes are extensively used in China. They are suitable for rotary peeling smaller diameter logs from young and fast-grown hardwood plantations (McGavin 2016). Spindleless lathes achieve higher yields because they can peel logs to smaller <b>peeler</b> <b>core</b> diameters compared to spindled lathes currently used for radiata pine. Moreover, spindleless lathes can control splits by pressing the splits together during peeling. Therefore, using this type of lathe may generate higher recovery and quality of veneer sheets.|$|E
30|$|It has to {{be noted}} that the tested E. globoidea was genetically {{unimproved}} material of unknown provenance. Wood properties like growth-stress and MoE are under genetic control (Davies et al. 2017). Murphy et al. (2005) reported a heritability of 0.3 to 0.5 for growth-strain in Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden and indicated tree breeding can be an effective method to reduce growth-stress. Considerable variation among trees was observed, indicating a potential for genetic improvement. The relatively high acoustic velocity of eucalypts in the corewood could allow peeling veneers to a smaller <b>peeler</b> <b>core</b> with spindleless lathes, improving yields and allowing the use of a small diameter younger resource.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the second}} part of a large {{research}} initiative aimed at characterizing Changbai larch (Larix olgensis Henry) for veneer and high-valued product potential. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of the tree growth characteristics, particularly diameter at breast height (DBH) and radial growth from pith (or <b>peeler</b> <b>core)</b> to bark on clear wood and veneer properties. A population of 36 trees was chosen and classified into three DBH classes, namely 20, 25, and 30 cm, and crosscut into six segments each along the vertical stem. With the entire veneer ribbon peeled from the pith to bark for each segment, the effect of sapwood and heartwood on wood properties was revealed. The tree DBH and height were moderately and positively correlated. The tree DBH significantly affected properties of both clear wood and veneer in a similar pattern. For the larch veneer population, veneer mean ultrasonic propagation time (UPT) and density decreased but veneer mean dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) increased from the heartwood to sapwood or from the pith to bark. Among the three DBH classes, the 25 cm DBH yielded the highest mean veneer density and MOE, followed by the 20 cm DBH and 30 cm DBH. This was found to be caused by the radial evolution of veneer properties from the pith to bark in combination with the variation of veneer yield and stem position...|$|E
30|$|The {{trees were}} transported to Nelson Pine Industries Ltd. (NPI), Richmond, NZ for processing. All logs were heated at 85  °C for 24  h {{in a water}} bath before peeling 8  days after felling. 23 of the 26 logs were peeled to a core {{diameter}} of 82  mm using a spindled lathe (Raute, Finland) with three-stage chucks. The remaining three logs fell off the lathe with a larger <b>peeler</b> <b>core</b> (133 to 162  mm in diameter) due to severe end-splitting. Veneers with a thickness of 3.74  mm were produced from all 26 logs. During the peeling process, the recovery and volumes {{of different types of}} waste (core, round-up, spur, clipper defects) were recorded for each log. After clipping, 296 veneer sheets were obtained. Recovery was defined as the ratio of the obtained veneer volume to log volume. Veneer volume was calculated {{based on the number of}} sheets and the thickness and dimensions of sheets. For comparison, NPI provided the average recovery data of more than 46, 000 radiata pine logs (2.7  m long) collected previously from the production line. The radiata pine logs used in this study were sourced from plantations and woodlots in Nelson and Marlborough. Veneer splitting was the major defect with few knots or other defects found so the aggregate defect rule according to AS/NZS 2269.0  (2012) was not applied. The green veneer sheets were visually graded to four classes (face, core, composer, waste) according to their splitting severity by the technical manager in NPI. Only face and core grades were considered to be usable veneer.|$|E
