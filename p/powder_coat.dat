50|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> {{on glass}} is a {{specialized}} procedure related to traditional <b>powder</b> <b>coating,</b> {{which is the}} technique of applying electrostatically charged, dry powdered particles of pigment and resin to a solid item's surface.

5000|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>Coating</b> {{is a type}} of coating that {{is applied}} as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main {{difference}} between a conventional liquid paint and a <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> is that the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a [...] "skin". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. <b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminum extrusions, drum hardware, and automobile and bicycle parts. Newer technologies allow other materials, such as MDF (medium-density fibreboard), to be <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> using different methods.|$|R

40|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>coating</b> of {{engineered}} wood panels such as medium density fibreboards (MDF) is gaining industrial interest due to ecological and economic advantages of <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology. For transferring <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology to temperature-sensitive substrates like MDF, {{a thorough understanding}} of the melting, flowing and curing behaviour of the used low-bake resins is required. In the present study, thermo-analysis in combination with iso-conversional kinetic data analysis as well as rheometry is applied to characterise the properties of an epoxy-based <b>powder</b> <b>coating.</b> Neat resin and cured <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> films are examined in order to define an ideal production window within which the resin is preferably applied and processed to yield satisfactory surface performance {{on the one hand and}} without exposing the carrier MDF too high a temperature load on the other hand to prevent the panel from deteriorating in mechanical strength. In order to produce <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> films of high surface gloss – a feature that has not yet successfully been realized on MDF with powder coatings – a new curing technology, in-mould surface finishing, has been applied...|$|R
40|$|Powder {{coatings}} provide {{several advantages}} over traditional coatings: environmental friendliness, freedom of design, robustness and resistance of surfaces, possibility to seamlessly all-around coating, fast production process, cost-effectiveness. In {{the last years}} these benefits of the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology have been adopted from metal to heat-sensitive natural fibre/ wood based substrates (especially medium density fibre boards- MDF) used for interior furniture applications. <b>Powder</b> <b>coated</b> MDF furniture parts are gaining market share already in the classic furniture applications kitchen, bathroom, living and offices. The acceptance of this product is increasing as reflected by excellent growth rates and an increasing customer base. Current efforts of the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> industry to develop new powders with higher reactivity (i. e. lower curing temperatures and shorter curing times; e. g. 120 °C/ 5 min) will enable the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> of other heat-sensitive substrates like natural fibre composites, wood plastic composites, light weight panels and different plastics in the future. The coating could be applied and cured by the conventional <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> process (electrostatic application, and melting and curing in an IR-oven) or by a new <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> procedure based on the in-mould-coating (IMC) technique which is already established in the plastic industry. Extra value could be added in the future by the functional powder toner printing of <b>powder</b> <b>coated</b> substrates using the electrophotographic printing technology, meeting the future demand of both individualization of the furniture part surface by applying functional 3 D textures and patterns and individually created coloured images and enabling shorter delivery times for these individualized parts.

At the professional scale, the capital expense and time required for a <b>powder</b> <b>coat</b> gun, booth and oven are similar to a spray gun system. Powder coatings have a major advantage in that the overspray can be recycled. However, if multiple colors are being sprayed in a single spray booth, this may limit the ability to recycle the overspray.|$|E

40|$|The <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> of wood {{products}} as an emerging environmentally sustainable coating technology holds promise {{in terms of}} novel product quality features for engineered wood like medium-density fiberboards (MDFs). However, one major limitation currently impeding widespread application of <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> technology is the availability of MDF panels that are suitable for this process. Typically, special-grade MDF panels are required that are more costly than standard-grade MDF panels to provide reliable coating quality, which makes <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> economically unattractive for many users. Methods are needed that allow extending the range of available MDF grades. In the present study, three surface pretreatment approaches for MDFs were studied to increase the processability of standard-grade MDF in the <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> process: atmospheric plasma pretreatment, infrared irradiation, and moisture equilibration in a climate chamber prior to electrostatic powder application. While atmospheric plasma treatment had no beneficial effect {{on the use of}} standard-grade MDF panels, both infrared preheating and preconditioning of the panels under controlled temperature–humidity conditions demonstrated that the range of MDF panels suitable for <b>powder</b> <b>coating</b> can be significantly extended by appropriate selection of the pretreatment procedure...|$|R

As part of EPA’s National Partnership for Environmental Priorities http://www.epa.gov/npep (NPEP) program, Crown set a partnership goal of eliminating chromium from its paints. Crown reduced its hazardous waste emissions by more than 300,000 pounds by removing chromium (in the form of ammonium dichromate as a flash rust inhibitor) from water-based paint formulations. By installing a new <b>powder</b> <b>coat</b> paint line, Crown eliminated more than 65 percent of wastewater from its water curtain paint booths, cutting more than 200,000 pounds of wastewater and sludge.
