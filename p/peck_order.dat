50|$|Pecking {{order or}} <b>peck</b> <b>order</b> is the colloquial {{term for the}} {{hierarchical}} system of social organisation. It was first described by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 under the German terms Hackordnung or Hackliste and introduced into English in 1927.|$|E
40|$|THE <b>peck</b> <b>order,</b> {{observed}} in domestic poultry flocks, {{has four main}} components - aggressiveness, submission, acceptance of submission and recognition. Intra-specific aggressiveness arises {{as a result of}} sexual selection for mates, territory and food 1, and submission signals and their acceptance are necessary to divert aggressiveness into harmless channels 2. Recognition is necessary in a gregarious species to allow these other three forces to be integrated into a <b>peck</b> <b>order.</b> Aggressiveness is only lowered within a group; strangers are always attacked...|$|E

40|$|We {{quantify}} the empirical {{relevance of the}} <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> hypothesis using a novel empirical model and testing strategy that addresses statistical power concerns with previous tests. While the classificatory ability of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> varies significantly depending on whether one interprets the hypothesis in a strict or liberal (e. g., "modified" <b>pecking</b> <b>order)</b> manner, the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> is never able to accurately classify {{more than half of}} the observed financing decisions. However, when we expand the model to incorporate factors typically attributed to alternative theories, the predictive accuracy of the model increases dramatically [...] accurately classifying over 80 % of the observed debt and equity issuances. Finally, we show that what little <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> behavior can be found in the data is driven more by incentive conflicts, as opposed to information asymmetry. <b>Pecking</b> <b>order</b> Capital structure Security issuance Asymmetric information...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we test how firm {{sizes and}} {{financial}} surpluses and deficits affect the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory’s explanation power based on Shyam-Sunder and Myers’s basic model. We find that, for both financial surpluses and deficits, firm sizes cause asymmetry when testing the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> model, <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> coefficients generally increasing along with firm sizes. We also find that surplus coefficients are obviously {{larger than the}} corresponding deficit coefficients, indicating that the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory is more applicable when firms have financial surpluses. Though we take firm sizes and financial surpluses and deficits into consideration, <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> coefficients of all cases (except for the largest firms with financial surpluses) are smaller than 0. 5, {{much less than the}} model’s expectation. This indicates that if we would apply the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> to characterize financing decisions in Japanese firms, we need to identify more conditions...|$|R
40|$|Evidence of {{an effect}} of the <b>peck</b> <b>order</b> in poultry on the {{variation}} in productive characters under floor conditions is {{used as the basis}} of a discussion on the design of animal experiments. Since these competitive effects increase the variation between animals penned together, the usual tests for the presence of pen effects between replicate pens are unsuitable. Replicates should be used in all experiments when treatments are allocated to pens of animals to provide an adequate measure of the experimental error. Considerations of social behaviour are likely to be relevant in many types of animal experiments, both husbandry and breeding. It is, however, emphasised that the amount of information available on such an important question is completely inadequate and that behaviour studies should be incorporated into all types of animal experiments to obtain such information...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that {{different}} methodologies may lead to different implications about the validity of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory. Design/methodology/approach – Using data from Greek firms as a starting-point, the paper first investigates whether they follow the financing pattern implied by the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory and then illustrates that conclusions concerning the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> should be carefully shaped by researchers, as the methodology used can be misleading. Two different information sources are used; the first is data derived from the financial statements of the Greek firms listed in the Athens Exchange, while the second comprises the answers to a detailed questionnaire. Findings – It is shown that a negative relationship between leverage and profitability does not necessarily mean that the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> financing hierarchy holds. Analysis should not rely solely on the mean-oriented regression quantitative analysis to test the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory, as it refers to a distinct hierarchy. Research limitations/implications – Further research should focus on investigating the reasons that underlie actual firm financing. Practical implications – The fact that the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> is actually a hierarchy makes research in this field more complex. Analysts should consider this special feature of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> approach when analyzing the existence of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> financing pattern. The methodology followed is of crucial importance in the analysis of the existence of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> financing pattern. Originality/value – To the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to test the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> pattern of financing using simultaneously quantitative and qualitative data, and to compare results and conclusions drawn from these two different types of methodology.

50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{function of}} a <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> {{is to increase the}} individual or inclusive fitness of the animals involved in its formation. Fighting to acquire resources such as food and mates is expensive in terms of time, energy and the risk of injury. By developing a <b>pecking</b> <b>order,</b> animals determine which individuals will get priority of access to resources, particularly when they are limited; there is a reduction in aggression when a <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> has been developed. Therefore, the proximate functions of a <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> are to reduce the costs of time, energy and risk of injury incurred during resource acquisition and defence.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test static {{tradeoff}} against <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> models of capital structure in Japanese firms. Design/methodology/approach – The static tradeoff and <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> models are tested on a sample of 1, 325 non-financial Japanese firms between 2002 and 2006. Findings – Empirical results prove that both models can explain some part of the capital structure. The static tradeoff model shows that firm leverage is affected by several determinants, and the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> model displays similar movements between net debt retired and financial surplus. However, both models have shortcomings. The static tradeoff model fails to explain the negative correlation between profitability and firm leverage, and the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> model fails to explain the low deficit coefficient.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} basic <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> model of Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) by {{separating}} {{the effects of}} financing surpluses, normal deficits, and large deficits. Using a broad cross-section of publicly traded firms for 1971 to 2005, {{we find that the}} estimated <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> coefficient is highest for surpluses (0. 90), lower for normal deficits (0. 74), and lowest when firms have large financing deficits (0. 09). These findings shed light on two empirical puzzles: first, small firms  although having the highest potential for asymmetric information  do not behave according to the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory, and second, the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory has lost explanatory power over time. We provide a solution to these puzzles by showing that the frequency of large deficits is higher in smaller firms and increasing over time. As a result, our findings support a <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory that considers firms' debt capacitie...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the existing empirical research on the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> hypothesis which has been largely confined to the United States {{and a few other}} advanced countries, this paper attempts to test the hypothesis for an emerging economy through a case study of the Indian Corporate sector. A well diverse sample of 556 manufacturing firms over the period 1997 - 2007 is used in the paper to test the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> hypothesis. The study finds strong evidence in favour of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> hypothesis – a result that stands startlingly odd to the most recent evidences against <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory in developed countries (Fama and French, (2005), Frank And Goyal (2003, Lemmon and Zender (2004), Leary and Roberts (2004)). ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tests for}} <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> {{behavior}} in medium-sized private Portuguese firms. In {{contrast to the}} usual split between internal funds, debt, and external equity, we separate debt into four components – cheap trade credits (CTC), bank loans (BL), other loans, and expensive credits (EC). We use breakpoint tests to identify when firms switch between funding sources by examining the change in each funding source based on the financing deficit remaining after the previous <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> funding source has been used. Our tests indicate that Portuguese companies generally move from lower cost to higher cost financing sources, {{but they do not}} exhaust each type of debt before {{moving on to the next}} funding source in the <b>pecking</b> <b>order.</b> Such behavior is consistent with a loose interpretation of <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> financing, but not a strict interpretation of the theory. Instead, Portuguese firms may be balancing <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> financing with a need to maintain some degree of financing flexibility...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} unit root test at both {{individual}} company (Dickey-Fuller) and panel (Im-Pesaran-Shin) level, {{in order to provide}} some quantitative evidence of the univariate behaviour of Italian companies' debt-ratio. If it is mean-reverting, then at least a share of companies are going to behave according to the trade-off model, whereas if it is non-stationary, then companies may behave according to <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory. Individual company test results support the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory in the case of more than 80 % of firms, while the panel test rejects the unit root null. These contradictory results {{can be explained by the}} heterogeneity of the firms which tends to characterise the entire panel. For this reason, we selected a number of sub-samples in which companies are supposed to follow either the pure trade-off or the pure <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> model of behaviour. Results confirm that: a) heterogeneity may lead to a false rejection of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theory in panel unit root tests; b) both trade-off and <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> theories contribute towards explaining the financial behaviour of Italian companies; c) the testing procedure we propose has the power to reject the pure <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> model under the null hypothesis, but not the pure trade-off model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pecking</b> <b>order</b> {{behavior}} {{is a very}} important financial hypothesis that attempts to explain how capital structure choices are made. Prior empirical evidence has been lukewarm in its support of this behavior. Most of the research has been conducted using samples of American firms. This paper examines the validity of the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> hypothesis in emerging market countries. One of the driving forces behind the <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> hypothesis is that managers have more information about the value of the company than do outside investors. Examining <b>pecking</b> <b>order</b> behavior in emerging markets would seem like an ideal place to find support for the hypothesis because the problems for outside investors are huge. Compared to investors in the US, investors in emerging markets receive less information, the information they do receive is likely to be distorted (managed), and the legal rights they possess are worse than their counterparts in the US. Using a sample of 23 countries, we find no support for this hypothesis.
