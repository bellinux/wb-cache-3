40|$|The {{experimental}} {{behavior of}} spinning laminated composite pretwisted plates (turbo-fan blade-like) with small (less than 10 % by volume) integral viscoelastic damping patches was investigated at NASA-Lewis Research Center. Ten different <b>plate</b> <b>sets</b> were experimentally spin tested {{and the resulting}} data was analyzed. The first-four <b>plate</b> <b>sets</b> investigated tailoring patch locations and definitions to damp specific modes on spinning flat graphite/epoxy plates {{as a function of}} rotational speed. The remaining six <b>plate</b> <b>sets</b> investigated damping patch size and location on specific modes of pretwisted (30 degrees) graphite/epoxy plates. The results reveal that: (1) significant amount of damping can be added using a small amount of damping material, (2) the damped plates experienced no failures up to the tested 28, 000 g's and 750, 000 cycles, (3) centrifugal loads caused an increase in bending frequencies and corresponding reductions in bending damping levels that are proportional to the bending stiffness increase, and (4) the centrifugal loads caused a decrease in torsion natural frequency and increase in damping levels of pretwisted composite plates...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{behavior of}} spinning, pre-twisted laminated composite plates was investigated. The {{purpose of these}} experiments was to establish an experimental database consisting of strain, deflections, and natural frequencies {{as a function of}} rotational velocity. Six different <b>plate</b> <b>sets</b> were tested, that included three different stacking sequences (two symmetric, one asymmetric), two different initial twist levels (0 deg, 30 deg), and two different initial twist axis locations (midchord, quarter-chord). The plates were spin tested at four different combinations of pitch and sweep. It was observed that the location of the pretwist axis and the level of pretwist greatly affects the strain and deflections of the spinning plate, while only the pretwist level affects the measured natural frequencies...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} refractive {{errors in}} school age children with color vision deficiency (CVD) {{and those with}} normal color vision (NCV) {{in order to make}} a better understanding of the emmetropization process. Methods: A total of 4, 400 primary school students aged 7 - 12 years were screened for color vision using Ishihara pseudoisochromatic color vision <b>plate</b> <b>sets.</b> Of these, 160 (3. 6 %) students had CVD. A total of 400 age- and sex-matched students with NCV were selected as controls. Refractive status was evaluated using objective cyclorefraction. Results: The CVD group included 136 male (85 %) and 24 female (15 %) subjects with mean age of 10. 1 ± 1. 8 years. The NCV group comprised of 336 male (84 %) and 64 female (16 %) subjects with mean age of 10. 5 ± 1. 2 years. The prevalence of myopia (7. 7 % vs. 13. 9 %, P < 0. 001) and hyperopia (41 % vs. 57. 4 %, P = 0. 03) was significantly lower in the CVD group. Furthermore, subjects with CVD subjects demonstrated a lower magnitude of refractive errors as compared to the CVD group (mean refractive error: + 0. 54 ± 0. 19 D versus + 0. 74 ± 1. 12 D, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Although the lower prevalence of myopia in subjects with CVD group supports the role of longitudinal chromatic aberration in the development of refractive errors; the lower prevalence of hyperopia in this group is an opposing finding. Myopia is a multifactorial disorder and longitudinal chromatic aberration is not the only factor influencing the emmetropization process...|$|E

40|$|The Annieopsquotch accretionary tract {{comprises}} a thrust {{stack of}} Lower to Middle Ordovician arc and backarc terranes that were accreted to the Laurentian margin of Iapetus during Middle to Upper Ordovician. Geological relationships {{suggest that the}} constituent terranes of the Annieopsquotch accretionary tract initially formed outboard of a peri-Laurentian Dashwoods microcontinent in an extensional arc, but occupied a lower <b>plate</b> <b>setting</b> with respect to Dashwoods during accretion. Metamorphic mineral assemblages indicate that the terranes were underplated beneath the composite Laurentian margin at depths ranging from ~ 3 km up to > 18 km. We infer the accretion of the terranes {{to be controlled by}} the brittle–ductile transition in the hydrated crust. The decoupling of brittle from ductile crust resulted in very high aspect ratios of the terranes, which comprise thin (< 5 km) but very large (up to 25 × 250 km) slabs of supracrustal arc rocks and ophiolite crust. Arc basement and ophiolitic mantle are not preserved and were either underplated at a greater depth or subducted and recycled back in the mantle. The accreted crust forms a reasonable approximation to bulk continental crust requiring little post-accretionary modification; hence, the accretion of arc–backarc complexes which occupy a lower <b>plate</b> <b>setting</b> can form an important mechanism for creation of new continental crust required to balance crustal loss at convergent margins...|$|R
