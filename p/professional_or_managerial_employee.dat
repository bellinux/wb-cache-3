30|$|Eastern European skilled {{immigrants}} without <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations earn {{significantly less}} than their counterparts who are <b>professionals</b> <b>or</b> managers (Table  3). The gap of almost $ 30, 000 suggests an income disadvantage experienced by skilled immigrants without <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations. Regardless of the immigrants’ occupational status, the most prevalent income category for Eastern European skilled immigrants is $ 20, 000 to $ 49, 999.|$|R
30|$|Eastern European {{immigrants}} without <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations have {{a slightly}} shorter average length of stay in the U.S. (13  years), tend to be older (41  years), {{and are more likely}} to reside in the Midwest (26 %) than immigrants holding <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations. They are also more likely to immigrate from Poland and Ukraine and less likely from Russia, Bulgaria and Romania.|$|R
30|$|Eastern European {{immigrants}} with {{at least}} an associate’s degree have a lower likelihood of employment in <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations than all other groups, except Hispanics. Over 40 % of educated Eastern European immigrants {{do not have a}} <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> job. These immigrants experience lower occupational status and, correspondingly, lower incomes. Eastern Europeans have the lowest share of associate and master degree holders employed as <b>professionals</b> <b>or</b> managers. This suggests that Eastern European skilled immigrants experience more difficulties in transferring their human capital and continuing their careers than other groups in the analysis, especially immigrants from Northern and Western Europe.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the labour market consequences of severe employment decline in Britain's major cities between 1981 and 1991, using labour market accounts. Significant adjustment to employment change occurred through out-migration and commuting, but unemployment in cities also rose, {{although much of}} it was recorded as inactivity. On average, women were less able to adjust through out-migration or commuting than men, while women in lower skilled jobs showed much less adjustment than those in <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations. This suggests that the creation of employment opportunities for less skilled occupations brings far greater direct benefits to the resident population of major cities than the creation of <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> employment...|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} samples {{used in this}} study. The first sample (N =[*] 8871) {{included}} post- 1991 Eastern European immigrants aged 25 to 65 who completed an associate’s degree or higher and held a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupation. For comparison, the second sample (N =[*] 5699) included post- 1991 Eastern European immigrants aged 25 to 65 who completed at least an associate’s degree, but who did not hold a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupation, and were employed as other white-collar workers, service workers, manual workers, or unemployed. The third sample (N =[*] 14, 570) included all post- 1991 Eastern European immigrants aged 25 to 65 with at least an associate’s degree, regardless of their occupational status.|$|R
30|$|The last {{labor market}} outcome in Table[*] 5 {{is whether or}} not the {{respondent}} is in a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> job, which in keeping with Cawley et al. ([2009]), we refer to as “white collar.” We find significant associations between overweight and obesity and white collar work for men, but not for women. Native men are less likely to be in <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> jobs if they are overweight (2.3 percentage points) or obese (4.8 percentage points). As we saw in the means, immigrants overall are more likely to be in white collar occupations. Overweight and obese male immigrants, however, are less likely to be in these jobs (− 10.5 and − 12.1 percentage points respectively) although the association is statistically significant only for overweight immigrant men.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates post-migration {{educational}} investment among {{newly arrived}} immigrants and examines {{the effect of}} post-migration education on new immigrants’ labour market integration, as measured by earnings and occupational status. The results indicate that younger immigrants who are already well educated, fluent in English or French and worked in a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupation prior to migration {{are most likely to}} enroll in Canadian education. But, acceptance of previous work experience by Canadian employers lowers the likelihood of enrolling in further education. Financial capital was not found to affect participation in post-migration education. Those immigrants who did enroll in post-migration education enjoyed an earnings advantage and were more likely to work in a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> job. The effect of post-migration education was greater for immigrants whose previous work experience was not accepted in Canada. Immigrant Workers, Education, Wages...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the early labour market experiences of graduates from different class backgrounds at three differentially ranked universities. It finds that outcomes {{are more than}} the sum of credentials and hard work. Access to social, economic and non-academic forms of cultural capital is found to be important and graduates from middle class backgrounds are more likely than graduates from working class backgrounds to access the forms of capital recognised by the graduate labour market. This leads to observable differences in graduate labour market outcomes. However, the complex relationship between higher education and the graduate labour market means that class differences are not simply reproduced. In the first instance, patterns in graduate labour market outcomes are a product of the academic requirements demanded by certain occupations. These academic barriers are tangible and affect all graduates regardless of background. Graduates with more prestigious credentials are more likely to access <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations and are more likely to find traditional graduate employment: the proportion of middle class graduates employed in <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations was 100...|$|R
40|$|Research {{into social}} {{networks}} and occupational attainment is a well-documented field in economic sociology internationally {{but has been}} the subject of little Australian research because of theoretical lack of interest and a shortage of appropriate data. This study attempts to fill this gap by using data from the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA) 2007. We provide two major findings about the role of social networks in Australian occupational attainment. First, as a job search method, social networks are associated with lower earnings and occupational status and lower probability of entering a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> position than market oriented job search methods. Second, jobs that are found using strong ties such as family members, relatives and friends have lower earnings and occupational status and are less likely to be <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> than jobs found using weak ties such as acquaintances and other people. Although the findings are preliminary, they contribute to international research by using Australian data and drawing out implications for further exploration of the role of social networks in Australia’s labour markets...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{socioeconomic}} adaptation of post- 1991 skilled immigrants from Eastern Europe in the United States. The study focused on immigrants from sixteen Eastern European countries who immigrated to the U.S. after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The minimum educational level of immigrants included in the analysis was an associate’s degree. The experiences of immigrants with and without <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations were compared to better ascertain differences in socioeconomic outcomes.|$|R
40|$|Purpose This {{research}} {{investigates the}} relationship between students’ entrepreneurial attitudes and traits and their classification of employment six months after university graduation. It aims to identify what specific attitudes and traits of entrepreneurial graduates are linked to employability in a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> field. Design/Methodology The research adopts a quantitative approach to measure the entrepreneurial drive of final-year undergraduate business school students and regresses this measurement against the employment level of the same students six months after their graduation. The employment classification of each respondent was classified as ‘professional/managerial’ or ‘non-professional/non-managerial’, {{in line with the}} Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2010. Findings The research found that both proactive disposition and achievement motivation were statistically linked to the likelihood of graduates being employed in a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> position six months after graduation. 	 Originality/Value This research goes beyond existing literature linking entrepreneurship to employability to quantitatively examine what specific attitudes and traits can be linked to employability in recent graduates. By identifying the aspects of entrepreneurialism that have a relationship with employability, more information is available for educators who are designing entrepreneurial education programs and allows for greater focus on aspects that may be of greatest benefit to all students...|$|R
30|$|The {{study used}} {{descriptive}} statistics {{to examine the}} socioeconomic status of Eastern European skilled immigrants, their individual backgrounds, and characteristics of their countries of origin. Regression analyses tested the determinants of occupational status and income among Eastern European skilled immigrants with an associate’s degree or higher. Logistic regression {{was used to assess}} the likelihood of holding a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> job because the dependent variable occupational status was dichotomous. The dependent variable income was a continuous measure; therefore, ordinary least squares regression (OLS) was the most appropriate regression technique to test the determinants of income.|$|R
30|$|Table  3 {{also shows}} that the {{majority}} of Eastern European professionals are managers (22 %) followed by computer professionals (16 %), educators (14 %), and healthcare professionals (13 %). These findings are consistent with the literature that suggests immigrant professionals in the U.S. tend to be concentrated in certain occupations, including computer-related and medical professions (Batalova & Lowell, 2007). Their counterparts without <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations tend to concentrate in service occupations (42 %) followed by other white-collar jobs (31 %), manual jobs (26 %), or are unemployed (1 %).|$|R
30|$|Eastern European skilled {{women are}} {{as likely to}} hold <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> jobs as their male counterparts, but despite similar {{likelihood}} of professionalization, men and women differ in their occupational concentrations and income. Women are more concentrated in business, finance, healthcare, and education, while men tend to be employed in computer-related occupations and engineering. A significant gender-wage gap suggests that women may be concentrated in lower-paying jobs. Professional women from Eastern Europe earn on average $ 30, 000 less than their male counterparts. The gap persists across all professional occupations and it is the largest in law and healthcare.|$|R
5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> {{position}} (in education or government) before entering the service. The average enlisted SPAR was 24 years old, single, a high school graduate, and had worked for over {{three years in a}} clerical or sales job before joining the service. The likelihood was that she came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons for becoming a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss of a loved one in the war.|$|R
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  3, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} educational category among Eastern European professionals is a bachelor’s degree (38 %) followed by a master’s degree (35 %) and a Ph.D. (11 %). In comparison, Eastern European skilled immigrants without <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupations are more likely to hold an associate’s (27 %) or a bachelor’s degree (49 %) and less likely to hold a master’s degree (20 %), professional degree (3 %), or a Ph.D. (1 %). These differences confirm the importance of human capital in socioeconomic adaptation of immigrant professionals with immigrants holding advanced educational degrees having a higher occupational status than less educated immigrants (Bodankin & Semyonov, 2016).|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this case-control study, {{occupational}} histories {{were used}} to assess the relation between risk of breast cancer and employment in professional and managerial occupations while adjusting for reproductive and other risk factors. METHODS: Incident, primary, female cases of breast cancer diagnosed between 1986 and 1991, and randomly selected controls were interviewed to obtain detailed medical, reproductive, and occupational histories. Mantel-Haenszel crude odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) {{were used to}} estimate risk of breast cancer related to the job of longest duration. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate crude and adjusted ORs and 95 % CIs associated with having ever been employed and duration of employment in a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupation. RESULTS: A non-significant threefold increase in risk was found among premenopausal women whose major job was in the occupational category of precision production, craft, and repair (95 % CI 0. 90 to 20. 35). No increase in risk was found for premenopausal women whose major job was a <b>managerial</b> <b>or</b> <b>professional</b> occupation. However, an inverse relation between risk of premenopausal breast cancer and having ever held a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> job was observed (OR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 82). This relation was strongest for women who worked one to 10 years (OR 0. 47, 95 % CI 0. 29 to 0. 77). Postmenopausal breast cancer was not related to professional and managerial employment. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, employment in professional and managerial occupations is not associated with postmenopausal risk of breast cancer, but seems to be related to a reduction in risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Methodological limitations of this study including response rates are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Definitions {{of skilled}} {{immigrants}} in the literature {{vary depending on the}} data, methodology, and goals. The term “skilled” is often used interchangeably with “professional” and “highly skilled” (Batalova & Lowell, 2007). The most obvious indicators of “skill” are education and occupation, which prior studies used to distinguish skilled immigrants from general immigrant population. This study uses a common international definition which classifies skilled immigrants as individuals who have completed a two-year college degree or more and are employed in a variety of skilled occupations (Batalova & Lowell, 2007). Based on this definition, new skilled immigrants from Eastern Europe are those who have completed an associate’s degree or higher and have been employed in a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> <b>managerial</b> occupation based on the 2010  U.S. Census Occupational classification.|$|R

The data gathered was analyzed against literature from previous research reviewed for this study. Findings The main {{findings of this study}} were to that even though Indian IT employees change their employers easily, monetary compensation was not the primary factor in their work lives. They valued intrinsic motivational factors above extrinsic and those factors were often tightly connected with the work itself. The employer should not try to engage professional and <b>managerial</b> <b>employees</b> through salaries, rather their work tasks should be made interesting and challenging. Through interesting jobs employees are more engaged and motivated toward the job they do and committed to the employer who provides that job...|$|R
