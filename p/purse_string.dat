5000|$|The {{implantation}} {{procedure is}} performed under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, and guided by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and fluoroscopy. [...] A small incision is made {{inferior to the}} xyphoid process, exposing {{the apex of the}} heart and allowing for apical puncture. A <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> (U-shaped) suture is placed around the site of entry to maintain hemostasis following the removal of the delivery system. A J-tipped 0.035 inch guidewire is then advanced through the left ventricle and across the native mitral orifice. The catheter, loaded with the Tiara apparatus is then advanced over the guidewire, to be positioned in the left atrium. Central positioning of the Tiara delivery system in the native mitral orifice is confirmed using TEE and angiography before the guidewire is removed and the valve is deployed. The valve opens in a particular sequence. First the atrial skirt is deployed and the valve is positioned so the flat portion of the D-shaped frame is adjacent to the LVOT. Once the Tiara is aligned, the valve is pulled downward and seated on the annulus. The ventricular portion is then deployed and anchored. It is anchored behind the anterior and posterior leaflets of the native valve. Finally, the delivery system is removed and hemostasis is maintained by the <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> suture. [...] Heart and valve function is monitored following the procedure.|$|E

40|$|SummarySingle {{cells and}} {{multicellular}} tissues rapidly heal wounds. These processes are considered distinct, but one mode of healing—Rho GTPase-dependent formation and closure of a <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin- 2 around wounds—occurs in single cells [1, 2] and in epithelia [3 – 10]. Here, {{we show that}} wounding of one cell in Xenopus embryos elicits Rho GTPase activation around the wound and at the nearest cell-cell junctions in the neighbor cells. F-actin and myosin- 2 accumulate at the junctions and around the wound itself, and as the resultant actomyosin array closes over the wound site, junctional F-actin and myosin- 2 become mechanically integrated with the actin and myosin- 2 around the wound, forming a hybrid <b>purse</b> <b>string.</b> When cells are ablated rather than wounded, Rho GTPase activation and F-actin accumulation occur at cell-cell junctions surrounding the ablated cell, and the <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> closes {{the hole in the}} epithelium. Elevation of intracellular free calcium, an essential upstream signal for the single-cell wound response [2, 11], also occurs at the cell-cell contacts and in neighbor cells. Thus, the single and multicellular <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> wound responses represent points on a signaling and mechanical continuum that are integrated by cell-cell junctions...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Secure transluminal closure is {{the most}} {{fundamental}} prerequisite for the safe introduction of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). The aim was to compare acute strength of various gastrotomy closure techniques in an in vitro porcine stomach model by assessing leak pressures. METHODS: Standardized gastrotomies were closed manually, {{without the use of}} an endoscope, by one of seven NOTES closure devices: (i) T tags, (ii) <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> modified T tags, (iii) Eagle Claw VIII, (iv) Resolution clips, (v) flexible stapler; (vi) <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> suturing device, and (vii) flexible Endostitch. After closure, each specimen was fixed on the experimental apparatus and the pressure was gradually increased. By linking the pressure gauge and two cameras, the leak location and pressure could be determined in detail. We began by collecting gold standard reference values, by testing 15 gastrotomies closed with interrupted surgical sutures; these were associated with a mean leak pressure of 206 mmHg (SD 59). Using a noninferiority design, a sample size of 11 specimens for each NOTES closure technique was determined. RESULTS: The Resolution clips (P = 0. 0285), Eagle Claw VIII (P = 0. 0325), flexible stapler (P 0. 6775), <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> modified T tags (P > 0. 999), and the <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> suturing device (P = 0. 9875) resulted in inferior closures. CONCLUSIONS: The Eagle Claw VIII, Resolution clips, flexible stapler and flexible Endostitch produced noninferior closures in comparison with surgical closure in this model. These techniques seem to be the prime candidates for further testing in animal experiments before human trials can be initiate...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDorsal closure during Drosophila {{embryogenesis}} is {{an important}} model system for investigating the biomechanics of morphogenesis. During closure, two flanks of lateral epidermis (with actomyosin-rich <b>purse</b> <b>strings</b> near each leading edge) close an eye-shaped opening that is filled with amnioserosa. At each canthus (corner of the eye) a zipping process remodels the tissue interfaces between the leading edges of the lateral epidermis and the amnioserosa. We investigated zipping dynamics and found that apposing leading edge cells come together at their apical ends and then square off basally to form a lateral junction. Meanwhile, the <b>purse</b> <b>strings</b> act as contractile elastic rods bent toward the embryo interior near each canthus. We propose that a canthus-localized force contributes to both bending {{the ends of the}} <b>purse</b> <b>strings</b> and the formation of lateral junctions. We developed a thermodynamic model for zipping based on three-dimensional remodeling of the tissue interfaces and the reaction dynamics of adhesion molecules in junctions and elsewhere, which we applied to zipping during unperturbed wild-type closure and to laser or genetically perturbed closure. We identified two processes that can contribute to the zipping mechanism, consistent with experiments, distinguished by whether amnioserosa dynamics do or do not augment canthus adhesion dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Time {{and again}} the {{technique}} of appendectomy for acute appendicitis has been debated, and optimal management of the stump is still a matter of discussion. Thus, a study was proposed to compare two techniques of management of the stump i. e., simple ligation alone vs. ligation and invagination of the stump with <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> sutures. Aim: To compare and evaluate simple ligation alone with ligation and invagination of the stump during appendectomy. Materials and Methods: A total of 102 patients were included in this study. Each patient was alternately divided under two groups (Group A: Simple ligation of the stump and Group B: Ligation and invagination of the stump with <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> sutures). The two techniques were compared with respect to duration, intra-operative and post-operative complications. Results: It was observed that simple ligation {{is not only an}} equally safe a procedure, but is also better in terms of duration of the procedure, which was seen to be less in the case of simple ligation alone. Post-operative course as well as duration of hospital stay was similar in both the groups.

40|$|The {{actomyosin}} <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> is an evolutionarily conserved contractile {{structure that}} {{is involved in}} cytokinesis, morphogenesis, and wound healing. Recent studies suggested that an actomyosin <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> is crucial for the closure of wounds in single cells. In the present study, morphological and pharmacological methods were used to investigate the role of this structure in the closure of wounds in the peripheral cytoplasm of sea urchin coelomocytes. These discoidal shaped cells underwent a dramatic form of actin-based centripetal/retrograde flow and occasionally opened and closed spontaneous wounds in their lamellipodia. Fluorescent phalloidin staining indicated that a well defined fringe of actin filaments assembles from the margin of these holes, and drug studies with cytochalasin D and latrunculin A indicated that actin polymerization is required for wound closure. Additional evidence that actin polymerization is involved in wound closure {{was provided by the}} localization of components of the Arp 2 / 3 complex to the wound margin. Significantly, myosin II immunolocalization demonstrated that it is not associated with wound margins despite being present in the perinuclear region. Pharmacological evidence for the lack of myosin II involvement in wound closure comes from experiments in which a microneedle was used to produce wounds in cells in which actomyosin contraction was inhibited by treatment with kinase inhibitors. Wounds produced in kinase inhibitor-treated cells closed {{in a manner similar to}} that seen with control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that an actomyosin <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> mechanism is not responsible for the closure of lamellar wounds in coelomocytes. We hypothesize that the wounds heal by means of a combination of the force produced by actin polymerization alone and centripetal flow. Interestingly, these cells did assemble an actomyosin structure around the margin of phagosome-like membrane invaginations, indicating that myosin is not simply excluded from the periphery by some general mechanism. The results indicate that the actomyosin <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> is not the only mechanism that can mediate wound closure in single cells...|$|E

40|$|Wound {{healing is}} {{essential}} in maintaining tissue integrity. Wounds can close via lamellipodial crawling, which involves the rapid migration of cell sheets. A slower mechanism also exists, which involves the assembly of an actomyosin cable and subsequent contraction in a “purse string ” manner to close the wound. Here we vary wound geometry to generate conditions where both mechanisms act synergistically to accelerate wound closure. In wounds that take the shape of zigzag patterns, cells at the apical points develop into leader cells while the cell sheet undergoes <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> contraction in concave regions. Especially strong <b>purse</b> <b>string</b> contraction was observed in 45 ° zigzag wounds, resulting in nearly eight-fold faster wound healing rates compared to wounds with straight edges. 108 The process of collective migration has been well-studied for its importance in wound healing, morphogenesis, and tumor metastasis.
