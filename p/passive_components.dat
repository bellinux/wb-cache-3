5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with <b>passive</b> <b>components.</b> An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E

However, its underlying mechanism(s) remain elusive, and it cannot be explained readily {{within the framework of}} the cross-bridge theory. Traditionally, residual force enhancement has been attributed to the development of sarcomere length non-uniformities. However, recent evidence suggests that this might not be the case. Rather, it appears that residual force enhancement has an active and a <b>passive</b> <b>component.</b> The active component is tentatively associated with changes in the cross-bridge kinetics that might be reflected in decreased detachment rates following active muscle stretching, while the <b>passive</b> <b>component</b> possibly originates from a structural protein, such as titin, whose stiffness might be regulated by calcium...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller <b>passive</b> <b>components.</b> It is frequently used in practice.|$|E

2500|$|During and {{immediately}} after World War II a phenomenon named [...] "the tyranny of numbers" [...] was noticed, that is, some computational devices reached a level of complexity at which the losses from failures and downtime exceeded the expected benefits.

2500|$|The {{thyristor}} valve {{was first}} used in HVDC systems in 1972 on the Eel River Converter Station in Canada. The thyristor is a solid-state semiconductor device similar to the diode, but with an extra control terminal {{that is used to}} switch the device on at a defined instant. Because thyristors have breakdown voltages of only a few kilovolts each, HVDC thyristor valves are built using large numbers of thyristors connected in series. Additional <b>passive</b> <b>components</b> such as grading capacitors and resistors need to be connected in parallel with each thyristor {{in order to ensure that}} the voltage across the valve is shared uniformly between the thyristors.
