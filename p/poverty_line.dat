40|$|Absolute <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> {{are often}} {{derived from the}} cost of obtaining {{sufficient}} calories. Where staples vary across regions, such <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> may differ depending on whether they are set using national or regional food baskets.

This paper explores this issue by focussing on Uganda, a country where widening spatial inequalities in the 1990 s have caused concern. Conflicting results from earlier studies have suggested that the spatial pattern of poverty in Uganda is very sensitive to whether national or regional food baskets are used in setting <b>poverty</b> <b>lines.</b> We confirm this suggestion by comparing the spatial profile of poverty in 1993 using national and regional <b>poverty</b> <b>lines.</b> However, since the regions consuming the more expensive staple sources of calories are also those with higher incomes, using simple regional <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> is problematic. Instead, a method of setting regional <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> is considered that adjusts for income differentials between regions. Even with this adjustment, the use of regional food baskets implies a markedly different...|$|R

Nutritional adequacy <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> are higher than official <b>poverty</b> <b>lines,</b> particularly in rural areas. The application of nutritional adequacy <b>poverty</b> <b>lines</b> points to greater rural-urban poverty differences than in official estimates. Declines in rural poverty during the 1990 s were also slower under the nutritional adequacy definition, especially in south India. There is a greater degree of rural-urban and regional bias in nutritional adequacy poverty reduction than suggested by official data. Inter-state variations in changes in nutritional poverty and official poverty in the 1990 s are largely explained by differences in assumptions on overall price movements. However, relative price movements in food items also played a role, particularly the slow increase in prices of cereals and edible oils in comparison to the prices of pulses, and in some southern states, compared to milk and vegetable prices as well. ...|$|R
