5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to <b>phenolic</b> compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the <b>phenolic</b> concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of <b>phenolic</b> compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phenolics</b> are {{the most}} {{abundant}} plant metabolites and are believed to decompose slowly in soils compared to other soil organic matter (SOM). Thus, they have often been considered as a slow carbon (C) pool in soil dynamics models. Here, however, we review changes in our concept about the turnover rate of <b>phenolics</b> and quantification {{of different types of}} <b>phenolics</b> in soils. Also, we synthesize current research on the degradation of <b>phenolics</b> and their regulatory effects on decomposition. Environmental changes, such as elevated CO 2, warming, nitrogen (N) deposition, and drought, could influence the production and form of <b>phenolics,</b> leading to a change in SOM dynamics, and thus we also review the fate of <b>phenolics</b> under environmental disturbances. Finally, we propose the use of <b>phenolics</b> as a tool to control rates of SOM decomposition to stabilize organic carbon in ecosystems. Further studies to clarify the role of <b>phenolics</b> in SOM dynamics should include improving quantification methods, elucidating the relationship between <b>phenolics</b> and soil microorganisms, and determining the interactive effects of combinations of environmental changes on the <b>phenolics</b> production and degradation and subsequent impact on SOM processing...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of phenolic-rich functional foods is often {{limited by the}} off-tastes of <b>phenolics</b> that might be counteracted by sequestering these compounds using a carrier, thereby preventing them to interact with bitter taste receptors and salivary proteins. A range of common animal food proteins were tested for binding of <b>phenolics.</b> It appeared that a proline-rich open protein structure, as in β-casein, favored binding of <b>phenolics.</b> Globular proteins other than bovine serum albumin showed poor potential for use as carrier. No appropriate carriers for monomeric <b>phenolics</b> were found. β-Casein and Na-caseinate were shown to have good bitter-masking potential for EGCG, as measured by a maximal reduction in bitter receptor activation of ~ 93 % measured in vitro. This effective reduction in bitter receptor activation was confirmed by a sensory test. This illustrates the validity of using food proteins with good binding properties as carriers for <b>phenolics.</b> Different methodologies for probing the interaction between proteins and <b>phenolics</b> were developed: (i) ultrafiltration followed by UV quantification of unbound <b>phenolics</b> in the retentate, (ii) fluorescence quenching, and (iii) ultrafiltration followed by mass spectrometric quantification of unbound <b>phenolics</b> in the retentate. The latter method offered the opportunity to analyze preferential binding to protein of individual <b>phenolics</b> present in a complex mixture. With these methods, it was established that, with respect to <b>phenolics,</b> conformation and flexibility were important drivers of protein-phenolic interaction, besides degree of polymerization and galloylation. With respect to relatively proline-poor unstructured proteins such as α-casein and β-casein, it appeared {{that there should be}} other factors, besides proline density, explaining the interaction with <b>phenolics...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Phenolics</b> in {{food and}} fruit tree leaves exist in free, soluble-conjugate, and insoluble-bound forms. In this study, {{in order to enhance}} the {{bioavailability}} of insoluble-bound <b>phenolics</b> from guava leaves (GL), the ability of enzyme-assisted extraction in improving the release of insoluble-bound <b>phenolics</b> was investigated. Compared to untreated GL, single xylanase-assisted extraction did not change the composition and yield of soluble <b>phenolics,</b> whereas single cellulase or β-glucosidase-assisted extraction significantly enhanced the soluble <b>phenolics</b> content of PGL. However, complex enzyme-assisted extraction (CEAE) greatly improved the soluble <b>phenolics</b> content, flavonoids content, ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP by 103. 2 %, 81. 6 %, 104. 4 %, 126. 5 %, and 90. 3 %, respectively. Interestingly, after CEAE, a major proportion of <b>phenolics</b> existed in the soluble form, and rarely in the insoluble-bound form. Especially, the contents of quercetin and kaempferol with higher bio-activity were enhanced by 3. 5 - and 2. 2 -fold, respectively. More importantly, total soluble <b>phenolics</b> extracts of GL following CEAE exhibited the highest antioxidant activity and protective effect against supercoiled DNA damage. This enzyme-assisted extraction technology can be useful for extracting biochemical components from plant matrix, and has good potential for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries...|$|R

40|$|Summary Soluble and cell-wall-bound <b>phenolics</b> in mycor-rhizas of Larix decidua [...] Laccaria amethystea and in nonmy-corrhizal fine {{roots of}} larch grown in sterile culture were {{analyzed}} by HPLC. The soluble <b>phenolics</b> p-hydroxybenzoyl-glucose, p-hydroxybenzoic acid glucoside, picein, catechin, and epicatechin were identified in nonmycorrhizal fine roots. The same <b>phenolics</b> also occurred in mycorrhizas, but only in very small quantities compared with those in nonmycorrhizal fine roots. The amount of cell-wall-bound ferulic acid was much lower in mycorrhizas than in nonmycorrhizal fine roots. Pure mycelia of Laccaria amethystea (Bull.) Murr. contained none of the identified <b>phenolics.</b> We conclude that L. amethys-tea induced a large decrease in soluble and cell-wall-bound <b>phenolics</b> in fine roots of Larix decidua Mill. that may explain their rapid mycorrhization...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the total}} <b>phenolics,</b> {{condensed}} tannins (CT), protein-precipitable <b>phenolics</b> content and protein precipitation capacity were determined {{on a series of}} mangrove leaves from two true viviparous mangrove species (Kandelia candel and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) at various stages of development and decomposition in the Jiulong River Estuary, Fujian, China. Similar measurements were also done for the propagules at different developmental stages. The results showed that the total <b>phenolics,</b> extractable condensed tannins, total condensed tannins, protein-precipitable <b>phenolics</b> content and protein precipitation capacity in young leaves were higher than those in mature and senescent leaves. Tannin dynamics during leaf decomposition varied with species, and the rapid loss of <b>phenolics</b> observed during decomposition can be ascribed to leaching and degradation. Protein-bound CT and fibre-bound CT tended to increase with leaf decomposition, with CT binding more strongly to protein than to fibre. Protein-bound CT was higher than fibre-bound CT with the exception of mature leaves. Total <b>phenolics,</b> extractable CT and protein-precipitable <b>phenolics</b> contents in flower tissues were relatively lower than those in hypocotyls at different developmental stages. Protein precipitation capacity fluctuated with the development of propagules. Increases in nitrogen in decaying litter, and declines in contents of total <b>phenolics</b> and total condensed tannins of detritus support the general conclusion that decomposing mangrove detritus can be a more palatable heterotrophic substrate than living leaves...|$|R

40|$|Although {{considerable}} researches {{have been}} conducted on the physiological responses to plant iron (Fe) deficiency stress in dicotyledonous plants, much {{still needs to be}} learned about the regulation of these processes. In the present research, red clover was used to investigate the role of root <b>phenolics</b> accumulation in regulating Fe-deficiency induced Fe(III) chelate reductase (FCR). The root FCR activity, IAA and <b>phenolics</b> accumulation, and also the <b>phenolics</b> secretion were greatly increased by the Fe deficiency treatment. The application of TIBA (2, 3, 5 -triiodobenoic acid) to the stem, an IAA polar transport inhibitor, which could decrease IAA accumulation in root, significantly inhibited the FCR activity, but did not effect root <b>phenolics</b> accumulation and secretion, suggesting that IAA itself did not involve in root <b>phenolics</b> accumulation and secretion. In contrast, the Fe deficiency treatment significantly decreased the root IAA-oxidase activity. Interestingly the <b>phenolics</b> extracted from roots inhibited IAA-oxidase activity in vitro, and this inhibition was greater with <b>phenolics</b> extracted from roots of Fe deficient plants than that from Fe sufficient plants, indicating that the Fe deficiency-induced IAA-oxidase inhibition probably caused by the <b>phenolics</b> accumulation in Fe deficient roots. Based on these observations, we propose a model where under Fe deficiency stress in dicots, an increase in root <b>phenolics</b> concentrations plays a role in regulating root IAA levels through an inhibition of root IAA oxidase activity. This response, leads to, or at least partially leads to an increase in root IAA levels, which in turn help induce increased root FCR activity...|$|R
