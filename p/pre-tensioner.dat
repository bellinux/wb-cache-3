5000|$|The {{signals from}} the various sensors are fed into the Airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various {{additional}} restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and [...] "curtain" [...] airbags which cover the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated {{with one or more}} pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between 1 and 3 amperes in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt <b>pre-tensioner,</b> this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately 20 to 30 milliseconds. An airbag must inflate quickly in order to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within 15 to 30 milliseconds after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately 60-80 milliseconds after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirement}} to operate vehicles in low light and/or night environments whilst wearing night vision goggle (NVG) systems {{has become increasingly}} common during military operations. There is very limited research investigating injury risks associated with these systems during ground vehicle collisions. This study examined the injury risks associated with wearing the Australian Defence Force - Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) and NVG system, in frontal vehicle collisions. This project consisted of two components: (1) crash tests using a sled and (2) numerical simulations of impacts. Four dynamic sled tests were conducted using a 50 th percentile, male, Hybrid III dummy positioned on a rigid seat. Frontal impact tests were performed at a 40 km/h change in velocity (*v) and 20 g deceleration. The test configurations were as follows: (a) Base; (no helmet or additional equipment); (b) ECH; and, (c) ECH and NVG. Condition (c) was carried out twice, to determine repeatability. The sled test protocols were reconstructed precisely with the numerical simulation package MADYMO and the simulations were shown to correlate well with the experimental results. Using this validated model, four parametric studies were undertaken to assess the influence of counterweights, seat cushion, seatbelt <b>pre-tensioner,</b> and the vehicle's *v and acceleration on injury risks. The study found that neck loads were within acceptable limits, {{with the exception of}} the neck extension moment, which was exceeded for all NVG conditions. Based on the parametric studies, no major improvements were observed in the neck extension moments with the use of counterweights or a seat cushion. In contrast the use of a seatbelt <b>pre-tensioner</b> was observed to decrease greatly this neck injury risk in certain scenarios. The study also identified that a *v of 15 km/h and peak acceleration of up to 14 g were required to keep the neck extension moment below the prescribed injury criteria. However, the high neck extension moment values may have been partially attributable to the stiff Hybrid III neck. This study identified a possible injury mechanism for soldiers using the ECH and NVG system during specific impact scenarios. The method applied in this project was designed to be repeatable...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{performance}} of adaptive restraint systems requires an accurate assessment of occupant parameters including physical properties and pre-collision {{behavior of the}} occupant. Muscle bracing, {{one of the key}} reflexive actions adopted by car occupants to mitigate the severity of an impending collision, is ignored in restraint designing since conventional human surrogate tools used for injury assessment due to collision loading provide limited insight into this effect. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of pre-collision muscle bracing on the injury outcome of an occupant using a simplified numerical musculoskeletal model. The activation levels for 12 major muscle groups loading the ankle, knee, hip and elbow joints, were determined using an optimization routine with data collected from previously reported volunteer sled tests. A whole body injury metric, weighted to the severity of injury and the injured body region, was used to evaluate the potential risk of injuries estimated for different levels of bracing. The musculoskeletal model was further used to determine the requirements on the restraint system properties to minimize overall injuries for an occupant in a relaxed and a braced condition. Significant variation was observed in the load-limiting value and <b>pre-tensioner</b> firing time, as the restraint properties were optimized to account for the bracing behavior. The results of the study provide a framework for improving the {{performance of}} adaptive restraint systems, currently designed for passive anthropometric tests devices, by taking into account realistic response of the occupant involved in a collision...|$|E
40|$|Human body models (HBMs) are virtual human surrogates used {{to predict}} {{kinematic}} and injury responses during motor vehicle crashes. In recent years, active musculature has been incorporated into HBMs for enhanced biofidelity in simulated emergency scenarios, in particular low-severity crashes and pre-crash situations, where occupant responses are influenced by muscle tension. Development and validation of HBMs that simulate neuromuscular control requires information on muscle activation patterns and contraction levels for different loading levels and directions. This information can be acquired by measuring muscle activity in volunteers with electromyography in replicated pre-crash events. This thesis investigates occupant responses in various pre-crash type braking scenarios and multidirectional perturbations. Muscle activity was measured in volunteers in the following scenarios; maximum voluntary braking, autonomous braking with standard seatbelt, autonomous braking with reversible <b>pre-tensioner</b> activated 200 ms before braking, and seated perturbation in multiple directions without restraint. Muscle activity and forward displacement during autonomous braking was influenced by type of restraint system and role (passenger vs. driver). Pre-tensioning the seatbelt caused decreased forward displacement as well as increased startle like muscle activity in some volunteers. Active HBMs that model the startle reflex can elucidate its effect on injury risk in the crash phase. The difference in posture between drivers and passengers resulted in decreased upper extremity and increased lower back muscle activity for passengers and more forward displacement. Active HBMs validated against the data presented here {{can be used to}} further assess {{the difference between the two}} occupant roles and to aid the optimisation of safety systems for each group. The spatial tuning patterns generated from multidirectional perturbation showed variable activation amplitudes and preferred directions for the neck muscles. Implementing muscle and direction specific activation schemes in active HBMs might result in better prediction of the head and neck responses. The research outcomes provide data sets for active HBM validation in pre-crash braking events and the development and validation of omnidirectional models. Further studies that identify occupant muscle responses are needed. Measuring muscle activity during a pre-crash steering manoeuvre or during a realistic visual threat to identify the muscle responses following a startle reflex would support the advancement of future omnidirectional models and startle reflex control methods. </p...|$|E

40|$|Fatalities and {{injuries}} to car occupants in motor vehicle crashes {{continue to be}} a serious global socio-economic issue. Advanced safety systems that provide improved occupant protection and crash mitigation have the potential to reduce this burden. For the development and virtual assessment of these systems, numerical human body models (HBMs) that predict occupant responses have been developed. Currently, {{there is a need for}} increasing the level of biofidelity in these models to facilitate simulation of occupant responses influenced by muscle contraction, such as often experienced during pre-crash vehicle manoeuvres. The aim of this thesis was to provide data and modelling approaches for the advancement of HBMs capable of simulating occupant responses in a wide range of pre-crash scenarios. Volunteer experiments were conducted to study driver and passenger responses during emergency braking with a standard seatbelt and with a seatbelt equipped with a reversible <b>pre-tensioner.</b> Muscle activity, kinematic, and boundary condition data were collected. The data showed that pre-tensioning the seatbelt prior to braking influenced the muscular and kinematic responses of occupants. Drivers modified their responses during voluntary braking, resulting in different kinematics than were observed during autonomous braking. Passenger and driver responses also differed during autonomous braking. The findings demonstrate that HBMs need to account for the differences in postural responses between occupant roles as well as the adjustments made by drivers during voluntary braking. The studies provide detailed data sets that can be used for model tuning and validation. The modelling efforts of this work focused on simulation of head-neck responses. To facilitate the modelling of neck muscle recruitment, muscle activity data from volunteers exposed to multi-directional horizontal seated perturbations were analysed. The derived spatial tuning curves revealed muscle- and direction-specific recruitment patterns. The experimental tuning curves can be used as input to models or to verify spatial tuning of muscle recruitment in HBMs. A method for simulating muscle recruitment of individual neck muscles was developed. The approach included a combination of head kinematics and muscle length feedback to generate muscle specific activation levels. The experimental tuning curves were used to define appropriate sets of muscle activation in response to head kinematics feedback. The predicted spatial tuning using the two feedback loops was verified in multi-directional horizontal gravity simulations. The results showed that muscle activation generated by individual or combined feedback loops influenced the predicted head and intervertebral kinematics. The developed method has the potential to improve prediction of omnidirectional head and neck responses with HBMs. However, further work is needed to verify these findings. Overall, this research has increased knowledge about the muscle responses of occupants in dynamic events typical of pre-crash scenarios. The findings highlight important aspects that must be considered to enable active HBMs to capture a wide range of occupant responses. The data presented support the advancement of current and future HBMs, which will contribute to the development of improved safety systems that reduce the number of fatalities {{and injuries}} in motor vehicle crashes...|$|E
40|$|The {{side impact}} gained more {{importance}} {{in the course of}} the last years. This is partially because of the fact that the safety level in the frontal impact rose clearly by many safety devices (Airbag, <b>pre-tensioner,</b> belt force limiter, crash zone, strong passenger compartment …). The reason for the high risk in side impacts is that bullet and target vehicle are mostly not compatible with each other. In the context of this work an investigation of the influences factors in side impact compatibility was carried out. The importance of the side impact was illustrated by accident data. Large progress in the area of soft and hardware made it possible to calculate numerically within a short time and with small costs physical procedures with sufficient accuracy. Numerical Simulation was used to investigate the influence factors of the side impact. The numeric models were validated on the basis a physical test. Before however the results from simulation and reality could be compared, three stages of the numerical model were numerically illustrated. In the first a dummy sat in an abstracted model of a vehicle interior. The models were extended up to the next model stage, in which a whole vehicle was represented by ellipsoids and by the numeric model of a EEVC Side Impact barrier. However it was recognized that the complex technical and geometrical structures of a vehicle body can be better illustrated by the finite element analysis method (FEA). Accordingly, FEA was used in the next model stage, which confirmed at the same time the numeric representation of the side impact model. After satisfying security of the numeric model twelve simulations were accomplished, in which different parameters were changed. Vehicle mass, barrier impact speed, the front of the bullet vehicle and the point of impact were changed. Measurement results of two EUROSID and the deformation mode of the target vehicle were evaluated in these parameter variations. It was shown that against expectation an even and wide intrusion did not always affect the Dummy results positively. From these parameter variations one case was selected and conducted a physical test for validation. This case represents "worst case" for the target vehicle, since in this impact configuration the bullet vehicle is over-riding the side sill of the target vehicle. The results from simulation and reality show to a large extent good agreements regarding deformations and the kinematics of both vehicles and dummies. A suggestion on the improvement of the compatibility in side impacts was realised. This consisted of filling the side sill of the target vehicle with polyurethane foam to stiffen the side sill and provide additional energy absorption potential at the same time. Thus both intrusion and lateral acceleration of the target vehicle were reduced. Both reduced the occupant load in the target vehicle. The best foam specification was identified by parameter variations with the target of minimising the occupant load. The effectiveness of this measure could be proven. In order to confirm the results, a final validation test was carried out. It can be stated that the used numerical models, in particular for the selected task, were well suitable. The results of this work support the statement that the selected measure – to fill the side sill with a suitable foam – improves the compatibility in side impacts...|$|E
