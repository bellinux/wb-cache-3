25|$|If a rapid {{reduction}} of volume is required, <b>paracentesis</b> {{is the preferred}} option. This procedure requires the insertion of a plastic tube into the peritoneal cavity. Human albumin solution is usually given to prevent complications from the rapid volume reduction. In addition to being more rapid than diuretics, 4–5 liters of <b>paracentesis</b> is more successful in comparison to diuretic therapy.|$|E
25|$|Exudative ascites {{generally}} {{does not}} respond to manipulation of the salt balance or diuretic therapy. Repeated <b>paracentesis</b> and treatment of the underlying cause is the mainstay of treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} severe (tense) ascites, {{therapeutic}} <b>paracentesis</b> {{may be needed}} in addition to medical treatments listed above. As this may deplete serum albumin levels in the blood, albumin is generally administered intravenously {{in proportion to the}} amount of ascites removed.|$|E
25|$|CT {{scanning}} {{is preferred}} {{to assess the}} extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used. CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and <b>paracentesis</b> are of limited use; in fact, <b>paracentesis</b> can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results. However, <b>paracentesis</b> can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present. A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations. However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.|$|E
25|$|Ascites is {{generally}} treated while an underlying cause is sought, {{in order to}} prevent complications, relieve symptoms, and prevent further progression. In patients with mild ascites, therapy is usually as an outpatient. The goal is weight loss of no more than 1.0nbsp&kg/day for patients with both ascites and peripheral edema and no more than 0.5nbsp&kg/day for patients with ascites alone. In those with severe ascites causing a tense abdomen, hospitalization {{is generally}} necessary for <b>paracentesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Routine {{complete}} {{blood count}} (CBC), basic metabolic profile, liver enzymes, and coagulation should be performed. Most experts recommend a diagnostic <b>paracentesis</b> be performed if the ascites is new or if the patient with ascites is being admitted to the hospital. The fluid is then reviewed for its gross appearance, protein level, albumin, and cell counts (red and white). Additional tests will be performed if indicated such as microbiological culture, Gram stain and cytopathology.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial and fungal {{infection}}s {{are common in}} ALF, with one study demonstrating culture-proven infection in 80% of ALF patients. Defective cellular and humoral immunity as well as presence of indwelling catheters, coma, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and medications that suppress immunity all predispose to infection. Localizing symptoms of infection such as fever and sputum production are frequently absent and the only clues to an underlying infectious process may be worsening of encephalopathy or renal function. There must be a low threshold for obtaining frequent cultures (blood, urine, and sputum), chest radiographs, and <b>paracentesis.</b> Bacteria that enter through the skin, such as streptococci and staphylococci, tend to predominate. Aggressive surveillance is essential as prophylactic antibiotics have shown little benefit. Fungal infections, particularly {{in the setting of}} broad-spectrum antibiotics, are also common, and disseminated fungemia is a poor prognostic sign.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{diagnosis}} of encephalopathy has been made, efforts are made to exclude underlying causes (such as listed above in [...] "causes"). This requires blood tests (urea and electrolytes, full blood count, liver function tests), usually a chest X-ray, and urinalysis. If there is ascites, diagnostic <b>paracentesis</b> (removal of a fluid sample with a needle) {{may be required to}} identify spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).|$|E
500|$|Certain {{precipitants}} of HRS {{have been}} identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. These include bacterial infection, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. [...] Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is the infection of ascites fluid, is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals. [...] HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: iatrogenic precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of diuretic medications or the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid by <b>paracentesis</b> from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement.|$|E
500|$|The risk {{of death}} in hepatorenal {{syndrome}} is very high; consequently, {{there is a significant}} emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. [...] As infection (specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications [...] to prevent HRS. [...] Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable. [...] The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided. [...] In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS. [...] Also, large volume paracentesis—which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. [...] The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume <b>paracentesis</b> and may prevent HRS. [...] Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins.|$|E
2500|$|Although most {{commonly}} due to cirrhosis, severe liver disease or metastatic cancer, its presence {{can be a}} sign of other significant medical problems, such as Budd–Chiari syndrome. Diagnosis of the cause is usually with blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the abdomen, and direct removal of the fluid by needle, or <b>paracentesis</b> (which may also be therapeutic). Treatment may be with medication (diuretics), <b>paracentesis,</b> or other treatments directed at the cause. The term is from Greek askítes meaning [...] "baglike".|$|E
2500|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} can {{be treated}} with palliative surgery (colostomy, ileostomy, or internal bypass) or medicine, but surgery {{has been shown to}} increase survival time. Palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or re-obstruction; or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction. Other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition, a low-residue diet, palliative gastrostomy, and adequate pain control. Bowel obstruction can also be treated with octreotide when palliative surgery is not an option. Cancer can also block the ureters, which can be relieved by a nephrostomy or a ureteric stent. Ascites can be relieved by repeated <b>paracentesis</b> or placement of a drain to increase comfort. Pleural effusions can [...] be treated in a similar manner, with repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis, or placement of a drain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Paracentesis</b> (from Greek κεντάω, [...] "to pierce") {{is a form}} of {{body fluid}} {{sampling}} procedure, generally referring to peritoneocentesis (also called laparocentesis or abdominal <b>paracentesis)</b> in which the peritoneal cavity is punctured by a needle to sample peritoneal fluid.|$|E
