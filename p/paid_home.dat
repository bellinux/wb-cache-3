40|$|Abstract: The {{transition}} from the traditional pre-industrial to modern phase of development of society in India has in many ways changed {{the social context of}} the adjustment of the aged. In India, the elderly population depends heavily on the family for economic and emotional support. With joint family system, slowly diminishing the elderly are now being placed in ‘Homes’ and left to the care of such Organizations. This study compares the living conditions and nutritional status of elderly in selected <b>paid</b> and unpaid <b>homes</b> in Chennai, India. The living conditions and physical facilities provided are also assessed and compared. The nutritional status of one hundred and forty elderly from <b>paid</b> and unpaid <b>homes</b> was assessed using subjective, anthropometric and clinical parameters. The BMI of the elderly in unpaid homes was within the normal range of 17. 5 to 24. 9 kg/m 2. It was found that the women in the age group of 52 to 64 years had higher BMI than their older in both the sexes. The women in the 75 + age group range were malnourished while the rest were normal in <b>paid</b> <b>homes.</b> The clinical signs of nutritional disorders were, in general, not specific and mostly associated with old age. The awareness levels of elderly in nutrition knowledge revealed a mean 36 %. Significant differences were observed between homes on their opinion towards food provided, physical facilities available, nutritional knowledge and sanitary conditions. However, individual differences were also observed within the homes in all the criteria assessed...|$|R

Data from two studies were combined because of similarities in sample characteristics and interview questions and because data from the second study included both positive and negative experi-ences with home care providers. The authors find that caregivers perceived that good-quality <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> care facilitated enhanced quality of life for care recipients and improved perceptions of their performances as caregivers. When <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> care was of poor quality, caregivers felt more stress and increased their monitoring of providers.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} how {{the amount of}} informal care received by disabled elders changes when they are receiving publicly <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> care, and whether formal service use, disability, caregiving arrangements, and demographic characteristics of older adults predict changes {{in the amount of}} informal care. Design and Methods: Hierarchical linear models were estimated, using 3 -year data (12 repeated observations) collected from elderly partic-ipants (N = 888) in Michigan’s Home- and Commu-nity-Based Medicaid Waiver Program. Results: The amount of informal care declined in the beginning period when publicly <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> care was received, and then it stabilized. Changes in activities and instrumental activities of daily living and caregiver residence predicted changes in the amount. The living arrangement and age of elders predicted different patterns of change over time. Neither formal service amount nor its change significantly predicted the amount of informal care. Implications: Informal caregivers do not relinquish caregiving when publicly <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> care is available. Expanding community-based long-term care is a means of fostering partner-ships between formal and informal caregivers. Key Words: Home- and community-based care...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} income on the long-term care utilization of elderly Americans using a natural experiment that led otherwise similar retirees to receive significantly different Social Security payments based on their year of birth. Using data from the 1993 and 1995 waves of the AHEAD, we estimate instrumental variables models and find that a positive permanent income shock lowers nursing home use but increases the utilization of <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> care services. We find some suggestive evidence that the effects are due to substitution of home care for nursing home utilization. The magnitude of these estimates suggests that moderate reductions in post-retirement income would significantly alter long-term utilization patterns among elderly individuals. ...|$|E

The research shows that age, Medicare coverage, and the use of assistive technology are the strongest predictors of mode of residence. The second analysis shows that total expenditures for <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> health care (HHC) and hospital care do not decrease as expected when the percentage paid by individuals and/or their families increases.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the extent to}} which publicly provided formal (<b>paid)</b> <b>home</b> care substitutes for unpaid care provided informally by family and friends. Unlike most previous research, we recognize that the choice among alternative combinations of formal and informal care depends on the type of living arrangement chosen, and that these living arrangement choices in turn are influenced by the public provision of formal home care. Using data from a social experiment, we find that a generous public home care program significantly increases the probability that unmarried persons will live independently and reduces the probability of living in shared households or in nursing or personal care homes. However, any substitution effects-either direct effects on provision of informal care given living arrangement or indirect effects due to living arrangement changes-appear to be small. ...|$|E

We consider a sample of households with a dependent elderly person cared for either at home or in a residential home, extracted from a survey representative of the population of Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region.

We estimate two model specifications, based on a simultaneous and a sequential decision process respectively, the results of which are fairly consistent. Disability related variables, rather than family characteristics, emerge as the main determinants of institutionalisation. On the other hand, household characteristics and socio-economic variables are more influential when it comes to choosing between informal and formal home care provisions...|$|E

More than 54 million adults in the UnitedStates provided care for an elderly, disabled,or chronically ill relative or friend last year (National Family Caregivers Association, 2000).

40|$|The report {{begins with}} a brief {{overview}} of the social care system in England, providing in particular evidence about unpaid carers (mostly family members, but sometimes friends or neighbours) and the <b>paid</b> <b>home</b> care workers, who support older, sick or disabled people of all ages in their own homes. The variety of ways in which ICT (including telecare) has begun to be used to support those involved in providing domiciliary care is then described, highlighting both major publicly-funded initiatives and investments, and some of the approaches embraced by voluntary and private sector organisations. Eight concise case studies are provided to illustrate more in depth the range of different ways in which these new developments are contributing to the support available to carers and care workers, including through online dialogue and debate among carers. The last part of the report addresses the particular focus on immigrant and ethnic minority carers and care workers, presenting some evidence from the range of available statistical data on this topic (and notes the limitations of the available statistics).
