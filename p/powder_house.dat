25|$|For over a century, New Haven {{citizens}} {{had fought}} in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces, as in the French and Indian War. As the American Revolution approached, General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion. On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as <b>Powder</b> <b>House</b> Day, the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the governing British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the <b>powder</b> <b>house</b> to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven {{on his way to}} Cambridge. Contemporary reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers' professional military bearing, including uniforms.|$|E
25|$|Gunpowder {{production}} in Britain {{appears to have}} started in the mid 14th century {{with the aim of}} supplying the English Crown. Records show that, in England, gunpowder was being made in 1346 at the Tower of London; a <b>powder</b> <b>house</b> existed at the Tower in 1461; and in 1515 three King's gunpowder makers worked there. Gunpowder was also being made or stored at other Royal castles, such as Portchester. By the early 14th century, according to N.J.G. Pounds's study The Medieval Castle in England and Wales, many English castles had been deserted and others were crumbling. Their military significance faded except on the borders. Gunpowder had made smaller castles useless.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Jazz Festival (described above), New Haven serves as the home city of the annual International Festival of Arts and Ideas. New Haven's Saint Patrick's Day parade, which began in 1842, is New England's oldest St. Patty's Day parade and draws the largest crowds of any one-day spectator event in Connecticut. The St. Andrew the Apostle Italian Festival {{has taken place in}} the historic Wooster Square neighborhood every year since 1900. Other parishes in the city celebrate the Feast of Saint Anthony of Padua and a carnival in honor of St. Bernadette Soubirous. New Haven celebrates <b>Powder</b> <b>House</b> Day every April on the New Haven Green to commemorate the city's entrance into the Revolutionary War. The annual Wooster Square Cherry Blossom Festival commemorates the 1973 planting of 72 Yoshino Japanese cherry blossom trees by the New Haven Historic Commission in collaboration with the New Haven Parks Department and residents of the neighborhood. The Festival now draws well over 5,000 visitors. The Film Fest New Haven has been held annually since 1995.|$|E
500|$|In March 1775, a {{group of}} 65 New Haven {{residents}} formed the Governor's Second Company of Connecticut Guards. Arnold was chosen as their captain, and he organized training and exercises in preparation for war. [...] On April 21, 1775, news reached New Haven of the opening battles of the revolution at Lexington and Concord. [...] Arnold's company formed up to march to Boston the next day, but the town council would not release any gunpowder to them. [...] In a confrontation between Arnold and David Wooster that is reenacted in New Haven every <b>Powder</b> <b>House</b> Day, Arnold successfully argued with the older man {{that he would take}} the powder one way or another. [...] The magazine was opened, Arnold's company was armed, and they marched off to Boston.|$|E
500|$|There {{were several}} places {{throughout}} the colonies where the British army had stockpiled supplies.

[...] One locked storehouse near Boston, in what was then part of Charlestown, now <b>Powder</b> <b>House</b> Square in Somerville, was controlled by William Brattle, the leader of the provincial militia and an appointee of the governor. [...] Brattle, who had not obviously sided with either Loyalists or Patriots, notified Governor Gage in a letter dated August 27 that the provincial ("King's") powder was the only supply remaining in that storehouse, as the towns had removed all of theirs. [...] Gage decided that this powder had to be brought to Boston for safekeeping.|$|E
50|$|The Village of Glenwillow {{was carved}} out of Solon Township and {{established}} in 1893 as a company town by Austin Powder Company. As the population in surrounding areas, particularly the city of Solon, increased, Austin Powder was unable to test its explosive products. It moved its manufacturing operations to Athens, Ohio, and closed its Glenwillow plant in 1972. In the 1980s, the village installed infrastructural and utility improvements and added a 250 acre industrial park. Served by the Solon City Schools, a system consistently rated {{as one of the}} 100 best schools in the U.S. by publications such as Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, the village has since experienced residential development. In the early 2000s, the village received significant investment through mixed-use development, including renovation of the former Austin <b>Powder</b> <b>housing</b> stock and general store into boutiques, a restaurant, a tavern and a coffee shop, in conjunction with a new town center, village park and new housing in a town plan layout.|$|R

500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of September 1, a force of roughly 260 British regulars from the 4th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Maddison, were rowed in secrecy up the Mystic River from Boston to a landing point near Winter Hill in modern-day Somerville. [...] From there they marched about a mile to the <b>Powder</b> <b>House,</b> a {{gunpowder}} magazine that held the largest supply of gunpowder in Massachusetts. Phips gave the King's Troops the keys to the building, and after sunrise they removed all of the gunpowder. [...] Most of the regulars then returned to Boston the way they had come, but a small contingent marched to Cambridge, removed two field pieces, and took them to Boston by foot over the Great Bridge and up Boston Neck. [...] The field pieces and powder were then taken from Boston to the British stronghold on Castle Island, then known as Castle William (renamed Fort Independence in 1779).|$|E

5000|$|In 1909, {{residents}} of Kenosha County brought {{suit against the}} company {{on the grounds that}} the plant was a public menace. The suit was won by the company. On March 9, 1911, most of the town was destroyed by the explosion of five magazines holding 280 tons of dynamite and 105,000 kegs of black <b>powder</b> <b>housed</b> at the plant. The explosions rendered most houses within five miles of the blast center uninhabitable. Several hundred people were injured, and one plant employee, E. S. [...] "Old Man" [...] Thompson, was killed. A crater 100 feet deep was blasted under the former dynamite house. Damage estimates were put at $1,500,000, equivalent to $37,000,000 in 2015. Almost equal damage was done in Bristol four miles west. The force of the explosion was felt more than 100 miles in every direction and was heard as far away as Ohio and Iowa. Concerns about looting and vandalism by curiosity seekers prompted Kenosha County Sheriff Andrew Stahl to impress a hundred deputies and clear the village. It was believed the first explosion took place in the glaze house where more than 1,100 kegs of powder were dried in steel cylinders. One steel cylinder crashed through the roof of the general store of H. A. and E. A. King, tearing a hole five feet in diameter through the roof, the first and second floor and into the earth. H. A. King, in an adjoining room, was thrown to the floor unconscious by the shock. Phil Hess, a farmer near Truesdell, Wisconsin over two miles from the factory, lost his right ear, severed by a piece of flying glass as he was entering his home. J. H.

The Cromwellians established a new fortification on the Connacht bank of the river leading up to the plantation of Connacht in 1654.

25|$|The great {{explosion}} of 1898 {{started in the}} smokeless powder plant at 5:15 PM on April 26.

Many buildings used to house company employees were set afire and a community effort was required by residents of Santa Cruz to prevent fires from reaching powder magazines closer to the city. The explosion caused apprehension among Santa Cruz residents about the safety of operating the powder works so close to the city. Santa Cruz County closed the powder works school and required <b>powder</b> works employee <b>housing</b> facilities to be vacated.|$|R

Bulule, a waste of the mixture of cereal grains (tef, wheat, barley, maize, oats etc.) <b>powder</b> of mill <b>houses</b> was used only by small size farms (P <  0.05) due to its low price. The respondents stated that feeding bulule has improved milk production of dairy cows.
