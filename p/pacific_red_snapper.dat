40|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus peru, is {{a commercially}} {{important}} species throughout its distribution range, {{making it a}} good alternative for aquaculture; however, there is few information regarding environmental conditions and their influence on early development of this species. Temperature {{is one of the}} main factors affecting embryo and larval development in marine fishes. In this paper, the effects of different temperatures upon hatching rate, growth, consumption of yolk sac and oil droplet and the formation of the digestive system and eye pigmentation were evaluated in larvae of this species under experimental conditions. Eggs incubated between 20 and 32 °C showed hatching rates higher than 90 %. However, larvae maintained at 26 °C showed significantly larger notochord length and were the first to complete the pigmentation of the eyes and the formation of the digestive system when still possessing enough reserves in the yolk sac. Therefore, according to the results obtained, it is recommended that the incubation of eggs and larval rearing in <b>Pacific</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> takes place between 25 and 26 °C...|$|E

Sagittal otoliths from four populations of the <b>Pacific</b> deep slope <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> Etelis carbunculus Cuvier were compared using Fourier descriptors and other shape indices, linear proportions, and dry weight. Otoliths from Hawaii, Vanuatu, Fi j i and French Polynesia and a small number from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-ianas Islands (NMI) were examined. Regional shape and weight characteristics were distinguishable, despite {{the wide range of}} individual variation and limited available size range from some regions. Size-specific {{differences in}} otolith shape were found for the four regions for which a sufficient sample was available. Otoliths from Hawaii, French Polynesia, and NMI showed a significant shape affinity. Otoliths from Fij i and Vanuatu were similarly shaped and were distinct from those from the other three regions. Interregional otolith shape affinities for the stocks examined parallel similarities in maximum size and growth rate from the literature, suggesting that growth rate may influence otolith shape. Observed trends in otolith weight as a function of fish length support growth-related regional differences in otolith shape.

40|$|A ten-year study (2005 to 2015) was {{conducted}} to examine the timing of puberty and reproductive performance in <b>Pacific</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus peru. Wild young juveniles reared in a 200 m 3 lined-pond from 2005 were captured and spawned {{over the next three}} consecutive years, starting in 2009. The study continued in hatchery-reared red snappers from the 2010 progenies that spawned in 2014. In wild-reared and hatchery-reared red snapper, puberty occurred in both sexes at three years and nine months. In a pond, eight wild-reared females had on average 54 days of broadcast spawning, which corresponded to 0. 276 M viable eggs per day. Each female had on average 1. 838 million (M) viable eggs, and a relative fecundity of 0. 555 M eggs/kg yielding 0. 010 M eggs/kg per spawn. All wild-reared males (n = 22) had running sperm. In progeny hatchery-reared red snapper, nine females had vitellogenic oocytes, but only three reproduced. Ninety percent of hatchery-reared males (n= 31) had running sperm.

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a set of}} hypervariable microsatellite markers for the <b>Pacific</b> <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus peru), an economically important marine fish for small-scale fisheries in {{the west coast of}} Mexico. We performed shotgun genome sequencing with the 454 XL titanium chemistry and used bioinformatic tools to search for perfect microsatellite loci. We selected 66 primer pairs that were synthesized and genotyped in an ABI PRISM 3730 XL DNA sequencer in 32 individuals from the Gulf of California. We estimated levels of genetic diversity, deviations from linkage and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, estimated the frequency of null alleles and the probability of individual identity for the new markers. We reanalyzed 16 loci in 16 individuals to estimate genotyping error rates. Eighteen loci failed to amplify, 16 loci were discarded due to unspecific amplifications and 32 loci (14 tetranucleotide and 18 dinucleotide) were successfully scored. The average number of alleles per locus was 21 (+/- 6. 87, SD) and ranged from 8 to 34. The average observed and expected heterozygosities were 0. 787 (+/- 0. 144 SD, range 0. 250 - 0. 935) and 0. 909 (+/- 0. 122 SD, range 0. 381 - 0. 965), respectively. No significant linkage was detected. Eight loci showed deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and from these, four loci showed moderate null allele frequencies (0. 104 - 0. 220). The probability of individual identity for the new loci was 1. 46 (- 62). Genotyping error rates averaged 9. 58 %.

In muscle tissue of red snapper and English sole, {{it was clear that}} initially TMAO decreased during storage at 4 °C, while the amounts of TMA, DMA, and FA increased. When these species were stored at -S°C, only a slight decrease. in the amount of TMAO was measured. Less TMA was formed at -S°C than at 4 °C. There was no DMA production in these two species at -S°C and the amount of FA that was formed was significantly less (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than that formed when the storage temperature was 4 °C. In the muscle tissue of the trout, no TMAO, TMA, nor DMA was recovered at both storage temperatures. There was no significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) between the amounts of FA recovered from the trout stored at both storage temperatures. The amount of FA recovered from all of the species decreased significantly after 7 days at 4 °C and 50 days at - 5 °C. FA values may be used as an indication of freshness in those fish species which do not produce TMA during storage. TMA was not produced in the tissue of the English sole and the red snapper during frozen storage. No TMA was recovered from the tissues of the trout stored at 4 °C and - 5 °C. In order to obtain reliable data, FA values would have to be determined for each species and each storage condition. FA values would only be reliable if measured before incipient spoilage takes place (7 days at 4 °C and 50 days at - 5 °C).

Specifically, we examined the effects of fish size, commercial shrimp trawling, and habitat type on total Hg concentrations and stable nitrogen isotope ratios (d 15 N; a proxy for trophic position) in <b>red</b> <b>snapper.</b> Red snapper Hg concentrations and d 15 N values were positively and significantly correlated with fish size. In addition, <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> collected over trawled habitats had significantly higher Hg concentrations and d 15 N values than did <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> collected from similar, nontrawled habitats. Red snapper also exhibited habitat-specific differences in Hg concentrations and d 15 N values, but differences were size dependent and generally small. Our study suggests that the Hg concentrations of juvenile <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> in the northern GOM are elevated in areas where commercial shrimp trawling occurs, possibly due to increases in both <b>red</b> <b>snapper</b> trophic position and bioavailable Hg in trawled areas.

Weight distribution ranged from 1. 5 to 18. 5 pounds with a mean of 5. 81 pounds for retained fish and 0. 20 to 6 pounds with a mean of 1. 57 pounds for discarded fish.
