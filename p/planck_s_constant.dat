Our constraints for the second derivative of Newton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant</b> at the present day, assuming it is slowly evolving as suggested by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints, using the WiggleZ data is (eff) (t(0)) = - 1. 19 +/- 0. 95. 10 (- 20) h(2) yr(- 2), where h is defined via H- 0 = 100 h kms(- 1) Mpc(- 1), while using both the WiggleZ and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (SDSS LRG) data is (eff) (t(0)) = - 3. 6 +/- 6. 8. 10 (- 21) h(2) yr(- 2), both being consistent with General Relativity.

40|$|For any {{physical}} theory, to experimentally check its validity, {{we need to}} formulate an alternative theory and check whether the experimental {{results are consistent with}} the original theory or with an alternative theory. In particular, to check whether energy is preserved, it is necessary to formulate an alternative theory in which energy is not preserved. Formulating such a theory is not an easy task in quantum physics, where the usual Schroedinger equation implicitly assumes the existence of an energy (Hamiltonian) operator whose value is preserved. In this paper, we show {{that the only way to}} get a consistent quantum theory with energy non-conservation is to use Heisenberg representation in which operators representing physical quantities change in time. We prove that in this representation, energy is preserved if and only if Planck 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>constant</b> remains a constant.
