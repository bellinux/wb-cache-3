50|$|Failures {{that occur}} {{early in the}} life of a new product are vital {{information}} for the manufacturer to improve the product. New product development aims to eliminate defects by testing in the factory before launch, but some may occur during its early life. Testing products to simulate their behavior in the external environment is a difficult skill, and may involve accelerated life testing for example. The worst kind of defect to occur after launch is a safety-critical defect, a defect that can endanger life or limb. Their discovery usually leads to a product recall or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Product defects often follow the bathtub curve, with high initial failures, a lower rate during regular life, followed by another rise due to wear-out. National standards, such as those of ASTM and the British Standards Institute, and International Standards can help the designer in increasing <b>product</b> <b>integrity.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to {{identify}} the most important variables affecting the internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> in the case of coated grades for coldset web offset printing. Internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> was experimentally identified to mean in this work printing runnability and visual print quality. Printing runnability was experimentally defined to mean build-up formation tendency on the surface of the common impression cylinder (CIC) at satellite type coldset printing machines. Visual print quality was defined to mean set-off, print-through, contrast, dot-gain, evenness of printed surface and reproducibility of colors. The objectives {{of this study}} had significant commercial value and therefore the entire experimental part was carried out on industrial scale. This experimental set-up was aiming to speed-up the application of potential findings to industrial scale and to facilitate the exploitation of the results since the time consuming and risky step of scaling the laboratory results to industrial scale could be skipped over. The experimental part of this work consists of four parts: Pilot coating of industrial base papers, printing tests in commercial coldset printing process, comparison of print quality potential of different printing methods (coldset, waterless coldset and heatset) and laboratory analyses of base paper, unprinted and printed coldset samples. Laboratory analyses included structural tests, absorption tests, various microscopic methods, permeability tests, confocal Raman analyses and various printability tests. The results of the print quality testing showed that matt LWC printed in coldset reaches such a qualitative level that it allows the printer to exceed the technical obstacles by which the new business models are often confronted. It was further identified that coating pigments and base paper properties have influence on internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> of matt LWC paper in coldset printing. The influence of coating pigments as a single variable in the fine tuning of the internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> was smaller than expected. The influence of coating pigments on the internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> is most likely depending on the base paper properties. A natural area for future studies would be to identify the most important paper technological variables influencing the internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> via base paper properties. Latex properties as single variables did not have clear influence on internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity.</b> Latex coverage had some influence to the internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity.</b> Therefore, experimental designs profiting latex properties as multivariable parameters could bring new knowledge to the fine tuning of the internal <b>product</b> <b>integrity.</b> Printing paper manufacturers should shift the technical testing of product prototypes to industrial scale from laboratory scale. Creation of a new product in printing paper industry should approach the standard concurrent engineering processes, where new product is widely tested in industrial scale after the innovation phase, but before market launch. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The asset {{management}} industry has reached an impasse {{in the wake}} of the financial crisis and the extensive, ongoing revision of EU regulation. Much rides on its ability to make investment funds deliver better results to its investors. Distribution remains the major stumbling block, but action is also needed to promote the contribution of {{asset management}} to the real economy and to preserve financial stability. In response to these challenges, CEPS and ECMI formed a Task Force composed of market participants, international experts, regulators and academics who met regularly throughout 2011 to closely examine the workings of the asset management industry and its contribution to the EU economy. This report draws the link between asset management and several key issues: financial stability, <b>product</b> <b>integrity,</b> investor protection and the real economy. It evaluates the many legislative proposals that are currently under consideration – including implementation of the alternative investment fund managers Directive (AIFMD), the review of the markets in financial instruments Directive (MiFID II) and packaged retail investment products (PRIPS) – as well as the discussions on <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> in UCITS and ‘shadow banking’.

40|$|Worldwide, {{the demand}} for organic food {{products}} has expanded rapidly in the past decade, stimulated by consumer perceptions that organic products are safer, cleaner and more ethical than conventional products. The demand for organic products {{is estimated to be}} growing at a rate of 15 - 20 per cent per annum, with sales reaching $US 23 billion in 2002. The biggest growth in consumption has occurred in developed countries such as the United States and Europe, which are major importers of organic foods. Australia, as a major exporter of agricultural products, stands to benefit from this expansion in demand. However, {{little is known about the}} organic industry by other agribusinesses and little research on organics has been conducted in Australia, especially compared to the United States and Europe. The objective of this paper is to provide a contemporary overview of the Australian organic food products industry, including production, marketing and certification of organic foods.

Areas identified for further research include data collection and reporting of production, consumption and trade of organic products, consumer and producer attitudes towards, and expectations of, organic farming, <b>product</b> <b>integrity</b> and labelling regulation, competition from other sustainable farming systems, and future industry structure of the organic sector. Outputs from the research will provide market information to the organic industry that helps identify marketing opportunities and develop strategies for meeting market requirements and sustaining industry growth.
