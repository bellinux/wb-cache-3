40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of hydrocolloid addition on rheological properties and breadmaking performance of rice-buckwheat batter. Xanthan gum (XG) and <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>alginate</b> (PGA) were added to rice-buckwheat blend (60 : 40) at levels of 0. 5 and 1 %. Batter rheological properties were investigated using dynamic measurements in the linear viscoelastic range (frequency sweep and time cure tests). The addition of both hydrocolloids significantly enhanced the storage modulus (G’) of batter. XG exerted greater effect on G’ than PGA. Tan  was not affected by XG. Addition of PGA resulted in increasing both elastic and liquid-like behaviours. Different effects on starch gelatinisation were observed for the two hydrocolloids. PGA-breads showed higher improvement in terms of increased specific volume, decreased crumb firmness and crumb structure than XG-bread...|$|E
40|$|For {{many of the}} polysaccharides with {{reported}} {{surface active}} and emulsifying properties, this {{has been attributed to}} an associated protein fraction. However, certain polysaccharides, such as chitosans and <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>alginates,</b> possess inherent amphiphilic properties. These polysaccharides have the potential of acting as sole stabilizers in dispersed two-phase systems such as O/W emulsions and foams by virtue of combing their interfacial and gel forming properties, thereby omitting the use of surfactants and conveying system interconnectivity and increased long-term stability. In this thesis the potential for exploiting the total functionality of these polysaccharides were evaluated. The emulsion destabilizing and stabilizing properties of chitosan were investigated. Chitosans efficacy in inducing flocculation and creaming in an O/W emulsion was evaluated and it was found that flocculation was more pronounced at lower chitosan concentrations for chitosans of higher fractions of acetylation (FA). It was concluded that under the given conditions the mechanism of flocculation was bridging flocculation mediated by hydrophobic acetyl-rich stretches of chitosan chains. Secondly, an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion was prepared with chitosan (FA 0. 5) as the sole emulsifier. On the optical tweezers (pH 5) emulsion droplets displayed a high degree of stability as well as adaptability to external influence. The observations highlight the suitability of highly acetylated chitosan as emulsifier in O/W emulsions. Chitosan gels (FA 0. 5) covalently crosslinked with diethyl squarate (DES) were rheologically described with respect to gelling kinetics, mechanical properties and long term stability as a function of variable DES concentration and molecular weight (Mw). More rigid gels were formed for higher concentration of DES and higher Mw due to formation of a more optimal gel lattice. The gels were highly stable for 12 months in isotonic buffer at 40 °C. A series of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>alginates</b> (PGA) were characterized as a function of their degree of esterification (D. E.). The measured surface tension decreased with increasing D. E. The apparent equilibrium shear storage modulus values for PGA gels decreased with increasing D. E. While the PGAs of low and intermediate D.

30|$|The results {{presented}} here indicate that detection of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{is common in}} hospital patients, particularly those managed from drug overdoses or other toxic ingestions. The major source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> comes from iatrogenic administration of poorly water-soluble medications, especially intravenous lorazepam used for sedation. Intravenous formulations of lorazepam may contain up to 80 % (v/v) <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> Other intravenous medications that may contain <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> include diazepam, etomidate, and phenytoin (Al-Khafaji et al. 2002; Arbour 1999; Chicella et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2002). Another source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is activated charcoal preparations that use <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as the excipient to make the charcoal less gritty and easier to administer (Krasowski et al. 2012). Although the toxic plasma concentration of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is not well-defined, toxicity has been reported with plasma concentrations as low as 100  mg/dL (Zar et al. 2007). However, even if not directly toxic, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> increases plasma osmolality and complicates the use of osmolal gap in clinical diagnosis and management, especially for patients receiving multiple doses of propylene glycol-containing medication, as may be done in intubated patients requiring extended sedation (Krasowski et al. 2012). <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> has also been reported as an interferent in enzyme assays for ethylene glycol (Malandain & Cano 1996; Juenke et al. 2011). Our study demonstrates that <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> may be detected in patients who have ingested ethylene glycol, with iatrogenic drugs such as intravenous lorazepam or activated charcoal being common sources of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> These findings illustrate the importance of specific assays for determination of ethylene glycol in human samples.|$|R

In order to stabilise pink guava juice (PGJ), fifteen combinations of stabilisers which consist of six stabilisers namely guar gum (GG), carboxylmethylcellulose (CMC), arabic gum (AG), xanthan gum (XG), <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>alginate</b> (PGA) and pectin were applied into PGJ in different ratios. Three emulsifiers namely arabic gum (AG), polysorbate 80 (P 80) and <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>alginate</b> (PGA) were used to emulsify vitamin E in PGJ. Selection of the most suitable combination of stabilisers and emulsifiers added in PGJ was conducted followed by ultrasonic homogenisation process. In the phase 2, the sensory evaluation of PGJ that contained suitable amount of stabiliser, emulsifier and vitamin E was evaluated and continued by phase 3 where the determination of some physco-chemical properties changes during 180 days of storage at 5 °C, 15 °C and 25 °C (i. e viscosity, emulsion stability, colour stability and loss of vitamin E). Results in phase 1 showed that PGJ contained protein (0. 67 ± 0. 15 %), carbohydrate (4. 96 ± 0. 59 %), fat (0. 27 ± 0. 05 %), total fiber (0. 74 ± 0. 10 %), ash (0. 64 ± 0. 10 %), moisture (92. 72 ± 0. 91 %), acidity (0. 41 ± 0. 10 %), pH (3. 65 ± 0. 12), TSS (10. 56 ± 0. 43), aw (0. 99 ± 0. 02), viscosity (15. 33 ± 1. 15 mPa. s), L* (31. 95 ± 0. 02), C* (34. 65 ± 0. 01) and H° (25. 42 ± 0. 02). Results showed that the amount of stabilisers used was 0. 2 % (w/v) and the most suitable combination of stabilisers added in PGJ were XG and CMC at the 70 : 30 mixture proportion. It was also revealed that P 80 was found to be the best emulsifier at the concentration of 0. 8 % (w/v).

The addition of PGA had a significant (p < 0. 05) effect on the creaming index at 55 °C, while PGA-stabilized (PGA 1) emulsions showed low creaming stability at both 25 °C and 55 °C. Conversely, the utilization of PGA either as a mixture or sole emulsifier, showed significantly (p < 0. 05) higher cloudiness, as larger average droplet size will affect the refractive index of the oil and aqueous phases. Additionally, the cloudiness was directly proportional to the mean droplet size of the dispersed phase. The inclusion of PGA into the formulation could have disrupted the properties of the interfacial film, thus resulting in larger droplet size.

30|$|<b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is {{chemically}} {{similar to}} ethylene glycol {{and is also}} used in some automobile antifreezes (Kraut & Kurtz 2008; Zar et al. 2007). <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is generally much less toxic than ethylene glycol and is found {{in a variety of}} products including beverages, cosmetics, ointments, activated charcoal preparations, and as a diluent for intravenous preparations of poorly water-soluble drugs such as diazepam, etomidate, and lorazepam. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> toxicity has been described in overdoses of propylene glycol-containing antifreeze (Brooks & Wallace 2002). A number of studies have detailed <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> toxicity from repeated intravenous administrations of medications containing <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as the diluent, particularly lorazepam used for extended sedation (e.g., intubated patients on mechanical ventilation) (Al-Khafaji et al. 2002; Arbour 1999; Chicella et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2002;Wilson et al. 2005).|$|R
5000|$|Forty-five {{percent of}} <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{produced}} {{is used as}} chemical feedstock {{for the production of}} unsaturated polyester resins. In this regard, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> reacts with a mixture of unsaturated maleic anhydride and isophthalic acid to give a copolymer. This partially unsaturated polymer undergoes further crosslinking to yield thermoset plastics. Related to this application, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> reacts with <b>propylene</b> oxide to give oligomers and polymers that are used to produce polyurethanes. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is used as a humectant (E1520), solvent, and preservative in food and for tobacco products. It {{is also one of the}} major ingredients (10-92%), along with vegetable glycerin, of the [...] "e-liquid" [...] and cartridges used in electronic cigarettes (as well as liquid nicotine), where it is aerosolized in the atomizer. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is also used in various edible items such as coffee-based drinks, liquid sweeteners, ice cream, whipped dairy products and soda. Vaporizers used for delivery of pharmaceuticals or personal-care products often include <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> among the ingredients. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals, including oral, injectable and topical formulations, such as for diazepam and lorazepam which are insoluble in water.

40|$|With {{an aging}} {{population}} venous ulceration {{is likely to become}} an increasing problem. Despite improvements in care and the widespread introduction of compression bandaging, the mainstay of current management, a significant proportion of venous leg ulcers remain hard to heal. Therefore, a single-blinded, randomized multicenter study was performed to compare wound size reduction using amelogenin proteins (Xelma) formulated into a solution which forms a temporary extracellular matrix on contact with the wound bed. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>alginate</b> 7 % served as a control. Patients were randomized to receive either amelogenin protein or control treatment. The investigational products were applied weekly under soft silicone secondary dressings for up to a maximum of 12 weeks. Compression therapy was maintained throughout the investigation. Wound size reduction was measured by tracing and all wounds were photographed. In total 123 patients were recruited, 62 patients in the amelogenin group, and 61 in the control group, respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed for ulcers with a size> 10 cm 2 at baseline and for ulcers of duration of > 12 months. The wound size reduction was greatest in the group treated with amelogenin (33. 8 vs. 25. 6 %, n= 117), this difference being greatest for larger ulcers (25 vs. 7. 9 % for ulcers> 10 cm(2), n= 61) and those of long duration (29. 3 vs. 10. 9 % for ulcers> 12 -month duration, n= 61).
