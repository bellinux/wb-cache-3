5|$|Although not the <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command,</b> {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident.

5|$|As {{would emerge}} in later {{testimony}} at the post-crash hearing, this crewing combination led to {{confusion in the}} cockpit during the final flight segment, as to who was making the decisions and giving the orders as <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command,</b> and who was operating the engine and fuel controls as flight engineer.|$|E
500|$|Since {{a medical}} {{certificate}} {{and a private}} pilot's license have a minimum age requirement of 16 and 17 respectively, the new rule prohibits [...] "child pilots" [...] such as Jessica Dubroff and Vicki Van Meter from manipulating the flight controls if they are pursuing a record, and the <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command's</b> <b>pilot</b> certificate may be revoked for allowing such activity.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{civilian}} professions—the most notable modern examples being merchant marine and civil aviation—also wear peaked caps. In such civilian old traditional usage, only captains aboard ships and <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> (airline captains) <b>in</b> service aboard aircraft, have the golden oak leaf motifs ("scrambled eggs") on the visor; {{this is in}} contrast to the naval tradition, where it is also worn by commanders (one rank below captain) as well as by commodores and flag officers.|$|R
5|$|The Lockheed Constellation L-049, {{like many}} airliners of its era, was {{normally}} crewed by three individuals: a captain (or <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command)</b> {{in the left}} seat, a first officer (also known as copilot) in the right seat, and a flight engineer in the rear seat. The accident flight crewing was unusual in several respects.|$|E
5|$|The flight's <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> was 34-year-old Captain Patrick Sondenheimer, who had {{ten years}} of flying {{experience}} (6,000 flight hours) flying A320s for Germanwings, Lufthansa, and Condor.

The <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command,</b> Jan Bjørstad, was 43 years old, had held a pilot's license since 1974 and had been employed in Widerøe since 1985. He had held a C certificate since 4 January 1993, and had been a <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> since 20 January.

50|$|April 8, 2003 St Louis, Missouri: an Aircraft Dassault Aviation DA-20C N179GA. The {{twin engine}} {{turbofan}} powered airplane was ditched into a river after a complete {{loss of power}} from both engines. Both pilots received serious injuries. The NTSB determined the probable cause(s). The <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command's</b> improper in-flight decision not to divert to an alternate destination resulting in the exhaustion of the airplane's fuel supply, and his failure to relay his low fuel state to air traffic control in a timely manner.|$|R
500|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the probable cause of the accident was Reid's [...] "improper decision to take off into deteriorating weather conditions (including turbulence, gusty winds, and an advancing thunderstorm and associated precipitation) when the airplane was overweight and when the density altitude was higher than he was accustomed to, resulting in a stall caused by failure to maintain airspeed." [...] The NTSB further determined that [...] "contributing to the <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command's</b> decision to take off was a desire to adhere to an overly ambitious itinerary, in part, because of media commitments." ...|$|R

The flight consisted of a crew of eleven, including a cockpit crew of four (two aircraft pilots, one engineer and one navigator), a cabin crew of five and two technicians.

5|$|At 8:24a.m. MDT, Reid's {{aircraft}} {{began its}} takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty crosswinds and turbulence. According to witnesses, the plane lifted off and climbed slowly, with its nose high and its wings wobbling. It began a gradual right turn, and after reaching {{an altitude of}} a few hundred feet, the plane rolled out of its turn, then descended rapidly, crashing at a near-vertical angle into Kornegay Court, a street in a residential neighborhood. Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid, who was legally the <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> for all of Dubroff's flights, was allegedly manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>In</b> aviation, <b>pilots</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> of {{a larger}} civil {{aircraft}} are usually addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] plus their full name or surname. This tradition is slowly diminishing in the United States and most EU countries. However, many countries, especially in Asia, follow this tradition and address airline pilots, military pilots, and flight instructors exclusively as [...] "Captain" [...] even outside of the professional environment. In addition, such countries' etiquette rules dictate that this title must be placed on all the official letters and social invitations, business cards, identification documents, etc. In the United States, when addressing a pilot, common etiquette {{does not require the}} title [...] "Captain" [...] to be printed on official letters or invitations before the addressee's full name. However, this is optional (akin to [...] "Esq" [...] after an attorney's name, in the U.S.) and may be used where appropriate, especially when addressing airline pilots with many years of experience.|$|R
5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew were not aware {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The <b>pilot</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the outbound track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E

40|$|Contingency {{analysis}} and reaction {{is a critical}} task {{to be carried out}} by any airplane to guarantee its safe operation in a non-segregated airspace. Pilot’s reactions to any kind of incidences that may occur in-flight, like engine malfunctions, loss of electrical power, hydraulic failure, unexpected weather, etc, will determine the fate of the flight. Nowadays, contingency reactions are mainly driven by the airplane manufacturer, with pre-analyzed contingency scenarios covered in the airplane documentation, and by ICAO’s rules as de-fined in the way flight plans should be prepared and landing alternatives implemented. Flight dispatching is the set of tasks related to flight preparation, such as load and balance, meteorology study and briefing, operational flight planning, contingency {{analysis and}} plan-ning, etc. However, managing contingencies on a UAS is a much more complex problem basically due to the automated nature of the vehicle and the lack of situational awareness that <b>pilot’s</b> <b>in</b> <b>command</b> should face.
