On 5 March 2010, it was announced that the park will open its doors at 8:28am (UTC+8) on 18 March 2010, for a soft-opening phase.

25|$|A similar {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} in environmental analysis of total economic value. Both {{costs and benefits}} can be diverse. Financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data. The net benefits of a project may incorporate cost savings or public willingness to pay compensation (implying the public has no legal right to {{the benefits of the}} policy) or willingness to accept compensation (implying the <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to the benefits of the policy) for the welfare change resulting from the policy. The guiding principle of evaluating benefits is to list all (categories of) parties affected by an intervention and add the (positive or negative) value, usually monetary, that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the First and the Seventh Circuits, both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals have held that the <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> First Amendment right to record public officials. In 2000, in Smith v. City of Cumming, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the First Amendment protects the right of citizens to film [...] the police. Likewise, in 1995, in Fordyce v. City of Seattle, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a private citizen could film police conduct at a protest because the First Amendment protects the [...] "right to film matters of public interest". However, both the Third Circuit in Kelly v. Borough of Carlisle (2010) and the Fourth Circuit in Szymecki v. Houck (2009) have held {{that even if the}} constitution protects the right to film the police, such a right was [...] "not clearly established for the purposes of qualified immunity in those cases’ factual contexts". Additionally, the Fifth Circuit ruled in Turner v. Driver (2017) that while the officers were entitled to qualified immunity in that case, the First Amendment protects the right to record police, subject only to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. Some scholars suggest these various rulings present the potential for a circuit split in cases that involve the filming of police conduct, while others have described the different rulings among circuit courts as [...] " [...] an artificial split—not on the merits of the First Amendment right violated, but on technical qualified immunity ground".|$|E

The Crown and the <b>public</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interest in these cases: the Crown <b>has</b> such <b>an</b> interest because, in Scotland, all fees on the registration of armorial bearings and pedigrees are payable to HM Treasury; the <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> interest {{in terms of the}} prevention of fraud and of the misappropriation of property.

2500|$|The {{majority}} {{also criticized}} Austin's reasoning that the [...] "distorting effect" [...] of large corporate expenditures constituted {{a risk of}} corruption or the appearance of corruption.

[...] The <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to have access to all information and to determine the reliability and importance of the information. Additionally, the majority did not believe that reliable evidence substantiated the risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, and so this rationale did not satisfy strict scrutiny.|$|E

2500|$|A multi-format points {{system was}} first {{introduced}} for the 2013 Women's Ashes series in England; the series consisted of one Test match, three One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for winning the Test match, with two points each if drawn, and two points for winning a limited overs match, and one point each if the match was drawn. Talking about the points system, then England captain Charlotte Edwards said [...] " [...] It preserves Test cricket, {{which is the most}} important thing, but equally we get to play the more popular formats which are one day and Twenty20 which the media and the <b>public</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> huge demand for." [...] England won the series 12–4 after the test match was drawn, Australia won one ODI and England won two ODIs and all three T20Is. The system was used again in the 2013–14 women's Ashes in Australia, with England winning 10–8, despite winning fewer matches; England won the test match, one ODI and one T20I, while Australia won two ODIs and two T20Is.|$|E
