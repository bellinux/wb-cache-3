40|$|The need {{to improve}} {{software}} productivity and reliability has become an area of in-creasing importance to the software engineering community. During the early phases of the software life cycle, {{there is a strong}} need to emphasize the usc of tools which provide a representation of the program structure that can be easily understood and modified. Thus, a significant usage of <b>Program</b> <b>Design</b> Languages (PDLs) as a design tool in practical en-vironments has surfaced in recent years.

40|$|Pair {{programming}} {{consists of}} two developers who collaborate with {{each other on the}} same <b>programming</b> task to <b>design</b> and code a solution. Previous pair programming experiments did not explore the efficacy of pairs in <b>program</b> <b>design</b> separately from coding, and most suffered from using students who were not full-time, professional programmers. Aptitude tests relevant to <b>program</b> <b>design</b> tasks have been shown to correlate with future programming performance and do not require skill in a particular computer language. Variations in programmer skill in a particular language or integrated development environment can interfere with interpreting results in pair programming experiments and mask the skill of subjects in <b>program</b> <b>design</b> related tasks. Two experiments were conducted with full-time professional programmers as subjects who worked on increasingly complex aptitude tasks related to problem solving and algorithmic design.
