5|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with writer Philip Stark. The episode {{was the first of}} a new slate of South Park episodes Parker and Stone made after Comedy Central agreed to {{permanently}} pick up the show. The duo were not happy with the episode, particularly the ending, and were surprised by the positive response it received from fans. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he also wanted the episode to convey, in part, that Halloween is a positive holiday for children.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew {{and so he did}} not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> it only made her feel more lonely and isolated.|$|E
25|$|Trey Parker and Matt Stone both professed {{their love}} of the episode, but {{said that it is}} a {{polarizing}} one for the audience, claiming that if a viewer is not on board with the episode's toilet humor, then the whole episode breaks down for them. The creators claimed that young people and women reacted poorly to the episode. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> that his father, who is the basis for Randy's character, was very thrilled by the episode.|$|E
50|$|The {{popularity}} of his novels led to 20 subsequent {{film and television}} adaptations, which made Park a household name. Among them, <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> he was most excited about the 2012 film A Muse. Adapted from his provocative 2010 novel Eun-gyo in which a poet in his 70s who falls for a high school girl, <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> it reflected his own personal thoughts on aging, human psychology and desire.|$|R
5000|$|Then in June 1973 at Tokyo Gallery, Park {{began his}} ongoing {{journey through the}} Ecriture series. This is what <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> at the time: ...|$|R
500|$|On 6 December 2007, it was {{reported}} that Clarion Solicitors, representing Gordon <b>Park,</b> <b>said</b> that they would launch an appeal. In a public statement, they said: ...|$|R
500|$|Another {{influence}} on the plot was {{the large amount of}} hunting Parker and Stone saw around them while growing up in Colorado. Neither of them were hunters, and <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> Stan's hesitation about hunting was based largely on himself and his father, who hated the idea of killing an animal even though Parker's grandfather, like Jimbo, was enthusiastic about the sport. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he feels many of the first season episodes considered taboo in 1997 would have been considered less controversial five years later, but that [...] "Volcano" [...] is an exception. Since the episode involved children drinking beer and threatening each other at gunpoint during hunting trips, <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he did not believe Comedy Central would have aired it following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Back then, it was just sort of funny, kids pointing guns at each other, and it's just not so funny now." ...|$|E
500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined look it has retained throughout the years. <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I think that this was where we finally felt like we got it right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|E
500|$|... "Damien" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a satire on religion, faith and the nature of good and evil, as well as a commentary on commercialism and the cult of celebrity in American culture. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> the writers sought to satirize the speed and ease at which the followers of Jesus lose faith in him and bet against him. Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the abandonment of Jesus demonstrates, [...] "Like many people in the real world, the faith of the town's people cannot withstand the hard times." [...] <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Everybody puts their trust in Satan and ends up getting screwed. There is a bigger message – all in all, a pretty wholesome message. That's why South Park works. Sometimes we have a message." ...|$|E
5000|$|The series Coffee House was {{a welcome}} change for her; after having mainly taken on serious or dark characters, <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> she had been [...] "dying {{to be in a}} romantic comedy." [...] Describing Park as [...] "extremely kind," [...] {{director}} Pyo Min-soo said he incorporated her real-life personality in writing her character: a bright, cheerful, and caring career woman who at the same time is hardworking, frank and confident. <b>Park</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Honestly, {{this is the first time}} working has been this fun." ...|$|R
2500|$|In April, <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Timing is very {{important}} for our economic policy, jobs and livelihood mainly ordinary people should organize a supplementary budget in a timely manner." ...|$|R
50|$|The biographical {{details of}} his life are unclear. A 2002 article in the Village Voice by Ed <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> {{he might have been}} English by birth but was more {{probably}} American. The article said he might have served in the navy and that he has been incorrectly called a graduate of MIT. The article says that he attended a vocational high school attached to MIT in 1888 but there is no record that he graduated. <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> rumors that Wright died within hours of Gadsby being published are untrue.|$|R
500|$|<b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> {{following}} the tremendous success of [...] "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", {{much of the}} direct feedback he received for [...] "Damien" [...] was negative. Parker described it as the [...] "first sort of backlash" [...] he had experienced with South Park, with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had [...] "sold out". <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?' We just kept doing {{what we thought was}} funny, we didn't go start making commercials or anything. But everybody was saying we sold out." [...] Nevertheless, the episode received generally positive reviews, and has been described as one of South Park [...] "classic episodes".|$|E
500|$|When {{the monsters}} battle {{each other at}} the end of the episode, a Japanese man sings songs about each of the monsters while they approach. This mirrors a common element {{throughout}} actual Japanese monster movies, which commonly have theme songs for the monster characters. Parker wrote the songs in Japanese language. The English translation for the lyrics sung when Robert Smith transforms translates are, [...] "I really like Robert Smith", and the lyrics sung about Mecha-Streisand translate, [...] "Barbra, Barbra, she's a bitch, Barbra". When Streisand becomes Mecha-Streisand, the line was written in Japanese, [...] "From this moment on, I am Mecha-Streisand!", but <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> Bergman misread some of the words so the on-air translation was imperfect. Before Leonard Maltin transforms, he screams in Japanese, [...] "Listen, listen, here's a tulip", which <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> is a phrase Japanese children say before passing gas.|$|E
500|$|Although Comedy Central did {{not object}} to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to {{material}} they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a Nativity play, a baby Jesus resembling a fetus pops out of Wendy, who is playing the Virgin Mary, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> they had to handle its animation [...] "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took {{a bite out of}} it. Comedy Central officials would not allow the scene in the episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he felt was actually funnier.|$|E
2500|$|For years, {{the black}} {{community}} had complained that the situation was unfair. <b>Parks</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest. I {{did a lot of}} walking in Montgomery." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the press}} conference of Kim Han-min's 2009 thriller Handphone, <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> he hoped viewers wouldn't {{interpret}} the two characters as simply good and evil, but as real people with understandable motivations {{within the context of}} their situations.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a debate}} with Commission members {{about whether to}} {{transform}} the Grand National Party into a non-conservative political party or not, but <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> the GNP would never become non-conservative and will follow {{the real value of}} conservatism.|$|R
500|$|<b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he and Stone did {{not intend}} for [...] "Damien" [...] to be {{offensive}} to Christians or any other religion: [...] "In South Park, Jesus is a great guy, he's on our show, and in this episode he's the hero. We're {{not in the business}} of offending people. We're in the business of making people laugh." [...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year. <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over, so I wasn't going to fit into any of them, and I just wanted to destroy and kill, which was the inspiration for this show." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} [...] "Damien" [...] was animated, {{much of the}} drawing and {{animation}} responsibilities {{that had previously been}} handled by Parker and Stone were now being delegated to a team of animators. The duo were particularly proud of the animation during the boxing match between Jesus and Satan, which used elements of perspective and three-dimension seldom used in the series before; <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "definitely the most action [...] stuff we'd done [...] ". While animating Jesus, Parker and Stone deliberately left glitches in the animation that made it appear skin was showing beneath the beard on the left-hand side of the character's face. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> this was done because it was the way Jesus appeared in the crudely animated The Spirit of Christmas, a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone that served as a precursor to South Park, and they wanted to maintain that nuance for the character.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{partially}} {{inspired by the}} commercials for the Christian Children's Fund, in which Sally Struthers encourages viewers to donate money to provide food for starving children in Africa. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he did not really believe Struthers was hoarding food from the charity, but {{he came up with}} the concept because he found it funny that such an obese woman would make a public plea for food for others. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he had always wondered how a starving African child would react if they were taken to a large buffet dinner at an American restaurant, with [...] "people leaving tons of food on their plates", which served as further inspiration for the episode. Parker and Stone originally planned for Struthers to die {{at the end of the}} episode and have the African children eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central executives told the duo they could not kill Struthers, although celebrities have been killed off in subsequent episodes without any objections from the network.|$|E

50|$|In her {{dissertation}} for her Ph.D., Sarah Y. Park cited Kendall (2005) and Kim (2007) when <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> {{that female}} Korean adoptees are commonly {{told that they}} may have become a prostitute if they were not adopted out of Korea.|$|R

500|$|Parker {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Kanye, both in the episode and in [...] "Gay Fish", a full-length song featured {{at the end of}} the episode about West's realization that he actually is a gay fish. Parker used a large amount of Auto-Tune pitch audio processing, which he had never used before. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he eventually discovered he had to sing off-key on purpose in order to get the desired effect. <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You had to be a bad singer in order for that thing to actually sound the way it does." [...] The day after [...] "Fishsticks" [...] was broadcast, the full two-and-a-half minute version of the Kanye West spoof, [...] "Gay Fish", was made available for download on South Park Studios, the official South Park website. The site also featured T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode. One featured Jimmy asking, [...] "Do you like fishsticks?" [...] The other features text from Kanye West's whiteboard in the episode: [...] "Fishsticks + Me = Gayfish".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{considered}} the first South Park musical episode, and included such songs as [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The general rule was people hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey {{would prove to be}} real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children's show Sesame Street; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird, which <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> [...] "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie, particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press.|$|E
500|$|Actor George Clooney {{provided}} the small {{role of the}} voice of Sparky, which is limited entirely to dog barks. Clooney was a vocal South Park fan and was largely responsible for generating news about [...] "The Spirit of Christmas", a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone {{that served as a}} precursor to South Park. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because [...] "we thought it was funny", and because they wanted to do something different from the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis. Parker added, [...] "Since South Park is sort of a show that rips on celebrity, we wanted to degrade them in other ways too. And we thought let's have celebrities on, but have them do really minor, unimportant things". Comedy Central executives were excited at the prospect of having Clooney appear on the show, but <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> they were disappointed to learn his role was so small.|$|E
5000|$|... “I {{believe that}} my visit could serve as an {{important}} occasion to secure momentum {{for the development of}} bilateral relations and to strengthen substantial cooperation,” <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> in a separate meeting with nearly 20 representatives from the Korean community in Iran.|$|R
2500|$|During a 1956 radio {{interview}} with Sydney Rogers in West Oakland {{several months after}} her arrest, <b>Parks</b> <b>said</b> she had decided, [...] "I would have to know for {{once and for all}} what rights I had as a human being and a citizen." ...|$|R

500|$|Parker and Stone {{had trouble}} {{deciding}} how to resolve the episode and bring the zombie characters back to life. Although they ultimately settled on having Kyle kill the [...] "main zombie" [...] {{to bring back the}} others, Parker did not feel the resolution made sense and described it as a deus ex machina. <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> of the ending, [...] "This was another big one of those episodes where we were sort of (like), 'How do we get out of this one?'" [...] Parker also described the ending of the episode as [...] "a bloodbath, (which) is what a good zombie movie should be". [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first South Park episode Parker and Stone felt unsatisfied with once production was complete. <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We were pretty bummed out, and we kind of thought, well, we're going to have a bad episode go on the air, and hopefully it won't alienate too many people, and we'll try to get our viewers back for Thanksgiving. But we were totally wrong, people totally loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|Comedy Central {{originally}} ordered {{only six}} episodes of South Park {{for the first}} season's initial run. However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. <b>Parker</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing. That was part of what we wanted (to say). I think kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{introduced}} several {{characters who}} would maintain important recurring roles {{throughout the rest}} of the series. Among them were Sheila Broflovski and Grandpa Marvin Marsh. Sheila and Gerald Broflovski, Kyle's parents, were named after Stone's parents, although he insists the characters are nothing like his real parents. Marvin Marsh was not based on any real-life person, but Parker and Stone wanted to create a rude and unlikeable grandfather character because they felt most elderly people were portrayed as sweet and lovable on television. Originally, they wanted Marvin Marsh to be known as the [...] "molesting grandpa" [...] who kept making sexual comments to Stan and attempting to play inappropriate games with him, but Comedy Central refused to allow it, which <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> was [...] "probably the right call". Terrance and Phillip are loosely based on Parker and Stone themselves, and were also inspired by the Itchy & Scratchy characters from The Simpsons, as well as the protagonists from the MTV cartoon Beavis and Butt-Head. Although [...] "Death" [...] marked the first appearance of Terrance and Phillip, <b>Parker</b> <b>said</b> the duo [...] "took on a life of their own". They made frequent appearances {{throughout the rest of}} the series, and played a major role in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.|$|E
50|$|College <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> {{goodbye to}} {{professional}} baseball in 1996 when the Class A Tampa Bay Devil Rays affiliate, now a Yankees affiliate, Charleston RiverDogs left the stadium for Joseph P.

5000|$|In September 2011, a North Korean {{defector}} {{was arrested}} in Seoul {{by members of the}} National Intelligence Service on his way to meet with Park, referred to as [...] "Enemy Zero" [...] by the Pyongyang regime. South Korean authorities said that he had planned to kill Park either by poisoning his drink or by jabbing him with a poisoned needle. <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> that the assassin, Ahn, had phoned him earlier and asked to meet him. [...] "Ahn told me by phone", <b>Park</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "that he was to be accompanied by a visitor from Japan who wants to help our efforts. But then I was told by the NIS not to go to the meeting due to the risk of assassination".|$|R
5000|$|... "I am here {{to pursue}} the path of common {{prosperity}} with our old friend Iran,” <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> in a forum attended by some 450 South Korean and Iranian business executives and leaders in the Iranian capital. On Monday, Park and Rouhani observed the signing of nearly 20 out of 66 memorandums of understanding worth up to US$45.6 billion after their summit. Seoul hopes the MOUs could {{pave the way for}} South Korean companies to eventually win massive infrastructure projects under way in Iran. She also said she expects the MOUs signed between the two governments on transportation and infrastructure as well as water resources to further boost bilateral cooperation down the line. South Korea and Iran “can produce a win-win outcome in overall infrastructure” projects, including railways and airport, <b>Park</b> <b>said</b> at the business gathering.|$|R
