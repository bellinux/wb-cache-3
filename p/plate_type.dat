25|$|In {{the late}} 1st century BC or early 1st century AD a new design {{appeared}} in some bow type fibulae. A separate pin {{was attached to}} the head-end of the bow with a small hinge. In {{the second half of the}} 1st century AD, hinges were introduced to <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> fibulae. One or two small plaques were cast on the back of the plate and a pin {{was attached to the}}m by a small hinge. Previously, <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> fibulae had bilateral springs attached to the back. In the 3rd century AD, the hinge was placed in the centre of a long transverse bar creating the famous crossbow fibula design. A few fibulae from a much earlier date also had hinges, although this design feature was very rare and soon died out for nearly five centuries. For example, the Asia Minor Decorated Arc Fibula (Blinkenberg Type XII Variation 16) dating to the 5th century BC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} type of keel is the [...] "flat plate keel", and this is fitted in the {{majority}} of ocean-going ships and other vessels. A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the [...] "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries. Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive scantlings, but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity. If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat <b>plate</b> <b>type,</b> bar keels often being associated with open floors, where the plate keel may also be fitted.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{patterns}} of an automatic number plate recognition system, AVI (Automatic Vehicle Identification) misidentification errors. ITS performance evaluation results show that the performance level of the equipments becomes lower as they are old. Also, AVI is more suitable for day time traffic data collection than night time because of its visibility. Most errors come from similar shaped letter such as consonant, vowel or number, and different <b>plate</b> <b>types</b> such as old fashioned plate, plate of vehicle kept for business and new model (long-width <b>type)</b> <b>plate</b> <b>types.</b> In the results and discussion part, we talk about these types with figures.

50|$|The Dingo {{was based}} on a {{commercial}} Ford 30-cwt 134.5 inch wheelbase chassis shortened to 110 inches, fitted with a Marmon-Herrington all wheel drive kit to give the vehicle 4 wheel drive. It was powered by either an 85 hp or 95 hp Ford V8 engine. Onto this was fitted an armoured body manufactured from ABP-3 (Australian Bullet Proof <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> 3) by Victorian Railways. Serial production began in early 1942.|$|E

Future studies with a larger sample size may detect these differences if present.|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} at the overlap of two magma types -- within <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> to the north, and island-arc type to the south -- that erupted in the Quaternary: to the north, the eastern end of the Eurasian Plate and, to the south, the {{subduction}} zone of the Philippine Sea Plate. It runs about 200 kilometres east to west and its north-south width varies between 20 and 30 kilometres.|$|E
50|$|The {{main bar}} frames, 4+1/2 in thick, were {{machined}} from a 2 ft wide solid. The hind {{part of this}} frame was rigidly secured to the boiler through the high-pressure cylinder saddle castings and terminated {{just in front of}} the firebox outer throat plate. From this point rearwards, the frame was of the <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> and arranged to carry the spring gear and other fittings for the trailing Bissel truck.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly before 1941, all {{military}} equipment receiverd a number format {{different from the}} civil format, the [...] "L-N-NN-NN" [...] format.

5000|$|The first Lancer Evolution {{used the}} 2.0 L {{turbocharged}} DOHC engine and AWD drivetrain {{from the original}} Galant VR-4 in a Lancer chassis, and was sold in GSR and RS models. This engine was also used in the Mitsubishi RVR with the Hyper Sports Gear trim package, and the Mitsubishi Chariot Resort Runner GT. The RS was a stripped-down version that lacked (power) windows and seats, anti-lock brakes, a rear wiper, and had steel wheels to weigh approximately 70 kg less than the 1238 kg GSR, ready for racing or tuning. The RS version was released with a mechanical <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> rear Limited-slip differential (LSD). The GSR came {{with all of the}} conveniences of a typical street car, including a digital screen climate control system. It came with Mitsubishi's 4G63 engine producing [...] at 6000 rpm and 309 Nm at 3000 rpm. 5,000 of the first generation Evolutions were sold between 1992 and 1993. Top speed was 228 km/h. The GSR version of the Evolution I was the only Evolution Lancer released with a Viscous Limited Slip Rear Differential (VLSD). The subsequent Evolution Lancer models all featured rear mechanical <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> LSD's.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{power is}} {{transmitted}} to gearbox through a clutch, which is dry single- or double <b>plate</b> <b>type,</b> or turbine clutch. A number of gearbox options were available. The 13-speed Fuller RTO91513 {{is suitable for}} highways, and 14-speed Fuller RTO9508LLB designated for on- and off-road use. Both transmissions provide top speed of 102-107 km/h, but the latter option has got 35% higher ratio with the smallest gear compared to the first variant. Also a six-speed synchronised gearbox was available. PTO is a standard feature in every gearbox option.|$|E
50|$|Three {{different}} cowcatchers {{were used}} on Class 1E units. The first six series were delivered with cowcatchers {{made up of}} horizontal bars. The Series 7 units were delivered with a plain <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> cowcatcher, but the bogies were sometimes interchanged during overhauls {{with the result that}} units from different orders often carried cowcatchers not as originally fitted. In later years, units were sometimes fitted with cowcatchers made up of vertical bars, similar to those that were fitted on most steam locomotives after the Second World War.|$|E

30|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{may help}} explain the lack of significant difference between <b>plate</b> <b>types</b> in load to failure of both constructs. This seemingly inconsequential plastic and elastic deformation in the 3.5 -mm plate may allow some compression across the large, non-comminuted fracture fragments, thus providing secondary stability which the more rigid 4.5 -mm counterpart lacks. As stated before, this phenomenon would not apply to comminuted fractures in patients with poor bone quality and unfavorable healing biology.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} <b>types</b> of {{printing}} <b>plate</b> materials: photopolymer and steel. Photopolymer plates are the most popular, as {{they are easy to}} use. These are typically used in short to medium production runs. Steel plates come in two forms: thin steel for medium to long runs, and thick steel for very long runs. Both steel <b>plate</b> <b>types</b> are generally processed by the plate supplier as it involves the use of specialized equipment.|$|R
