It also discusses the overall pattern of the flora and fauna including the fact that the islands can be divided, by what would eventually become known as the Wallace line, into two parts, those whose animals are more closely related to those of Asia and those whose fauna is closer to that of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Croatia's {{territory}} covers , {{making it}} the 127th largest country in the world. The <b>physical</b> <b>geography</b> of Croatia is defined by its location—it {{is described as a}} part of Central Europe and Southeast Europe, a part of the Balkans and Mitteleuropa. Croatia borders Bosnia–Herzegovina (for 1,009.1km) and Serbia (for 317.6km) in the east, Slovenia for 667.8km in the west, Hungary for 355.5km in the north and Montenegro for 22.6km and the Adriatic Sea in the south. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the extreme south of Croatia is separated {{from the rest of the}} mainland by a short coastline strip around Neum belonging to Bosnia–Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all aspects of}} the land that is now Scotland, including physical and human, between the departure of the Romans in the early fifth century from what are now the southern borders of the country, to the adoption of the major aspects of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Scotland was defined by its <b>physical</b> <b>geography,</b> with its long coastline of inlets, islands and inland lochs, high proportion of land over 60 metres above sea level and heavy rainfall. It is divided between the Highlands and Islands and Lowland regions, which were subdivided by geological features including fault lines, mountains, hills, bogs and marshes. This made communications by land problematic and raised difficulties for political unification, but also for invading armies.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{enclaves}} have richly interconnected {{social and}} <b>physical</b> <b>geographies,</b> {{much of which}} is hidden from casual observation. As a result, interpersonal collaboration, coordination, and socio-physical navigation is often suboptimal. We are exploring how ubiquitous social computing applications that seamlessly provide location-aware information about people and places could help address this situation. As part of this effort, we are turning an urban university campus into a living laboratory for systems that link people-to-people-to-place. This allows us to examine human centered computing challenges, such as effective privacy management and social recommendation system design, through use of a suite of applications glued together by a unified middleware layer that leverages an increasingly rich model of an enclave’s people and places...|$|R

25|$|In geology, <b>physical</b> <b>geography,</b> and {{sediment}} transport, fluvial processes relate to flowing water in natural systems. This encompasses rivers, streams, periglacial flows, flash floods and glacial lake outburst floods. Sediment moved by {{water can be}} larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher density and viscosity. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of sand and gravel size, but larger floods can carry cobbles and even boulders.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} the {{sequence}} of sedimentary rock strata is the main source for {{an understanding of the}} Earth's history, including palaeogeography, paleoclimatology and the history of life. The scientific discipline that studies the properties and origin of sedimentary rocks is called sedimentology. Sedimentology is part of both geology and <b>physical</b> <b>geography</b> and overlaps partly with other disciplines in the Earth sciences, such as pedology, geomorphology, geochemistry and structural geology. Sedimentary rocks have also been found on Mars.|$|E

40|$|In eleven propositions {{the article}} {{surrounds}} an ambivalent theme. It {{is related to}} the conditions found in Departments of Geography in German-speaking countries. – On the one hand it pleads for a diseiplinary strategy to integrate various human and <b>physical</b> <b>geographies</b> to constitute a neo-holistic geography. This could contribute to shape geography as a centre of competence for current issues of regional and urban development. The complex concept of sustainability – taken in its threefold meaning as ecological. economic and social sustainability-lends itself as asound basis for this integrative strategy. – On the other hand well-established career routines of young scientists are a strong hindering factor. These career paths require a degree of topical specialization which runs counter to serious Steps of integration...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is situated}} {{at the crossroads of}} migration, family and transnational studies. It explores families that span multiple cities and countries due to the migration of one or more relatives and analyzes their subsequent construction and reconstruction of familyhood across national borders. Through a multi-sited qualitative study into Moroccan family networks with residential nodes in Liège, Belgium and Oujda, Morocco, but also several other destinations, Caroline Zickgraf considers both the material and non-material functions of transnational family practices that together produce and inflate transnational social spaces. She treats both the social and <b>physical</b> <b>geographies</b> of these networks in order to understand how the circulation of people affects the circulation of care but also treats the tensions and asymmetries that characterize their multi-directional cross-border exchanges...|$|R
