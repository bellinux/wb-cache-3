5000|$|In {{the early}} days of radio, mains {{electricity}} was supplied at different voltages in different places, and either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) was supplied. There are three ways of powering electronic equipment.

When connected to a DC supply, the rectifier stage of the power supply performed no active function. DC-only equipment would only run from a DC supply and included no rectifier stage. DC is almost never used in mains power distribution anymore.|$|R

50|$|A {{problem in}} early vacuum tubes was {{secondary}} emission; electrons striking the plate could knock other electrons {{out of the}} metal surface. In some tubes such as tetrodes these secondary electrons could be absorbed by other electrods such as grids in the tube, resulting in a current out of the plate.

50|$|Before the {{transistor}} was invented, radios used {{vacuum tube}}s. Although portable vacuum tube radios were produced, they were typically bulky and heavy.

50|$|Since in {{this region}} an {{increase}} in plate voltage causes a decrease in plate current, the AC plate resistance, that is the differential output resistance of the tube, is negative:As with other negative differential resistance devices like the tunnel diode, this negative resistance {{can be used to}} create an oscillator.

50|$|Each tuned RF stage {{consists}} of an amplifying device, a triode (or in later sets a tetrode) vacuum tube, and a tuned circuit which performs the filtering function. The tuned circuit consisted of an air-core RF coupling transformer which also served to couple the signal from the <b>plate</b> <b>circuit</b> of one tube to the input grid circuit of the next tube. One of the windings of the transformer had a variable capacitor connected across it to make a tuned circuit. A variable capacitor (or sometimes a variable coupling coil called a variometer) was used, with a knob on the front panel to tune the receiver. The RF stages usually had identical circuits to simplify design.|$|E
5000|$|One {{common cause}} is {{feedback}} through the plate power supply circuit. [...] The power supply provides DC current to each tube's <b>plate</b> <b>circuit,</b> so the {{power supply wiring}} (power busses) can be an inadvertent feedback path between stages. The increasing impedance of the filter capacitors at low frequencies can mean that low frequency swings in the current drawn by output stages can cause voltage swings in the power supply voltage which feed back to earlier stages, making the system a subaudio oscillator. This is caused by inadequate power supply filtering or decoupling. The electrolytic capacitors used in equipment of 1960s vintage contained liquid electrolyte, which dried out over decades, decreasing the capacitance and increasing the leakage current, and these are often the cause.|$|E
50|$|The tetrode {{functions}} {{in a similar}} way to the triode, from which it was developed. A current through the heater or filament heats the cathode, which causes it to emit electrons by thermionic emission. A positive voltage is applied between the plate and cathode, causing a flow of electrons from the cathode to plate through the two grids. A varying voltage applied to the control grid can control this current, causing variations in the plate current. With a resistive or other load in the <b>plate</b> <b>circuit,</b> the varying current will result in a varying voltage at the plate. With proper biasing, this voltage will be an amplified (but inverted) version of the AC voltage applied to the control grid, thus the tetrode can provide voltage gain.

Based on {{an understanding of the}} importance of materials of construction and the physical layout for absorber formation reactors, SSI designed and built a replacement large-area reactor based on a more direct scale-up of the baseline reactor. While designing and building the new large-area reactor, SSI defined and demonstrated new package designs to combine 10 -cm {times} 30 -cm <b>circuit</b> <b>plates</b> into one package; this allowed SSI to deliver large-area prototype modules to NREL for evaluation, and to introduce the first CIS-based products [...] 5 -watt (ST 5) and 10 -watt (ST 10) modules. After completion of the new large-area reactor, all processes were scaled to a 30 -cm {times} 120 -cm plate size. Subsequently, only large 30 -cm {times} 120 -cm <b>circuit</b> <b>plates</b> were fabricated for 30 -cm {times} 120 -cm prototype modules or, after cutting the large <b>circuit</b> <b>plates</b> into smaller <b>circuit</b> <b>plates,</b> for the two new CIS-based products. The scaled process exhibits generally good control for extended periods with periodic shifts in the short-term process average that appears to result from batch-to-batch variability in precursor or base electrode preparation. Similarly, periodic shunting along the laser-scribed pattern lines in the Mo base electrode appears to result from batch-to-batch variability in base electrode preparation. Significant progress was made in understanding transient effects in CIS devices. Transient effects are important for many topics, including accelerated testing, process definition, measurement protocols, process predictability, interpretation of experimental test results, and understanding of device structures. Long-term outdoor stability of CIS continues to be demonstrated at NREL where 30 -cm {times} 30 -cm and 30 -cm {times} 120 -cm modules have undergone testing for more than ten years.

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of this current can be controlled by a voltage applied between the cathode and the grid. The grid acts like a gate for the electrons. A more negative voltage on the grid will repel some of the electrons, so fewer get through to the plate, reducing the plate current. A positive voltage on the grid will attract more electrons from the cathode, so more reach the plate, increasing the plate current. Therefore, a low power varying (AC) signal applied to the grid can control a much more powerful plate current, resulting in amplification. Variation in the grid voltage will cause identical proportional variations in the plate current. By placing a suitable load resistance in the <b>plate</b> <b>circuit,</b> the varying current will cause a varying voltage across the resistance which can be {{much larger than the}} input voltage variations, resulting in voltage gain.|$|E
5000|$|The diagram (right) shows one of {{the most}} common single tube reflex {{circuits}} from the early 1920s.

The capacitor C6 bypasses the RF signal around the audio transformer winding T2 which would block it. The amplified signal from the plate of the tube is applied to the RF transformer L3, L4 while C3 bypasses the RF signal around the headphone coils. The tuned secondary L4, C5 which is tuned to the input frequency, serves as a second bandpass filter as well as blocking the audio signal in the <b>plate</b> <b>circuit</b> from getting to the detector.

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that {{hotspots}} are fixed relative {{to one another}} and thus constitute a global reference frame for measuring absolute plate motions and true polar wander. But it has long been known that the best documented hotspot track, the Hawaiian–Emperor chain, is inconsistent with the internally coherent tracks left by the Indo–Atlantic hotspots. This inconsistency is due either to unquantified motions within the <b>plate</b> <b>circuit</b> linking the Pacific with other plates, for example, between East and West Antarctica, or relative motion between the Hawaiian–Emperor and Indo–Atlantic hotspots. Analysis of recent paleomagnetic results from Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica confirms that there has been post- 100 Ma motion between West Antarctica (Marie Byrd Land) and East Antarctica. However, incorporation of this motion into the <b>plate</b> <b>circuit</b> does not account for the Cenozoic hotspot discrepancy. Comparison of an updated inventory of Pacific and non-Pacific paleomagnetic data does not show a significant systematic discrepancy, which, along with other observations, indicates that missing plate boundaries and other errors in the <b>plate</b> <b>circuit</b> play a relatively small role in the hotspot inconsistency. We conclude that most of the apparent motion between the Hawaiian–Emperor and Indo–Atlantic hotspots is real.
