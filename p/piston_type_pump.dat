40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston type pumps are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this type of pump due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different types of pumps. From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect. Conse-quently it {{can be used as a}} tool for the efficiency and quality control of different types of pumps. QC 20121221 </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The water {{hydraulic}} reciprocating {{plunger pump}} driven by linear motor is suitable to deep sea application with high efficiency and variable control. Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed. And the control method and the performance were analyzed by simulation based on the AMESim model. The {{results show that the}} pressure and flow pulsation of <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> are much smaller than the valve type, even though the piston type is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a valve distribution tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear motor reciprocating plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, and the flow pulsation rate is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007. These results contribute to the research on deep-sea water hydraulic power pack and direct drive pump with high efficiency and energy conservation...|$|E

These flow-rates are calculated at a maximum of 120 cfm air supply. Material supply hoses are medium pressure at about 600 psi.

50|$|For {{high quality}} {{rotating}} drive systems plunger motors are generally used. Whereas {{the speed of}} hydraulic pumps range from 1200 to 1800 rpm, the machinery {{to be driven by}} the motor often requires a much lower speed. This means that when an axial plunger motor (swept volume maximum 2 litres) is used, a gearbox is usually needed. For a continuously adjustable swept volume, axial piston motors are used.PISTON TYPE.— Like <b>piston</b> (reciprocating) <b>type</b> <b>pumps,</b> the most common design of the <b>piston</b> <b>type</b> of motor is the axial. This type of motor is the most commonly used in hydraulic systems. These motors are, like their pump counterparts, available in both variable and fixed displacement designs.

Efficiencies and minimum/maximum rotational speeds are highly dependent on the design of the rotating group, and many different types are in use..|$|R

In the present work, a methodology for modeling the dynamics of the pump in multibody framework considering component flexibility is studied. A multibody dynamic model of the pump is developed considering housing flexibility and pressure forces acting on the pistons. The flexibility of the housing is modeled using the relative nodal coordinate formulation (RNCF) with a floating frame of reference. The bearing forces, control piston force, swashplate motion and torque ripple are studied. The bearing and control piston force results are compared with the case of a rigid housing assembly. The experiments are conducted to measure the end cover vibration levels during operation of the pump. The vibration levels are also obtained from the simulation and compared with experiments. Numerical studies are conducted to better understand the influence of housing flexibility on the dynamics of the pump...|$|R

The dynamic excitation forces in the frequency domain are obtained using fast fourier transform (FFT) with a rectangular type windowing function. A detailed FE model of the pump is developed consisting of the internal components, housing, and end cover. The dominant mode shapes and natural frequencies of the pump assembly are studied. The forced vibration behaviour of the pump is predicted by using the dynamic excitation forces from the MBD model. The numerical results are compared with the experimental results and a good agreement is found.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a numerical {{analysis of the}} piston dynamic behaviour in axial <b>piston</b> swash plate <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> and motors. The numerical method adopted {{is based on the}} solution of the piston motion equations which depend on the pressure distribution within the cylinder-piston gap. In order to determine this contribution, the Reynolds equation is applied in the lubricating fluid film between the piston and the cylinder. Besides the piston dynamic behaviour, the model permits to calculate the leakage flow through the gap and the friction forces acting on the piston and cylinder surface. After the presentation of the numerical procedure, the dynamic behaviour of the piston is firstly discussed, highlightingthe stability of the bearing. This work is part of a wider research activity focused on the study of positive displacement machines, with the aim to determine and maximize their global efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to explore the {{possibilities}} for filling recovered mining areas using solidifying backfill. The article describes the preparation of the backfill (backfill formulation with an eventual application using low quality sands, wastes from treatment plants and ash from power plants etc) now to transport it as well as its application in practice. Advantageous and disadvantageous of this method are also mentioned. Several factors must be taken info consideration during the preparation process of the backfill mixture. Firstly, the quantities of each individual component must be constantly regulated. Secondly, the properties of each component must be respected. In addition, the needs of the pipeline transport system and the specific conditions of the recovered area to be filled must also be considered. Hydraulic transport and pneumo-hydraulic pipeline transport are used for handling the backfill. Pumps for transporting the solidifying backfill have to carry out demanding tasks. Due to the physical-mechanical properties of the backfill, only highly powerful pumps can be considered. <b>Piston</b> <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> such as Abel Simplex and Duplex pumps with capacities of up to 100 m 3. h- 1 and operating pressures of up to 16 MPa would be suitable. This method has been applied abroad for different purposes. For example, solid backfill was used in the Hamr mine during exploitation of uranium using the room-and-pillar system mining method. In the OstravaKarvina Coal field, backfill was used in decontamination work, filling areas in a zone of dangerous deformations and for creating a dividing stratum during thick seam mining. Research info the use of solidifying backfill was also done in the Walsum mine in Germany. The {{aim of this}} research was:- to investigate the possibilities of filling a collapsing area in a working face using a solidifying mixture of power plant ash and water,- to verify whether towing pipelines proposed by the DMT corporation would be suitable for filling,- to determine whether collapsed rocks would be able to absorb surplus water to prevent it from flowing info the mine. Research has shown that it is necessary to resolve the automatization of the control and management processes of the whole filling process. After the application of high performance computer technology instruments, the filling process will be more effective and of a higher quality...|$|R

40|$|The roller {{swashplate}} {{bearing in}} hydraulic piston pumps is very unique in applications of roller element bearings. The main advantages {{of this type}} of bearings are low friction, very small difference between start torque and steady state torque, and no additional pressure source is required for their functioning. Therefore, better control performance and higher efficiency can be expected from piston pumps with roller swashplate bearings, compared with pumps with hydrostatic or plain ones. However, it is particularly challenging to design a roller swashplate bearing to meet the very demanding and widely varying load requirements for heavy duty off-highway machine operations, considering cost and pump size limitations. Quite different from most other roller bearing applications, a roller swashplate bearing for heavy duty hydraulic piston pumps is subject to (a) extremely high contact pressure between rollers and races due to high system pressure, (b) high frequency oscillating forces in three dimensions caused by the torque ripple and discharge pressure ripple inherent in pump rotating group, (c) very unfavorable local lubrication conditions when the pump is operated with no or little displacement change, and (d) sliding between rollers and races because of frequent sudden pump displacement changes. Based on the observed failure modes of bearings in this application, this paper discusses several measures to improve the fatigue life of the swashplate roller bearing for an axial swashplate <b>type</b> <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> used in a heavy duty off-highway machine. Analyses, simulation results, and machine operation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed measures. 1...|$|R
