25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 4 June 1942, during the Battle of Midway, a Japanese {{aircraft}} carrier force was spotted approaching the island. Muri's unit received no specific training nor any <b>pre-flight</b> <b>briefing.</b> He only knew the location of his target for the 2,000-pound torpedo that his B-26 was carrying—the area of the aircraft carrier Akagi. On the way to its target, Muri's formation was intercepted by 30 Japanese Zero fighters. He was forced to make his attack at 200 feet above sea level, but his only chance {{to get out of}} the fighters' line of fire, and the carrier's outward pointing guns, was to fly along the Akagi flight deck. Following the encounter, he and one other B-26 pilot were able to land their planes safely on Midway Island. Muri's torpedo had missed its mark and his unit, as part of the first attacking wave, did little damage. However, the ensuing three-day assault was successful as the Akagi had caught fire after being attacked by a group of Douglas SBD Dauntless aircraft during the battle. The carrier was later ordered to be scuttled by fleet commander Isoroku Yamamoto.|$|E

50|$|Certain civil {{aviation}} authorities put {{a high value}} on quality and personalised <b>pre-flight</b> <b>briefing.</b> They require a system that will automatically deliver pre-flight bulletins where it is needed: e-mailed, faxed or delivered on paper. Each bulletin is tailor made from the flight route, derived from the flight plan. A typical requirement is to provide the most essential information possible, not to overload the cockpit with unnecessary paper and irrelevant data. For this purpose, these types of users normally require a narrow route briefing, where only information that touches or overlaps a flight corridor is included. An example of an excellent flight briefing service is the FPC at Arlanda in Sweden. A perfect product for such a customer is NSWS Flight Briefing with the necessary NSSRV components added as required, e.g. fax drivers. Legal records of all delivered flight briefings are also kept to provide an exact history. This may be crucial during an accident investigation.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mission was}} set for 16 February, but unusually wintry weather, with low cloud and snow meant the mission had to be {{scrubbed}} the first two days. 18 February was their last opportunity, and Pickard chose to go. Pickard told them in their <b>pre-flight</b> <b>briefing</b> “When I have dropped my bombs I shall pull {{off to one side}} and circle, probably just {{to the north of the}} prison. I can watch the attack from there; and I’ll tell you by radio." [...] None of the pilots were keen to fly on such a day. In his mild tone he added [...] "It's a death or glory mission for us". The first wave took off in appalling weather. Visibility was hampered by snow squalls. The aircraft were initially flying blind till they broke through the cloud cover. The weather made it difficult to link up with their assigned covering fighters. Over the channel the weather cleared and sunshine broke through. They crossed low at about 50 feet over choppy wave tops. Under strict radio silence, they had to maintain visual contact if they were to stay together. The Mosquitos flew in a compact formation. The Typhoons assigned to cover the first group of Mosquitos were late to the rendezvous and did not link up, but the escort for the second group did. Meanwhile, Tempest fighters from No 3 Squadron RAF assigned to provide air cover over Amiens itself never got into the air, their commander refusing to allow the squadron to take off into the complete whiteout over his airfield.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPolice and fire departments today are challenged with an increasing frequency of complex emergencies and a continuing cultural divide. Devoted people from both agencies are actively {{working to improve}} their response capability. Rather than solving the problem solely in house, other disciplines {{may be able to}} help. This thesis investigated what the aviation industry could teach the emergency services field about how to approach complex life-sensitive problems. A structured focused comparison model was used to evaluate aviation’s use of Crew Resource Management, the <b>pre-flight</b> <b>briefing,</b> and the concept of airmanship in relation to how they may benefit the response capability of police and fire commanders at a combined emergency response. The research concludes that police and fire departments in the United States would immediately benefit from instituting joint pre-shift briefings and discipline training. It is recommended that FEMA amend its ICS procedures to reflect the benefit of instituting a pre-shift briefing. By building relationships with a police or fire counterpart during briefings and showing discipline on an emergency scene, the public at large will immediately benefit.

40|$|Type III exits are {{a useful}} {{means of escape}} and they exist on a large {{proportion}} of the airline fleet. Evidence from aircraft accidents and previous research indicates that many passengers experience great difficulty in operating and evacuating through an overwing exit. There are two different approaches to improving passenger operating performance; these being improvement and simplification of the task itself or provision of clear instruction or practice for the passenger seated next to the exit. The first experiment investigated the impact of improvement to the Type III exit mechanism and practice on participant operation speed and accuracy. The results of a four-way Analysis of Variance indicated that both speed and accuracy of operation improved as a result of the exit redesign. A Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance also showed that the provision of practice led to a significant reduction in operation times. However, practising the operation of the current design of the Type III exit failed to improve participant speed of operation to the level achieved by participants when operating the modified exit for the first time. The results from the second study which investigated the impact of variations in safety briefings on participants' speed and accuracy of operation of the traditional Type III exit clearly indicated the benefits of providing some form of instruction. Allowing participants to watch a `fellow passenger' on a video performing the task led to quicker and more accurate exit operation. Variations in <b>pre-flight</b> <b>briefing</b> card design were also shown to improve operation accuracy. The implications of these results for the future development of self help exits, provision of training and design of briefing material are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) {{offers the}} {{opportunity}} to enable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers {{to serve as a}} primary means of navigation, worldwide, for precision approach down to Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV- 200) operation. Previous produced works analysed the performance of this new technique, clearly showing the potential of ARAIM architectures to provide the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) for LPV 200. However, almost all of the studies were performed with respect to fixed points on a grid on the Earth’s surface, with full view of the sky, evaluating ARAIM performance from a geometrical point of view and using nominal performance in simulated scenarios lasting several days. In our previous work we presented the ARAIM performance in simulated operational configurations. Attitude changes from manoeuvers, obscuration by the aircraft body and shadowing from the surrounding environment could all affect the incoming signal from the GNSS constellations, leading to configurations that could adversely affect the real performance. In this paper, we continue the previous work. The new proposed algorithm integrates ARAIM performance prediction capability, considering the attitude and terrain shadowing effects, in two different scenarios: In the design of instrument approach procedures. The algorithm could be used to improve the procedure of the development of new instrument approaches, reducing time, effort and costs. In the aircraft Flight Management Systems. The algorithm could support the pilots in the <b>pre-flight</b> <b>briefing,</b> highlighting possible integrity outage in advance and allowing them to select a different approach or making them aware of the need to utilise additional positioning systems. Increased awareness and better pre-flight planning could ultimately improve the safety of flights and contribute to the safe introduction of GNSS as a viable positioning method for instrument approach...|$|E
