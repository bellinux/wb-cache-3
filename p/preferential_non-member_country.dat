40|$|This paper investigates {{whether a}} {{regional}} bloc would enlarge or remain stagnant in size using a model where enlargement is the endogenous {{outcome of the}} interaction between the supply of and demand for membership. We show that a maximum size of the bloc exists beyond which the regional policy-maker will be unwilling to enlarge further, and that either the supply side or the demand side of membership might be binding in the determination of the equilibrium size of the bloc. Furthermore, we analyze how the deepening of integration within a regional bloc affects its width. We show that deeper integration may lead to wider integration when the demand side of membership is binding in the determination of the equilibrium size of the bloc, while the equilibrium size of the bloc will be unaffected when the supply side of membership is binding.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} trade {{benefits}} from {{the free trade agreement}} of the SAARC countries. It assesses the trade potential and trade creation with member and <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> The gravity model has been used to measure the bilateral trade flows and to assess the trade effect for member and <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Two analyses estimate the gravity model. The first analysis is based on cross-sectional data to capture the trade effect individually each year; and the second analysis utilises the pooled data to measure the overall trade effects and trade flows for the period 2003 to 2008. The results from the two approaches show that estimated coefficients are consistent with the model assumptions. Both analyses show that the regional trade agreement of the SAARC countries could divert the trade for member countries {{as well as for the}} <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> However, trade volume will increase only if the major partners (Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka) sign regional trade agreements.

40|$|Using the {{modified}} gravity model, {{this study examines}} whether the free trade areas of NAFTA, ANZCER and ASEAN would result in trade creation among the member countries and trade diversion with the <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Further, it applies Linder's income similarity concept to explain the trade patterns in the developed and developing countries within these free trade areas. First, {{the results suggest that}} the implementations of the free trade areas have facilitated higher trade among the member countries, particularly the ANZCER and ASEAN countries. However, among all three free trade areas, the formation of the ANZCER free trade area has resulted in trade diversion with <b>non-member</b> <b>countries,</b> whereas that of the ASEAN free trade area has resulted in a trade increase with <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Surprisingly, the formation of the NAFTA free trade area has no significant effect on trade with <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> as their trade flows remain quite low even before its implementation. Second, the result indicates that the trade-enhancing effect of income similarity is confirmed for the developing rather than developed member countries. The developing member countries with similar incomes would trade extensively more with each other. This result can be partly explained by Hanink's income threshold concept, which argues that the income similarity effect is only applicable to developed countries with very small difference in incomes. Given the heterogeneous country sample in this study, the substantial income differences among the developed member countries would probably account for the lack of income similarity effect in these countries.

40|$|The paper proposes some {{hypotheses}} {{about the way}} in which the EU contributes via its MEDA Programme to the promotion of intra-regional economic co-operation among Mediterranean <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> It argues that MEDA is indeed an important political and economic measure to create favourable conditions for increased trade and investment among Mediterranean <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Notwithstanding this general proposition, an institutionalist analysis of the implementation process of the MEDA Programmes for the years 1995 - 1999 reveals that deadlocks within the EU policy-making process have significantly weakened the overall success of financial and technical assistance. The paper provides an in-depth empirical analysis of the MEDA Programme and its contribution to enhance intra-regional economic co-operation. It argues that only if the institutional deadlocks can be overcome can MEDA function as the envisaged accompanying measure to the reform of Mediterranean <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> economic and social structures and, thereby, provide the basis for increased intra-regional economic co-operation. Recent reforms at the EU level have, at least partially, addressed the most pertinent shortcomings of the first five years of the operation of MEDA. However, political declarations, such as the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean, cast some serious doubts on whether the EU has the political will to underpin these organisational reforms with the necessary political leadership. This dilemma between cautious organisational reforms, on the one hand, and political stagnation, on the other, ultimately weakens the contribution the EU could make to foster economic co-operation among Mediterranean <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> via the MEDA system.

30|$|Trade {{diversion}} is {{the replacement}} of cheaper imports from <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> with products of member countries due to {{a free trade agreement}} (Balassa 1967; Richardon 1993). Trade diversion occurs when free trade agreements among member countries shift the trade inflow from non-number to member countries in a trading bloc to increase the flow of intra-trade. When member countries perform trading activities among themselves in a trading bloc (i.e., intra-trade), this is economic regionalism which contributes to the development of trade protectionism (Lim 2009; Schiff and Winters 2003; Ruggie 1994). Richardon (1993) also pointed out the consequences of trade protection resultant of free trade agreements on <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> (extra-trade). Nevertheless, the number of free trade agreements are increasing. It is therefore important {{to examine the relationship between}} free trade agreements and extra-trade.|$|R

But to get the average treatment of an RTA on the member and <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> as countries’ baseline real GDPs are different and I emphasize on every member’s welfare gain, I take average of percentage losses of 9 AFTA member countries. Hence in conditional, the average real GDP loss of AFTA member countries is 1.74 % after the removal of AFTA.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an update on}} the main elements of the reform agenda concerning the CEMAC trade regime as well as a tentative quantitative assessment of selected effects on tariff revenues and trade patterns. Notwithstanding data limitations, the key messages from the analysis are as follows. First, {{there is a need for}} a renewed political commitment to regional integration. In addition, key measures for improving compliance with the requirements for a customs union need to be introduced, including limiting tariff exemptions, phasing out remaining surcharges, strengthening the determination of products'' country origin, and enhancing customs administration. There is also a need to improve transportation infrastructure and organization. Finally, there is a strong case for tariff reduction, with or without an EPA. Trade liberalization would help boost economic growth and poverty alleviation and limit risks of trade diversion with an EPA. Tariff reform should be complemented by improvements in domestic revenue mobilization.
