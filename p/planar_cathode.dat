The preliminary simulation results showed that an electronic efficiency up to 4 % can be achieved with no external magnetic fields applied. However, the interaction mechanism is not clear. In the present work, the interaction mechanisms are studied. The MAGIC code is used to investigate the interactions between the electrons and the THz waves. To understand the interaction mechanism, the cathode has been trimmed to emit electrons. The simulation {{results show that the}} efficiency of the case corresponding to the trimmed cathode is higher than that of the original <b>planar</b> <b>cathode.</b> The interaction regions are located among the gaps between the cathode and the anode. The AC electric fields of the THz waves not only velocity-modulate the electron beam but also cause the density modulation of the field emission current.

One of the key determinants in the marketability of sodium hydrosulfite {{is the level of}} sodium thiosulfate in the product. At present, the level of thiosulfate from the electrochemical process is higher than that from the chemical process. Here a critical evaluation is presented of cathode materials for the electrochemical manufacture of sodium hydrosulfite nearly devoid of thiosulfate. It is demonstrated that the yield, selec-tivity, and efficiency of hydrosulfite and thiosulfate production depends upon the applied potential, pH of the feedstream,buffering capacity, and <b>cathode</b> material. Several <b>planar</b> <b>cathodes</b> for the electrosynthesis of hydrosulfite have been crit-ically evaluated.

Despite the resolution improvement using single-polarity charge sensing techniques, the variations in detector response, such as the peripheral asymmetry in coplanar grids and the material non-uniformity can still degrade the energy resolution of large volume CdZnTe detectors. A 3 -D CdZnTe spectrometer employs a pixellated anode and a conventional <b>planar</b> <b>cathode.</b> The pixel position provides the interaction’s lateral coordinates, while the interaction depths for single-pixel events are derived from the cathode to anode signal ratio. For multiple-pixel events, individual electron drift times are recorded to obtain the depth for each interaction.

30|$|It must be {{mentioned}} that the streamer corona, transient spark and micro-discharges produce the cold and non-equilibrium plasma discharges with the temperatures between 300 and 550  K. Besides, the glow discharge plasmas are hotter and still in the non-equilibrium conditions (1900  K). On the other hand, the microwave plasma discharges are much hotter with the temperatures between 3000 and 4000  K. Moreover, the vibrational temperature always remains higher than the rotational one. Thus, {{it shows that the}} plasma is in the PLTE condition. Furthermore, the conditions for the vibrational temperatures (2500 – 3500  K) govern transient spark and glow discharges. However, the rotational temperatures are higher for both the transient spark and glow discharges [56]. Moreover, as seen in Fig.  6 for the designed pulse plasma jet, the rotational and vibrational temperatures are about 360 – 1000  K at the applied voltage of 7  kV. Hence, the developed pulsed plasma jet is suitable for the sterilization applications [49]. In addition, in a typical experimental setup, Britun et al. used a thin wire electrode as anode which was placed over a <b>planar</b> <b>cathode</b> with the spatial distance of 500  µm between the powered electrodes.

To implement the controllable electron emission, five-sided and ten-sided faceted <b>planar</b> <b>cathodes</b> employing gated field emitters are considered as these emitters could be fabricated on flat substrates. For demonstration, the conformal finite-difference time-domain particle-in-cell simulation, as implemented in VORPAL, has been used to model a ten-cavity, rising sun magnetron using the modulated current sources and benchmarked against a typical continuous current source. For the modulated, ten-sided faceted cathode case, the electrons are injected from three emitter elements on each of the ten facets. Each emitter is turned ON and OFF in sequence at the oscillating frequency with five emitters ON at one time to drive the five electron spokes of the π-mode. The emitter duty cycle is then 1 / 6 th the Radio-Frequency (RF) period. Simulations show a fast start-up time as low as 35 [*]ns for the modulated case compared to 100 [*]ns for the continuous current cases. Analysis of the RF phase using the electron spoke locations and the RF magnetic field components shows that the phase is controlled for the modulated case while it is random, as typical, for the continuous current case.

40|$|Pixelated CdZnTe {{detectors}} {{can achieve}} 3 D position reconstruction, which enables 4 pi Compton imaging of gamma rays {{with a single}} detector and energy resolution better than 1 % full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 662 keV. The detector configuration, readout electronics, event reconstruction algorithms, multiple-pixel event performance, depth reconstruction, and complications due to readout electronics are discussed. In pixelated CdZnTe two dimensions of position sensitivity are determined based on which pixel collects charge. The third dimension comes from the signal ratio of the <b>planar</b> <b>cathode</b> to the pixelated anode, or, from the electron drift time for each pixel that collects charge. This work investigates the depth reconstruction using a collimated fan beam of gamma rays oriented such that counts are restricted to a narrow range of depths in a detector. The depth uncertainty is evaluated by measuring the fluctuation of the reconstructed depths of interaction. The depth accuracy is evaluated by calibrating the beam position and measuring the offset between the true depth of interaction and the reconstructed depth of interaction. Depth uncertainty and accuracy better than 1 mm FWHM is achieved at 662 keV for both single and multiple interaction events in 15 mm thick CdZnTe detectors. The energy reconstruction of pixelated CdZnTe is challenging for gamma rays that deposit energy on multiple pixels, due to factors such as signal crosstalk and system nonlinearity. This work details the impact of such factors on multiple pixel event energy resolution and, when possible, uses experimental data to put an upper bound on their effect. A correction is developed for the peak-hold circuitry of the readout electronics, improving the performance of events with at least three pixels that collect charge. The linearity of the system was also studied, especially {{as a function of}} the number of pixels that collect charge, resulting in energy resolution of 0. 36 % FWHM at 2614 keV.

Thick battery electrodes are capable of providing adequate energy, but long and tortuous diffusion pathways lead to low power capabilities. On the other hand, thin film batteries can operate at significant current densities but require large surface areas to supply practical energy. This dilemma can be solved by either developing new high capacity materials or by engineering new battery designs that decouple power and energy. 	Three dimensional batteries redesign traditional configurations to create nonplanar interfaces between battery components.

Energy density is maximized by layering material in the vertical direction, thus ensuring a minimal footprint area. 	Three dimensional carbon electrodes are fabricated using basic MEMS techniques. A silicon mold is anisotropically etched to produce channels of a predetermined diameter. The channels are then filled using an infiltration technique with electrode slurry. Once dried, the mold is attached to a current collector and etched using a XeF 2 process. Electrodes of varying feature sizes have been fabricated using this method with aspect ratios ranging from 3. 5 : 1 to 7 : 1. 3 D carbon electrodes are shown to obtain capacities over 8 mAh/cm 2 at 0. 1 mA/cm 2, or nearly 700 % higher than planar carbon electrodes. When assembled with a <b>planar</b> <b>cathode,</b> the battery cell produced an average discharge capacity of 40 J/cm 2 at a current density of 0. 2 mA/cm 2. This places the energy density values slightly less than thick-film microbatteries but with power density values larger than thin-film batteries. A 3 D zinc-air battery was also fabricated by electrodepositing zinc into a silicon mold. This battery obtained over 12 mAh/cm 2 and utilized 93 % of the available material...|$|E
40|$|<b>Planar</b> {{magnetron}} <b>cathodes</b> have arching {{magnetic field}} lines which concentrate plasma density near the electrode surface. This enhances the ion bombardment {{of the surface}} and the yield of sputtered atoms. Magnetron cathodes {{are used in the}} Plasma Electrode Pockels Cell (PEPC) devices of the Laser Program because they provide for significantly higher conduction than do glow discharges. An essential feature of magnetron cathodes is that the vector product of the perpendicular electric field, E[sub y], with the parallel component of the magnetic field, B[sub x], forms a closed track with a circulating current along the cathode surface. An analytical, 2 D, two component, quasi-neutral, continuum model yields formulas for the plasma density, the total and component current densities, the electric field, and the positive electrical potential, between the cathode surface and a distant, uniform plasma. For a specific gas, the free parameters are electron temperature, gas number density, and total current. The model is applied to the interpretation of experimental data from the PEPC device, as well as a small vacuum facility for testing magnetron cathodes. Finally, the model has been applied to generate cross sectional views of a PEPC magnetron cathode track...|$|R
40|$|<b>Planar</b> {{magnetron}} <b>cathodes</b> have arching {{magnetic field}} lines which concentrate plasma density to enhance ion bombardment and sputtering. Typical parameters are: helium at 1 to 300 milli-torr, 200 to 2000 gauss at the cathode, 200 to 800 volts, and plasma density decreasing {{by up to}} ten times within 2 to 10 cm from the cathode. A 2 D, quasineutral, fluid model yields formulas for the plasma density: n(x,y), current densities: j(x,y), j{sub e}(x,y), j{sub +}(x,y), the electric field: E{sub y}(y), and the voltage between the cathode surface and a distant plasma. An ion sheath develops between the cathode and the quasineutral flow. The thickness of this sheath depends on processes in the quasineutral flow. Experiments shows that T{sub e} (3 {yields} 8 eV) adjusts to ensure that {alpha}{sub 0 }{tau} {approx} 2. 5 in helium, for ionization rate {alpha}{sub 0 } (10 {sup 4 } {yields} 10 {sup 5 } s{sup - 1 }), and electron transit time to the unmagnetized plasma {tau} (10 {yields} 100 {micro}s). Helium glow discharge cathode fall {alpha}{sub 0 }{tau} is about 2. 5, though this occurs at much higher voltage...|$|R
40|$|Improving the {{theoretical}} {{understanding of the}} reactive magnetron sputtering process regarding facility layout and process control is essential for gaining access to high-precision film properties in consideration of homogeneity and reproducibility. Especially insights about plasma physics and target interaction within a magnetron discharge are required to derive reliable conclusions about dynamic process behavior and underlying parameter correlations on a macroscopic scale. In this work a parallelized three dimensional plasma simulation environment is introduced using the classical hybrid approach of combined Particle-in-Cell and Monte-Carlo simulation (PIC-MC) to handle charged particle movement as well as molecular interactions. Electric and magnetic fields are computed seperately using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM) respectively. For an increased flexibility in geometry decomposition and for the simulation of more complex boundary particle interactions, triangle meshed freeform objects can be mapped both into the field compulation and the molecular interaction domain. An exemplary PIC-MC simulation on a <b>planar</b> magnetron <b>cathode</b> is demonstrated taking into account three dimensional field geometry and spatial molecular dynamics. In contrast to simplified one- or two-dimensional models this holistic approach reveals a more detailed perception about plasma parameters and their coupling behavior along the target racetrack. This includes visualization of geometric target anomalities such as inhomogeneous target erosion and poisoning. The results obtained from the PICMC simulation can be further used for refinement of a heuristic plasma impedance model...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimisation}} {{is reported}} {{on the design of}} unbalanced magnetron (UBM) sputtering cathodes. For the study, a <b>planar</b> circular <b>cathode</b> backed by a double-coil electromagnet (compatible for a 100 mm diameter target) was developed. The variation of the structure and strength of the magnetic field in front of the target was investigated for different current combinations in the electromagnetic coils, and its effect on the sputtering process was analysed. The observations on the magnetic field geometry revealed some interesting features, such as the balancing point of the fields along the axis (null-point), and the zero axial region over the target surface (B-z = 0 ring). The positions of both could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of the electric current in the coils. The magnetic field null-point {{could be used as a}} reference for the region of homogeneous film growth. The B-z = 0 ring was the location where the glow discharge concentrated (or where the maximum target erosion occurred). The diameter of the ring determined the area covered by the discharge and thus the sputtering efficiency. The optimum substrate position can be fixed according to the position of the null-point and optimisation of sputtering can be achieved by adjusting the diameter of the B-z = 0 ring. The results of this study should be helpful in the designing of an ideal UBM using permanent magnets as well as electromagnets. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
