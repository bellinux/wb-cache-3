The Haggadah was published using <b>photocopying</b> <b>equipment</b> and distributed in hundreds of copies across Moscow and other major cities of the former Soviet Union. This Hagadah was meant to instruct in leading an exciting and spiritual Seder.|$|E

This venture {{was a huge}} gamble but ultimately the company's saving grace, until, once more in financial difficulties, it signed off increasing percentages of its holdings, to the parent company, finally becoming fully integrated into Xerox in the late 1990s.|$|E
40|$|The flow of {{data in the}} {{clinical}} chemistry laboratory has been studied {{with respect to the}} types of personnel handling it and the ultimate use of the data. In order to promote higher efficiency, a data processing system using punched cards has been devised and operated for a period of approximately 24 months. Forms, cards and general considerations useful in such a system are described in detail. Some of the problems associated with this type of operation are discussed, as are the economics of this system and its general applicability. 1 â€™TnEINCREASED DEMAND for services from clinical chemistry laboratories throughout the nation has been widely noted (6) and has stimulated much research on methods for handling laboratory analysis by semi-automatic means (1). Although in our laboratories we have adopted many of these devices, there has been left the formidable task of col-lecting, distributing, storing, and interpreting the information so ob-tained. We present here some of the observations made in our chemistry service concerning the flow and organization of laboratory data, a description of the prominent features of this process, and details of the pertinent steps we have explored ill making this phase of laboratory operations more efficient and useful. Recent reports indicate that the data-handling phase of laboratory operations is receiving increasing attention. Radin (4) has reported the application of edge-punched cards for manual handling of certain as-pects of laboratory data. Mason (2) described an interesting applica-tion of <b>photocopying</b> <b>equipment</b> to produce reports and short-term summaries. Swichtenberg et al.

40|$|In the U. S. {{national}} income and product accounts (NIPA's), {{most of the}} types of goods in the investment category "information processing (IP) equipment and software" have experienced rapidly changing technology and are thus candidates for inclusion in the new economy. The NIPA price indexes for computers and peripheral equipment, computer software, and communication equipment all, at least in part, include quality adjustments based on hedonic studies. In addition, anecdotal evidence strongly indicates that instruments have also have undergone substantial quality improvements, although no hedonic quality adjustments are currently being made to their prices. Together, these goods make up more than nine-tenths of the category. There is also some evidence that there have been substantial quality improvements for the remaining two types of goods in the category, <b>photocopy</b> and related <b>equipment</b> and office and accounting equipment. In order to facilitate research leading to improved measurement of information technology, this paper discusses the relationship between private fixed investment in IP equipment and software and GDP, explains how the current- and constant-dollar estimates are prepared, and finally assess recent progress in measurement and plans for improvement. ...|$|R
40|$|Closed loop supply chains comprise, in {{addition}} to the conventional forward flows from suppliers to end-users, a reverse flow of products, components, and materials from end-users to the manufacturers and secondary markets. Designing a closed-loop supply chain is a strategic level planning which considerably impacts on tactical and operational performance of the supply chain. It refers to the decisions taken on the location of facilities involved in the supply chain network along with the management of the physical flows associated with forward and product recovery channels. Our problem of interest is mainly motivated by the case of durable products including but not limited to large household appliances, computers, <b>photocopying</b> <b>equipment,</b> and aircraft engines. Such category of products has a modular structure, composed of independent components. As opposed to simple structured products, e. g., printer cartridges, that can only be recycled, each of the components in the reverse bill of materials of durable products can be recovered by a particular type of recovery process. Besides, durable products share a long life cycle characteristic which indeed makes designing their CLSC networks more complicated. In this thesis, in keeping with the abovementioned motivation, we focus on designing closed-loop and reverse supply chains in the context of durable products that are of various quality conditions. The recovery decisions for product return include remanufacturing, part harvesting, bulk recycling, material recycling, and landfilling/incineration. Moreover, we take into account environmental concerns regarding the harmful impacts of used products in the closed-loop supply chain planning. As the closed-loop supply chains typically encounter uncertainty in quality and quantity of the profitable return stream, we further aim to consider the impact of uncertainty in designing the recovery network. For such purposes, in the first phase, we address a closed-loop supply chain planning problem in the context of durable products with generic modular structures. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model which is then solved by an accelerated Benders decomposition-based algorithm. The performance of the proposed decomposition approach is enhanced through incorporating algorithmic features including valid inequalities, non-dominated optimality cuts, and local branching strategies. Next, in the second phase, we propose a precise approach to model the uncertain quality status of returns, in which the availability of each component in the reverse bill of materials is modeled as discrete scenarios. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model to address this problem setting. Then, since the cardinality of the scenario set grows exponentially with the number of involved components, we detail on a scenario reduction scheme to alleviate the computational burden of the proposed model. The stochastic problem is solved by a L-shaped algorithm enhanced through valid inequalities and Pareto-optimal cuts. Finally, we investigate designing a dynamic reverse supply chain where the quantity of the return flows is uncertain. We introduce a multi-stage stochastic programming model and develop a heuristic inspired by scenario clustering decomposition scheme as the solution method. It revolves around decomposing the scenario tree into smaller sub-trees which consequently yields a number of sub-models in accordance with sub-trees. The resulting sub-models are then coordinated by Lagrangian penalty terms. On account of the fact that each sub-model per se is a hard to solve problem, a Benders decomposition-based algorithm is proposed to solve sub-models...|$|E
