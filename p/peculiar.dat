5|$|But the {{equation}} of theft with disloyalty to Æthelstan's person appears <b>peculiar</b> to him. His preoccupation with theft—tough on theft, tough on the causes of theft—finds no direct parallel in other kings' codes.|$|E
5|$|Irregular {{galaxies are}} chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About {{a quarter of}} all galaxies are irregular, and the <b>peculiar</b> shapes of such galaxies {{may be the result of}} {{gravitational}} interaction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Peculiar</b> {{galaxies are}} galactic {{formations}} that develop unusual properties due to tidal interactions with other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|She {{also plays}} a part in David Racine's novel Floating in a Most <b>Peculiar</b> Way (1999).|$|E
5|$|Supernovae {{that do not}} {{fit into}} the normal classifications are {{designated}} <b>peculiar,</b> or 'pec'.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{more or less}} quirky traditions <b>peculiar</b> to {{individual}} colleges, for example the All Souls mallard song.|$|E
5|$|This {{symmetry}} of this ideal solution has the <b>peculiar</b> property of having zero net {{drag on the}} cylinder, a property known as d'Alembert's paradox.|$|E
5|$|A <b>peculiar</b> {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of {{detached}} towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|Another {{signature}} joke is {{the frequent}} visits by main characters to Sue White's office, {{in which these}} characters expect Sue to act {{as some kind of}} psychiatric counselor to them, only to be thwarted by Sue's ever more <b>peculiar</b> behaviour.|$|E
5|$|By careful examination, the {{luminosity}} {{was found}} to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any fragment of rotten wood attached to the specimen. This phosphoresence was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some <b>peculiar</b> condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.|$|E
5|$|Byne's disease, more {{accurately}} known as Bynesian decay, is a <b>peculiar</b> and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing chemical reaction) which often attacks mollusk shells {{that are in}} storage or on display {{for long periods of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The <b>peculiar</b> velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of <b>peculiar</b> velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E
5|$|However, chronic cobalt {{ingestion}} {{has caused}} {{serious health problems}} at doses {{far less than the}} lethal dose. In 1966, the addition of cobalt compounds to stabilize beer foam in Canada led to a <b>peculiar</b> form of toxin-induced cardiomyopathy, which {{came to be known as}} beer drinker's cardiomyopathy.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Green {{reunited with}} Tim Burton in Miss Peregrine's Home for <b>Peculiar</b> Children, a film {{based on the}} 2011 novel by Ransom Riggs. Green would {{collaborate}} once more with Burton in the 2019 Disney's live-action adaptation of Dumbo, co-starring with Colin Farrell and Michael Keaton.|$|E
5|$|In many {{instances}} I {{could have made}} the incidents more dramatic, would I have sacrificed my main object, the desire of exhibiting the misery and oppression, <b>peculiar</b> to women, that arise out of the partial laws and customs of society.|$|E
5|$|J. Rendel Harris {{pointed out}} that the menology of the Ferrar group {{contains}} saints which appear to be <b>peculiar</b> to Calabria or Sicily. Abbe Martin had previously stated that certain palaeographical traits to be observed in these manuscripts were characteristic of Calabrian scriptoria.|$|E
5|$|Klaus Thymann (born 1974) {{lives in}} London. His HYBRIDS project was {{published}} in 2007 and featured documentary photography with a global perspective exploring <b>peculiar</b> hybrid cultures around the planet, such as Snow Polo in St. Mortiz, Gay Rodeo in LA, Underwater Striptease in Chile, Underground Gardening in Tokyo and more.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several <b>peculiar</b> {{behavioural}} characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Men {{are like}} plants: the {{goodness}} and flavour {{of the fruit}} proceeds from the <b>peculiar</b> soil and exposition in which they grow. We are nothing but what we derive from the air we breathe, the climate we inhabit, the government we obey, the system of religion we profess, {{and the nature of}} our employment.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{visits a}} Seattle hospital {{to pick up}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher), who works there as a counsellor. Rothenburg is brought in on a stretcher by paramedics. Black notices a <b>peculiar</b> slash across her palm, and glances down at his own, which bears a scar matching the woman's cut exactly. Rothenburg then dies of her injuries.|$|E
5|$|Motile {{bacteria}} are attracted or repelled by certain stimuli in behaviours called taxes: these include chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy taxis, and magnetotaxis. In one <b>peculiar</b> group, the myxobacteria, individual bacteria move {{together to form}} waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores. The myxobacteria move only when on solid surfaces, unlike E. coli, which is motile in liquid or solid media.|$|E
5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The {{reason for this is}} still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a <b>peculiar</b> oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E
5|$|The codex uses a <b>peculiar</b> {{system of}} chapter divisions, which it shares with Codex Vaticanus and Minuscule 579. A more common system divides {{chapters}} {{according to their}} titles. The capital letters at the beginnings of sections stand out in the margin as in the Codices Alexandrinus and Ephraemi.|$|E
5|$|The title character, Strawberry Shortcake, {{lives in}} a fictional place called Strawberryland. In the special, narrated by Romeo Muller (as Mr. Sun), {{she and her friends}} {{celebrate}} her sixth birthday. While preparations for her party are underway, a villain called the <b>Peculiar</b> Purple Pieman plots to steal the berries from Strawberry's home in order to make his pies.|$|E
5|$|The verb {{systems and}} pronouns {{recorded}} by Baudrimont is <b>peculiar</b> in several ways. Apart from his problem of eliciting the citation form of verbs {{as opposed to}} participles, he lists pronouns and possessive pronouns that appear to contain Romani roots and an unexpected auxiliary.|$|E
5|$|These birds forage on {{the ground}} or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food. While foraging, they {{frequently}} spread their wings in a <b>peculiar</b> two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|These types {{would now}} all {{be treated as}} <b>peculiar</b> Type II supernovae, of which many more {{examples}} have been discovered, although it is still debated whether SN 1961V was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an impostor.|$|E
5|$|To the {{practical}} ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification {{in being able}} to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance, whether at rest, or during their flight; for not only every genus has something <b>peculiar</b> to itself, but each species has its own appropriate marks, by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something <b>peculiar</b> about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|Mountfort's early Gothic work in New Zealand was of {{the more}} severe Anglican variety as practised by Carpenter, with tall lancet windows and many gables. As his career progressed, and he had proved himself to the {{employing}} authorities, his designs developed into a more European form, with towers, turrets and high ornamental roof lines in the French manner, a style which {{was in no way}} <b>peculiar</b> to Mountfort but was endorsed by such architects as Alfred Waterhouse in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} <b>peculiar</b> fact {{associated}} with the episode was a letter by Senator Hillary Clinton and Representative John M. McHugh addressed to show character Josh Lyman, concerning the closing of an upstate New York army base. Josh {{points out that the}} deep-snow training base of Fort Drum is relatively useless in a time when most wars take place in desert terrain. Clinton and McHugh wrote a tongue-in-cheek response pointing out flaws in Lyman’s reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Strawberry's villain, the <b>Peculiar</b> Purple Pieman, lives {{atop the}} Pie Tin Palace {{on a black}} hill called Porcupine Peak. While she is doing chores, the Pieman sends his crows"berry birds"to {{retrieve}} some berries for his pies. Strawberry tries shooing the flock away with her broom, but a moving tree helps out as a scarecrow, and she thanks him for helping. In desperation, the Pieman heads down to Strawberryland himself to get his supply, dressed as a kind old peddler.|$|E
5|$|The Collégiale Notre-Dame de la Crypte is Cassel's main church, {{built in}} brick. Parts {{date from the}} 11th century but the main part is a 16th-century Gothic {{structure}} of a design known as a hallekerk or hall-church, <b>peculiar</b> to Flanders and Artois. It comprises a huge rectangular space with three gables, three aisles, three apses and a square tower over the transept. During his stay in Cassel during the First World War, Marshal Foch regularly prayed here.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spectral}} {{classification of}} these distant supernovae {{was performed by}} Rudolph Minkowski in 1941. He categorized them into two types, based {{on whether or not}} lines of the element hydrogen appeared in the supernova spectrum. Zwicky later proposed additional types III, IV, and V, although these are no longer used and now appear to be associated with single <b>peculiar</b> supernova types. Further sub-division of the spectra categories resulted in the modern supernova classification scheme.|$|E
5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their <b>peculiar,</b> flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a relationship to the Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities have historically been suggested for the dodo, including {{that it was a}} small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E
5|$|The snail's {{oesophageal}} gland houses symbiotic gammaproteobacteria {{from which}} the snail appears to obtain its nourishment. This species {{is considered to be}} one of the most <b>peculiar</b> deep-sea hydrothermal-vent gastropods, and it is the only known extant animal that incorporates iron sulfide into its skeleton (into both its sclerites and into its shell as an exoskeleton). Its heart is, proportionately speaking, unusually large for any animal: the heart comprises approximately 4% of its body volume.|$|E
