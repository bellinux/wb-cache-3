40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{processed}} product and the strategies on the final market strongly depends on the types of vertical relationship among the supply chain participants, on the types of economic agents (vine growers, wineries, bottlers), on their structural and organizational characteristics. We provide an original study of the wine processing sector by {{taking into account the}} role of the supply chain organization in determining the {{quality of the}} processed product. Indeed, the objective {{of this paper is to}} study the relationship between structural and organizational characteristics of the Italian wine processing sector and the incidence of quality wine production. Furthermore, we provide a regional description of wine processing units in terms of quality, plants’ size, type of vertical relationship and final product’s valorisation on the final market (through bottling specialization and localisation indexes). This analysis is based on the treatment and elaborations of data concerning harvest and <b>production</b> <b>declarations</b> (source: agea) and wine bottling stage (source: Infocamere - Unioncamere). Wineries are classified according to the degree of vertical integration between the vine-growing and the wine processing stage in agricultural wineries, industrial wineries and cooperatives. At national level, we show that agricultural wineries are mainly characterized by low quantity but high quality wine production, while industrial wineries are mediumbig size firms mainly oriented to table wine production. The regional analysis makes it possible to identify and describe some "structural and organizational typologies" that may characterize specific regional areas. We first point out a positive relationship between the incidence of quality wine production and the quantity of wine processed by (1) small-medium plants’ size wineries and (2) vertically integrated wineries. Moreover, we show that a strong regional orientation to quality wine production may coexist with a high level of specialization in bottling activities that facilitate the strategies for the development of brands on the final market (both of locally produced wine and of wine produced outside the region). ...|$|R

40|$|Alasdair Mann, {{the noted}} scholar of book culture in early modern Scotland, has {{suggested}} that a significant change had occurred in Scotland's relationship with the printed word by the late seventeenth century. This study sets out {{to explain how the}} interregnum served as a ‘watershed’ during which a consumer demand was created for popular print and how this in turn necessitated {{a significant increase in the}} production and distribution of printed material. Beginning with the sale of the press and patent of Evan Tyler to the London Stationers’ Company in 1647, the article charts the key factors that transformed Scotland's printing industry from the <b>production</b> of official <b>declarations</b> and works for foreign markets to the production of polemical texts for a Scottish audience. These developments also witnessed publication of the first serial news journal and the growth of a competitive market for up-to-date printed news. More than just an anomaly that flourished during a decade of occupation, these fundamental changes altered Scotland by introducing the large-scale consumption of chapbooks and printed ephemera, thereby initiating the nation's enduring print culture...|$|R
40|$|Recent European Union {{sustainability}} {{criteria for}} biofuels {{provide an opportunity}} to understand more precisely the relationship between national sustainable development policies and World Trade Organization (WTO) law. A desire to avoid WTO conflict was one reason for the omission of stronger criteria addressing negative social and environmental impacts of increased biofuels <b>production.</b> Thus, despite <b>declarations</b> of sustainable development’s central importance in WTO legal texts and statements by the Secretariat, national sustainability regulations risked trade law conflict. This article documents potential reasons for a WTO regulatory chill effect on the sustainability criteria. It then outlines challenges that the regulatory concept poses to trade law, which result primarily from its breadth and complexity, as well as the lack of targeted international standards, and its emphasis on production processes which intrude heavily, in an extraterritorial sense, on importers. It is important to identify these limitations to the mutual supportiveness between trade liberalization and national policies to achieve sustainability goals. However, despite these limitations, the case study also suggests that, with regard to sustainability criteria, sustainable development’s soft power as a WTO legal principle is an important source of influence...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advantages of database systems is that the underlying mathematics is rich enough to specify very complex operations with a small number of statements in the database language. This research covers an aspect of biological informatics that is the marriage of information technology and biology, involving the study of real-world phenomena using virtual plants derived from L-systems simulation. L-systems were introduced by Aristid Lindenmayer as a mathematical model of multicellular organisms. Not much consideration has been given to the problem of persistent storage for these simulations. Current procedures for querying data generated by L-systems for scientific experiments, simulations and measurements are also inadequate. To address these problems the research in this paper presents a generic process for data-modeling tools (L-DBM) between L-systems and database systems. This paper shows how L-system productions can be generically and automatically represented in database schemas and how a database can be populated from the L-system strings. This paper further describes the idea of pre-computing recursive structures in the data into derived attributes using compiler generation. A method to allow a correspondence between biologists 2 ̆ 7 terms and compiler-generated terms in a biologist computing environment is supplied. Once the L-DBM gets any specific L-systems <b>productions</b> and its <b>declarations,</b> it can generate the specific schema for both simple correspondence terminology and also complex recursive structure data attributes and relationships...|$|R

40|$|Wydanie publikacji dofinansowane przez Ministerstwo Edukacji NarodowejFor Clement Attlee the {{question}} of the nuclear energy control {{has become one of the}} most important in international relations since an American nuclear attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. British Prime Minister realized the danger created by the fact of invention of nuclear bomb and resting the secret of its construction exclusively in the hands of the USA. His fears were proved by the policy of the Soviet Union which became more and more unfriendly towards the USA and the states of the Western Europe. First of all Attlee aimed at creation of an international organisation for nuclear energy research control and at bringing both Russians and Americans to mutual agreement on that question. He initiated an activity leading to the organisation of conference of the representations of Great Britain, the USA and Canada. It should have made common attitude in nuclear energy control and disclosure of the results of actual research on it. Attlee also would like to prolong the Anglo-American co-operation in technology of production of nuclear weapon research, which existed since the Quebec Agreement in 1943. Clement Attlee, Harry Truman and Wiliam Mackenzie King met in Washington where on November 9 - 16 th 1945 the conference took place. As a result of that meeting the common declaration was proclaimed. It was a compromise between the claims of British Prime Minister and American plan of gradually disclosing of secrets of nuclear weapon <b>production.</b> Washington <b>Declaration</b> found out the necessity of creation of the Atomic Energy Commission as one of the agencies of the United Nations. The Commission should prepare the suggestions concerning: an international exchange of the scientific information, an atomic energy research control, an exclusion of the massive destruction weapon from the armament of the states. The USA also confirmed the necessity of further co-operation concerning atomic energy between the signatories of the Quebec Agreement. Washington Declaration was a success of the diplomacy of Clement Attlee. However it was a fusion of the British conception with the American one, but more important articles of that document were dominated by the political ideas of the British Prime Minister. His efforts allowed Great Britain to gain common control of the nuclear weapon, and in that way the United Kingdom obtained a confirmation of parity in the international policy. Zadanie pt.

40|$|Measures {{are being}} {{developed}} and implemented enabling the co-existence of conventional, genetically modified (GM) and organic cropping systems. In order to segregate GM from conventional crops in the entire supply chain, a food or feed company has to reorganise its production. This may involve for dedication of the production line to non-GM, or production can be organised on the same plant, using spatial or temporal segregation. In practice, only the latter method {{is used in the}} feed industry, as no investments in new machinery are necessary in the case. The segregation and identity preservation of GM and non-GM crops has to be well organised. An important tools used to proof the identity of the imported raw materials is the batch or product declaration and in some cases, a supplementary certificate of analysis for the raw materials is provided. In compound feed production, specific procedures to reduce carry-over are introduced and described in a book of charge, such as rinsing of transportation and <b>production</b> line, empty <b>declaration</b> of transport systems or storage bins and specific discharge and production orders. All these measures however imply supplementary costs to the manufacturer. A major additional cost is the price difference between GM and non-GM raw materials. Other extra costs result from losses in flexibility, a devaluation of the rinsing product, analysis and audits. As a result, the cost of a compound feed using non-GM is higher than with GM. Benefits to the segregation measures are an increased gamut of products and an improved organisation and management of the production. Together with an improved traceability system, consumers’ confidence is also increased. GMO, co-existence, costs, segregation, identity preservation, compound feed, Agribusiness,...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the quality of information available on the internet to patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Materials and Methods: The sources of information were obtained the keyword 'laparoscopic cholecystectomy', from internet searches using Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Ask and AOL search engines with default settings. The first 50 web links were evaluated for their accessibility, usability and reliability using the LIDA tool (validation instrument for healthcare websites by Minervation). The readability of the websites was assessed by using the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) and the Gunning Fog Index (GFI). Results: Of the 250 links, 90 were new links. Others were repetitions, restricted access sites or inactive links. The websites had an average accessibility score of 52 / 63 (83. 2 %; range 40 - 62), a usability score of 39 / 54 (73. 1 %; range 23 - 49) and a reliability score of 14 / 27 (51. 6 %; range 5 - 24). Average FRES was 41. 07 (4. 3 - 86. 4) and average GFI was 11. 2 (0. 6 - 86. 4). Discussion and Conclusion: Today, most people use the internet as a convenient source of information.
