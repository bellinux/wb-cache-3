40|$|Radiation {{emissions}} within territories that accommodate {{nuclear power}} facilities are monitored by stationary gamma radiation measuring systems. Any facilities that may contemplate the hazard of radioactive emissions {{must meet the}} safety requirements {{both in terms of}} normal conditions of their operation and in case of accidents. Thus, radioactive materials now in use must comply with strict rules. The account for and control of radioactive materials, their proper application, compliance with the rules and security measures minimize their impact on the environment. However, the loss of professional control over the above materials (various emergencies, losses in the course of transportation, plunders) may involve serious consequences. One of the most effective ways of reconnaissance of territories exposed to radioactive contamination to assure the search for the sources of radionuclides represents remote measurement of surface gamma radiation performed by <b>radiation</b> <b>meters</b> installed on unmanned airborne vehicles (UMAV). The main advantage of UMAV is that it may be used as the carrier of <b>radiation</b> <b>meters.</b> In addition to the gamma <b>radiation</b> <b>meter,</b> the system can take a video of different sources of hazards. The article demonstrates the results of tests of the unmanned <b>radiation</b> <b>meter</b> designated for remote sensing of the surface gamma radiation. The option of assessment of the intensity of the radiation and the concentrations of radionuclide fields is considered. It is noteworthy that the technology of remote scanning of the area can also be used for environmental surveying, technical inspection of structures and buildings, fire detection, photography of high-voltage lines and other facilities located in remote areas...|$|R

Readings were taken twice in a month for three months in the five different oil spilled site and one measurement taken at a control site {{where there is no}} oil spillage but within oil bearing community. The average radiation values in all the oil spilled site is 0. 019 ± 0. 006 mRh- 1, this is far above the 0. 011 ± 0. 003 mRh- 1 obtained for the control and ICRP 0. 013 ± 0. 005 mRh- 1 world background levels. The average equivalent dose rate obtained in all the five studied site is 1. 6 mSvy- 1 while the dose rate in the control is 0. 93 mSvy- 1. The results showed that all the oil spilled sites yearly equivalent dose rate exceeded the 1 mSvy- 1 maximum permissible limit recommend for the public and non-nuclear industrial environment by International Council on Radiological Protection (ICRP, 1999). All the oil spilled environment radiation levels exceeded the normal world average BIR level of 0. 013 mRh- 1 and other reported values in similar environment. This shows that the oil spilled environment have been impacted radiologically. This will pose some long-term health side effects on the clean-up workers and residents of the host communities.
