5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the diagram, the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|E
5|$|The 1969 fire raised public {{awareness}} of potential hazards <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> plant and led to years of increasing citizen protests and demands for plant closure. Releases from previous years had not been reported publicly prior to the fire; airborne-become-groundborne radioactive contamination extending well beyond the Rocky Flats plant was not publicly reported until the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Service Day {{is celebrated}} on 21 April every year. The purpose {{for this day}} is to rededicate and recommit {{themselves}} {{to the cause of}} the people. It is observed by all Civil Services.

5|$|After the war, the Command {{continued}} Anti-Submarine Warfare duties {{during the}} Cold War, {{to combat the}} threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Navy and other fleets of the Warsaw Pact. It ceased to exist in 1969 when it was subsumed into the newly formed Strike Command, which had also absorbed the former Bomber, Fighter and Signals Commands and later also absorbed Air Support Command, the former Transport Command.|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, {{even trying to}} take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E

5|$|By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was {{reported}} that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} period of German naval expansion, Britain {{did not feel}} {{particularly}} threatened. The Lords of the Admiralty felt {{the implications of the}} Second Naval Law were not a significantly more dangerous threat than the fleet set by the First Naval Law; they believed it was more important to focus on the practical situation rather than speculation on future programs that might easily be reduced or cut entirely. Segments of the British public, however, quickly seized on the perceived threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German construction programs. Despite their dismissive reaction, the Admiralty resolved to surpass German battleship construction. Admiral John Fisher, who became the First Sea Lord and head of the Admiralty in 1904, introduced sweeping reforms in large part to counter the growing threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> expanding German fleet. Training programs were modernized, old and obsolete vessels were discarded, and the scattered squadrons of battleships were consolidated into four main fleets, three of which were based in Europe. Britain also made a series of diplomatic arrangements, including an alliance with Japan that allowed a greater concentration of British battleships in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|English colonial {{traders and}} explorers from Carolina, since its {{founding}} in 1670, had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended {{all the way to the}} Mississippi. Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests.|$|E

5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|Otho and Vitellius {{realized}} the potential threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of}} being nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the grain supply to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.|$|E

5|$|Pinto Colvig as Grumpy and Sleepy in a dual role: Grumpy {{initially}} disapproves of Snow White's {{presence in}} the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Queen and rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs and is frequently seen with one eye shut. Sleepy is always tired and appears laconic in most situations. Sterling Holloway, who would later voice many other characters for future Disney films was originally considered to voice Sleepy by Walt Disney.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's {{concession}} speech {{emphasized the}} dangers of nuclear war and the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. Though he lost the nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election {{from the state of}} Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.|$|E
5|$|The French Atlantic fleet {{was even}} more {{dispersed}} than the British {{in the spring of}} 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly had sailed from Rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of the line at Brest to meet the threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British fleet under Lord Howe.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions {{were filled with}} earth, probably to allow heavier guns to be mounted on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 {{in response to the}} threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Spanish armada, and were probably kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's {{foreign policy is}} the country's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States. The common threat <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key {{issues such as the}} country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Warren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, {{visits the}} plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two {{additional}} tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase {{the output of the}} plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon (Mischa Barton), a reporter in the Paris Match, and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson. She impersonates the identity of an Associated Press reporter, but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> chemicals.|$|E
