40|$|An ever {{increasing}} feature of public office {{is the way}} in which the recruitment and training of civil servants are controlled by legislation. Civil servants are a basic component of public administration but they are also important for labor law because civil service relations have the characteristics of an employment relationship and also specific features resulting from the rules of public law. The relevant expression of the interferences between public and private law for civil servants is recruitment and training. The originality of this article lies in the multidisciplinary character, combining elements of labor law, administrative law and human resources management, character reflected in the bibliography used. Another merit of this study is that the authors correlated the provisions of various laws: Constitution, Labor Code, Law no. 161 / 2003 on the transparency in exercising public dignities and public functions, Government Ordinance no. 137 / 2000 regarding the <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanction</b> of all discrimination forms, Government Ordinance no. 129 / 2000 concerning adults’ professional training...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains two}} related, but separate reports. The Juvenile Crime Prevention Community Grant Fund Outcomes Report is {{a summary of}} outcomes from services and activities funded through the Juvenile Crime Prevention Community Grant Fund in FY 2001. The Juvenile Justice Youth Development Program Summary describes Iowa communities’ current <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanction</b> programs supported with funding from the Division of Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning (CJJP) during FY 2002. The material in Juvenile Crime Prevention Community Grant Fund Outcomes Report is presented {{in response to a}} legislative mandate to report specific prevention outcomes for the community Grant Fund. It includes a brief description of a Youth Development Results Framework established by the Iowa Collaboration for Youth Development. Outcomes are reported using this results framework, which was developed by a number of state agencies as a common tool for various state programs involving youth development related planning and funding processes. Included in this report is a description of outcomes from the prevention activities funded, all or in part, by the Community Grant Fund, as reported by local communities. The program summaries presented in the Juvenile Justice Youth Development Program Summary provide an overview of local efforts to implement their 2002 Juvenile Justice Youth Development plans and include <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanction</b> programs funded through the combined resources of the State Community Grant Fund and the Federal Title V Prevention, Juvenile Justice & Delinquency Prevention Act Formula Grant and Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant programs. These combined funds are referred to in this document as the Juvenile Justice Youth Development (JJYD) funds. To administer the JJYD funds, including funds from the Community Grant Fund, CJJP partners with local officials to facilitate a community planning process that determines the communities’ priorities {{for the use of the}} funds. The local planning is coordinated by the Iowa’s Decategorization Boards (Decats). These local officials and/or their staff have been leaders in providing oversight or staff support to a variety of local planning initiatives (e. g. child welfare, Comprehensive Strategy Pilot Projects, Empowerment, other) and bring child welfare and community planning experience to the table for the creation of comprehensive community longterm planning efforts. The allocation of these combined funds and the technical assistance received by the Decats from CJJP is believed to have helped enhance both child welfare and juvenile justice efforts locally and has provided for the recognition and establishment of connections for joint child welfare/juvenile justice planning. The allocation and local planning approach has allowed funding from CJJP to be “blended” or “braided” with other local, state, and federal dollars that flow to communities as a result of their local planning responsibilities. The program descriptions provided in this document reflect services and activities supported with JJYD funds. In many cases, however, additional funding sources have been used to fully fund the programs. Most of the information in this document’s two reports was submitted to CJJP by the communities through an on- line planning and reporting process established jointly by the DHS and CJJP...|$|E

40|$|Misogynous and sexist {{violence}} against women, which {{often results in}} death, represents a global problem. Numerous international and national legal instruments are dedicated to the <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> of {{violence against}} women. However, the reality implies that existing mechanisms of penal reaction to femicide, as its most extreme and brutal form, should be re-examined. Having in mind the frequency and severe consequences of this criminal offence and the discriminatory character of {{the message that the}} state sends by tolerating it or inadequately punishing its perpetrators, the author attempts to define femicide, to present basic forms of state reaction to femicide in comparative law as well as to analyze the features of femicide as an independent criminal offence. Arguing for the incrimination of femicide as an independent criminal offence, or as a special form of aggravated murder, the author points out that such solution could contribute to more precise observation of this form of crime, to a better estimation {{of the quality of the}} state‘ s reaction to it and to its more efficient suppression...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights concerning the conflicts between {{freedom of religion}} and freedom of expression, through the analysis of reciprocal interactions between {{the contents of the}} two freedoms in judicial balancing of the judges of Strasbourg. The paper traces the evolution of case law in the approach to offenses against religion, which since 2005 are considered by the European Court, worthy of restriction mainly if dangerous to public order. It can therefore be noted a loss of importance of the protection of religious feelings and religious freedom in the solution of these disputes, and an increasing centrality recognized the need to protect public order and social peace. This transition is evident in the case-law concerning the crimes of religious hatred, in which the religious dimension of the offense is recessive with respect to the content conveyed by the expression of hatred. If such an approach symbolically indicates the actual severity of the manifestations of hatred and intolerance (however justified) in contemporary societies, it also poses a number of problems both in terms of the principle of legality in criminal matters, both in the profile related to the <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> response, that these criminal behaviors require...|$|R
40|$|The {{violent crime}} rate among American Indians is {{twice that of}} the United States as a whole. Tribal {{communities}} are also beset by high rates of domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, alcohol abuse, and gang involvement. Given such factors, {{it is not surprising}} that tribal youth are exposed to multiple risk factors for delinquency. Indeed, while the violent crime rate for U. S. youth has steadily declined over the past several years, the rate of violent juvenile crime in tribal communities continues to grow. Risk factors for delinquency for the nearly 2 million American Indians who live on or near tribal lands are compounded by a lack of social services. Tribal communities are challenged by inadequate resources for their juvenile justice systems, resulting in insufficient training of law enforcement and other justice personnel and a dearth of programs that comprehensively combat juvenile delinquency through appropriate <b>prevention,</b> intervention, <b>and</b> <b>sanction</b> activities. This Bulletin describes the efforts of the Office of Juvenile Justice <b>and</b> Delinquency <b>Prevention</b> (OJJDP) to assist tribal communities through such initiatives as the Tribal Youth Program, the Triba...|$|R

50|$|The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, {{adopted by}} the UN General Assembly on 20 December 2006, also states that the {{widespread}} or systematic practice of enforced disappearances constitutes a crime against humanity. It gives victims' families the right to seek reparations, and to demand {{the truth about the}} disappearance of their loved ones. The Convention provides for the right not to be subjected to enforced disappearance, as well as the right for the relatives of the disappeared person to know the truth. The Convention contains several provisions concerning <b>prevention,</b> investigation <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> of this crime, as well as the rights of victims and their relatives, and the wrongful removal of children born during their captivity. The Convention further sets forth the obligation of international co-operation, both in the suppression of the practice, and in dealing with humanitarian aspects related to the crime. The Convention establishes a Committee on Enforced Disappearances, which will be charged with important and innovative functions of monitoring and protection at international level. Currently, an international campaign of the International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances is working towards universal ratification of the Convention.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is an {{analysis}} of the social treatment of victims of domestic violence and their institutional treatment in the context of gender stereotypes, prejudices and discriminatory attitudes, which are deeply rooted and widely spread among professionals involved in the <b>prevention</b> <b>and</b> prosecution of domestic violence. The aim of the paper is to point out how, and in what way institutional sexism becomes a barrier to effective <b>prevention,</b> prosecution <b>and</b> <b>sanctioning</b> of domestic violence and the cause of discrimination of victims of this form of violence in the exercise of the right to legal protection. In this context, the current situation in Serbia has been observed in light of the international standard of “due diligence”, which is normatively operationalized in Istanbul Convention (2011). From the perspective of this standard, the authors discuss the standpoints of the CEDAW Committee as well as the latest opinion of the European Court of Human Rights in the verdict of the case Eremia and others v. Moldova (2013), which {{was the first time that}} the Court held that institutional sexism was the main reason for the state authorities’ failure to provide adequate legal protection against domestic violence. The authors underscore that the state action on the recognition, demystification and eradication of the deeply rooted institutional sexism is one of the key prerequisites for an effective prevention of domestic violence in compliance with the international “due diligence” standard.

Community justice may bedefined Uy six core elements: it 1) operates at the local level; 2) is information-driven; 3) entailsproblem solving; 4) decentralizes authority and accountability; 5) requires citizen participation; and 6) is process-oriented. Each of these may befundamental features that distinguish community justice models from traditional approaches to crime. However, each alsoposes significant challenges to implementation. This articles examines the six challenges facing a community justice model. © 1999 John Wiliry & Sons, Inc. Change is happening in criminal justice and even more broadly across the public policy landscape. Government is no longer seen as the only answer to pressing social problems, yet some form of collective action is clearly necessary. Turning from the state, public pol icy is increasingly invoking the community. In criminal justice, the prefix is ubiquitous: community crime prevention, community policing, community prosecution, communi ty courts, community corrections, communityjustice (for a review of these developments, see Karp, 1998). This article examines the role of the community in preventing crime and promoting justice.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Instituto Universitario de Estudios de la Mujer. Fecha de lectura: 29 - 09 - 2017 Making use of {{a feminist}} and human rights-based theoretical framework, this doctoral thesis reveals the isolation experienced by women victims of sexual violence over the last 30 years in Spain, despite the positive developments in this realm {{and the existence of}} a regulatory framework specifically addressing gender-based violence. To undertake this analysis of sexual violence committed against women, I provide a much-needed examination of the theoretical and conceptual signification of sexual violence throughout history (from the Middle Ages to the 20 th century) and in particular {{from the time of the}} Spanish democratic transition to present day. This research offers a greater understanding of the factors behind the disregard experienced by victims of sexual violence in the 20 th century, in a wealthy country like Spain governed by the rule of law. This study was undertaken based on a detailed analysis developed by the theoretical and political feminist framework from the 1960 s to present day. In order to present the conclusions of this research, the numerous variables implicated in the issue are dissected making {{use of a}} feminist perspective – in dialogue with a human rights theoretical framework and approach. These are the variables which have permitted the systemic exercise of this form of violence and discrimination against women: the objective of sexual violence as one of the pillars supporting the patriarchal system; its origins, underlying causes and the permanent rape myths surrounding it, the various manifestations of sexual violence, as well as the constant impunity of those responsible. Using the above analysis as a point of departure, the second part of this doctoral thesis evaluates the responsibility of the Spanish state in the area of sexual violence using the due diligence standard, evidencing the absolute indifference of the State, which has failed to fulfil its obligations in terms of <b>prevention,</b> investigation <b>and</b> <b>sanction,</b> integrated attention <b>and</b> compensation for victims of sexual violenc...|$|R
