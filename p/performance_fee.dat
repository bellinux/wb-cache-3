25|$|Hedge fund {{management}} firms typically charge {{their funds}} both a management fee and a <b>performance</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> is {{typically}} 20% of the fund's profits during any year, though they range between 10% and 50%. Performance fees {{are intended to}} provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits. Performance fees have been criticized by Warren Buffett, who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses, such fees create an incentive for high-risk investment management. <b>Performance</b> <b>fee</b> rates have fallen {{since the start of}} the credit crunch.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how {{asymmetric}} <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> {{affect the}} <b>performance</b> and risk-taking {{of mutual funds}} in the Swedish market between 2012 – 2016. From our findings we cannot conclude that <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> induce fund managers to take on more risk. We find that mutual funds on average generate positive excess risk-adjusted return. However, funds utilizing <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> underperform those without by 0. 29 % per quarter. Moreover, we find a negative relationship between funds’ expense ratio and performance. This implies that investors trying to maximize their return should avoid funds with <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> and high expense ratios...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the general equilibrium implications of <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> linking the compensation of fund managers to {{the return of}} the managed portfolio relative to that of a benchmark portfolio. We find that symmetric (“fulcrum”) <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> distort the allocation of managed portfolios in a way that induces a significant positive effect on the equilibrium prices of stocks included in the benchmark portfolio, a significant negative effect on their equilibrium Sharpe ratios, and a marginally positive effect on their equilibrium volatilities: these implications of the model are consistent with the available empirical evidence. We also find that asymmetric <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> can generate the opposite pricing implications. Moreover, asymmetric <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> result in lower volatilities for benchmark stocks than for nonbenchmark stocks. Finally, we document that, within the class of fee structures we consider, some amount of benchmarking can improve the welfares of fund investors. ...|$|R
25|$|Management {{fees are}} {{calculated}} {{as a percentage}} of the fund's net asset value and typically range from 1% to 4% per annum, with 2% being standard. They are usually expressed as an annual percentage, but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly. Management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager, whereas the <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> provides the manager's profits. However, due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a manager's profits, and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds, such as CalPERS, for being too high.|$|E

Since then, Smith has led the association's lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission regarding issues affecting the television and radio broadcast industry. These issues include voluntary incentive auctions of broadcast TV spectrum, efforts by record labels to institute a <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> on local radio stations for music airplay, and retransmission consent rules. Broadcast industry executives have credited Smith's leadership with improving NAB's lobbying clout and influence. In October 2012, Smith was named as one of Washington's top lobbyists by The Hill.|$|E

500|$|The Foxtrot tour covered Europe and North America from September 1972 to August 1973. The {{show at the}} National Stadium in Dublin on 28 September 1972 {{marked the}} debut of Gabriel wearing a costume on stage, {{something}} that surprised the other band members as they were kept uninformed. Originally suggested by Charisma booking agent Paul Conroy, Gabriel went off stage during an instrumental section in [...] "The Musical Box" [...] and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head. The incident resulted in front cover reports in the music press, allowing the band to double their <b>performance</b> <b>fee.</b> [...] In December 1972, Stratton-Smith organised the band's first gigs in the US with a show at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts and Philharmonic Hall in New York City with openers String Driven Thing, in aid of the United Cerebral Palsy Fund.

40|$|Do fund incentives, {{volatility}} exposure, and {{liquidity risk}} affect fund performance? We show that hedge funds with high <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> and {{high water mark}} provisions tend to outperform those with low <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> and no high water marks. Moreover, funds that short volatility and embrace liquidity risk deliver significantly higher returns relative to funds that long volatility and eschew liquidity risk. Investors with access to secure capital and managed account platforms may be positioned {{to take advantage of}} these performance differences...|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{study by}} The Journal of Finance explains {{that one of}} the advantages to incentive, or performance-based, fees is that they align manager interest with investor interests. On this point, both groups do better when the investment does better. It is argued that management effort is generally higher for funds with <b>performance</b> <b>fees.</b> Since investors realize that funds with <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> draw the best managers and elicit the most effort, investors may be willing to place more money in these funds.|$|R
2500|$|Almost all {{hedge fund}} {{performance}} fees include a [...] "high water mark" [...] (or [...] "loss carryforward provision"), {{which means that}} the <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> only applies to net profits (i.e., profits after losses in previous years have been recovered). This prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance, though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund, rather than attempting to recover the losses {{over a number of years}} without <b>performance</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Some {{performance}} fees include a [...] "hurdle", {{so that a}} fee is only paid on the fund's performance in excess of a benchmark rate (e.g. LIBOR) or a fixed percentage. A [...] "soft" [...] hurdle means the <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> is calculated on all the fund's returns if the hurdle rate is cleared. A [...] "hard" [...] hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate. A hurdle is intended {{to ensure that a}} manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Some {{hedge funds}} charge a {{redemption}} fee (or withdrawal fee) for early withdrawals during a specified {{period of time}} (typically a year) or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment. The purpose of the fee is to discourage short-term investing, reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor <b>performance.</b> Unlike management <b>fees</b> and <b>performance</b> <b>fees,</b> redemption fees are usually kept by the fund.|$|R
25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds. The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of <b>performance</b> <b>fees.</b> To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no <b>performance</b> <b>fees.</b> The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the economic role of fees in aligning the incentives of money managers {{with those of}} investors. We examine a simple model in which manager effort (or investment in human and physical capital) is observed by the investor prior to her investment decision, but is not verifiable. This setup creates a positive economic role for net asset value (NAV) as a contracting variable and thus provides {{an explanation for the}} widespread use of contracts based on NAV in both the mutual and hedge fund industries. We also provide an explanation for why hedge funds use asymmetric <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> while mutual funds typically charge a fixed fraction of NAV (even though 'fulcrum' <b>performance</b> <b>fees</b> are available) ...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{hedge fund}} {{investment}} strategies aim {{to achieve a}} positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling ("absolute return"). Hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage. A hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee (for example 2% of {{the assets of the}} fund), and a <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> (for example 20% of the increase in the fund's net asset value during the year). Both co-investment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund. [...] Some hedge funds have several billion dollars of assets under management (AUM).|$|E

In late April, Vaughan began rehearsals for the tour in Las Colinas, Texas. When contract renegotiations for his <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> failed, Vaughan abandoned the tour days before its opening date, and he was replaced by Earl Slick. Vaughan commented: [...] "I couldn't gear everything on something I didn't really care a whole lot about. It was kind of risky, but I really didn't need all the headaches." [...] Although contributing factors were widely disputed, Vaughan soon gained major publicity for quitting the tour.|$|E

He attributed the violent scenes at the airport to citizens overreacting to a [...] "misunderstanding", and {{announced that he had}} lifted the tax on the band's earnings in the Philippines. Although Brown, writing in his 1983 memoir The Love You Make, said that the Beatles' <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> had been received from Ramos in two instalments, subsequent evidence suggests that the band were not paid.

2500|$|The group scored {{their first}} number-one hit with [...] "Where Did Our Love Go", {{paving the way}} for {{unprecedented}} success: between August 1964 and May 1967, Ross, Wilson, and Ballard sang on ten number-one hit singles, all of which also made the UK top 40. The group had also become a hit with audiences both domestically and abroad, going on to become Motown's most successful vocal act throughout the sixties. Following significant issues with her comportment, weight, and alcoholism, Florence Ballard was fired from The Supremes by Gordy in July 1967, hiring Cindy Birdsong from Patti LaBelle and the Blue-Bells as Ballard's replacement. Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & The Supremes, making it easier to charge a larger <b>performance</b> <b>fee</b> for a solo star and a backing group, as it did for other renamed Motown groups. Gordy initially considered Ross leaving The Supremes for a solo career in 1966 but changed his mind because the group's success was still too significant for Ross to pursue solo obligations. Ross remained with the Supremes until early 1970.|$|E
