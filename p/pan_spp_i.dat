40|$|Chimpanzees (<b>Pan</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{were tested}} on a habituation/dishabituation {{paradigm}} that was originally developed {{to test for}} comprehension of causality in very young human infants. Three versions of the test were used: a food item being moved by a hand, a human pushing another human off a chair to obtain a food item, and a film clip of natural chimpanzee behaviour (capturing and eating a monkey). Chimpanzees exhibited similar results to those obtained with human infants, with significantly elevated levels of looking on the dishabituation trials. Since the level of response was significantly greater on natural/unnatural sequences than on unnatural/natural sequences, we conclude that the chimpanzees were not responding just to novelty but rather to events that infringed their sense of natural causation...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the concentration of mercury in fish consumed in Marabá, Brazil which is located close to the Serra Pelada gold mines. Methods: Fish species which have great economic impact on the city of Marabá were selected for study in a pilot research programme. The species sampled were collected from fish sold at the Feira da 28, were from the species Cichla spp, Mylossoma spp and Pimelodus spp. The samples were processed through the Allegra method. Results: The measured mercury concentrations were Cichla <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> (0. 750 kg) 600 μg/kg, Cichla spp. II (1. 254 kg) 1000 μg/kg, Cichla spp III (2. 750 kg) < 2000 μg/kg; Mylossoma <b>spp</b> <b>I</b> (1. 300 kg) 100 μg/kg, Mylossoma spp II (2. 100 kg) < 300 μg/kg; Pimelodus <b>spp</b> <b>I</b> (0. 850 kg) 100 μg/kg, Pimelodus spp II (1. 050 kg) < 300 μg/kg. Conclusions: The concentrations of mercury in the fish samples analysed exceed the limits for consumption established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian government. The semi quantitative Allegra method for determination of mercury in environmental samples is confirmed as a suitable alternative for environmental monitoring programs which are relevant to public health.

40|$|Basal {{hominoids}} (i. e. apes, hominids and humans) appeared approximately 24 {{million years}} ago. The genus Homo derive from a hominoid lineage {{that includes the}} extinct australopithecines and the extant chimpanzees and gorillas (see Fig. 1). It is now well established that the closest relatives of modern humans are the chimpanzees (<b>Pan</b> <b>spp.),</b> with the Homo–Pan divergence having occurred 4. 5 – 5. 5 million years ago and the earlier separation of Gorilla 5. 5 – 7 million years ago (Goodman et al., 1994). Phylogenetic reconstruction using parsimony suggests that much of hominoid evolution occurred at mid-montane elevations (Fig. 1). Key features separating humans from their hominoid relatives are an enlarged neocortex, a reduced anterior dentition, bipedalism and sophisticated interindividual (and particularly intersexual) interactions (Lovejoy, 1981). Bipedalism, of course, is the salient locomotor feature of humans, and this trait is evident in fossils of our prehuman australopithecine predecessors as early as 4 million years ago (see White, 1980; White et al., 1994; Leakey et al., 1995) ...|$|R

Two genospecies (Bradyrhizobium <b>spp.</b> <b>I</b> and III) were distributed widely in all treatments, while Bradyrhizobium sp. II was found only in GL treatment. Cultivation with soybeans increased the rhizobial abundance and diversity, except for the soybean monoculture (S-S) treatment. In monoculture systems, soybeans favored Bradyrhizobium sp.

40|$|Fission-fusion social systems, {{in which}} members of a social {{community}} form frequently changing subgroups, occur {{in a number of}} mammalian taxa. Such systems are assumed to be a response to the costs of grouping, but evidence to support this hypothesis is limited. We use a linear programming approach to build a time budget model that predicts the upper bound on group size in order to test the hypothesis that fission-fusion social systems are the outcome of time constraints. Comparative data from 14 wild chimpanzee (<b>Pan</b> <b>spp.)</b> populations are used to derive a set of equations defining the relationship between climatic variables and time budget components, which are then used to calculate the upper limits on group size that can be maintained in different habitats. We validate the model by showing that it correctly predicts the presence/absence of chimpanzees across sub-Saharan Africa and the group sizes observed in natural populations. The model suggests that the costs of travel are limiting for chimpanzees. Chimpanzees can reduce these costs dramatically by fissioning their bonded communities into small foraging parties. If they did not, they would be unable to live in any habitats where they currently occur. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A total of 130 samples (25 each of chicken, mutton, poultry faeces, cloacal samples and 10 each of liver, spleen and kidney) collected from different sources were subjected to cultural and PCR methods {{for the presence of}} Salmonella and Salmonella enteritidis. Primers for invA and sefA gene were used for Salmonella and S. enteritidis respectively. Results: Out of 130 samples, 87 were positive for Salmonella <b>spp.</b> <b>i.</b> e. chicken- 16 (64 %), mutton- 12 (48 %), faeces- 23 (92 %), cloacal swabs- 23 (92 %), liver- 5 (50 %), spleen and kidney samples- 4 (40 %) each by PCR methods, whereas 77 were positive by cultural method i. e. chicken- 14 (56 %), mutton- 10 (40 %), faeces- 22 (88 %), cloacal swabs- 21 (84 %), liver- 4 (40 %), spleen and kidney- 3 (30 % each). Out of 87 positive for Salmonella by PCR method, 59 (chicken- 12, mutton- 7, faeces- 17, cloaca...|$|R
40|$|Bougainvillea is a {{very common}} {{ornamental}} plant grown almost {{all over the world}} in tropical and subtropical gardens. In this study, bract and flower parts of two different color paper flowers (Bougainvillea <b>spp.),</b> <b>i.</b> e. yellow and pink were investigated for phenolic content and flavonoid content. Total phenolic and flavonoid content of the bougainvillea glabra choisy and calforina gold flower extracts was determined by using the Folin- Ciocalteu reagent and aluminum chloride (AlCl 3) method. The total phenolic content was found to be 65. 25 µg mL- 1, 62. 56 µg mL- 1 respectively however the flavonoid content was 93. 11 µg mL- 1, 73. 96 µg mL- 1 for bougainvillea flower extract. Phenolic acids and flavonoids function as reducing agents and free radical scavengers From the research, it was concluded that the Flowers and bract of bougainvillea being rich in phenolics and flavonoid may provide a good source of antioxidant for treating ailments where oxidative stress is implicated as these flowers as potential sources of bioactive components with high antioxidant properties that may be of interest to consumers and public health worker...|$|R
