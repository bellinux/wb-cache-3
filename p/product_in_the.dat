5|$|Metformin {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a <b>product</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was completely forgotten, as other guanidine analogs, such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin.|$|E

5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company.

5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} {{sought and}} obtained from Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the <b>product</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken <b>product</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E

The market share in the Netherlands was 40% and 10% in Germany. Ampera sales fell 40% in 2013 to 3,184 cars, and within the plug-in hybrid segment, the Ampera was surpassed in 2013 by the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (8,197), Volvo V60 plug-in (7,437), and the Prius plug-in (4,314). In 2013 the Ampera ranked eighth among Europe's top selling plug-in electric vehicles, and its market share fell to about 5%. During {{the first five months}} of 2014, only 332 units had been sold, down 67% from the same period in 2013.

5|$|Upon {{completing}} his studies, Ravalomanana returned to Manjakandriana District, {{where he and}} his family began making and selling homemade yogurts, a common artisanal <b>product</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highlands region. On his bicycle, he collected milk from farmers in neighboring towns, gradually increasing his production and clientele. He opened his first yogurt and cheese production center in 1977 in Sambaina on land he named Rova-Tiko ("Tiko Palace"), where he would build the first Tiko factory several years later. His wife handled the administrative and accounting side of the business from Ankadivato, where the storage facility for finished products was located. By the end of the 1970s, Ravalomanana's dairy business employed five salaried staff members and was distributing its products in stores across Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uranium–thorium dating, {{involving}} {{the decay of}} 234U to 230Th, and ionium–thorium dating, which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. (The name ionium for 230Th is a remnant from a period when different isotopes were not recognised {{to be the same}} element and were given different names.) These rely on the fact that 232Th is a primordial radioisotope, but 230Th only occurs as an intermediate decay <b>product</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decay chain of 238U. Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process {{involving the}} alpha decay of 235U into 231Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both 232Th and 230Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230Th to 232Th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer.|$|E
