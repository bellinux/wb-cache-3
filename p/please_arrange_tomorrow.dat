40|$|Meetings: <b>Please</b> <b>arrange</b> {{meetings}} via email. Aims and Objectives: This module {{provides a}} thorough {{introduction to the}} rapidly growing field of Geographical Information Systems and Science. GIS are spatial databases, developed from earlier cartographic forms, which can handle spatial information in a far greater variety of ways than was previously possible with paper maps. By capturing, manipulating, integrating and displaying digital spatial data, {{a wide range of}} different analyses can be carried out and questions addressed. GIS is used in everything from social research- how standard of living in different geographical areas can be related to health and disease- to environmental work-linking maps of different farming practices with environmental models of soil erosion. GIS also has a very public presence: many people carry mobile phones that use satellite navigation Global Positioning Systems to display locational information. The class covers the key theoretical principles of GIS but it also provides practical hands-on exercises using current state-of-the-art Geographical Information Systems (GIS), providing training both raster (IDRISI Andes) and vector (ArcGIS) based software. GIS is a crucia...|$|R
40|$|Note {{from the}} {{coordinator}} This issue gives me particular pleasure, for which I thank the authors. For {{the first time}} since launching this InfoBull all contributions were unsolicited! Better yet, we were able to pick and choose among manuscripts offered. So perhaps we are over one daunting hill that faces all new serials. But, I will continue badgering those who have yet to contribute, especially you who have promised over the last few years, but have still to deliver! It might encour-age those in academic institutions to know that all arti-cles in this issue have been peer reviewed. This is anoth-er first. I intend to continue that, so your time and efforts will not be wasted. However, it remains a constant problem to catch rele-vant items of new literature. So we would be grateful if you could bring to our attention books, articles and other documents that you think should be reviewed, or at least noted. Better yet, <b>please</b> <b>arrange</b> to have a copy sent to us. Don’t forget that this Information Bulletin as well as most other SPC fisheries-related publications can be found o...|$|R

6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - You are {{properly}} paid at last, {{and it is}} like you will have but {{a shadow of a}} letter. I have been pretty thoroughly out of kilter; first a fever that would neither come on nor go off, then acute dyspepsia, in the weakening grasp of which I get wandering between the waking state and one of nightmare. Why the devil does no one send me ATALANTA? And why are there no proofs of D. Balfour? [...] Sure I should have had the whole, at least the half, of them by now; and it would be all for the advantage of the Atalantans. I have written to Cassell & Co. (matter of FALESA) 'you will <b>please</b> <b>arrange</b> with him' (meaning you). [...] 'What he may decide I shall abide.' So consider your hand free, and act for me without fear or favour. I am greatly pleased with the illustrations. It is very strange to a South-Seayer to see Hawaiian women dressed like Samoans, but I guess that's all one to you in Middlesex. It's about the same as if London city men were shown going to the Stock Exchange as PIFFERARI; but no matter, none will sleep worse for it. I have accepted Cassell's proposal as an amendment to one of mine; that D. B. is to be brought out first under the title CATRIONA without pictures; and, when the hour strikes, KIDNAPPED and CATRIONA are to form vols. I. and II. of the heavily illustrated 'Adventures of David Balfour' at 7s. 6d. each, sold separately.|$|R

I am not much better; yet I feel my illness is one of simple sickness and much increased by the terrible anxiety and apprehension I am suffering. From this I see no deliverance at all. I fear parents will not stand by me and that my school is dying in spite of itself and of me. Against this feeling {{there seems to be}} no remedy or relief, but some change in the stream of fortune which will reinstate the school, or which will give me absorbing occupation of a new kind The latter seems impossible: for the former I must strive as best I can. But the position as it is, is more painful than I can say”.Mgr. Lord Petre then retired to The Hyde in Ingatestone, Essex; also, in 1885 the Duchy of Lancaster granted him the Liberty of Clare and the Manor of Arnolds. Eight years later, he died at the early age of 46. How much did the anxiety and frustration of those years of striving to attain an educational ideal contribute to his early demise? Why was he not supported in his venture by the nobility of the day for whose children he was attempting to provide a new departure in Catholic education? He was a man of simple tastes and all who knew him spoke well of him. He was kind to his tenants, to the poor and especially to the young.|$|R
