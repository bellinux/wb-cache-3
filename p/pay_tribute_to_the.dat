5|$|In 1207, the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan (r.1206–1227) conquered and subjugated {{the ethnic}} Tangut {{state of the}} Western Xia (1038–1227). In the same year, he {{established}} diplomatic relations with Tibet by sending envoys there. The conquest of the Western Xia alarmed Tibetan rulers, who decided to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mongols. However, when they ceased to pay tribute after Genghis Khan's death, his successor Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241) launched an invasion into Tibet.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victor.|$|E

5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba.

This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E

5|$|Following the Smolensk campaign, the Commonwealth was {{threatened}} by another {{attack by the}} Ottoman Empire. During the wars against Ottomans in 1633–1634 Władysław moved the Commonwealth army south of the Muscovy border, where {{under the command of}} hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski it forced the Turks to renew a peace treaty. In the resulting treaty, both countries agreed again to curb the border raids by Cossacks and the Tatars, and the Ottomans confirmed that the Commonwealth to be an independent power, and had not to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Empire.|$|E
5|$|Heathen groups {{assemble}} for rituals {{in order}} to mark rites of passage, seasonal observances, oath takings, rites devoted to a specific deity, and for rites of need. These rites also serve as identity practices which mark the adherents out as Heathens. Strmiska noted that in Iceland, Ásatrú rituals had been deliberately constructed {{in an attempt to}} recreate or <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ritual practices of pre-Christian Icelanders, although there was also space in which these rituals could reflect innovation, changing {{in order to}} suit the tastes and needs of contemporary practitioners.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriters Jeb Stuart, Jeffrey Boam, Frank Darabont, and Jeff Nathanson wrote drafts before David Koepp's script {{satisfied}} the producers.

Shooting began on June 18, 2007, at various locations in New Mexico; New Haven, Connecticut; Hawaii; and Fresno, California, {{as well as}} on sound stages in Los Angeles. To maintain aesthetic continuity with the previous films, the crew relied on traditional stunt work instead of computer-generated stunt doubles, and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński studied Douglas Slocombe's style from the previous films.|$|E

5|$|Although the Song dynasty {{was able}} {{to hold back the}} Jin, a new foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), {{initially}} invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin. The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt. Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces. The Mongols also invaded Korea, the Abbasid Caliphate of the Middle East and the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán did not <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and {{complained that they}} had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and set them on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{consolidation}} of Wallachia, waves of nomadic peoples – the last of them being the Cumans and the Mongols – rode across the territory. The territory became a frontier area between the Golden Horde (the westernmost part of the Mongol Empire) and the Kingdom of Hungary after 1242. The Romanians in Muntenia, east of the Olt River, had to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mongols; and west of the river, in Oltenia, they were oppressed by the Bans of Severin, appointed by the Kings of Hungary. The Golden Horde's domination decreased in the region {{at the end of}} the 13th century, and at that time the Kingdom of Hungary also underwent a strong political crisis. These events enabled the incipient states of the territory to consolidate their autonomy.|$|E

5|$|The belated {{attempt at}} sanctification of the Bosnian monarchy gravely {{offended}} the Hungarian king Matthias, {{who saw the}} Pope's involvement in the coronation as an infringement {{of the rights of}} Hungarian rights. Matthias {{went so far as to}} request that the Pope withdraw his support of Stephen. Pope Pius and Bishop John Vitéz mediated in the dispute between the kings of Bosnia and Hungary, but the negotiations did not proceed easily. The relations were finally repaired in the spring of 1462. Matthias was driven by the need to ransom the Crown of St Stephen from Emperor Frederick III, and Stephen was obliged to contribute. In return for the Hungarian king's good graces, Stephen was also required to cede certain towns, swear fealty and to refuse to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contemporary}} accounts {{relating to}} Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin {{and tend to}} emphasize Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203 the garrison were making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted {{as a base for}} expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E
5|$|Han Chinese power {{during the}} tumultuous post-Tang era was {{represented}} by the Song dynasty (9601279), which completed its unification of the Chinese states with the conquest of Wuyue in 971. Turning to the north after this victory, in 979 the Song eliminated the Northern Han, ultimate successors to the Later Jin, but were unable to take the Sixteen Prefectures from the Liao dynasty. As a result of Song's military aggression, relations between the Song and Liao remained tense and hostile. One of the battlegrounds in the Song–Liao War was the Great Wall Gap (長城口), so named because the southern Yan wall of the Warring States period crossed the Juma River here into Liao territory. The Great Wall Gap saw action in 979, 988989, and 1004, and a Song fortress was built there in 980. Intermittent wars between the Song and the Liao lasted until January 1005, when a truce was called {{and led to the}} Treaty of Chanyuan. This agreement, among other things, required the Song to <b>pay</b> <b>tribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Liao, recognized the Song and Liao as equals, and demarcated the Song–Liao border, the course of which became more clearly defined in a series of subsequent bilateral agreements. Several stretches of the old Great Walls, including the Northern Qi Inner Wall near the Hengshan mountain range, became the border between the Song and the Liao.|$|E
