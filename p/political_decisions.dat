5|$|In September 1277 King Ottokar II held in {{the border}} city of Opava a meeting of Polish princes. Sources doesn't specify either the exact date or the participants. Historians {{speculate}} only that they could be: Henryk IV Probus, Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław of Opole with his sons, Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II. Several <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> were made during the meeting, most notably military actions against Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} was organized along similar {{lines to the}} British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's first line of defense relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, the {{military was}} to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in <b>political</b> <b>decisions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{many factors}} were {{important}} in arranging royal marriages. One such factor was {{the amount of}} territory that the other royal family governed or controlled. Another, related factor was {{the stability of the}} control exerted over that territory: when there was territorial instability in a royal family, other royalty would be less inclined to marry into that family. Another factor was political alliance: marriage was an important way to bind together royal families and their countries during peace and war and could justify many important <b>political</b> <b>decisions.</b>|$|E

5|$|Wilton {{returned}} for the series' 2005 Christmas special as Davies wanted {{to include a}} familiar character whose presence would ease the transition following {{a change in the}} series' lead actor. Despite her character having been introduced as fair minded and hard working, Harriet is depicted as an uncompromising Prime Minister, which led to comparisons to real life politicians. Response to the character's <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> prompted mixed commentary from the media; some reviewers felt that the character had acted unreasonably whilst others sympathised with her actions and felt her scripted political demise was unjust.|$|E
5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. <b>Political</b> <b>decisions</b> had {{to take into account}} the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. Beginning in the last decades of the sixteenth century, the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the north}} of Norway to a fairly {{distinguished}} family, he soon became interested in politics and history. Starting his political career in the Liberal Party, he switched to the Labour Party {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Hananu's {{subordinate}} {{officers and}} rank-and-file fighters were all Sunni Muslims, but were ethnically heterogeneous. Hananu {{himself was a}} Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar, while Umar al-Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha'ban Agha was a Turk. The ′isabat led by al-Bitar and al-Qassam were dominated by Arabs. The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels' sense of defending their homeland and community. Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to the revolt in the plural as thawrat al-Shimal (Northern revolts) rather than the singular thawra, and referred to {{the leadership of the}} revolt as the plural quwwad al-thawra rather than qiyadat al-thawra, which refers to a central command.|$|E
5|$|While in power, Rajoelina {{periodically}} {{engaged in}} ongoing negotiations to establish {{conditions under which}} {{free and fair elections}} could be held to restore government constitutionality and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} international community. On 4 August 2009 Rajoelina met with former Madagascar presidents Ravalomanana, Ratsiraka and Zafy along with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano acting as mediator at the four-day mediation crisis talks held in Maputo, Mozambique. The Maputo Accords signed by the four leaders in August and further accords signed in Addis-Abeba in November provided guidelines for a period of consensual political transition. In the months that followed, however, Rajoelina obstructed the implementation of the accords, making unilateral <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> and filling all important government posts with TGV party representatives.|$|E
5|$|Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona {{concluded}} a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen's role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> {{continued to be}} made by the much older and more experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, needlework and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> making is often complex and tedious. The policy process {{consists}} of multiple steps, {{most of them}} are highly iterative. In addition, different stakeholder groups are involved in <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> making and contribute to the process. A series of textual documents accompanies the process. Examples are official documents, discussions, scientific reports, external reviews, newspaper articles, or economic white papers. Experts from the political domain report that this plethora of textual documents often exceeds their ability {{to keep track of the}} entire policy process. We present PolicyLine, a visualization system that supports different stakeholder groups in overview-and-detail tasks for large sets of textual documents in the <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> making process. In a longitudinal design study conducted together with domain experts in <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> making, we identified missing analytical functionality on the basis of a problem and domain characterization. In an iterative design phase, we created PolicyLine in close collaboration with the domain experts. Finally, we present the results of three evaluation rounds, and reflect on our collaborative visualization system...|$|R

5|$|Queen Victoria {{assumed the}} title Empress of India in 1876. A durbar (court) {{was held in}} Delhi, India on 1January 1877 to {{proclaim}} her assumption of the title. The queen did not attend personally, but she was represented there by the Viceroy, Lord Lytton. A similar durbar was held on 1January 1903 to celebrate the accession of EdwardVII, who was represented by his brother the Duke of Connaught. In 1911, GeorgeV also held a durbar which {{he and his wife}} Queen Mary attended in person. Since it was deemed inappropriate for a Christian anointing and coronation to take place in a largely non-Christian nation, GeorgeV was not crowned in India; instead, he wore an imperial crown as he entered the Durbar. Tradition prohibited the removal of the Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom; therefore, a separate crown, known as the Imperial Crown of India, was created for him. The Emperor was enthroned, and the Indian princes paid homage to him. Thereafter, certain <b>political</b> <b>decisions,</b> such as the decision to move the capital from Calcutta to Delhi, were announced at the durbar. The ceremony was not repeated, and the imperial title was abandoned by GeorgeVI in 1948, a year after India gained independence.|$|E
5|$|While {{the largely}} {{underground}} southern section will reach Ny Ellebjerg station from The Central Station by 2023. South of the Central Station will four new stations be built before the line terminus at Ny Ellebjerg. Three {{of these four}} stations will pass through the southern parts of Copenhagen's harbour. The northern terminus will presumably be moved farther and farther out at the peninsula, which constitutes {{a large part of}} Copenhagen's northern harbour part, as the city aims to rebuild typical harbour buildings with housing. However the <b>political</b> <b>decisions</b> on the M4 topic, so far only deals with a line with a total of 13 stations between Orientkaj and Ny Ellebjerg.

Of the 44 stations in 2023, will 8 stations serve both Metro as well as S-train.|$|E
