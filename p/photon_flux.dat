5|$|The halo ring appears {{brightest}} in forward-scattered light, {{in which}} it was extensively imaged by Galileo. While its surface brightness is much less than that of the main ring, its vertically (perpendicular to the ring plane) integrated <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> is comparable due to its much larger thickness. Despite a claimed vertical extent of more than , the halo’s brightness is strongly concentrated towards the ring plane and follows a power law of the form z−0.6 to z−1.5, where z is altitude over the ring plane. The halo’s appearance in the back-scattered light, as observed by Keck and HST, is the same. However its total <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> is several times lower than that of the main ring and is more strongly concentrated near the ring plane than in the forward-scattered light.|$|E

Despite greater transparency of the resist, the incident <b>photon</b> <b>flux</b> is about 14 times larger (193/13.5) for the same energy dose per unit area. The resist thickness is limited by transparency as well as resist collapse and resist strip considerations.|$|E
25|$|When one pinhole is closed, {{the grid}} of wires causes appreciable {{diffraction}} in the light, and blocks {{a certain amount}} of light received by the corresponding photon-detector. However, when both pinholes are open, the effect of the wires is negligible, comparable to the case in which there are no wires placed in front of the lens (Fig.3), because the wires lie in the dark fringes, which the photons avoid. The effect is not dependent on the light intensity (<b>photon</b> <b>flux).</b>|$|E

25|$|Many salient {{characteristics}} of the fundamental molecules of life (those found in all three domains) all point directly to the involvement of UV-C light in the dissipative structuring of incipient life. Some {{of the most difficult}} problems concerning the origin of life, such as enzyme-less replication of RNA and DNA, homochirality of the fundamental molecules, and the origin of information encoding in RNA and DNA, also find an explanation within the same dissipative thermodynamic framework by considering the probable existence of a relation between primordial replication and UV-C photon dissipation. Michaelian suggests that it is erroneous to expect to describe the emergence, proliferation, or even evolution, of life without overwhelming reference to entropy production through the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential, in particular, the prevailing solar <b>photon</b> <b>flux.</b>|$|E

Crucially, the mechanism responsible for the upconversion in our system does not rely on multi-photon absorption via intermediate states, thus {{eliminating the need for}} high <b>photon</b> <b>fluxes</b> to achieve upconversion.

40|$|Abstract. We {{calculated}} for the nearest active galactic nucleus (AGN), Centaurus A (Cen A), the flux of high energy cosmic rays and of accompany-ing secondary photons and neutrinos expected from hadronic interactions in the source. We used as two basic models for the generation of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR) shock acceleration in the radio jet and acceleration in the regular electromagnetic field close {{to the core of}} the AGN, normalizing the UHECR flux to the observations of the Auger ex-periment. Here we compare the previously obtained <b>photon</b> <b>fluxes</b> with the recent data reported by the Fermi LAT and H. E. S. S. collaborations. In the case of the core model, we find good agreement both for the predicted spectral shape and the overall normalization between our earlier results and the H. E. S.

40|$|Interaction of very low-frequency {{primordial}} (relic) {{gravitational waves}} (GWs) to {{cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) can generate B-mode polarization. Here, {{for the first time}} we point out that the electromagnetic (EM) response to high-frequency GWs (HFGWs) would produce quasi-B-mode distribution of the perturbative <b>photon</b> <b>fluxes.</b> We study the duality and high complementarity between such two B-modes, and it is shown that such two effects are from the same physical origin: the tensor perturbation of the GWs and not the density perturbation. Based on this quasi-B-mode in HFGWs and related numerical calculation, it is shown that the distinguishing and observing of HFGWs from the braneworld would be quite possible due to their large amplitude, higher frequency and very different physical behaviors between the perturbative <b>photon</b> <b>fluxes</b> and background <b>photons,</b> and the measurement of relic HFGWs may also be possible though face to enormous challenge...|$|R

40|$|The key {{requirement}} for harnessing the quantum properties of light is {{the capability to}} detect and count individual photons.

Existing schemes for addressing this challenge rely on a proportional conversion of photons to electrons.

In this work, we employ a divide-and-conquer approach to infallibly discerning non-classicality of states of light. This is achieved by transforming the incident fields into uniform spatial distributions that readily lend themselves for characterization by standard on-off detectors. Since the exact statistics of the light stream in multiplexed on-off detectors are click statistics, our technique is freely scalable to accommodate-in principle-arbitrarily large <b>photon</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Our experiments pave the way towards genuine integrated photon-number-resolving detection for advanced on-chip photonic quantum networks...|$|R
