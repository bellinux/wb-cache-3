25|$|Since iPSCs can {{be derived}} {{directly}} from adult tissues, they not only bypass the need for embryos, but {{can be made in}} a patient-matched manner, which means that each individual could have their own <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> line. These unlimited supplies of autologous cells could be used to generate transplants without the risk of immune rejection. While the iPSC technology has not yet advanced to a stage where therapeutic transplants have been deemed safe, iPSCs are readily being used in personalized drug discovery efforts and understanding the patient-specific basis of disease.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 it {{was shown}} that <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> highly similar to {{embryonic}} <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can be generated by the delivery of three genes (Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4) to differentiated cells. The delivery of these genes [...] "reprograms" [...] differentiated <b>cells</b> into <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> allowing for the generation of <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> without the embryo. Because ethical concerns regarding embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> typically are about their derivation from terminated embryos, {{it is believed that}} reprogramming to these [...] "induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> cells" [...] (iPS cells) may be less controversial. Both human and mouse cells can be reprogrammed by this methodology, generating both human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and mouse <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> without an embryo.|$|R

Although induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> resemble embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> both morphologically and functionally, {{the extent to}} which these cell lines are truly equivalent, from a molecular point of view, remains controversial. Methods: Principal component analysis and K-means cluster analysis of collected Raman spectroscopy data were used for a comparative study of the biochemical fingerprint of human induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and human embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> The Raman spectra analysis results were further validated by conventional biological assays. Results: Raman spectra analysis revealed that the major difference between human embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> is due to the nucleic acid content, as shown by the strong positive peaks at 785, 1098, 1334, 1371, 1484, and 1575  cm– 1, which is enriched in human induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions: Here, we report a nonbiological approach to discriminate human induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from their native embryonic <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> counterparts...|$|R

Screening of fluorescent chemical libraries with human induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (iPSCs) and subsequent evaluation of hit molecules identified a fluorescent compound (Kyoto probe 1 [KP- 1]) that selectively labels human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Our analyses indicated that the selectivity results primarily from a distinct expression pattern of ABC transporters in human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and from the transporter selectivity of KP- 1. Expression of ABCB 1 (MDR 1) and ABCG 2 (BCRP), both of which cause the efflux of KP- 1, is repressed in human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Although KP- 1, like other pluripotent markers, is not absolutely specific for <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> the identified chemical probe may be used in conjunction with other reagents...|$|R
25|$|The {{impetus for}} SCNT-based stem cell {{research}} has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into pluripotent stem cells were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based {{stem cell research}}: the derivation of <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lines that have all genes linked to various diseases. Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron. This {{raises the question of}} how well iPS cells can mimic the gold standard ESC in experiments, as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type. SCNT stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe diverse cell {{states and}} in vitro {{conditions}} for the derivation and maintenance of the mammalian embryo-derived <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> raise the questions of whether there are multiple states of pluripotency of the <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> of each species, {{and if there are}} innate species-specific variations in the pluripotency state.

2500|$|Creating induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} ("iPSCs") is a long and inefficient process. Pluripotency refers to a stem cell that has the potential to differentiate into any of the three germ layers: endoderm (interior stomach lining, gastrointestinal tract, the lungs), mesoderm (muscle, bone, blood, urogenital), or ectoderm (epidermal tissues and nervous tissue). A specific set of genes, often called [...] "reprogramming factors", are introduced into a specific adult cell type. These factors send signals in the mature cell that cause the cell to become a <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell.</b> This process is highly studied and new techniques are being discovered frequently on how to better this induction process.|$|E

40|$|Impressive {{progress}} has been made {{since the turn of the}} century in the field of <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Different types of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have now been isolated from different types of tissues. <b>Pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are the most promising cell source for organ regeneration.

40|$|Human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{considered}} to be ideal cell sources for regenerative medicine, but their clinical and industrial application is hindered by their tumorigenic potential. Previously we have identified a <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> cell-specific lectin rBC 2 LCN recognizing podocalyxin as a cell surface ligand. More recently, podocalyxin was found to be a soluble ligand of rBC 2 LCN that is secreted specifically from human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into cell culture media. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, we have previously developed a sandwich assay targeting the soluble podocalyxin using rBC 2 LCN as a capturing probe and another lectin rABA as an overlay probe to detect human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> residing in cell therapy products derived from human <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> A drawback to this, however, was that cell culture media containing fetal bovine serum was found to cause a substantial background signal to the sandwich assay. To reduce the background and increase the sensitivity, we screened different overlay probes to detect the soluble podocalyxin. Among them, an anti-keratan sulfate monoclonal antibody called R- 10 G showed the highest sensitivity and provided a low background signal to fetal bovine serum. The established sandwich assay using rBC 2 LCN and R- 10 G was proved to be powerful, which allowed the high-sensitive detection of human induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> residing among clinical-grade cardiomyocytes and neural <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> both derived from human induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> The developed method has a possibility to be a standard technology to detect human induced <b>pluripotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> resided in various types of cell therapy products...|$|R
