40|$|Background and Aims. While several {{case reports}} on ischemic colitis (IC) suggest the {{presence}} of <b>predisposing</b> causative factors, {{a few studies have}} investigated the <b>predisposing</b> factors in IC. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of patients with IC, particularly focusing on the <b>predisposing</b> factors. Methods. We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of 159 patients with IC. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, endoscopic findings, and medical records were reviewed. Data were compared between groups of patients defined according to the <b>predisposing</b> factors. The <b>predisposing</b> factors are defined as temporary states or episodic events occurring within a week before the development of IC such as colonoscopy, enema, use of laxatives, heavy drinking, pancreatitis, shock, and burn. Results. Compared to the group of patients without <b>predisposing</b> factors of IC, the group of patients with <b>predisposing</b> factors was characterized by a relatively higher prevalence of male sex (56. 9 % versus 33. 3 %, p= 0. 005), younger age (60. 9 [*]±[*] 15. 4 versus 67. 2 [*]±[*] 13. 4 years, p= 0. 010), lower incidence of hypertension (43. 1 % versus 60. 2 %, p= 0. 044), and fewer risk factors (1. 24 [*]±[*] 1. 18 versus 1. 82 [*]±[*] 1. 22, p= 0. 005). Conclusions. Among men with <b>predisposing</b> factors, IC may develop even at a relatively younger age {{and in the absence of}} multiple risk factors, suggesting that <b>predisposing</b> factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of IC...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} mononeuropathy {{in the lower}} {{extremity}} involves the nerve. We retrospectively evaluated the etiological <b>predisposing</b> factors and clinical-neurophysiological features of 36 patients affected by peroneal mononeuropathy (PM). In 30 patients, a clear <b>predisposing</b> factor was identified. PM was more frequently perioperative (11 cases), associated with axonal involvement. Unexpectedly, PM was not only due to surgery close to the peroneal region, but was mostly associated with hip surgery and, rarely, with thoracic-abdominal surgery. A postural <b>predisposing</b> factor of PM was also frequently observed, usually associated with a pure conduction block. Conversely, most patients with bedridden <b>predisposing</b> factor presented axonal involvement, which was rarely associated with conduction block. In 25 of 36 PM cases, a long-term follow-up lead to an improvement (12 cases) or to good recovery (13 cases) of PM. In conclusion, our study shows that: (1) in most PM cases {{it is possible to}} identify a <b>predisposing</b> factor; (2) there is a good correlation between <b>predisposing</b> factor and neurophysiological involvement, and (3) PM usually has usually a good prognosis...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the landslide <b>predisposing</b> factors' combination using a bivariate statistical model that best predicts landslide susceptibility. The best model is one that has simultaneously good performance in terms of suitability and predictive power and has been developed using variables that are conditionally independent. The study area is the Santa Marta de Penaguião council (70 km 2) located in the Northern Portugal. In order to identify the best combination of landslide <b>predisposing</b> factors, all possible combinations using up to seven <b>predisposing</b> factors were performed, which resulted in 120 predictions that were assessed with a landside inventory containing 767 shallow translational slides. The best landslide susceptibility model was selected according to the model degree of fitness and on the basis of a conditional independence criterion. The best model was developed with only three landslide <b>predisposing</b> factors (slope angle, inverse wetness index, and land use) and was compared with a model developed using all seven landslide <b>predisposing</b> factors. Results showed that it is possible to produce a reliable landslide susceptibility model using fewer landslide <b>predisposing</b> factors, which contributes towards higher conditional independence...|$|R

5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling <b>predispose</b> to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors <b>predispose</b> to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Necrotic {{enteritis}} in chickens develops as {{a result}} of infection with pathogenic strains of Clostridium perfringens and the presence of <b>predisposing</b> factors. <b>Predisposing</b> factors include elements that directly change the physical properties of the gut, either damaging the epithelial surface, inducing mucus production, or changing gut transit times; factors that disrupt the gut microbiota; and factors that alter the immune status of birds. In the past research into necrotic enteritis <b>predisposing</b> factors was directed by the simple hypothesis that low-level colonization of C. perfringens commonly occurred within the gut of healthy chickens and the <b>predisposing</b> factors lead to a proliferation of those bacteria to produce disease. More recently, with an increasing understanding of the major virulence factors of C. perfringens and the application of molecular techniques to define different clades of C. perfringens strains, it has become clear that the C. perfringens isolates commonly found in healthy chickens are generally not strains that have the potential to cause disease. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate hypotheses regarding the development of disease, the origin of disease causing isolates of C. perfringens, and the importance of interactions with other C. perfringens strains and with <b>predisposing</b> factors. Many <b>predisposing</b> factors that affect the physical and immunological characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract may also change the resident microbiota. Research directed towards defining the relative importance of each of these different actions of <b>predisposing</b> factors will improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis and may allow refinement of experiment disease models...|$|R

5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is {{recognized}} in horses. Horses {{can develop a}} number of muscle disorders, many of which may progress to rhabdomyolysis. Of these, some cause isolated attacks of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., dietary deficiency in vitamin E and selenium, poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as organophosphates), while others <b>predispose</b> to exertional rhabdomyolysis (e.g., the hereditary condition equine polysaccharide storage myopathy). 5–10% of thoroughbred horses and some standardbred horses suffer from the condition equine exertional rhabdomyolysis; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} <b>predispose</b> the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that <b>predispose</b> to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
