50|$|Roediger {{is perhaps}} most widely known for his {{research}} in the area of false memory, looking at why and how people develop memories of events that never happened to them. Throughout the 1990s, he and his colleagues took the methodology from a relatively unknown study by James Deese from 1959 and worked to develop it into one of the most widely used tools in human memory research; the DRM Paradigm. In a typical DRM experiment, a subject listens to a list of related words, for example; Thread, <b>Pin,</b> <b>Eye,</b> Sewing, Sharp, Point, Prick, Thimble, Haystack, Torn, Hurt, Injection, Syringe, Cloth, Knitting, and is then tested on their memory for this list. Typically, subjects will recall or recognise an associated, but unpresented lure word (Needle). Roediger and McDermott asked people whether they actually remembered hearing this unpresented word, or if they merely felt like they had heard it. Interestingly, participants often reported actually remembering hearing the word, illustrating memory for an event that never occurred.|$|E
40|$|In {{a special}} issue of the Journal of Memory and Lan-guage devoted to {{research}} on memory illusions, Roedi-ger (1996) provided a historical overview of errors in perception and memory. He defined a memory illusion as an instance in which a person’s report of a past event seriously deviates from the actual event. One striking ex-ample offered as evidence of a memory illusion was Deese’s (1959) finding of false recall in a list-learning paradigm. Deese presented subjects with lists of seman-tic associates to nonpresented critical words. For exam-ple, for the critical word needle, the presented list con-sisted of thread, <b>pin,</b> <b>eye,</b> sewing, sharp, point, pricked, thimble, haystack, pain, hurt, and injection. When the subjects were given a free recall test after each list’s pre-sentation, the nonpresented critical word was often erro-neously recalled more frequently than nonpresented but unrelated words. This procedure induced subjects to re-call specific words that were never presented in the lists. Beginning with Roediger and McDermott (1995), {{there has been a}} revival of interest in this paradigm for study-ing this false memory effect (e. g., McDermott, 1996...|$|E

40|$|M. B. Miller and G. L. Wolford (1999) {{argued that}} the high false-alarm rate {{associated}} with critical lures in the Roediger-McDermott (H. L. Roediger & K. B. McDermott, 1995) paradigm results from a criterion shift and therefore does not reflect false memory. This conclusion, {{which is based on}} new data reported by Miller and Wolford, overlooks the fact that Roediger and McDermott's false-memory account is as compatible with the new findings as the criterion-shift account is. Furthermore, a consideration of prior work concerned with investigating the conditions under which participants are and are not inclined to adjust the decision criterion suggests that the criterion-shift account of false memory is unlikely to be correct. Roediger and McDermott (1995) resurrected a procedure first used by Deese (1959) that seemed to reliably produce false memories of words. The procedure involves asking people to memorize items that are closely related to a critical item that did not appear on the list. For example, participants might hear 15 words related to the critical item needle (e. g., thread, <b>pin,</b> <b>eye,</b> thimble, sharp, etc.), but needle itself would not be presented.

40|$|Objective of {{this study}} was to compare {{accuracy}} of placement of implant with three different positioning guides. Methods: Twenty-one patients were divided into three groups. In first group, implants were placed by using grid, second group (X-ray pin) and third group (wire eye). Pre- and postoperative radiographs were recorded by using radio visual graph (RVG). Planned insertion point (PIP) was marked and compared in all the three groups. Actual insertion point (AIP) was marked and compared, and the distance between AIP and nearest root of adjacent teeth was also measured. Results: Mean values of horizontal distance from GC to PIP by using grid guide, X-ray <b>pin</b> and wire <b>eye</b> was 0. 1514 ± 0. 1624, 0. 2829 ±. 1031 and 0. 379 ± 0. 069.

There is less chances of root injury by using grid guide as compared to other guides under study.

Since that she had undergone some troubles of her own by which the tone of her remonstrances had been necessarily moderated; but even now she could not forgive her sister such a lover as Luke Rowan. She would have been quite willing to see her sister married, but the lover should have been dingy, black-coated, lugubrious, having about him some true essence of the tears of the valley of tribulation.

The dynamics and stress analysis of an articulating crane with one loose joint is performed to illustrate the difference between the classic and modified joint assembly.

50|$|Power of the Dragonflame is the {{conclusion}} to the saga. The Ice Warrior has retreated {{to the town of}} Elgard, where Aresius heals his troubled mind. Despite all the losses, the Warrior is welcomed as a hero, and he travels once again to the holy city of Algalord to meet with the surviving Kings. Together, they organize a huge army to stop the forces of Akron and the Queen of the Dark Horizons. Akron, now more powerful than before thanks to the Emerald Sword, and even more powerful because he can drain power from the destruction his forces inflicted, is undefeatable. The Ice Warrior's army is completely surrounded, and they realize all is lost. Dargor, the Shadowlord, challenges the Ice Warrior to a final duel, and the Warrior defeats Dargor. Dargor does not die, though, but falls from a rock and gets trapped. The Warrior sees Dargor's predicament and helps him up. Dargor does not understand this act of mercy, and because he believes the Warrior to be evil (Akron having told him that the Warrior had murdered his family), he strikes him down with his sword. The Warrior didn't expect this from Dargor and, unable to talk to him, falls down bleeding heavily. Akron is now ready to declare total victory, and he occupies Algalord, reducing it to rubble. The Ice Warrior is tortured once again, and this time Dargor does watch. Finally he understands that what Akron had told him was untrue, and he turns against the Dark Lord. He strikes down and kills the Queen of the Dark Horizons, invokes the power of the Gargoyles, mythical stone creatures, and plans to kill Akron as well. Akron, however, gives a signal to a demon, who throws his weapon at Dargor, injuring his shoulder. Akron tells Dargor that he had long been expecting this betrayal. But Gaia, Dargor's mother and goddess of the Earth, gives Dargor one final burst of strength, and he knocks Akron down on to the platform where the Ice Warrior is lying, ready to be lowered into the marshes of Acheros to be devoured by the watersnakes. The Warrior shouts to Dargor to lower the platform, and he does so. Akron and the Warrior fall into the water and the Warrior plunges the Emerald Sword into the Dark Lord's right <b>eye,</b> <b>pinning</b> him to the platform, where he is devoured by the watersnakes. With a battle cry in final homage to the Warrior, Dargor personally leads the forces of Algalord to victory, with help from the Gargoyles he has summoned. They defeat the demons, and the Gargoyles throw all of them back through the gates of Hell, remaining there to guard them. Algalord is rebuilt, and the Gargoyle becomes the new symbol of the city. Dargor disappears until the next saga.|$|R
