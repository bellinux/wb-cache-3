The newspaper published an email from the Duke to Kazakh oligarch Kenges Rakishev, (who had allegedly brokered sale of the Prince's Berkshire mansion Sunninghill Park), and claimed that Rakishev had arranged meetings for the consortium. After initially claiming the email was a forgery, Buckingham Palace sought to block its publication as a <b>privacy</b> <b>breach.</b> [...] The Palace strongly denied the allegation that the Duke had acted as a [...] "fixer" [...] calling the article [...] "untrue, defamatory and a breach of the editor's code of conduct." ...|$|E

40|$|Since its {{inception}} in Jones v Tsige, legal practitioners have struggled with the tort of intrusion upon seclusion. The limited damages awarded in that case, and what the court indicated would be reasonable for <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches,</b> suggested that the tort would have limited utility as a stand-alone cause of action, and may only arise in {{in conjunction with other}} claims. However, the tort has recently been used successfully, at least at the summary judgment level, particularly in the class actions context where the aggregate claims make it more feasible to rely on the tort exclusively. In the wake of The Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in Hopkins v Kay, this paper examines intrusion upon seclusion in the context of <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> in the healthcare sector. This work purports to show that although a statutory regime exists to govern healthcare <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> in Ontario and other provinces in Canada, intrusion upon seclusion is the best method for addressing <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> in this context...|$|R

While the increasing popularity of smartphones and mobile technology has advanced communication, new uses have created <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> of personal and consumer information. This article examines the different ways that American smartphone users use their mobile devices as well as the various types of data created. This article also explores the vulnerabilities faced by smartphone users. Vulnerabilities occur through the use of traditional hacking and malware, but can extend to the collection and dissemination of personal and consumer information by smartphone applications. The article concludes by examining different solutions for <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches.</b> Some solutions may be implemented on an individual or institutional level. Other solutions to <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> require the enforcement and extension of legislation upon telecommunication companies and application developers. </p...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in the problem of building accurate data mining models over aggregate data, while protecting privacy {{at the level of}} individual records. One approach for this problem is to randomize the values in individual records, and only disclose the randomized values. The model is then built over the randomized data, after first compensating for the randomization (at the aggregate level). This approach is potentially vulnerable to privacy breaches: based on the distribution of the data, one may be able to learn with high confidence that some of the randomized records satisfy a specified property, even though privacy is preserved on average. In this paper, we present a new formulation of <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches,</b> together with a methodology, "amplification", for limiting them. Unlike earlier approaches, amplification makes it is possible to guarantee limits on <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> without any knowledge of the distribution of the original data. We instantiate this methodology for the problem of mining association rules, and modify the algorithm from [9] to limit <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> without knowledge of the data distribution. Next, we address the problem that the amount of randomization required to avoid <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> (when mining association rules) results in very long transactions. By using pseudorandom generators and carefully choosing seeds such that the desired items from the original transaction are present in the randomized transaction, we can send just the seed instead of the transaction, resulting in a dramatic drop in communication and storage cost. Finally, we define new information measures that take <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> into account when quantifying the amount of privacy preserved by randomization...|$|R
40|$|Information sharing {{has become}} a means of gaining public trust for {{institutions}} such as governmental and scientific organizations. The transparency sought through information sharing contributes to the trust of various stakeholders such as citizens, other organizations and enterprises in such institutions. Information sharing, on the other hand, may increase the chance of <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> due to, for example, information leakage and information fusion. Such <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> can undermine stakeholders’ trust and thus work against the purpose of gaining trust through transparency. Moreover, fear of potential <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> compels information disseminators to share minimum or no information. In this contribution we show that creating transparency through sharing information {{in the context of}} our public judiciary organization is a typical wicked problem. Subsequently we explain (the outcomes of) our designerly approach to design and intervene three artifacts within our organization. These artifacts are aimed at disseminating our judiciary data in a privacy preserving way, as privacy preservation contributes positively to the information sharing. Through addressing the privacy problem we try to address the transparency problem...|$|R

40|$|A welcome but {{unintended}} consequence of recent state disclosure {{laws in the}} U. S. (most notably California SB 1386), has been a continuous stream of <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> reported in the mass media. In this paper, we provide empirical analysis of disclosed breaches {{for the period of}} 2005 - 2006 to better understand what is happening in aggregate (overall patterns and trends) beyond the often sensational individual cases reported in the media. By processing raw data from the best available sources, we have created an Internet-accessible database that can be queried for breach statistics and a data set that can be shared so that our analysis can be validated, as well as enable future analysis by other researchers. The statistical analysis we report here is a first step toward answering the important and complex questions of why <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> are occurring and what may be the best practices to prevent and mitigate their effects. Policy formulation to address <b>privacy</b> <b>breaches</b> is already in process at the organization, state, and national levels largely driven by mass media coverage – it is our hope decision-makers take the empirical evidence we report here into consideration...|$|R

Finally, we present experimental results that validate the algorithm by applying it on real datasets. 1...|$|R
