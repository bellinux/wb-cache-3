5|$|As {{the light}} filters through leaves of trees during a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse,</b> the {{overlapping}} leaves create natural pinholes, displaying mini eclipses on the ground.|$|E
5|$|A <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse,</b> because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E
50|$|Saros cycle 143, repeating every 18 {{years and}} 11 days, {{containing}} 72 events. It consisted of 10 <b>partial</b> <b>eclipses,</b> 12 total eclipses, 4 hybrid events, 26 annular eclipses, {{and ends with}} 20 <b>partial</b> <b>eclipses.</b> The longest {{total eclipse of the}} series was in 1887 at 3 minutes and 50 seconds.|$|R

5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace {{as a result of}} the eclipse. The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|T Aurigae (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova {{discovered}} at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by Thomas David Anderson. It became {{visible to the}} naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova's discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a slow nova, similar to DQ Herculis. Like DQ Herculis, WZ Sagittae, Nova Persei 1901 and Nova Aquilae 1918, it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae's period of 4.905 hours, comparable to DQ Herculis's period of 4.65 hours, and has a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> period of 40 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

25|$|As {{an example}} of a single saros series, this table gives the dates of some of the 72 lunar eclipses for saros series 138. This eclipse series began in AD 1427 with a <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> at the {{southern}} edge of the Earth's shadow when the Moon was close to its descending node. In each successive saros, the Moon's orbital path is shifted northward with respect to the Earth's shadow, with the first total eclipse occurring in 1950. For the following 252 years, total eclipses occur, with the central eclipse in 2078. The first <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> after this will occur in the year 2220, and the final <b>partial</b> <b>eclipse</b> of the series will occur in 2707. The total lifetime of lunar saros series 138 is 1280 years.|$|E
