Then the different generations in optical fiber communication along with their features are discussed. Some aspects of total internal reflection, different types of fibers along with their size and refractive index <b>profile,</b> <b>dispersion</b> and loss mechanisms are also mentioned.

The efficiency was determined for flow-rates between 0. 1 and 1. 0 ml/min at temperatures of 303, 318, 333 and 348 K. The efficiency is poor (below 100 plates) at 303 K, but increases rapidly with increasing temperature. From studies {{of the effects of}} these two parameters, the band <b>profile</b> <b>dispersion</b> is attributed to flow anisotropy and adsorption-desorption kinetics.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} Schrödinger equation (NLS) with dispersion averaged nonlinearity {{of saturated}} type is considered. Such a nonlocal NLS is of integro-differential type and it arises naturally in modeling fiber-optics communication systems with periodically varying dispersion <b>profile</b> (<b>dispersion</b> management). The associated constrained variational principle {{is shown to}} posses a ground state solution by constructing a convergent minimizing sequence {{through the application of}} a method similar to the classical concentration compactness principle of Lions. One of the obstacles in applying this variational approach is that a saturated nonlocal nonlinearity does not satisfy uniformly the so-called strict sub-additivity condition. This is overcome by applying a special version of Ekeland's variational principle. Comment: 24 page...|$|E

A detailed analysis shows that the complex expression for pulse dispersion can be arranged in three groups of terms which may be defined as composite material dispersion, waveguide dispersion and composite <b>profile</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The analysis {{has been applied to}} a fibre for which the material dispersion parameters are accurately known and it is found that zero total dispersion can be obtained at a wavelength which depends on the profile and the core diameter but may be selected within a range roughly 1. 3 - 2 µm.

40|$|Measurements of pulse {{spreading}} in three graded index fibers {{have been performed}} over an extensive range of wavelengths, including regions in which the index profiles become optimal and the bandwidths correspondingly high. The refractive index distributions and <b>profile</b> <b>dispersion</b> parameter have been measured and used in a ray-tracing algorithm in order to predict bandwidths. Comparison reveals that averaging processes on the index data are usually necessary to account for noncircularity of the fiber and small variations in the deduced profile caused by the wavelength dependence of the near-field intensity distribution. Results obtained by this means usually tend to slightly underestimate the true fiber bandwidth, while alpha-profile predictions always result in overestimates by about one order of magnitude. Remaining discrepancies between measured and predicted bandwidths are attributed to small variations of the index profiles along the fiber length...|$|E

The optimal ridge waveguide cross section is obtained when the elliptical ridge top has a semicircular cross section.

40|$|The {{radial density}} profile {{of dark matter}} {{structures}} has been observed to have an almost universal behaviour in numerical simulations, however, the physical reason for this behaviour remains unclear. It has previously been shown that if the pseudo phase-space density, rho/sigma_d^epsilon, is a beautifully simple power-law in radius, with the "golden values" epsilon= 3 and d=r (i. e., the phase-space density is only dependent on the radial component of the velocity dispersion), then one can analytically derive the radial variation of the mass <b>profile,</b> <b>dispersion</b> profile etc. That would imply, if correct, that {{we just have to}} explain why rho/sigma^ 3 _r ~r^{-alpha}, and then we would understand everything about equilibrated DM structures. Here we use a set of simulated galaxies and clusters of galaxies to demonstrate that there are no such golden values, but that each structure instead has its own set of values. Considering the same structure at different redshifts shows no evolution of the phase-space parameters towards fixed points. There is also no clear connection between the halo virialized mass and these parameters. This implies that we still do not understand the origin of the profiles of dark matter structures.

40|$|Seismic {{surface wave}} methods gained {{popularity}} {{during the last}} decade to retrieve the shallow subsurface shear wave velocity (Vs) from the analysis of the recorded wave field. Besides early approaches, such as the Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves, based on a two-receiver setup and the passive methods, based on noise recordings which are not investigated here, the “Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves” method known as MASW, which exploits an array of receivers is up to date {{one of the most widely}} adopted non-invasive active-source approaches in the professional world for the evaluation of the stiffness properties of the ground for geotechnical engineering purposes an represent the starting point for many research fields. The method utilizes the dispersive nature of either Rayleigh and Love waves excited by an active source and recorded by a sensors array along a profile on the ground surface. Surface waves propagation allows for the construction of the dispersion curve which is then inverted to obtain the shear wave velocity <b>profile.</b> <b>Dispersion</b> curves generation requires the transformation of the recorded datasets i. e. the seismograms, from the time-space domain into a more suitable domain for the analysis, typically the frequency-wave number (f-k) or the frequency-velocity (f-V) domain where experimental dispersion curves of the propagating modes are extracted by locating the local maxima during the so-called picking operation. Finally, the misfit between theoretical and experimental dispersion curves is minimized during the inversion procedure. Available inversion algorithms assume the subsurface model as a stack of homogeneous parallel layers, so that they can only capture the vertical distribution of elastic properties of the subsurface model i. e. they are 1 -D. However this is only a convenient approximation of the actual subsurface conditions for most sites and it may yield misleading results if the actual soil profile is far from the assumed geometry. Despite this limitation, classic MASW approach still remain of value when the subsoil can be considered sub-horizontal. In this paper we investigate the effects of lateral heterogeneities such as variations of layers thickness on the f-V transform to assess the limitations and judge the reliability of traditional surface waves interpretation. To do so, we investigate the vertical component of accelerations computed by our three-dimensional elastodynamic solver based on the Spectral Element Method, for a 48 channels array on a simplified two Layers subsurface model. The obtained seismograms are transformed into the frequence wave-number domain where the influence of different sloping interfaces is investigated and compared to the Hermann’s theoretical modes for the neighboring flat layered conditions. Finally, different locations of a strong lateral variation are compared...|$|E

The convex <b>dispersion</b> <b>profile</b> provides an accurate description of the chromatic dispersion over the whole frequency range, thus allowing for a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the cascaded third order soliton compression when ultrashort pulses (< 1 ps) are considered. Typical dispersion-flattened and decreasing fiber (DFDF) has a convex curvature in its <b>dispersion</b> <b>profile</b> which varies along length of fiber. Compared to DFDF, the cascading of fiber segments with convex dispersion that stays constant along the fiber length greatly reduces the manufacture difficulties and provides a much simpler engineering design in practice.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of operating a non-simultaneous, bidirectional, unrepeatered communications link over long lengths of optical fibre at a data rate of 1 Mb/s is discussed. The link {{is intended for}} communicating between a stationary local terminal and a mobile remote terminal. A design study of the link {{has shown that the}} optical fibre is the most critical system component and that precise characterisation of the fibre is essential. A 1 Mb/s optical fibre data link has been constructed to test the validity of the design study, and has been successfully operated over a distance of 5 km with an error-rate of < 10 ^- 9. The optical receiver utilizes a silicon PIN photodiode feeding a low-noise preamplifier while the transmitter incorporates either a high-radiance LED or a cw semiconductor injection laser, generating half-width return-to-zero optical pulses at wavelengths of 0. 9 µm and 0. 85 µm respectively. Recently a distance of 10. 5 km has been achieved with a 25 dB signal/noise ratio for the LED source. An analogue system incorporating a PIN detector and LED source has also been demonstrated. The signal/noise ratio is 21 dB over 7 km of low-loss fibre. A new method has been invented, the near-field scanning technique, for providing a simple and rapid method for obtaining reproducible and detailed index-profile measurements. The index profile is determined by observation of the light intensity variation across the output face of a short length of fibre illuminated by an incoherent source. The profile obtained in this way may be suitable for many applications; however for accurate determinations it is necessary {{to take into account the}} presence of tunneling leaky modes which contribute additional power to the inferred refractive-index profile and cause a length-dependent error. A normalised correction factor is developed which may be applied to the measured intensity profile once the fibre length, core diameter and numerical aperture are known. The technique has been extensively investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, and the resolution appears to be good when scanning typical multimode fibres. It has allowed for the first time, observation of imperfections in the index profile right down to individual cvd layers. A novel technique is also reported for the determination of the <b>profile</b> <b>dispersion</b> parameter P, by direct measurement on the fibre itself. The method is based on the fact that measurement of the wavelength dependence of the numerical aperture yields the difference in dispersion between the core and cladding glasses from which P may be calculated. Very little sample preparation is required and accurate experimental data has been obtained over the wavelength range 0. 35 to 1. 9 µm for germanosilicate, phosphosilicate and borosilicate glasses, whilst the range 0. 35 to 1. 2 µm has been covered for fluoro-silicate glass. For germanosilicate glass, P is found to be independent of both dopant concentration and thermal history. The results show that the exploitation of the longer-wavelength region will require either the design of fibres specifically for 1. 3 µm operation, or the development of fibres which exhibit a low pulse dispersion over an extended spectral range...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} {{a number of}} studies to examine some high order effects of advanced trapping dynamics beyond the standard single gradient force optical trap. Our interests lay primarily on low symmetry particles, specifically on high refractive index, high aspect ratio nanowires. We examine higher order dynamics due to coupling between rotational and translational degrees of freedom when a single high aspect ratio nanowire is trapped. We also study the coupling of the trapping laser into the waveguiding modes of the trapped nanowire, as well as the coupling interactions between multiple trapped nanowires. On single optically trapped nanowires, we show calculations beyond the standard power spectral analysis to demonstrate the emergence of resonance behaviour in overdamped systems due to the coupling between rotational and translational degrees of freedom. We also experimentally demonstrate the effects of such coupling which shows up in the form of resonance peaks in the power spectrum when single nanowires are trapped in optical tweezers. Next we examine the coupling of light into the waveguide modes of high refractive index nanowires by calculating the field <b>profiles,</b> <b>dispersion</b> and group velocity. We then investigate the optical coupling between multiple high refractive index nanowires in close proximity. In particular, we calculate the field <b>profiles,</b> <b>dispersion</b> and optical force of coupled nanowire waveguides with the Coupled Mode Theory and Perturbation Theory. The optical forces between coupled waveguides is also calculated and compared to results obtained from Maxwell’s Stress Tensor calculations. In the final results chapter, we explore various experimental approaches to experimentally measure the coupled nanowire system that was calculated in the previous chapter. We propose time-shared optical tweezers with interferometric particle tracking as a means of physically measuring the coupling between nanowires and investigate the feasibility of this measurement technique for our system. In summary, we conducted theoretical analysis and experiments that aid in the further understanding of the advanced dynamics of high refractive index, high aspect ratio nanowires within the optical trapping domain...|$|R

40|$|A test of Newton's law {{of gravity}} {{in the low}} {{acceleration}} regime using globular clusters is presented. New results for the core collapsed globular cluster NGC 7099 are given. The run of the gravitational potential {{as a function of}} distance is probed studying the velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profile</b> of the cluster, as derived from a set of 125 radial velocities with accuracy better than 1 km/s. The velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profile</b> is traced up to ~ 18 pc from the cluster center.

Assuming for NGC 7099 a total V mag of M(V) =- 7. 43 mags and mass-to-light ratio M/L= 1, the acceleration at 10 pc from the center is 1. 1 e- 8 cm/s/s.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profiles</b> of clusters of galaxies for seven cosmological models.

We find that the velocity despersion profiles depend both on #OMEGA# and on #LAMBDA#. For #LAMBDA# = 0, the profiles are steeper in a lower-#OMEGA# model than in a higher-#OMEGA# one. The cosmological constant significantly weakens the dependence on #OMEGA#: the difference in the profile distributions between two flat models is much smaller than that between the two corresponding open models with the same #OMEGA#. These results in principle can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters when a large sample of the velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profiles</b> is available. Motivated by the practical situation that a sample of #approx# 100 clusters with #approx# 100 measured redshifts per cluster is still the best sample available in the foreseen future, we examine carefully to what degree the cosmological parameters can be constrained with the velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profiles</b> of such a sample of clusters. The limited sampling around clusters and the limited number of clusters seriously degrade the discriminative power of the velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profiles</b> among cosmological models.

Good agreement is demonstrated between extracted chemical shift differences from fits of <b>dispersion</b> <b>profiles</b> and the corresponding differences measured independently on a model exchanging system, validating the experiment. The methodology {{is applied to the}} gating residues of the T. acidiphilium proteasome that are shown to undergo extensive motion on the millisecond time scale...|$|R
40|$|With {{the success}} of the Chandra and XMM {{missions}} and the maturation of gravitational lensing techniques, powerful constraints on the orbital structure of cluster dark matter halos are possible. I show that the X-ray emissivity and mass of a galaxy cluster uniquely specify the anisotropy and velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profiles</b> of its dark matter halo. I consider hydrostatic as well as cooling flow scenarios, and apply the formalism to the lensing cluster CL 0024 + 16 and the cooling flow cluster Abell 2199. In both cases, the model predicts a parameter-free velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profile</b> that is consistent with independent optical redshift surveys of the clusters.

40|$|Abstract- A silicon {{waveguide}} {{is proposed}} in which dispersion value and its variation is effectively reduced over bandwidth. Dispersion tailoring is performed by tuning the structural {{parameters of the}} waveguide. Group velocity dispersion is varied between very low values of- 1. 1 and + 3. 3 ps/(nm. km) over an approximately 350 -nm bandwidth for an optimum structure. Because of ultra-flat group velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profile,</b> higher order <b>dispersions</b> are also very low. Real part of nonlinear parameter for the optimum waveguide is 355. 6 (W- 1 m- 1) at 1550 nm. Therefore, a good balance between nonlinearity and dispersion is provided that makes the waveguide applicable for highly efficient implementation of nonlinear functions in 1. 55 -µm wavelength range...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{measurements of}} the light and dark side of our Galaxy's halo, i. e. the stellar and dark matter halo. It describes the techniques used to obtain the kinematic tracers and the tracer density profiles to an unprecedented distance and unparalleled accuracy, which was not possible in previous works. We use a kinematic snapshot of two different halo tracers, namely, blue horizontal branch and K giant stars obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This data is {{used to measure the}} spatial density <b>profile,</b> velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>profiles</b> and mass distribution of the Milky Way. These recent measurements have important repercussions in our understanding of a formation history of the Galaxy and in the numerical simulations attempting to reproduce it. This thesis includes articles published in international peer reviewed astronomical journals over the candidature. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required. Non university access may be obtained by visiting the University of Sydney Library...|$|R
