It {{had previously been}} demonstrated that these systems displayed a dichotomy of reactivity, which generated α-functionalized-β′ -hydroxy ketones or 2, 2 -disubstituted oxetanes. Control over this dual reactivity was further investigated using nitrogen-based heteroaromatic nucleophiles. Regioselective control to provide substituted oxetanes was accomplished via formation of Lewis acid induced oxonium ion intermediates.

Five residues, S 70, S 130, N 132, T 235 and A 237, are involved in ligand binding. The gamma-OH group of T 235 and, {{in the case of}} benzylpenicillin, the gamma-OH group of S 130 interact with the carboxylate group, {{on one side of the}} ligand molecule. The side-chain NH 2 group of N 132 and the carbonyl backbone of A 237 interact with the exocyclic CONH amide bond, on the other side of the ligand. The backbone NH groups of S 70 and A 237 polarize the carbonyl group of the scissile beta-lactam amide bond. Four residues, S 70, K 73, S 130 and E 166, and two water molecules, W 1 and W 2, perform <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>of</b> the bound beta-lactam compound. E 166, via W 1, abstracts the proton from the gamma-OH group of S 70. While losing its proton, the O-gamma atom of S 70 attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the beta-lactam ring and, concomitantly, the proton is delivered back to the adjacent nitrogen atom via W 2, K 73 and S 130, thus achieving formation of the acyl-enzyme. Subsequently, E 166 abstracts a proton from W 1. While losing its proton, W 1 attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the S 70 ester-linked acyl-enzyme and, concomitantly, re-entry of a water molecule W' 1 replacing W 1 allows E 166 to deliver the proton back to the same carbonyl carbon atom, thus achieving <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>of</b> the beta-lactam compound and enzyme recovery. The model well explains the differences found in the kcat. values for <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>of</b> benzylpenicillin and cephalosporin C by the Streptomyces albus G beta-lactamase.

40|$|International audienceAminoacyl adenylates (aa-AMPs) {{constitute}} essential intermediates {{of protein}} biosynthesis. Their polymerization {{in aqueous solution}} has often been claimed as a potential route to abiotic peptides {{in spite of a}} highly efficient CO 2 -promoted <b>pathway</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> Here we investigate the efficiency and relevance of this frequently overlooked pathway from model amino acid phosphate mixed anhydrides including aa-AMPs. Its predominance was demonstrated at CO 2 concentrations matching that of physiological fluids or that of the present-day ocean, making a direct polymerization pathway unlikely. By contrast, the occurrence of the CO 2 -promoted pathway was observed to increase the efficiency of peptide bond formation owing to the high reactivity of the N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) intermediate. Even considering CO 2 concentrations in early Earth liquid environments equivalent to present levels, mixed anhydrides would have polymerized predominantly through NCAs. The issue of a potential involvement of NCAs as biochemical metabolites could even be raised. The formation of peptide–phosphate mixed anhydrides from 5 (4 H) -oxazolones (transiently formed through prebiotically relevant peptide activation pathways) was also observed as well as the occurrence of the reverse cyclization process in the reactions of these mixed anhydrides. These processes constitute the core of a reaction network that could potentially have evolved towards the emergence of translation...|$|R

Among these different CCK derivatives, [βAla 7], [dMet 6] and [dTrp 5]CCK- 8 were not hydrolyzed by enkephalinase: [dAlad]CCK- 8 was rapidly cleaved by the enzyme. [Bta 5] and [Bfa 5]CCK- 8 did not prove to be quite resistant; however the C-terminal tetrapeptides having the same modifications on the Trp residue were not cleaved although they interacted with the enzyme binding site.

40|$|Abstract — Based on {{the notions}} of Mendelian {{population}} and biological species, the commonly <b>proposed</b> <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> speciation are discussed {{with respect to the}} roles played by reproductive isolation as well as pre- and postzygotic incompatibility. It is emphasized that evolutionarily meaningful analyses of speciation processes require consideration of the conditions for establishment of the various mechanisms of isolation and incompatibility, which, in turn, necessitates specification of appropriate modes of inheritance of these mech-anisms. Properties desirable for genetic models of speciation are derived and compared with existing models. A general result on the joint evolution of underdominance in fitness and positive assortative mating is used to evaluate the significance of hybrid disadvantage and prezygotic incompatibility in speciation. The conclusions from this evaluation are compared with observations published in an analytical review of studies on incompatibil-ities among Drosophila species and with the results of a genetic analysis in two lacewing species presented as evidence for sympatric speciation...|$|R
50|$|Dilation {{occurs when}} nitric oxide (NO) is {{released}} from endothelial cells and diffuses into nearby vascular smooth muscle. Several <b>proposed</b> <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> NO-induced vasodilation {{have been proposed}} through haemodynamic investigation. It {{has been shown that}} NO inhibits 20-HETE synthesis, which may interfere with astrocytes’ constriction pathways and lead to vasodilation. It has also been proposed that NO may amplify astrocyte Ca influx and activate Ca-dependent potassium channels, releasing K into the interstitial space and inducing hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells. In addition to this, it has already been shown that NO stimulates increased cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels in the smooth muscle cells, inducing a signaling cascade that results in the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and an ultimate decrease in smooth muscle Ca concentration. This leads to a decrease in muscle contraction and a subsequent dilation of the blood vessel. Whether the vessels are constricted or dilated dictates the amount of oxygen and glucose that is able to reach the neuronal tissue.|$|R
