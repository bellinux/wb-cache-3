25|$|The {{basic duty}} of the {{receiver}} was to realise value for the floating charge holder, although all preferential debts, or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a duty to act only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given floating charges to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend Mr Russell, who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that Mr Russell, as administrative receiver, had acted for an improper purpose by refusing this deal. A further case of breach of duty occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for <b>professional</b> <b>negligence</b> was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that the receiver's power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|E

The report was in response to a perceived crisis in medical indemnity insurance. The objective was to restrict and limit liability in negligence actions. This paper will consider to what extent the reforms have impacted on the liability of health <b>professionals</b> in medical <b>negligence</b> actions. The reversal of the onus of proof through the obvious risk sections has attempted to extend the scope of the defence of voluntary assumption of risk. There is no liability for the materialisation of an inherent risk. Presumptions and mandatory reductions for contributory negligence have attempted to reduce the liability of defendants. It is now possible for reductions of 100 % for contributory negligence. Apologies can be made with no admission of legal liability to encourage them being made and thereby reduce the number of actions being commenced. The peer acceptance defence has been introduced and enacted by legislation. There is protection for good samaritans even though the Ipp Report recommended against such protection. Limitation periods have been amended. Provisions relating to mental harm have been introduced re-instating the requirement of normal fortitude and direct perception. After an analysis of the legislation, it will be argued in this paper that while there has been some limitation and restriction, courts have generally interpreted the civil liability reforms in compliance with the common law. It has been the impact of statutory limits on the assessment of damages which has limited the liability of health <b>professionals</b> in medical <b>negligence</b> actions...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} provide for successful, safe and high quality medical services, health care {{institutions}} need to be equipped with adequate medical devices. For this reason, every medical institution is legally obliged to have relevant medical devices. In case a patient has been deprived of some medical service {{for the lack of}} necessary medical devices (which the institution has been obliged to provide), the medical institution is responsible for the damage and harm sustained by the patient. The responsibility implies non-contractual liability (in tort law) or pre-contractual liability (in contract law). In both cases, the liability is based on the presumed culpability. In order to be excluded from liability, the medical institution has to prove that the patient has been deprived of medical service (or that the institution has refused to enter into a medical service provider agreement) on justifiable grounds, i. e. {{due to the lack of}} necessary medical devices. On the other hand, in case the medial institutions fail to provide needed care or violate their obligation to use medical devices when necessary, it is regarded as medical <b>negligence</b> (<b>professional</b> error). In most cases, it implies the liability of medical institutions for damage, injury or harm caused to the patient by medical services provided without applying a relevant medical device, whose use has been medically indicated. The liability is even more substantial in cases where the medical device has been available but the medical institutions has not applied it in medial treatment (even though its use has been medically indicated); such conduct is qualified as gross negligence...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the committee of preliminary inquiry (in the context of professional conduct committees) of the Health Professions Council of South Africa, with specific reference to maxillo-facial and oral surgery. An evaluation was done of cases that were referred by the committee for preliminary inquiry to this specific professional conduct committee of the Medical and Dental Professions Board. Where necessary, these cases were supplemented by relevant cases from other professional conduct committees. In order to achieve this goal, a comprehensive literature study was conducted on the broad concept of medical and dental misconduct and negligence. Specific attention was paid to the issues of expert testimony and witnesses and consent. Furthermore, a study was conducted to determine the legal framework in which these committees are supposed to function. In the cases where inquiries into the complaints against the registered practitioners followed, a detailed evaluation of the so-called legal process was done, as well as the findings in each case (in the context of the professional conduct committees). The results of this study have shown that the investigative system of the committee for preliminary inquiry preceding professional conduct inquiries into complaints against registered practitioners has certain shortcomings, especially in the more complex cases. The following proposals have been made (in order of most importance) : 1. Both the committee for preliminary inquiry and professional conduct committee must abide by the rules of natural justice, as pertained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. 2. Establishment of a Forum of Expert Witnesses that will evaluate all cases of alleged <b>professional</b> misconduct and <b>negligence</b> pertaining to the field of maxillo-facial and oral surgery, after it was evaluated and referred by the Ombudsman. 3. Appointment of a maxillo-facial and oral surgeon as Ombudsman to evaluate all cases brought before the committee for preliminary inquiry pertaining to the field of maxillo-facial and oral surgery. 4. Acceptance of the proposed test of medical negligence, i. e. the ‘reasonable person’s test’, subjected to that of the ‘reasonable specialist’ as standard for evaluation of cases of alleged negligence in maxillo-facial and oral surgery. 5. The proposed patient’s consent form serves as an example of a legitimate patient consent form. It follows that the legal requirements, especially in cases of extensions and deviations of medical interventions, must be adhered to. 6. It is advisable to belong to an organisation providing indemnity cover (such as Medical/Dental Protection Society) in order to receive proper assistance in the handling of these cases of alleged unprofessional/disgraceful conduct. The recommendations consequential to this study would provide a more streamlined, cost- and time effective investigative system to investigate claims of unprofessional conduct for possible further disciplinary action.

[...] The case involved a psychologist (Kaney) instructed as an expert witness in a personal injury claim, who was said to have negligently signed a statement of matters agreed with the expert instructed by the opposing side, in which she made a number of concessions that weakened the claim considerably. As a result, according to the injured claimant (Jones), he had to settle the claim for much less than he would have obtained had his expert not been careless. [...] To succeed in the claim, he had to overturn an earlier Court of Appeal decision that had decided that preparation of a joint statement with the other side's expert was covered by immunity from suit. [...] Kaney therefore succeeded in getting the claim struck out before trial on an application heard by Mr Justice Blake in the High Court of Justice. [...] The judge issued a certificate allowing the claimant to [...] "leapfrog" [...] the Court of Appeal and go straight to the Supreme Court to appeal against his decision.|$|E

2500|$|Tort is {{sometimes}} {{viewed as the}} causes of action which are not defined in other areas such as contract or fiduciary law. However, tort and contract law are similar in that both involve a breach of duties, and in modern law these duties have blurred {{and it may not}} be clear whether an action [...] " [...] in tort or contract"; if both apply and different standards apply for each (such as a statute of limitations), courts will determine which is the [...] "gravamen" [...] (the most applicable). Circumstances such as those involving <b>professional</b> <b>negligence</b> may involve both torts and contracts. The choice may affect time limits or damages, particularly given that damages are typically relatively limited in contract cases while in tort cases noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering may be awarded. Punitive damages are relatively uncommon in contractual cases versus tort cases. However, compensation for defective but not unsafe products is typically available only through contractual actions through the law of warranty.|$|E
2500|$|This wide {{discretion}} of the administrator to manage the company is reflected also in paragraph 3(3)-(4), whereby the administrator may choose between which result (whether saving the company, selling the business, or winding down) [...] "he thinks" [...] subjectively is most appropriate. This places an administrator in an analogous position to a company director. Similarly, further binding duties allow a broad scope for the administrator to exercise good business judgment. An administrator is subject to a duty to perform her functions as 'quickly and efficiently as is reasonably practicable', and must also not act so as to 'unfairly harm' a creditor's interests. In Re Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2) the administrator sold the insolvent company's business at an allegedly undervalued price, which creditors alleged breached his duty to not unfairly harm them. Millett J held the standard of care was not breached, and was the same standard of care as in <b>professional</b> <b>negligence</b> cases of an [...] "ordinary, skilled practitioner". He emphasised that courts should not judge decisions which may turn out sub-optimal {{with the benefit of}} hindsight. Here the price was the best possible in the circumstances. Further, in Oldham v Kyrris it was held that creditors may not sue administrators directly in their own capacity, because the duty is owed to the company. So a former employee of a Burger King franchise with an equitable charge for £270,000 for unpaid wages could not sue the administrator directly, outside the terms of the statutory standard, unless responsibility had been directly assumed to him.|$|E
