A series of giant and large {{porphyry}} Mo deposits have been reported in this belt including Shapinggou, Qian'e'chong, Tangjiaping Yaochong and Xichong etc. （Fig. 1 ）, as well as some Au, Pb-Zn deposits. The geology, geochronology and geochemistry of key porphyry Mo deposits in this belts have been reported by Yang (2009), Meng et al. (2012), Zhang et al. (2011), Zhang et al. (2012), Chen et al. (2013), Li et al. (2011), Huang et al. (2011), Gao et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2014). Most of these researchs is for Shapinggou, Qian'e'chong, Tangjiaping and Yaochong, no much for Xichong deposit. Based on field observation, petrographic, ore-microscopic, SEM/EDS, XRD results together with chronology and petrochemical results of fine grained granite (FGG), this paper discusses the alteration, minerlization and the genetic link between FGG and Mo - Cu mineralization in Xichong deposit. The results show that Yanshanian FGG formed at the starting of regional extentional and is closely related to Mo - Cu mineralization. The potassic-silification represents the early alteration and followed by sericite - quartz alteration <b>propylitization</b> and argillation.

The hydrothermal alterations associated with the mineralizations are represented by: the <b>propylitization,</b> the argillization, the phyllic and potassic alteration. The monoascenedant character of the mineralizations is predominant. The magmatic intrusions have been sequential placed and have represented the heat, metals and hydrothermal solutions source. In the first stages of mineralization the hydrothermal solutions contain predominantly magmatic water and in the final stages the water is of connate and meteoric origin. According to the structural magmatic control, to the mineralogical composition and to the hydrothermal alterations, the Herja ore deposits are of a low sulphidation epithermal systems type. ...|$|E

Mineralization in Zletovo deposit was accompanied by intensive alternations of volcanic rocks, with explicit manifetations round the ore veins.

40|$|Although the Au and U {{deposits}} of the Witwatersrand basin are {{generally regarded as}} modified placer in origin, {{the nature of the}} source area and the ultimate origin of Au and U still remain a major enigma. A number of domal outcrops of the Archcan basement are exposed in the Witwatersrand hinterland, revealing the presence of a diverse suite of granitoids and a minor (< 20 %) greenstone belt component. In addition, samples from over 130 boreholes drilled adjacent to the basin have revealed the character of subsurface Archcan basement beneath early Proterozoic sedimentary and volcanic cover. The granitic subsurface basement is commonly characterized by pervasive hydrothermal alteration evident as <b>propylitization,</b> sericitization, carbonation, and greisenization, as well as a variety of vein-related alterations comprising quartz + K-feldspar + chlorite + CO 3 [...] - sulfide + fluorite parageneses.

40|$|Abstract: The Late Cretaceous Silistar {{intrusion}} comprises of gabbros, gabbro-diorites to quartz-diorites and aplites, {{that were}} emplaced into a volcano-sedimentary succession of similar age. Structural {{data suggest that}} this intrusion {{is part of a}} larger, partially exposed body. A dense network of primary and secondary joints, in many places filled with various ore and gangue minerals, is a conspicuous feature of the intrusion. Hydrothermal alteration affecting the intrusion and the wall rocks includes: uralitization (amphibole–epidote), secondary biotitization and <b>propylitization.</b> Propylitic alteration occurred in two stages: high temperature (epidote-actinolite-chlorite) and middle to low temperature (sericite-chlorite-carbonate-epidote and chlorite-sericite-carbonate). Products of later alteration events include quartz-adularia, quartz-carbonate, carbonate, quartz-zeolites and zeolites. Apart from previously recognized contact-metasomatic mineralization, the presence of stockwork-type and disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization, hosted by both the intrusion and the host rocks, is documented here. Two types of magnetite and pyrite (magmatic and metasomatic) are recognized. Based upon the alteration products and ore minerals, the presence of two differing zones is suggested. The first zone, which closely coincides with the intrusion, is potassic and hosts py-ma-cpy-hm-(ilm). The second zone is propylitic with py-ma-cpy-hm-(ilm) +(sph+ga) +(bo+hz).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} geological settings, {{resources and}} mineral {{composition of the}} ore bodies of the Zhyrychi copper deposit found in the North-Western Ukraine {{at the end of}} the last century. The deposit is located in the Vendian basaltic flows and intraflow pyroclastics in central part of the Volhyn trappean province, originated in the Late Vendian during Tornquist rifting. The majority of copper is concentrated in native form and occurs as disseminated grains, veinlets and nuggets. Locally native silver, copper-sulphides (chalcosite, digenite, bornite and covellite) and cuprite replace native copper. The ore bodies are controlled by faulting and occur as strata- bound, but are locally enriched in nuggets in tuffs and fissured zones in basalts. Ag, Pd, Rh and Au can also be economically important. The major copper ores were deposited together with prehnite-pumpellyite paragenesis, originated in the succession: pumpellyite  prehnite (ąnative copper)  laumontite (or wairakite) (ąnative copper). The ore bodies were formed during cooling of the mineral-forming hydrothermal system {{at the end of the}} Vendian volcanic activity. The syngenetic intergrowths of native copper with prehnite, precipitated after pumpellyite, and homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions in later wairakite (210  335 °C) indicate that the major deposition of native copper took place at 200  400 °C. The following <b>propylitization,</b> smectitization and analcimization of the country rocks probably occurred during attenuation of the hydrothermal activity after magmatism ceased. All these processes were accompanied by dissolution of copper ore and its redistribution with local enrichment in copper nuggets...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. (Geology) Shear zone {{controlled}} {{hydrothermal alteration}} zones {{in the northern}} Kaapvaal craton (NKC) are developed in host rocks of vastly different chemical composition and metamorphic grade. Some carry appreciable Au and base metals and some are barren. Alteration zones in three different distinctive crustal zones were examined in detail to determine the controls of {{these two types of}} alteration. 1. The Matok Complex is situated in the southern marginal zone (SMZ) of the Limpopo Belt (LB), close to the zone of rehydration. Two major stages of hydrothermal alteration could be identified in local shear zones, a pervasive <b>propylitization</b> and a subsequent vein controlled quartzalbite alteration. The two-stage alteration occurred sometimes between the emplacement of the Matok Complex (2670 Ma) and the intrusion of unaltered mafic dykes (1900 Ma). Calculated isotopic compositions of the hydrothermal fluids indicate that magmatic ± meteoric waters as well as juvenile C 02 were responsible for the establishment of the alteration zones. The fluids most probably were late magmatic fluids associated with the Matok magmatism. The propylitic alteration was accompanied by introduction of small amounts of CU + Au and represents an alteration type identical to that developed in porphyry copper deposits. The subsequent quartz-albite alteration was caused by extremely saline fluids which depleted the rocks of all the major and trace elements with exception of Si, Al, Na and Zr. 2. This chemical alteration pattern' contrasts with those developed in two alteration zones associated with economic gold mineralization in greenstone belts of the NKC (Sutherland and Pietersburg belts). At the Birthday and Eersteling gold mines, a biotite-calcite-quartz alteration is developed. The chemical pattern of the alteration is [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The giant Imiter epithermal Ag–Hg {{vein deposit}} in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of {{southern}} Morocco formed during a major episode of mineralization linked with Ediacaran volcanism at ca. 550 Ma. Silver was deposited during two main epithermal mineralizing events {{referred to as}} epithermal-quartz (ESE-Qz) and epithermal-dolomite (ESE-Dol) stages under distinct stress fields (i. e., WNW-ESE and N-S shortening directions), and is confined to the late Neoproterozoic, N 60 - 90 ° E-trending, transcrustal Imiter fault zone. Economic orebodies are aligned mainly along the interface between sedimentary and volcanic units of lower and upper Cryogenian age. The ore mineralogy consists principally of Ag–Hg amalgam, argentite, polybasite, pearceite, tetrahedritetennantite, proustite-pyrargyrite, imiterite, acanthite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite, and galena. Gangue constituents are dominated by quartz (ESE-Qz stage) and dolomite (ESE-Dol stage). Wall-rock alteration is well developed and includes silicification and dolomitization, and minor <b>propylitization</b> and kaolinitization. Fluid inclusion data indicate that the mineralizing fluids evolved through time, from a mean temperature of * 180 °C and salinity of * 10 wt% NaCl during ESE-Qz stage I, to a mean temperature of * 165 °C and salinity of * 24 wt% NaCl equiv during ESE-Dol stage II. Calculated trapping pressures, {{in the range of}} 1. 1 – 0. 9 kbar, exclude fluid unmixing “effervescence” as a viable ore depositional mechanism. Conversely, halogen compositions suggest the involvement of magmatic brines and evolved seawater. Stable (C, O, S) and radiogenic (Pb, Re/Os) isotope data, together with noble gas isotope compositions, are consistent with various degrees of mixing between mantle and crustal sources along the fluid flow path. Collectively, these data suggest that degassing of CO 2 and SO 2 during epithermal mineralization and related fluid/rock interactions led to local redox-potential decreases and pH increases that resulted in preferential deposition of massive amounts of native Hg-rich silver instead of Ag and Hg sulphide minerals...|$|E
40|$|The Tokara-jutto is a {{small group}} of islands lying in the south of Kyushu between 30 °N and 29 °N. These islands consist of Kuchinoshima, Nakanoshima, Suwanosejima, Gadyajima, Kogadyajima, Tairajima, and Akusekijima in the {{north-east}} and Kojima, Kodakarajima and Takarajima in the south-west. The sea surrounding the Tokara-jutto is called the "Jutto Sea," where both winds and waves are rough, erode the islands and leave little or no flat lands on the shores. Full of precipitous cliffs, these islands are short of harbour installstions. Those in the north-east are islands made up of volcanoes, both old and new, which are stratified alternately out of two-pyroxene andesites, there agglomerates and tuffbreccia. The older volcanoes are eroded and either formed into table-lands or buried beneath the newer ones, which are of a beautiful "Conide" type. Those in the south-west are composed chiefly or tuff-breccia, around them are developed coral reefs, with elevated coral reefs here and there. Takarajima, 11. 9 km in circumference, and 5. 5 km^ 2 in area, is a triangular island, in the heart of which stands Mt. Hirugo, 289 m above the sea-level, and its ridge extends both north-westerly and south-easterly. At the north-western end of the ridge rises Mt. Megami-yama(170 m), an inverted V-shaped mountain. The island, skirted with low-lying coral reefs, is a slightly uneven table-land, with serveral terraces. In three out of these terraces can be found elevated coral reefs, whiich are changed into coral lime-stones. At the north-eastern end, there is a sand-dune consisting of coral fragments. The tuff-breccia of Tkarajima, containing pumice, have suffered silicification, chrolitization and carbonization, and andesites <b>propylitization.</b> Coral lime-stones can be correlated to Ryoukyu-lime-stones. The history of Takarajima can be inferred as follows;- Before the late pliocene epoch but not very far back, tuff breccia piled up on the sea-bottom consequent upon volcanic activities, got elevated in the late pliocene and early pleistocene epochs and formed the upper and middle terraces, to which coral lime-stones were attached. In the middle pleistocene epoch, the island became elevated again and was connected with Kodakarajima and Kojima. Later Takarajima was submerged by the sea, but when it receded, such terraces with no coral reefs as Sagigasaki and Arakizaki were formed. In the late pleistocene and early holocene epochs, coral reefs (the existing lowest-lying terrace) encircled the island, and were still expanded afterwards. There are on the island hypo-hydrothermal quartz calcendony veins with chalcopyrite, pyrite, zincblend, ad galena. Serveral old copper mines can still be found, but both quantity ahd quality of the obtainable ores are so poor that there is no hope of their being exploited...|$|E
40|$|Tertiary {{meteoric}} hydrothermal {{systems have}} altered the rocks exposed over more than 5 % of the land surface of the northwestern United States and southern British Columbia, including at least 25, 000 km^ 2 in Idaho. The systems typically involved convective circulation of fluid derived from ordinary meteoric groundwaters around crystallizing, calc-alkaline, epizonal plutons emplaced into coeval volcanic cover rocks. These individual systems had widely ranging “lifetimes” of 10 ^ 3 to 10 ^ 6 years and operated locally throughout the Cenozoic, although the most profound development of such activity occurred during Eocene time. Individual systems varied in size from a few tens of square kilometers (Yankee Fork, Idaho) or less to several thousand square kilometers (Sawtooth and Castro ring zones, Idaho) Typically, regional <b>propylitization</b> aacompanied the fluid circulation, although the higher-temperature alteration assemblages were developed locally, as were intense alteration effects (e. g., silicification, sericitization, etc.) near some veins and in mining districts. A significant amount, probably 25 – 50 %, of the mineral production and potential {{in the region is}} closely related to Tertiary meteoric hydrothermal systems. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data clearly demonstrate the close geologic association of meteoric hydrothermal systems and mineralization in (1) the Paleocene, Cu-Zn-Pb-Mn Main Stage mineralization at Butte, Montana; (2) numerous Eocene epithermal deposits principally valued for Au and Ag but also including significant deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, F, Sb, etc., as at Republic, Washington, and in several mining districts in the Idaho batholith and the Challis volcanic field; (3) several Eocene skarn deposits valued for W (Ima, Idaho) and Cu (Mackay, Idaho); (4) important lead-silver vein and replacement deposits of Tertiary (Bluebell, British Columbia) and of probable Cretaceous and early Tertiary age (Wood River, Idaho); (5) several potentially economic Mo-, Be-, and U-bearing Eocene “porphyry” plutons; and (6) Miocene epithermal deposits, most prominently the Au and Ag bearing veins at Silver City and DeLamar, Idaho, the Hg deposits at the McDermitt caldera, Nevada and Oregon, and at Weiser, Idaho, and Au deposits in the Western Cascade Range and Lake County, Oregon. A close spatial association has been demonstrated between ore deposits and rocks having anomalous δ^(18) O values and low δD values. The most important deposits are associated with relatively small (generally 5 – 300 km^ 2) zones of low δ^(18) O values, and they are particularly closely linked with zones of very steep ^(18) O/^(16) O gradients in the altered rocks. These associations hold much promise for the use of δ^(18) O and δD contour maps in future exploration efforts...|$|E
40|$|The gold-silver {{telluride}} {{deposits of}} the Emperor mine (Vatukoula, Fiji) are fairly {{typical of the}} epithermal deposits found in association with Tertiary volcanic activity in the circum-Pacific belt. The mine produces about 60, 000 troy ounces of gold per annum, together with silver and tellurium. It lies on the western margin of a Pliocene caldera (the Tavua caldera or Tavua basin) and the host rocks for the mineralization are olivine basalt flows and andesite dykes. The olivine basalt sequence is about 2000 m thick and is probably underlain by mid-Tertiary calcareous sedimentary rocks. approximately 1500 m thick. The sedimentary rocks are probably underlain by early Tertiary andesitic rocks. Five phases of volcanic (and associated intrusive) activity have been recognised in the Tavua cauldron. The K-Ar dating indicates two major periods of igneous activity, Which commenced at about 10 m. y. with widespread eruptions of olivine basalt (phase I) and continued to about 7. 5 m. y. A period of quiescence followed. The later phases of volcanic activity (phases II to V) date between 5 and 4. 3 m. y. Phase II volcanism is represented by minor eruptions of trachybasalt., phase III by augite trachyandesite, phase IV by biotite trachyandesite and phase V by monzonite and trachyte. The later phases (phases III to V) are essentially intrusive in nature and are represented by cone • sheets, dykes and small plugs, and generally occur within. {{the limits of the}} caldera. Te 130 -Xe 130 dating on a telluride sample gave an age o f 7. 2 m. y. indicating that the bulk of the mineralization was probably associated with the first period of igneous activity (10 to 7. 5 m. y.). Initial hydrothermal activity resulted in widespread <b>propylitization</b> and carbonatization of basalt, and this was followed by limited K-silicate alteration and mineralization. The lodes are essentially fracture fillings with well-developed crustification textures and vugs. Ore-mineral, sulphide and carbonate precipitation appears to have been intermittent, whereas quartz precipitation was essentially uninterrupted, and continued after the cessation of oremineral precipitation. The ore-minerals are native gold, native tellurium and gold-silver tellurides. Paragenetic studies suggest ten stages of ore and gangue mineral precipitation, viz. stage IA: widespread propylitic alteration with the development of carbonate, chlorite, actinolite, epidote etc.; stage IB: fringe K-silicate alteration which includes K-feldspar, sericite, dolomite and sulphides; stage IIA: barren vein quartz deposition; stage IIB: vein quartz, dolomite, K-feldspar, sericite, roscoelite, native tellurium and goldrich tellurides; stage IIIA: barren vein-quartz deposition; stage IIIB: vein quartz, dolomite, K-feldspar, sericite, roscoelite, native gold • and silver-rich tellurides; stage IVA: white barren vein quartz; stage •VB: amber barren vein quartz; stage IVC: white barren quartz; and stage V: calcite deposition. The bulk of mineralization (stage IIB tellurides) is restricted to 12 level and above while stage IIIB tellurides and native gold are distributed throughout. Fluid-inclusion studies on quartz indicate a temperature range from 20. 5 to 317 °C during stage IIA and from 170 to 210 °C during stage IIIA. Temperatures during stage IVA, IVB and IVC ranged from 160 to 2400 C and peaked around 180 ° C. Fluid inclusions in stage V calcite are rare and very small, and generally lack a visible vapour phase; no temperature determinations were possible. Temperatures during stage IIA show an apparent increase with depth but no such changes are apparent during other stages. A number of inclusions from {{near the top of the}} mine show evidence that the fluids were boiling and it is possible to reconstruct dramatic variations in the water table during the vein formation which apparently overlapped caldera formation. Freezing temperatures of fluid inclusions indicate about 5. 5 wt. ...|$|E
