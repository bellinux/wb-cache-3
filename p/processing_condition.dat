40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the impact of different modes of processing anxious apprehension on subsequent anxiety and performance in a stressful speech task. Participants were informed {{that they would have}} to give a speech on a difficult topic while being videotaped and evaluated on their performance. They were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions. In a specific <b>processing</b> <b>condition,</b> they were encouraged to explore in detail all the specific aspects (thoughts, emotions, sensations) they experienced while anticipating giving the speech; in a general <b>processing</b> <b>condition,</b> they had to focus on the generic aspects that they would typically experience during anxious anticipation; and in a control, no-processing condition, participants were distracted. Results revealed that at the end of the speech, participants in the specific <b>processing</b> <b>condition</b> reported less anxiety than those in the two other conditions. They were also evaluated by judges to have performed better than those in the control condition, who in turn did better than those in the general <b>processing</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|E
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} {{on the development}} of the affective and cognitive circuitries that underlie affect regulation is still limited. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined whether there is more efficient prefrontal modulation of affective circuits with development. Ten adolescents (mean age 14 ± 2 years) and 10 adults (mean age 30 ± 6 years) underwent two scanning conditions that required different levels of cognitive control over face emotion processing. A ‘directed’ emotion <b>processing</b> <b>condition</b> required judgment of facial expressions. An ‘incidental’ emotion <b>processing</b> <b>condition</b> required an age judgment. For the incidental emotion <b>processing</b> <b>condition,</b> adolescents, compared with adults, showed less activation in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and greater activation in paralimbic regions, suggesting greater emotional reactivity and immature prefrontal circuitries for affect regulation. For the directed emotion <b>processing</b> <b>condition,</b> adolescents, compared with adults, showed decreased recruitment of both the dorsal and pregenual right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), suggesting immature modulatory functions of the ACC during directed face emotion processing. These results indicate that the neural circuitries for affect regulation are still developing in adolescence and have not yet reached the adult level...|$|E

40|$|Food thermal <b>processing</b> <b>conditions</b> can be {{optimized}} {{in terms}} of final product quality retention. This optimization is possible due {{to the difference between}} the temperature dependence of quality factors and microorganisms or enzymes kinetics of thermal degradation or inactivation, respectively. All the available research in this field assume first order degradation kinetics for the quality parameters. In this work the effect of reaction type kinetics on optimal thermal <b>processing</b> <b>conditions</b> and final quality retention is analyzed. Zero, second and reversible first order kinetics are taken into consideration. Assuming that the Arrhenius model is applicable, the main conclusion is that the reaction type kinetics does not have influence on constant optimal thermal processing temperatures for maximizing the final surface product quality retention. Optimal conditions for maximizing volume average quality retention are affected by the reaction quality thermal degradation kinetics and the differences between optimal constant temperatures depend on the kinetic parameters values and <b>processing</b> <b>conditions</b> and requirements. For reversible first order degradation kinetics, final quality retentions are analyzed as a function of <b>processing</b> <b>conditions</b> and kinetic parameters and the calculation of optimal <b>processing</b> <b>conditions</b> is discussed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of stirring speed on stir casting synthesis of 15 wt% silicon carbide particle reinforced aluminium alloy (SiCp- 6061 Al) composite. The composite samples were produced at different stirring speed of 300, 500 and 700 rpm. However, the processing temperature and time are maintained at 800 °C and 180 secs <b>processing</b> <b>condition.</b> Dry reciprocating wear test is conducted using a ball on disc wear tester at a constant operating condition of 50 N load, 10 Hz frequency for 30 mins on the samples. The influence of stirring speed on the microstructure and wear morphology is examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The result reveals that the stirring speed influenced the <b>processing</b> <b>condition</b> including the microstructure and wear topography. Composite processed at 500 rpm attained homogeneity of the SiCp phase as observed from the microstructure. The worn surface experiences a relatively smooth mild wear without formation of cracks, porosity and craters. However, at 300 rpm the composite experiences micro cracks with formation of abrasive grooves due to insufficient distribution of the SiCp phase. Moreover, at 700 rpm high speed vortex formation is observed due to vigorous stirring which entraps gases and develops into large porosity, cracks and deep craters. This study establishes that stirring speed has a significant effect on the <b>processing</b> <b>condition</b> as well as the wear morphology of SiCp-Al 6061 composite developed using stir casting technique...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in mathematical modelling of heat transfer to heterogeneous foods, i. e. foods comprising a liquid and solids, forces food technologists to look for adequate input parameters for these models. Here, possibilities of the combined use of a mathematical model and a Time-Temperature-Integrator (TTI), suggested to determine the fluid-to-particle convective heat transfer coefficient (h(fp)) in conditions which prohibit the use of conventional measurement techniques, is considered theoretically. The relative importance of the kinetic characteristics of the TTI, the carrier material, the location in/on this carrier, the immersion temperature and immersion time are systematically studied for idealized modelled processing conditions. The feasibility of existing TTIs and experimental results previously obtained with this methodology are critically evaluated. This theoretical study indicates that this technique should be used with extreme caution and that the response of each TTI towards different boundary conditions in a specific <b>processing</b> <b>condition</b> should be identified prior to experimentation. The need for such an a priori sensitivity study, specific for each <b>processing</b> <b>condition,</b> TTI and carrier material makes it a cumbersome methodology. status: publishe...|$|E
