It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair.

Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related quality of life compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower. In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone. Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility. A 2017 Cochrane review found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.|$|E

50|$|The aim of CEA is {{to prevent}} the adverse {{sequelae}} of carotid artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerotic disease, i.e. ischemic stroke. As with any prophylactic operation, careful evaluation of the relative benefits and risks of the procedure is required on an individual patient basis. <b>Peri-operative</b> CEA risks for combined 30 day mortality and stroke risk should be < 3% for asymptomatic patients and ≤ 6% for symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients typically have either transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, defined as a focal neurologic defect affecting {{one side of the}} body, speech, or vision. Asymptomatic patients have narrowing of their carotid arteries, but have not experienced a TIA or stroke.|$|E
50|$|Paired {{with the}} antibiotic-coated implant, the “No Touch” Technique {{decreases}} infection to {{a rate of}} 0.46%, opposing the traditional method which has an infection rate of 5%.

J. Francois Eid developed his no-touch technique in 2006 on the hypothesis that eliminating any contact between the prosthesis and the skin, either directly or indirectly via surgical instruments or gloves, should reduce the incidence of contamination of the device with skin flora responsible for infection.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{measurement}} of cardiac output {{has been available}} since the 1970s. However, this blood flow measurement is highly invasive, utilizing a flow-directed, thermodilution catheter (also known as the Swan-Ganz catheter), which represents significant risks to the patient. In addition, this technique is costly (several hundred dollars per procedure) and requires a skilled physician and a sterile environment for catheter insertion. As a result, {{it has been used}} only in very narrow strata (less than 2%) of critically ill and high-risk patients in whom the knowledge of blood flow and oxygen transport outweighed the risks of the method. In the United States, it is estimated that at least two million pulmonary artery catheter monitoring procedures are performed annually, most often in <b>peri-operative</b> cardiac and vascular surgical patients, decompensated heart failure, multi-organ failure, and trauma.|$|E
50|$|The {{radial artery}} lies superficially {{in front of}} the distal end of the radius, between the tendons of the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis; it is here that {{clinician}} takes the radial pulse.

In March 1956, he performed the first successful pediatric cardiac operation at the SLGH, a total repair of tetralogy of Fallot in a four-year-old girl. He was at the forefront of surgeons focusing attention on coronary artery disease, and contributed to the advance of valvular surgery as well. In 1960, he performed one of the first-ever repairs of tricuspid valve regurgitation. His patient was a Latter-day Saint stake patriarch. In an indication of his surgical skill, a 1968 case series of his aortic valve replacements demonstrated an exceptionally low <b>peri-operative</b> mortality. Later, he performed the same operation on future LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball, replacing his damaged aortic valve. In 1985, Nelson along with his colleague, Conrad B.

50|$|For {{asymptomatic}} patients (those without TIA or strokes) the European asymptomatic carotid surgery trial (ACST) {{found that}} asymptomatic patients may {{also benefit from}} the procedure, but only the group with a high grade stenosis. The key in estimating the potential benefit for revascularization in asymptomatic patients is understanding {{the natural history of}} the disease, including the annual risk of stroke. Most agree that the annual risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease is between 1% and 2%, although some patients are considered to be at higher risk such as those with ulcerated plaques. In randomized trials of CEA compared to medication therapy, {{it has been shown that}} stroke is reduced by surgery, but the benefit does not appear for several years after the surgery is performed. This is because there are <b>peri-operative</b> complications (stroke and death) in the surgical patients. The longer a patient lives after surgery magnifies the surgical benefit.|$|E

50|$|Anterior ischemic optic {{neuropathy}} (AION) includes diseases {{that affect the}} optic nerve head and cause swelling of the optic disc. These diseases often cause sudden rapid visual loss in one eye. Inflammatory diseases of the blood vessels, like giant cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and rheumatoid arthritis can cause arteritic AIONs (AAION). The vast majority of AIONs are nonarteritic AIONs (NAION). The most common acute {{optic neuropathy}} in patients over 50 years of age, NAION has an annual incidence of 2.3-10.2/100,000. NAION presents as a painless loss of vision, often when awakening, that occurs over hours to days. Most patients lose {{the lower half of}} their visual field (an inferior altitudinal loss), though superior altitudinal loss is also common. The pathophysiology of NAION is unknown, but it is related to poor circulation in the optic nerve head. NAION is often associated with diabetes mellitus, elevated intraocular pressure (acute glaucoma, eye surgery), high cholesterol, hypercoagulable states, a drop in blood pressure (bleeding, cardiac arrest, <b>peri-operative</b> esp. cardiac and spine procedures), and sleep apnea. Rarely, amiodarone, interferon-alpha, and erectile dysfunction drugs have been associated with this disease.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lymphaticovenular {{anastomosis}} (LVA) is a supermicrosurgical {{procedure that}} involves the anastomosis of a functional lymphatic channel to a venule. Although <b>peri-operative</b> care might be an important contributor {{to the success of}} this technique, evidence about optimal <b>peri-operative</b> care seems limited. This review aims to summarize the <b>peri-operative</b> methods used by authors reporting on LVA. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. <b>Peri-operative</b> care used by authors was summarized and listed in a pre-defined form. Studies were also graded on quality of evidence by the GRADE system and a lymphedema surgery-specific system. RESULTS: In total, 22 studies were identified describing <b>peri-operative</b> measures. Although most authors were sparse in their description of <b>peri-operative</b> management, most recommended initiation of conventional compression therapy at 1 - 4 weeks after surgery. Prophylactic antibiotics, elevation of the affected limb, bandaging, low-molecular-weight heparin, prostaglandin E 1, and manual pressure therapy were also described. The quality of evidence of the included studies was low on average. CONCLUSION: Although supermicrosurgical LVAs are gaining in popularity, there are no high-quality prospective trials evaluating these new techniques and the description of <b>peri-operative</b> management is scarce. Of the available studies, a <b>peri-operative</b> management consisting of prophylactic antibiotics, elevation of the affected limb during night and hospital stay, and compression therapy 4 weeks post-surgery for 6 months seems to be preferred. Future studies should describe a detailed <b>peri-operative</b> protocol to allow for a better comparison between study results and to determine optimal <b>peri-operative</b> recommendations...|$|E
