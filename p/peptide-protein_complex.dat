50|$|The N-terminal α-helix of RNase A (residues 3-13) is {{connected}} to the rest of RNase A by a flexible linker (residues 16-23). As shown by F. M. Richards, this linker may be cleaved by subtilisin between residues 20 and 21 without causing the N-terminal helix to dissociate from the rest of RNase A. The <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complex</b> is called RNase S, the peptide (residues 1-20) is called the S-peptide and the remainder (residues 21-124) is called the S-protein. The dissociation constant of the S-peptide for the S-protein is roughly 30 pM; this tight binding can be exploited for protein purification by attaching the S-peptide to the protein of interest and passing a mixture over an affinity column with bound S-protein. smaller C-peptide The RNase S model system has also been used for studying protein folding by coupling folding and association. The S-peptide was the first peptide from a native protein shown to have (flickering) secondary structure in isolation (by Klee and Brown in 1967).|$|E
40|$|By using {{interactive}} computer graphics, {{two models}} for calmodulin {{have been constructed}} based on the structures of two functionally and structurally related proteins, intestinal calcium-binding protein and carp parvalbumin. The two models have been compared and contrasted to the parent proteins with respect to proportion of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, solvent-accessible surface area, and side-chain packing. Electrostatic potential surfaces generated for the models suggest a probable binding site for basic amphiphilic alpha-helical peptides located between the last E and F helices in the second domain of calmodulin. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic complementarity can contribute to stabilization of a <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complex</b> in this region...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPeptide-protein {{interactions}} are very prevalent, mediating key {{processes such as}} signal transduction and protein trafficking. How can peptides overcome the entropic cost involved in switching from an unstructured, flexible peptide to a rigid, well-defined bound structure? A structure-based analysis of peptide-protein interactions unravels that most peptides do not induce conformational changes on their partner upon binding, thus minimizing the entropic cost of binding. Furthermore, peptides display interfaces that are better packed than protein-protein interfaces and contain significantly more hydrogen bonds, mainly those involving the peptide backbone. Additionally, “hot spot” residues contribute most of the binding energy. Finally, peptides tend to bind in the largest pockets available on the protein surface. Our study is based on peptiDB, a new and comprehensive data set of 103 high-resolution <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complex</b> structures. In addition to improved understanding of peptide-protein interactions, our findings have direct implications for the structural modeling, design, and manipulation of these interactions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe ATTRACT {{coarse-grained}} docking {{approach in}} combination with various types of atomistic, flexible refinement methods {{has been applied to}} predict protein-protein and <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complexes</b> in CAPRI rounds 28 - 36. For a large fraction of CAPRI targets (12 out of 18), at least one model of acceptable or better quality was generated, corresponding to a success rate of 67 %. In particular, for several <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complexes</b> excellent predictions were achieved. In several cases, a combination of template-based modeling and extensive molecular dynamics-based refinement yielded medium and even high quality solutions. In one particularly challenging case, the structure of an ubiquitylation enzyme bound to the nucleosome was correctly predicted as a set of acceptable quality solutions. Based on the experience with the CAPRI targets, new interface refinement approaches and methods for ab-initio peptide-protein docking have been developed. Failures and possible improvements of the docking method with respect to scoring and protein flexibility will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Peptide–protein {{interactions}} {{are among the}} most prevalent and important interactions in the cell, but a large fraction of those interactions lack detailed structural characterization. The Rosetta FlexPepDock web server ([URL] provides an interface to a high-resolution peptide docking (refinement) protocol for the modeling of <b>peptide–protein</b> <b>complexes,</b> implemented within the Rosetta framework. Given a protein receptor structure and an approximate, possibly inaccurate model of the peptide within the receptor binding site, the FlexPepDock server refines the peptide to high resolution, allowing full flexibility to the peptide backbone and to all side chains. This protocol was extensively tested and benchmarked on a wide array of non-redundant <b>peptide–protein</b> <b>complexes,</b> and was proven effective when applied to peptide starting conformations within 5. 5 [*]Å backbone root mean square deviation from the native conformation. FlexPepDock has been applied to several systems that are mediated and regulated by peptide–protein interactions. This easy to use and general web server interface allows non-expert users to accurately model their specific peptide–protein interaction of interest...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPeptide-protein {{interactions}} are ubiquitous in the cell and form {{an important part}} of the interactome.  Computational docking methods can complement experimental characterization of these complexes, but current protocols are not applicable on the proteome scale. Here, we present a new fully blind flexible peptide-protein docking protocol, pepATTRACT, which combines a rapid coarse-grained global peptide docking search of the entire protein surface with a two-stage atomistic flexible refinement. Global unbound-unbound docking yielded near-native models for 70 % of the docking cases when testing the protocol on the largest benchmark of <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complexes</b> available to date. This performance is similar to that of state-of-the-art local docking protocols that rely on information about the binding site. Upon restricting the search to the peptide binding region, the resulting pepATTRACT-local approach outperformed existing methods.

40|$|Overexpression of the {{cellular}} FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) {{has been reported}} in a number of tumor types. As an inactive procaspase- 8 homologue, cFLIP is recruited to the intracellular assembly known as the Death Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) where it inhibits apoptosis, leading to cancer cell proliferation. Here we characterize the molecular details of the interaction between cFLIPL and calmodulin, a ubiquitous calcium sensing protein. By expressing the individual domains of cFLIPL, we demonstrate that the interaction with calmodulin is mediated by the N-terminal death effector domain (DED 1) of cFLIPL. Additionally, we mapped the interaction to a specific region of the C-terminus of DED 1, referred to as DED 1 R 4. By designing DED 1 /DED 2 chimeric constructs in which the homologous R 4 regions of the two domains were swapped, calmodulin binding properties were transferred to DED 2 and removed from DED 1. Furthermore, we show that the isolated DED 1 R 4 peptide binds to calmodulin and solve the structure of the <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complex</b> using NMR and computational refinement. Finally, we demonstrate an interaction between cFLIPL and calmodulin in cancer cell lysates. In summary, our data implicate calmodulin as a potential player in DISC-mediated apoptosis and provide evidence for a specific interaction with the DED 1 of cFLIPL...|$|E
40|$|Amphibians secrete potent host defence {{compounds}} from dorsal glands {{onto the}} skin when stressed, sick or {{under attack by}} predators and microbials. Many of these defence compounds, such as biologically active peptides, provide potential targets for new biotechnological and therapeutic investigation. The research presented in this study focuses on the isolation and investigation of peptides from Australian frogs of the genera Litoria and Crinia and endeavours to determine the biological activity and important structural and mechanistic features of these biological compounds. Isolation and identification of the skin peptide profile of the Eastern Dwarf Tree Frog Litoria fallax has revealed a number of novel peptides named fallaxidins. This frog species is quite unique in {{that it does not}} secrete a peptide that displays potent broad spectrum antimicrobial activity nor a peptide that inhibits nitric oxide formation through the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Instead it secretes several narrow spectrum antimicrobial peptides, including fallaxidin 3. 1. In addition, there are numerous small peptides displaying unique primary structures with unknown biological function. Interestingly, L. fallax produces a skin peptide profile that is quite distinct from the skin peptide profiles of other related Litoria species. The majority of anurans from the Litoria genus contain at least one peptide in their skin secretion that inhibits the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase. These peptides exert this action by preventing the association of the regulatory cofactor Ca²⁺ calmodulin to the enzyme binding site. The non-covalent binding of the potent neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor dahlein 5. 6 (L. dahlii) to calmodulin in the presence of Ca²⁺ is confirmed by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. A <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complex</b> was observed in the gas-phase with a 1 : 1 : 4 calmodulin/dahlein 5. 6 /Ca²⁺ stoichiometry. In addition, the structure and binding interactions have been investigated by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These experiments illustrated that upon binding dahlein 5. 6, Ca²⁺ calmodulin undergoes a substantial conformational transition towards a globular complex with the helical dahlein 5. 6 engulfed in a hydrophobic channel. Typically, the granular secretion of amphibians contains numerous peptides that exert activities in the central nervous system, termed neuropeptides. The biological activities, in particular smooth muscle action, proliferation of lymphocytes and opioid action are investigated to provide insight into the role of these peptides in the host defence. The structure activity relationships of disulfide peptides, caerulein peptides, tryptophyllins, rothein 1 and its related synthetically modified peptides has identified several important structural features essential for their corresponding biological function. Peptides from the granular secretion of anurans are synthesized within and released from larger precursors molecules. The genes that encode for the skin peptides of Crinia riparia and several Litoria species were isolated and identified. The cDNA sequence of the precursors provides a mechanism by which the evolution of amphibian species can be traced and information about the relationships existing among closely or distantly related species be obtained. All prepropeptides isolated from the Litoria species illustrated sequence homology to those isolated from numerous ranid and hylid frogs and demonstrate that the skin prepropeptides originated from a common ancestral gene. The precursors of peptides from C. riparia are significantly diverse and suggest that these prepropeptides either originated from the same common ancestral gene but have undergone substantial divergent evolution relative to the ranid and hylid frogs or that they have originated from distinct ancestral genes.

40|$|We have earlier {{reported}} the MOLSDOCK technique to perform rigid receptor/flexible ligand docking. The method uses the MOLS method, developed in our laboratory. In this paper we report iMOLSDOCK, the 'flexible receptor' extension we have {{carried out to}} the algorithm MOLSDOCK. iMOLSDOCK uses mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) to sample the conformation and the docking pose of the ligand and also the flexible residues of the receptor protein.

40|$|Bicyclic {{peptides}} generated through {{directed evolution}} by using phage display offer an attractive ligand format {{for the development}} of therapeutics. Being nearly 100 -fold smaller than antibodies, they promise advantages such as access to chemical synthesis, efficient diffusion into tissues, and needle-free application. However, unlike antibodies, {{they do not have a}} folded structure in solution and thus bind less well. We developed bicyclic peptides with hydrophilic chemical structures at their center to promote noncovalent intramolecular interactions, thereby stabilizing the peptide conformation. The sequences of the peptides isolated by phage display from large combinatorial libraries were strongly influenced by the type of small molecule used in the screen, thus suggesting that the peptides fold around the small molecules. X-ray structure analysis revealed that the small molecules indeed formed hydrogen bonds with the peptides. These noncovalent interactions stabilize the <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complexes</b> and contribute to the high binding affinity...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} {{implementation of}} a peptide drug-design strategy has been developed. The system is named EmPLiCS (Empirical Peptide Ldgand Construction System) accord-ing to the strategy of the system, which searches for peptdde-ligand structures by refer-ring to empirical rules that are derived from known protein 3 D structures. The system was tested on several known <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complexes.</b> The results demonstrated the ability of this system to detect key residues of peptides that are crucial for interaction with their specific proteins. The system also showed the ability to detect the main chain trace of these peptides. Some of the main chain atoms were detected even though the complete primary structures were not reproduced, suggesting that main chain struc-ture is important in peptide-protein recognition. The {{results of the present}} study dem-onstrated that the empirical rules-based system can generate significant information for use in the design of natural peptide drugs.

40|$|The {{conformational}} {{and dynamic}} properties of peptides play critical roles in their biological functions. Various {{methods have been}} applied for studying peptide conformations and dynamics. On the basis of structure-function studies and NMR work on the conformation of CCK, we designed a series of conformationally constrained peptides {{to test the hypothesis}} of a C-terminal folded structure required for interaction with the CCK-B receptor. Various cyclic peptides were synthesized to explore the possible spatial arrangements of key amino acid side chain groups. Based on the NMR conformational studies and receptor binding assay data, it was suggested that a C-terminal folded conformation of CCK 4 is a necessary but not a sufficient structural feature for strong CCK-B receptor binding. In a series of tyrosine analogues, slow rotations around Cβ-Cγ were studied by dynamic NMR. The free energies of activation (ΔG(^≠)) at their coalescence temperatures were estimated to be in the range of 14 - 20 Kcal/mol. This energy barrier is comparable to the one experienced by tyrosine aromatic rings in the interior of proteins, bioactive peptides or in <b>peptide-protein</b> <b>complexes.</b> This study demonstrates the ability of conformational constraints on restricting molecular motions. These tyrosine analogues with constrained side chains can be useful tools in studying the structure-function relationships of peptides and proteins. In peptides and proteins, amino acid residues are covalently linked together by either amide bonds or disulfide bonds. The molecules Me₂S₂, N-methylacetamide and other simple amides were used as models for disulfide or peptide bond linkages in our ab initio MO studies. An angular dependence of the ¹³C and ³³S NMR chemical shifts on the C-S-S-C dihedral angle was predicted based on our calculations. The well-known syn/anti dependence of ¹³C chemical shift around the peptide bond was found to have the same origin as the angular dependence of the γ-substituent effect. A systematic geometry optimization and chemical shift calculation on a model peptide, N-acetyl-N'-methyl glycine amide, enabled us to construct the first non-empirical energy surface and ¹³C NMR chemical shift surface for this molecule. The experimentally observed correlation between ¹³C chemical shifts of Cα in amino acid residues and protein secondary structures is attributed to the effect controlled by φ and ψ dihedral angles...|$|R
