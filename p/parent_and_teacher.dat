2500|$|There {{are both}} <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> versions, {{completed}} by each, that are {{submitted to the}} professional working with the youth at his/her appointment. It is important to acquire information from both of these sources because there are different demands placed on youth in different environments and the different settings bring out different aspects of symptoms for different disorders. [...] Furthermore, one care provider may be better at accurately evaluating symptoms in the youth over others. [...] Lastly, knowing the different settings in which the symptoms manifest in the youth is essential in adapting the most successful treatment plan. [...] The teacher version differs from the parent version in many ways. [...] The main difference is the addition of items that address information regarding behavior in educational settings as well as academic performance to the teacher version. [...] Furthermore, the teacher version excludes disorders that develop primarily in the home setting (i.e., separation anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder), as well as items in the parent checklist that the teacher {{would be unable to}} answer (i.e., regarding sleep, eating habits, activity at night). [...] In order to compare the versions most accurately, the teacher version was not renumbered, but instead excludes the items that don't pertain to it. [...] The wording of both version's was made user friendly by replacing psychiatric jargon of the DSM with more easily understood phrases by the care providers.|$|E
60|$|It is very {{desirable}} {{that every}} <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> {{should have a}} distinct and clear conception of {{the true nature of}} punishment, and of the precise manner in which it is designed to act in repressing offenses.

60|$|We {{should all}} {{remember}} that our pupils are, {{but a very}} short time, under our direct control.

Subjecting them then to mere external restraint, is a very inadequate remedy for the moral evil, to which they are exposed.

40|$|Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among {{adolescents}} {{is a significant}} problem, yet the majority do not seek professional help. <b>Parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> are arguably most in contact with young people, and are critical in identifying and referring adolescent self-injurers. This study explored what adolescents believe <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> {{can do to help}} young people who self-injure. A school-based sample of 2637 students (aged 12 - 18 years) completed a self-report questionnaire. Adolescents believe having non-judgemental <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> to talk to, improved parent-child relationships, referral to professionals, reduced school pressures, and student education, are pivotal to helping young self-injurers. However, many adolescents, particularly those exposed to NSSI, were unsure about whether <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> could do anything to help. These finding have important implications for educational programs that prepare <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> to address adolescent NSSI...|$|R

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{relationship}} between <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> who communicate via email and the effects of e-mail communication on the formation and development of the parentteacher relationship. By interviewing <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> on the subject of e-mail communication, an understanding of how relationships are formed and maintained was achieved. <b>Parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> described their experiences using e-mail to communicate with one another, as well as what they perceived were the biggest advantages and disadvantages. The interviews were analyzed using Social Information Processing Theory (SIPT) which describes three different communicative phases (Impersonal, Interpersonal, Hyperpersonal) that influence how relationships are formed when communicating via Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC). After applying the three phases of CMC to the acquired interview data, it became apparent that <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> often communicated from different phases. It appears that e-mail communication has a complicating effect on the parent-teacher relationship. The results from this study suggest that <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> struggle to manage impressions and form relationships when communicating via e-mail. It is possible that when <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> communicate from different phases of CMC, frustration and misunderstanding occurs, resulting in complications to the formation and development of relationships. It is therefore recommended that <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> discuss, create, <b>and</b> agree upon a protocol that will serve as a standard for the type of communication they are willing to engage in. By working together to determine an appropriate e-mail etiquette, <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> might {{have a better chance of}} achieving mutual understanding in their communication, thereby facilitating the formation and development of the parent-teacher relationship...|$|R
6000|$|For example, an {{important}} factor in the early stage of speech-teaching is the nursery rhyme. A little child, {{towards the end of the}} first year, having accumulated a really very comprehensive selection of sounds and noises by that time, begins to imitate first the associated motions, and then the sounds of various nursery rhymes--"Pat-a-cake," [...] for example. In the book I imagine, there would be, among many other things, a series of little versicles, old and new, in which, to the accompaniment of simple gestures, all the elementary sounds of the language could be easily and agreeably made familiar to the child's ears. [Footnote: Messrs. Heath of Boston, U.S.A., have sent me a book of Nursery Rhymes, arranged by Mr. Charles Welsh, which is certainly the best thing I have seen in this way. It is worthy of note that the neglect of pedagogic study in Great Britain is forcing the intelligent British <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>teacher</b> to rely more and more upon American publishers for children's books.

40|$|Empirical support {{confirms}} interventions {{with the}} goal of building partnerships between families and schools are effective methods for addressing childhood social-behavioral concerns and academic delays (for reviews see Jeynes, 2012). Conjoint Behavioral Consultation (CBC; Sheridan 2 ̆ 6 Kratochwill, 2008) is a problem-solving based intervention that seeks to remediate childhood behavior problems by enhancing working relationships between <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers.</b> CBC consistently yields positive effects for children, families, <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> (Sheridan, Eagle, Cowan, 2 ̆ 6 Mickelson, 200; Sheridan et al., 2012; Sheridan et al., in submission; Sheridan, Ryoo, Garbacz, Kunz, 2 ̆ 6 Chumney, 2013) and these outcomes are achieved through supportive parent-teacher relationships (Sheridan et al., 2012; Sheridan et al., in submission). Although communication among <b>parents,</b> <b>teachers,</b> <b>and</b> consultants is considered an important process feature of CBC, its influence on perceptions of the parent-teacher relationship remains unexplored. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether CBC consultants’ use of communication strategies during problem-solving interactions with <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> predicted reports of their relationships, and whether consultees’ (i. e., <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers)</b> displays of shared interactional qualities during these problem-solving interactions moderated the aforementioned prediction. One hundred and ninety-three collaborative, problem-solving meetings were coded for CBC consultants’ use of partnership-oriented communication strategies and the degree to which <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> demonstrated shared interactions. ^ Multilevel analyses were conducted to explore whether consultants’ use of partnership-oriented communication strategies during problem-solving interactions with <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers</b> predicted the quality of the parent-teacher relationship, as well as the extent to which consultees’ (i. e., <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers)</b> displays of shared interactions moderated this prediction. Descriptive analyses revealed that CBC consultants, on average, used a partnership orientation during their interactions with <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers.</b> Similarly, <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>teachers,</b> on average, displayed a high degree of shared interactions when engaging in collaborative problem solving.
