40|$|Background: Leptospirosis, an {{infectious}} disease that affects humans and animals, {{is a common}} zoonosis {{with a variety of}} clinical manifestations. Taiwan is one of the countries with a high incidence of leptospirosis. It is important to recognize the clinical features and risk factors of this disease. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the characteristics of patients with leptospirosis and correlate the onset of symptoms with exposure to a typhoon. Methods: We report 6 cases of serologically confirmed leptospirosis who required hospitalization during the past 5 years. The clinical characteristics, history of exposure to contaminated water and soil, and association with the occurrence of a typhoon were reviewed. Results: All patients were found to have a history of contact with contaminated soil or water. Five of these patients (83 %) suffered from the disease just after a typhoon. Fever was the most common symptom in all cases (100 %), followed by chills (83 %) and myalgia (67 %). Acute renal failure was the most common complication in these cases (83 %), followed by jaundice (67 %), acute respiratory failure (50 %), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (33 %). Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions were seen in three cases (50 %). All cases were successfully treated with antimicrobial agents. Conclusion: Most (83 %) patients suffered from leptospirosis after a typhoon. In order to prevent leptospirosis in Taiwan, it is important to educate the people on avoiding contact with contaminated water, moist soil, vegetation, and wearing <b>protective</b> clothing and <b>footwear</b> in areas suspected t...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} standardised {{mechanical test}} methodologies that measure dynamic {{coefficient of friction}} {{in order to assess}} the risk of a pedestrian slip. Currently, two shoesurface contact test methods are specified in British Standards to assess the risk of pedestrian slips during the heel strike phase. A pendulum test device as specified in BS 7976 - 2 : 2002 is used to determine the slip resistance of surfaces. Another standard, BS EN ISO 13287 : 2007 specifies the test method to assess the slip resistance of conventionally soled safety, <b>protective</b> and occupational <b>footwear.</b> Experiments were conducted on six common household surfaces in water contaminated conditions in compliance with the aforementioned standard procedures. The roughness and stiffness of each surface was also found. The results show no statistically significant linear correlation between the dynamic coefficient of friction found via the two standardised test methods. At low levels of roughness, no statistically significant linear correlations were found between the coefficient of friction found via the two standardised test methods and roughness. For flooring with a compliant layer, the contact conditions of the pendulum test device were found to cause friction losses associated with energy dissipated as the surface deforms and recovers during sliding. Differences in sliding velocity and area of contact were found to influence the measurements given by the two test procedures. The higher velocity pendulum is a more appropriate test device to replicate slip in wet conditions as it predicts the worst case scenario. However, it is likely to give misleading results on deformable surfaces as, on such surfaces, as it is not replicating the loading conditions during a real-life heel strike...|$|R

Ulcero-mutilating complications are the most serious, prominent, and leading diagnostic features in HSAN I.

Recently, the treatment of the foot complications has reached an efficient level allowing treatment on an outpatient basis.

Bang (2010) found that the preferences of firefighters for protective gear was in the order of fire suit (3.10), general work wear (3.04), helmet (2.97), leather <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> (2.68), gloves (2.6), and rubber <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> (2.59). The results of satisfaction analysis of firefighting protection gear showed that satisfaction was highest in order of general work wear (3.21), helmet (3.17), fire suit (3.15), leather <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> (2.97), gloves (2.77), and rubber <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> (2.75). Analysis of the overall satisfaction of firefighters’ protection gear indicated that there was a need to improve <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> for firefighters. The satisfaction rate of <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> for firefighters was low because of the thick material used for protection, and the weight and discomfort from metal parts, and bad storage conditions. Huang et al. (2009) conducted physiological analysis while climbing stairs wearing rubber <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> and leather <b>protective</b> <b>footwear.</b> Physical fatigue was lower for rubber footwear compared to leather footwear, and flexibility was higher at the knees and the back of the foot. However, {{there is a lack of}} studies that analyze designs of <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> for firefighters, and develop <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> according to the designs and review of current conditions, which could aid smoother field action for firefighters. Therefore, there is a need for a study that will provide specific points of improvement for <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> for firefighters, and develop a product based on these points, for improved protection and safe field activities of firefighters. Previous related studies include an analysis of <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> products for firefighters (Kang et al. 2015), a review of the current conditions of <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> worn by firefighters (Lee and An 2016), and an analysis of <b>protective</b> <b>footwear</b> products and design proposals (Jung et al. 2016).
