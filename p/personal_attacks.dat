Damodar influences all the witnesses including Shekhar before Shankar could arrest him. He later comes to know that Raja Rao's son Bharath, the previous district collector committed suicide along with his wife, who was a friend of Prakash, because of defamation and <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> when Bharath tried to stop the power project.|$|E
5|$|GCC's {{advocacy}} activities included lobbying government officials, grassroots lobbying through {{press releases}} and advertising, participation in international climate conferences, {{criticism of the}} processes of international climate organizations, critiques of climate models, and <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of anthropogenic climate change, emphasizing the uncertainty in climatology, advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of climate change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national sovereignty, and opposition to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the {{law school}} {{established}} the Center for Dispute Resolution, an alternative dispute resolution program. In 1992, the Collins Legal Center went through an award-winning renovation and expansion that ended with a dedication ceremony and speech by former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. In her dedication speech, O'Connor advocated for civility among those in the legal profession and for avoiding <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> among lawyers. In December 2005, the school's moot courtroom was used for a real civil trial after the Marion County Courthouse was damaged the previous month.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his growing}} {{national}} fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against the other, often making <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, the Democrats nominated Albion Parris, {{a former governor}} and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While the Democrats rallied behind their candidate, Dow's vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total from the year before, with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by Irish immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Emboldened by his success, Diệm {{began to}} plot Bảo Đại's downfall. He {{scheduled}} a referendum for 23 October 1955 and pushed Bảo Đại {{out of the}} political scene, hindering the former emperor's attempts to derail the poll. In the period {{leading up to the}} vote, campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused on <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons of the head of state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote. After his brother Ngô Đình Nhu successfully rigged the poll, Diệm proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour Prime Minister, {{called a}} general election. Dunglass {{was invited to}} stand once again as Unionist {{candidate}} for Lanark. Having been disgusted at <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele's association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat {{with one of the}} smallest majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour's 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of 5.|$|E

5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid <b>personal</b> <b>attacks.</b> The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E
5|$|No {{congressional hearing}} was convened to {{investigate}} the misallocation of funds by Powell, and neither Cope nor Marsh was held responsible for any of their mistakes, but some of Ballou's charges against Marsh came {{to be associated with}} the Survey. Facing anti-Survey sentiment inflamed by western drought and concerns about takeovers of abandoned western homesteads, Powell found himself the subject of larger scrutiny before the House Appropriations Committee. Galvanized to action by Marsh's perceived extravagance with Survey funds, the Appropriations Committee demanded the Survey's budget be itemized. When his appropriation was cut off in 1892, Powell sent a terse telegram to Marsh demanding his resignation, a personal slight as well as a financial one. At the same time, many of Marsh's allies were retiring or had died, lessening his scientific credence. Just as Marsh's extravagant lifestyle was catching up with him, Cope received a position on the Texas Geological Survey. Cope, still reeling from the <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> levied at him during the Herald affair, did not take advantage of the change in fortunes to press his <b>personal</b> <b>attacks.</b> Cope's fortunes continued to look up throughout the early 1890s, as he was promoted to Leidy's position as Professor of Zoology and was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same year that Marsh stepped down as head of the Academy of Sciences. Towards the latter part of the decade, Cope's fortunes began to sour once more as Marsh regained some of his recognition, earning the Cuvier Medal, the highest paleontological award.|$|E
5|$|The Jeffersonian Republicans opposed {{banks and}} cities, and favored France. They built their own {{national}} coalition {{to oppose the}} Federalists. Both sides gained the support of local political factions; each side developed its own partisan newspapers. Noah Webster, John Fenno, and William Cobbett were energetic editors for the Federalists; Benjamin Franklin Bache and Philip Freneau were fiery Republican editors. All the newspapers were characterized by intense <b>personal</b> <b>attacks,</b> major exaggerations and invented claims. In 1801, Hamilton established a daily newspaper, the New York Evening Post and brought in William Coleman as editor. It is still publishing (as the New York Post).|$|E

5|$|Paine left England {{before he}} could be tried, {{as he had been}} elected a member of the National Convention in France, tasked with writing a new constitution. He {{departed}} England on 13 September, never to return, although he further infuriated the government remotely by republishing the Rights of Man and writing Letter Addressed to the Addressors of the Late Proclamation, in which he defended his actions and beliefs against those who had chosen to side with the government. Paine was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a famous lawyer and orator who served as Attorney General to the Prince of Wales. As the trial date approached, both Erskine and Paine were targeted by vicious <b>personal</b> <b>attacks.</b> Paine's writ was followed by hundreds of loyal addresses, many of which targeted him, the burning of an effigy in Exeter, and the banning of the sale of any of his books in Chester. Pamphlets slandering him were widely published, and both Paine and Erskine had their personal lives dug into.|$|E
5|$|To help attract tourists, Harvey often {{brought in}} musicians and hosted dances {{and other events}} to give Monte Ne a {{constant}} festive atmosphere. He used the Monte Ne Herald, run by his son Tom, to promote these events. The newspaper only lasted until 1905, probably due to financial troubles and Harvey's publication of <b>personal</b> <b>attacks.</b> There were sporting events in Monte Ne such as tennis, croquet, and fox hunting. Monte Ne also had the first golf course, which was built sometime before 1909. Harvey's difficult-to-please nature often ended up driving away more people than it attracted. Harvey had a lights-out at 10 p.m. policy, and would cut the main electricity to the town if the policy was disobeyed, prompting disgruntled guests to leave prematurely. He was also criticized for holding events on Sunday and for banning children and people who were ill from the resort.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} <b>personal</b> <b>attacks</b> {{on the press}} and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

25|$|Ad hominem abuse (also called {{personal}} {{abuse or}} <b>personal</b> <b>attacks)</b> usually involves insulting or belittling one's opponent to invalidate {{his or her}} argument, but can also involve pointing out factual but ostensible character flaws or actions which are irrelevant to the opponent's argument.|$|E
40|$|Starting from a pragmadialectical {{concept of}} reasonableness, the {{judgments}} of ordinary arguers concerning the reasonableness of discussion moves were investigated, concentrat-ing on argumentum ad hominem fallacies. Three variants of ad hominem {{were presented to}} the respondents: (a) the abusive direct <b>personal</b> <b>attack,</b> (b) the circumstantial indirect <b>personal</b> <b>attack,</b> and (c) the you too! (tu quoque) variant. These fallacies were incorpo-rated in items of three types: (a) a scientific discussion, (b) a political debate, and (c) a domestic discussion. As predicted, the respondents regarded speech acts with an ad homi-nem fallacy as lacking in reasonableness. They considered the direct <b>personal</b> <b>attack</b> least reasonable, then the indirect <b>personal</b> <b>attack,</b> then the tu quoque fallacy. In a scientific discussion, ad hominem fallacies were viewed as less reasonable than {{in the other two}} types of discussion. ORDINARY ARGUERS’ STANDARDS FOR REASONABLENESS What do ordinary arguers think of the discussion moves deemed acceptable or unacceptable by argumentation theorists? This impor-tant but complex question cannot yet be adequately answered. Rela-tively few empirical research projects have been carried out regarding the standards for reasonableness that ordinary arguers apply when evaluating argumentative discourse. 1 Bowker and Trapp (1992) have made an attempt, but their approach can only be seen as exploratory. Instead of starting from a theoretically motivated notion of reason-ableness, they arrive with the help of discriminant, cluster, and factor analytic methods at a rather diffuse concept reflecting empirical validity...|$|R

5000|$|Two {{corollary}} {{rules of}} the doctrine, the <b>personal</b> <b>attack</b> rule and the [...] "political editorial" [...] rule, remained in practice until 2000. The [...] "personal attack" [...] rule applied whenever a person (or small group) was subject to a <b>personal</b> <b>attack</b> during a broadcast. Stations had to notify such persons (or groups) {{within a week of}} the attack, send them transcripts of what was said and offer the opportunity to respond on-the-air. The [...] "political editorial" [...] rule applied when a station broadcast editorials endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, and stipulated that the unendorsed candidates be notified and allowed a reasonable opportunity to respond.|$|R
