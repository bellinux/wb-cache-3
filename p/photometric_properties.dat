Because it is the planet nearest the Sun, Mercury represents one extreme in possible cosmochemical models of planet formation. Even before the Mariner 10 mission, Mercury’s high density and <b>photometric</b> <b>properties</b> suggested a large core, presumably iron, and a lithosphere of silicate materials. Evidence for an intrinsic dipolar magnetic field (Ness and others, 1974) reinforces interpretations favoring a large core. This core, which formed partly as a result of radiogenic heating, produced additional heating, leading to global expansion and the formation of extensional fractures in the lithosphere (Solomon, 1976, 1977). These fractures may have provided egress for the eruption of the oldest plains material during the period of heavy bombardment. Also about this time other structural lineaments developed, possibly as a result of stresses induced by tidal spin-down from a more rapid rotation rate (Burns, 1976; Melosh, 1977; Melosh and Dzurisin, 1978). The major east-west lineament trend in this polar region (noted in previous section) conforms to a prediction of Melosh (1977) for the orientation of normal faults. However, no unambiguous evidence for tensional faults occurs in the Bach quadrangle.|$|E

40|$|A semi {{automatic}} road extraction method has been constructed and evaluated. Our {{purpose is to}} obtain 1 / 25, 000 level road data from PRISM image. PRISM is panchromatic, three views, and the 2. 5 m resolution sensor carried on ALOS satellite that will be launched on late 2004. A centre line-detecting algorithm is employed for feature extraction. It picks up pixels where second derivative of brightness becomes maximal. Then those pixels are linked if both probability of line and angle difference between adjacent pixels satisfy given conditions. Acquired line candidates are classified by its <b>photometric</b> <b>property.</b> We test both automatic grey scale threshold method and traditional unsupervised multi band classification method for this stage. After eliminating false line segments, a line linking method is applied. If all of angle difference, lateral offset, and net gap are less than threshold, the pair is considered as one long line. This process is applied iteratively while a connectable pair remains. The proposed method was tested by a simulated ALOS image data set created from three-line airborne sensor images and an IKONOS data set. The result shows that 80 % of road was extracted before false line elimination while 80 % of extracted line was false data. There still remains 70 % of false road segments even after the classification method. Both correctness and completeness are unexpectedly poor. As our method {{is working on a}} single image and does not use full feature of PRISM yet, a method using three-dimensional property is needed. 1...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{a sample}} of galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10 ^ 10 M_ and with redshifts in the range 0. 025 <z< 0. 05 for which HI mass {{measurements}} {{are available from the}} GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS) or from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA). At a given value of M_*, our sample consists primarily of galaxies that are more HI-rich than average. We constructed a series of three control samples for comparison with these HI-rich galaxies. As expected, HI-rich galaxies differ strongly from galaxies of same stellar mass that are selected without regard to HI content. The majority of these differences are attributable to the fact that galaxies with more gas are bluer and more actively star-forming. In order to identify those galaxy properties that are causally connected with HI content, we compare results derived for the HI sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellar mass, size and NUV-r colour. The only <b>photometric</b> <b>property</b> that is clearly attributable to increasing HI content, is the colour gradient of the galaxy. Galaxies with larger HI fractions have bluer, more actively star-forming outer disks compared to the inner part of the galaxy. HI-rich galaxies also have larger g-band radii compared to i-band radii. Our results are consistent with the 'inside-out' picture of disk galaxy formation, which has commonly served as a basis for semi-analytic models of the formation of disks in the context of Cold Dark Matter cosmologies. The lack of any intrinsic connection between HI fraction and galaxy asymmetry suggests that gas is accreted smoothly onto the outer disk...|$|R

40|$|About 20 % of low-redshift {{galaxies are}} late-type spirals {{with a small}} or no bulge component. Although they are the {{simplest}} disk galaxies in terms of structure and dynamics, {{the role of the}} different physical processes driving their formation and evolution is not yet fully understood. We investigated whether small bulges of late-type spirals follow the same scaling relations traced by ellipticals and large bulges and if they are disk-like or classical bulges. We derived the <b>photometric</b> and kinematic <b>properties</b> of 9 nearby late-type spirals. To this aim, we analyzed the surface brightness distribution from the i-band images of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and obtained the structural parameters of the galaxies from a two-dimensional photometric decomposition. We measured the line-of-sight stellar velocity distribution within the bulge effective radius from the long-slit spectra taken with high spectral resolution at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We used the <b>photometric</b> and kinematic <b>properties</b> of the sample bulges to study their location in the Fundamental Plane, Kormendy, and Faber-Jackson relations defined for ellipticals and large bulges. We found that our sample bulges satisfy some of the photometric and kinematic prescriptions for being considered disk-like bulges such as small sizes and masses with nearly exponential light profiles, small bulge-to-total luminosity ratios, low stellar velocity dispersions, and ongoing star formation. However, each of them follows the same scaling relations of ellipticals, massive bulges, and compact early-type galaxies so they cannot be classified as disk-like systems. We find a single population of galaxy spheroids that follow the same scaling relations, where the mass seems to lead to a smooth transition in the <b>photometric</b> and kinematic <b>properties</b> from less massive bulges to more massive bulges and ellipticals.

A novel photometric calibration technique allows calibration of scenes containing multiple piecewise constant chromaticities. This method estimates per-pixel <b>photometric</b> <b>properties,</b> then uses a RANSAC-based approach {{to estimate the}} dominant chromaticities in the scene. A likelihood term is developed linking surface normal, image intensity and <b>photometric</b> <b>properties,</b> which allows estimating the number of chromaticities present in a scene to be framed as a model estimation problem.
