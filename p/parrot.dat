5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark <b>parrot</b> seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene <b>parrot</b> in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene <b>parrot.</b> This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified <b>parrot</b> may have been an African grey <b>parrot</b> (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise <b>parrot</b> in the Netherlands.

5|$|In 1973, English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak {{described}} {{some small}} <b>parrot</b> bones {{that he had}} discovered among a collection of broad-billed <b>parrot</b> (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) subfossils in the Zoology Museum of Cambridge University. These remains had been collected by Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, who had found them in a cave on Le Pouce mountain, on the Mascarene island of Mauritius. They {{were placed in the}} zoology museum by 1908. Apart from their size and robustness, Holyoak did not find the bones to be distinct from those of the Mascarene <b>parrot</b> genera Lophopsittacus, Mascarinus (the Mascarene <b>parrot),</b> Necropsittacus (the Rodrigues <b>parrot),</b> and Psittacula (which had two or three other species inhabiting the Mascarene islands). Because of their similarities, Holyoak considered all these genera to be closely related.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{based on}} remains {{collected}} by Louis Etienne Thirioux {{in the early}} 20th century, the English ornithologist Daniel T.

In 2007, {{on the basis of}} a comparison of subfossils, correlated with 17th and 18th century descriptions of small grey parrots, Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus Psittacula and called it Thirioux's grey <b>parrot.</b> In 1967, James Greenway had speculated that reports of grey Mauritian parrots referred to the broad-billed <b>parrot.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Rodrigues <b>parrot</b> (Necropsittacus rodricanus) is an {{extinct species}} of <b>parrot</b> that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar.

Then, we artificially provoked ten different contexts and recorded vocalizations of four captive grey <b>parrots</b> in these situations. <b>Parrots</b> predominantly emitted call categories in some contexts: distress, protestation, alarm, asking (i. e. emitted when a bird wanted something from an experimenter and contact calls. These results suggest that some calls are learned {{and can be used}} in specific contexts. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} <b>parrot</b> specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene <b>parrot,</b> in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two.

The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus <b>parrot</b> (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E

In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene <b>parrot</b> in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria.
