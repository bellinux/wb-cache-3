5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} <b>protocols</b> that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) <b>protocols.</b> These <b>protocols</b> ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.

5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of <b>protocols</b> that govern how the {{computers}} and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual <b>protocols</b> in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other <b>protocols.</b> This allows lower-level <b>protocols</b> to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level <b>protocols</b> operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. <b>Protocols</b> are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Protocols</b> of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The <b>Protocols</b> incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The <b>Protocols</b> reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The <b>Protocols</b> is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
