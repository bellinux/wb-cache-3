Niche separation of species, local extinction and competitive exclusion are {{only some of the}} possible effects. In addition to these, interspecific competition can be the source of a cascade of effects that build on each other. An example of such an effect is the introduction of an invasive species to the United States, <b>purple-loosestrife.</b> This plant when introduced to wetland communities often outcompetes much of the native flora and decreases species richness, food and shelter to many other species at higher trophic levels. In this way, one species can influence the populations of many other species as well as through a myriad of other interactions. Because of the complicated web of interactions that make up every ecosystem and habitat, the results of interspecific competition are complex and site-specific.|$|E

50|$|Lythrum alatum, {{commonly}} known as winged loosestrife, winged lythrum or (in Britain and Ireland) angled <b>purple-loosestrife,</b> is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Lythraceae. It is endemic to wetland areas {{in central and eastern}} United States and Ontario.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} as landscaping for an office complex, and its main feature is a lake with a fountain. Plants fringing the shore include water mint, gypsywort and <b>purple-loosestrife.</b> Waterfowl nest on a small island and there are dragonflies in summer.|$|E
50|$|On {{the shores}} are plants like alders, hybrid crack willows, osiers, elms, ashes, grey willow, birch, aspens, great yellow-cress, gypsywort, skullcap, whorled mint (a hybrid species between corn mint and water mint), trifid bur-marigold, slender tufted-sedge, reed sweet-grass, annual meadow-grass, {{silverweed}} and <b>purple-loosestrife.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{is a good}} {{range of}} flowers established. These include sanicle, common dog-violet, ramsons and ferns such as hart's tongue. The more open areas support plants such as common valerian, great willowherb, {{meadowsweet}} and Pendulous sedge. The river edges and wetter places support marsh-marigold, water mint, <b>purple-loosestrife</b> and yellow iris. water-crowfoot {{is seen in the}} river.|$|E
5000|$|Fuller {{information}} for Coombe Hill Canal (...) {{is provided in}} the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. It is a 20.16 ha site overall (standing water, canals, fen, marsh and swamp lowland). The clearance work has been beneficial to aquatic and bankside plants. Flourishing uncommon species include fine-leaved water-dropwort, common meadow-rue and cyperus sedge. Also recorded are <b>purple-loosestrife,</b> yellow iris and skullcap. The management of nettles preserves a colony of the parasitic greater dodder.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic plants {{includes}} reed, club-rush, wood club-rush, broadleaf cattail, flowering rush, water hemlock, yellow iris, yellow loosestrife, bittersweet, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, red pondweed, whorled water-milfoil, amphibious bistort, water-soldier, frogbit, duckweed, greater bladderwort, {{and greater}} duckweed. Along {{the shores of}} the lake are hybrid crack willow, alder, bay willow, grey willow, aspen, ash, <b>purple-loosestrife,</b> marsh fern, wild angelica, marsh woundwort, gypsywort, creeping spearwort, marsh cinquefoil, marsh-marigold, bittersweet, skullcap, corn mint, meadowsweet, trifid bur-marigold, and purple small-reed.|$|E
50|$|The {{trees along}} the canal include pedunculate oak, ash, crack willow and field maple. The area is colonised with common reed, reed sweet-grass and the more open areas support marsh-marigold, yellow water-lily, water dock and gipsywort. Meadowsweet and great willowherb flourish. There is also common valerian, <b>purple-loosestrife,</b> common marsh-bedstraw, yellow iris, ragged robin and marsh woundwort. Woodland flowers such as primrose, bluebell, yellow {{archangel}} and bugle thrive in a small wood near the tunnel entrance and under the towpath hedgerows. This wetland area supports a variety of fungi, liverworts and mosses.|$|E

5000|$|Declared a Local Nature Reserve in 2006 by Sandy Town Council and {{designated}} an 'Urban Fringe' site, The Riddy is {{a species}} rich habitat, being {{described by the}} Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire as [...] "an oasis of wild flowers, bird song and a wonderful view among a sea of arable fields". In the meadows many different grasses and other plants grow, such as cuckoo flower (Cardamine pratensis). The pond, stream and ditches support aquatic plants, such as arrowhead (Sagittaria sagittifolia), celery-leaved buttercup (Ranunculus sceleratus), <b>purple-loosestrife</b> (Lythrum salicaria), water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica) and duckweed. Chub (Squalius cephalus) and carp can both {{be found in the}} 500 yards m stream, along with the nationally protected water vole (Arvicola amphibius). Numerous birds frequent The Riddy, some which feed in the meadows including redwing (Turdus iliacus), fieldfare (Turdus pilaris) and northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), whilst sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) have been observed [...] "patrolling" [...] the mature hedgerows. Grey herons (Ardea cinerea) and common terns (Sterna hirundo) hunt fish, and in the autumn, song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) can be seen at the reserve. Grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) and kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) have also been recorded on the reserve.|$|E
