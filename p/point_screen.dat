40|$|Summary Epidermal {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} {{can be used}} as a biological marker in tumours. We examined 199 samples from 150 patients with ovarian cancer first by using a single <b>point</b> <b>screen,</b> then by full Scatchard analysis, over a concentration range between 0. 086 - 16. 6 nM. Taking as positive those samples which showed a 20 % difference between total binding and non specific binding, the EGFR was present in 39. 7 % of samples ranging from 36. 4 % in those tumours which were classified as being mucinous to 47. 7 % in the undifferentiated group. Thirty-six samples had a low affinity component (Kd> 1 nM), 27 had a high affinity component (Kd < 1 nM) and 16 had both high and low affinity components to the EGFR. There was no statistical difference between degree of differentiation of the tumour and the presence of the EGFR nor between stage of the disease and EGFR presence. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) interaction with EGFR results in growth of some epithelial cancer cells in vitro and EGFR has been found in both normal and malignant tissue samples. Hoffmann et al. (1984) found EGFR in normal human endometrium, while Korc et al. (1986) found the receptor in human endometrial carcinoma. Battaglia et al...|$|E

40|$|An acidic/metals/sulfate, {{groundwater}} contaminant plume {{emanates from}} the diarrhea Coal Pile Runoff Basin (DCPRB) at the Savannah River Site (SRS), {{due to the}} contaminated runoff the basin receives from the D-Area coal pile. From a previous feasibility evaluation and laboratory testing, {{it was concluded that}} the plume could be remediated with sulfate reduction remediation combined with monitored natural attenuation (MNA). Additionally these previous studies recommended that soybean oil and sodium lactate be utilized as organic substrates for sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) during a subsequent sulfate reduction, pilot scale, field demonstration. The soybean oil was to be tested as a long-term, slow release, organic substrate, and the sodium lactate was to be tested as a short-term, immediately available, organic substrate. The subsequent sulfate reduction, pilot scale, field demonstration consisted of the following: (1) Approximately 825 gallons of soybean oil was injected into both the south and north wings of the existing D-Area interceptor well. (2) Approximately 227. 5 gallons of sodium lactate and 1169 gallons of groundwater from a background well were injected into the south wing only. The groundwater was used to reduce the viscosity of the sodium lactate for injection, to flush the sodium lactate out of the injection <b>point</b> <b>screen</b> zones, and to provide bioaugmentation (i. e. the addition of SRB). Both pre-injection and post-injection monitoring and sampling and analysis were conducted in order to evaluate the impact of organic substrate injection on soluble organic, sulfate, nutrient, microbe, hydrogen sulfide, pH, Eh, and metal concentrations (i. e. the ability to promote sulfate reduction remediation of the plume). Overall it is clear from this field demonstration that both soybean oil and sodium lactate provided a suitable organic substrate to promote SRB growth. The SRB growth promoted by both soybean oil and sodium lactate resulted in sulfate reduction remediation as evidenced by the decrease in sulfate and increase in hydrogen sulfide concentrations, the subsequent increase in pH and decrease in Eh, and finally the subsequent decrease in metal concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{and quick}} {{assessment}} of energy conservation measures in greenhouse cultivation supports growers in their operations. Such an overview should quantify {{the consequences of}} changes in energy flows for total energy consumption, amount and quality of production, and farm economy. Using tomato as an example crop, comprehensive energy balances were developed for a reference situation in The Netherlands. Solar radiation, primary and secondary heating circuits and CO 2 from the flue gasses of the heating system were quantified as energy sources. Energy use for air and leaf temperature increase, crop photosynthesis, crop transpiration, as well as energy losses through the roof, walls and ground surface were quantified. Subsequently, the effects of 11 energy conservation measures were computed. Consequences for gas consumption and production were simulated with a greenhouse and a crop growth model, respectively, consequences for quality were assessed {{on the basis of}} expert knowledge, and economic consequences were simulated with a cost-benefit model. For tomato, most energy was saved by increased insulation of the greenhouse cover (23 % saving) and lowered temperature set point (16 %), followed by increased set point for air relative humidity, screen gap control in steps, and temperature integration (all about 5 %). Fresh tomato production fell in most cases, except in case of increased light transmission by the greenhouse cover. Energy use efficiency was defined as the amount of energy required to produce a certain quantity of fresh harvestable product. Energy-conservation aims to decrease the energy use efficiency. Greatest gains were reached through insulation (- 20 %), lowered temperature set point (- 12 %) and improved light transmission (- 8 %). Improved light transmission resulted in the strongest increase of the balance of yield and costs (¿ 2. 6, or 10 %), followed by increase of RH set point, crop-based RH control, crop-based use of the energy screen, increased size of the thermal storage tank and reduction of crop transpiration (all less than ¿ 0. 5). Although energy conservation reduces fuel costs, its implementation depends on the effects on production an overall economic profitability of the farm. Improved roof insulation, reduced temperature set <b>point,</b> <b>screen</b> gap control in steps, increase of the RH set point, temperature integration, and crop-based RH control are first candidates for (further) implementation. Other measures require prior technological advancements or fine-tunin...|$|E

40|$|Because {{solar cells}} in a {{production}} batch are not identical, screening is performed to obtain similar cells for aggregation into arrays. A common technique for screening {{is based on}} a single operating point of the I-V characteristic of the cell, usually the maximum power point. As a result, inferior cell matching may occur at the actual operating <b>points.</b> <b>Screening</b> solar cells based on the entire I-V characteristic will inherently result in more similar cells in the array. An array consisting of more similar cells is likely to have better overall characteristics and more predictable performance. Solar cell screening methods and cell ranking are discussed. The concept of a mean cell is defined as a cell 'best' representing all the cells in the production batch. The screening and ranking of all cells are performed with respect to the mean cell.
