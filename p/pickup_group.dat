500|$|In 1965, {{headlining}} the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed {{his first}} electric set {{since high school}} with a <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> featuring Mike Bloomfield on [...] guitar and Al Kooper on organ. Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version {{has it that the}} boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. Murray Lerner, who filmed the performance, said: [...] "I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric." [...] An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set. This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival, who reports his recording proves the only boos were in reaction to the MC's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, in each town or city, the {{producer}} or promoter can pay a local music contractor {{to hire a}} local musicians to form a [...] "pickup" [...] orchestra or a [...] "jobbing band". If a promoter decides to hire a <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> in each town or city, {{this means that the}} promoter does not {{have to pay for the}} travel, hotels and meals for these musicians, since they live in the town or city where the show is taking place. There are some disadvantages; using a <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> requires contractors to pay for a series of rehearsals for the new musicians in each town, so that they can learn the songs/pieces. As well, since the <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> will not have experience playing together and since they may not have experience performing the songs/pieces in the show, a <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> may not play with the same [...] "tight" [...] ensemble as a longstanding group which backs up a soloist or musical theatre/opera company on a permanent basis.|$|E

5000|$|One {{reason that}} musicians [...] "fake" [...] {{is because there}} are not enough rehearsals or time to learn the pieces.Another factor is the extreme {{challenges}} in contemporary pieces; professionals interviewed by the magazine said [...] "faking" [...] was [...] "...necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works. Youth orchestra members and players in amateur or community orchestras may fake because the parts in professional orchestral repertoire are beyond their technical level. Gigging musicians playing in [...] "one-off" [...] <b>pickup</b> <b>groups</b> and local pit orchestras may fake because they do not have time to practice or prepare the music.|$|R
5000|$|Manones {{style was}} similar to that of fellow New Orleans trumpeter Louis Prima: hot jazz with trumpet leads, punctuated by good-natured spoken patter in a pleasantly gravelly voice. Manone was an esteemed {{musician}} who was frequently recruited for recording sessions. He played on some early Benny Goodman records, for example, and fronted various <b>pickup</b> <b>groups</b> under pseudonyms like [...] "The Cellar Boys" [...] and [...] "Barbecue Joe and His Hot Dogs." [...] His hit records included [...] "Tar Paper Stomp" [...] (an original riff composition of 1929, later used as the basis for Glenn Millers [...] "In the Mood"), and a hot 1934 version of a sweet ballad of the time [...] "The Isle of Capri", which was said to have annoyed the songwriters despite the royalties it earned them.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Scott Yanow {{wrote of the}} album [...] "Whether it be on rapid stomps or {{sensitive}} ballads, this trio (which was in reality an all-star <b>pickup</b> <b>group)</b> sounds {{as if they had}} worked together regularly for years." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Ken Dryden states [...] "Veteran trombonist Jimmy Knepper has led {{relatively}} few recording sessions, but this 1979 studio date {{is well worth}} acquiring. Knepper brought his own arrangements to the studio for his <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> of European musicians to play, and all went well throughout the session".|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Sir Thomas Beecham made {{a series}} of {{recordings}} in Columbia Records' 30th Street Studios in New York City with a completely different <b>pickup</b> <b>group,</b> which was also called the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. Later reissued by Sony on CD, the recordings include Dance of the Hours from the opera La Gioconda by Amilcare Ponchielli, the overture to The Merry Wives of Windsor by Otto Nicolai, Carmen Suite by Georges Bizet, and Capriccio Italien by Peter Tchaikovsky.|$|E
50|$|Gil Waugh is classically {{trained on}} trumpet {{and for many}} years headed an Ottawa <b>pickup</b> jazz <b>group</b> named TWNJC. In the 1970s, he toured, {{recorded}} and performed on electric bass with several rock bands based in Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After TWNJC disbanded, he has focused composing and performing efforts on more traditionally rooted Celtic music and currently plays the Great Highland Bagpipe with The Sons of Scotland, Canada's oldest Civilian Pipe Band.|$|R
40|$|The CHARM II Collaboration {{has built}} a massive, {{fine-grained}} and low-density detector {{for the study of}} muon-neutrino and muon-antineutrino scattering on electrons. The detector consists of a target calorimeter of 692 t of glass followed by a magnetic spectrometer. The calorimeter is used to detect the different types of neutrino interactions, and to measure the energy and direction of the produced particle showers; the spectrometer permits the determination of the momentum of muons produced in charged-current reactions on nuclei. The calorimeter is composed of 441 detector planes having a total of 154 560 plastic streamer tubes with digital readout of the wires and of 73920 cathode <b>pickup</b> strips <b>grouped</b> in 9240 channels with analog readout. It is further instrumented with 1540 scintillators. A complete description of the detector and some results of its performance with cosmic-ray muons are presented. © 1989. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|After {{the test}} run concluded, Debmar-Mercury {{picked up the}} program for a full {{nationwide}} launch, and through additional station <b>group</b> <b>pickups</b> (including stations owned by CBS Television Stations, NBC Owned Television Stations, Tribune Broadcasting, LIN TV Corporation, Cox Media Group, Local TV LLC, Raycom Media, New Vision Television and the Meredith Corporation), gained carriage on stations covering more than 95% of the country including all of the 20 largest media markets and 45 of the top 50 markets. On June 4, 2009, BET acquired the cable syndication rights to the show, airing {{it as part of}} the cable channel's late night schedule. The Wendy Williams Show entered into national syndication on broadcast stations and on BET on July 13, 2009.|$|R

50|$|In early 2009, he {{performed}} three shows as a duo with Tall Firs drummer Ryan Sawyer, {{the latter two}} under the name Stabbing Eastward. Also in early 2009, Adebimpe released a combined single/DVD under the name Fake Male Voice on the Japan/Brooklyn label Heartfast. He performed one show under that name with a <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> at the record's release party. Fake Male Voice again performed at a Heartfast showcase during CMJ 2009, as a duo comprising Adebimpe and Gerard Smith.|$|E
50|$|While an {{undergraduate}} at Stanford, Guard started a <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> with Reynolds and Shane. Guard called his group Dave Guard and the Calypsonians, with a Weavers-style signature sound that was principally two guitars, a banjo, and rollicking vocals. Guard kept the group together after Reynolds and Shane left, changing {{the name of}} the Calypsonians to The Kingston Quartet. Then in 1957, when Reynolds and Shane agreed to team up with Guard again, the group changed its name to The Kingston Trio. Under contract with Capitol Records, the Trio became a huge commercial and influential success.|$|E
40|$|Large-amplitude ultralow-frequency wave {{structure}} {{observed on}} both sides of the magnetic pileup boundary of comet P/Halley during the flyby of the Giotto spacecraft have been analyzed using suprathermal electron density and magnetic field observations. Upstream of the boundary, electron density and magnetic field magnitude variations are anticorrelated, while in the pileup region these quantities are clearly correlated. Both in front of and behind the pileup boundary the observed waves are quasi-perpendicular wave structures as a minimum variance analysis shows. A detailed comparison of our observations in the prepileup region with theoretical and numerical results shows that the mirror mode mode waves may have been generated by a mirror instability driven by the pressure anisotropy of the ring-type distributions of the heavy (water <b>group)</b> <b>pickup</b> cometary ions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the current state of}} truck parking and rest area facilities in the Northeast Illinois Region to determine if and how problems from truck parking affect freight transportation infrastructure, safety, and the region???s economy and environment. A taxonomic study of truck traffic volume and truck parking vailability was completed. Truck parking sites for this report comprise private and public sites. Interviews were conducted with state, county, municipal authorities, and truck drivers. The primary problems found involved two groups of truckers. One group is the independent, over-the-road drivers with Chicagoland deliveries and <b>pickups.</b> This <b>group</b> has fewer resources available for securing parking when needed. These truckers are responsible for much of the ???nuisance??? parking in residential, retail, or manufacturing areas. The second group contributing to nuisance parking is local company drivers who park in areas designed for over-the-road truckers and access ramps. The consequences of nuisance parking include safety hazards, problematic environmental effects from emissions and toxins, and a diminished freight ransportation system affecting the local economy. Recommendations are given. Solutions include: improving parking sites by creating additional parking for the drivers needing it; and re-using brownfield sites, underutilized retail and manufacturing parking areas, and seasonally affected sites to create additional parking. Communication of site availability via radio or other means is also proposed. Since the impacts and needs are diffused over the region, further study of both procedural, such as the development of design guides, and programmatic private and public solutions are proposed.

40|$|Large-amplitude {{electromagnetic}} plasma {{waves are}} one of the dominant features of the solar wind-comet interaction. Wave characteristics strongly depend on parameters such as the solar wind flow and Alfven velocities and the angle between flow and interplanetary magnetic field as well as the production rate. With respect to the latter the flyby of the spacecraft Giotto at comet P/Griff-Skjellerup provides a unique possibility to study such waves in further detail. Pickup ion-related wave signatures have been observed up to a distance of 600, 000 km from the nucleus. Peak spectral power in the spacecraft frame of reference occurs at frequencies mainly somewhat below the water group ion gyrofrequency. From this the waves are determined to be mainly left-hand polarized waves, causing one-sided pitch angle diffusion outbound. The wave activity strongly increases close to the comet; upstream it exhibits a quadratic dependence on the water <b>group</b> <b>pickup</b> ion free energy. Furthermore, a phenomenological study of the wave characteristics provides a unique description of the fine-structure of the interaction region. Indications of steepened magnetosonic waves have been found in the outbound magnetosheath region...|$|R

50|$|A <b>pickup</b> <b>group</b> is a {{group of}} {{professional}} musicians, which may be session musicians who are hired to play for a limited time period—ranging from a single concert or sound recording session to several weeks of shows—before disbanding. Pickup groups are formed to play in pit orchestras for musical theatre performances, operas, or operettas, accompany jazz singers or instrumental soloists, and act as a temporary backup band for a pop singer for a tour. As well, pickup groups are hired to perform at social events such as weddings or holiday parties. The size of these ensembles ranges from a three- or four-member rock ensemble or jazz group (e.g., a rhythm section, organ trio or backing band) or classical chamber ensemble (e.g., a string quartet) to a 20-piece jazz big band, a 20-27 member pit orchestra for a Broadway musical or a 30-100 member orchestra.|$|E

40|$|The {{satellite}} observations at comet Halley have shown strong heating of solar wind alpha particles {{over an extended}} region dominated by high-intensity, low-frequency turbulence. These waves are excited by the water <b>group</b> <b>pickup</b> ions and can energize the solar wind plasma by different heating processes. The alpha particle heating by the Landau damping of kinetic Alfven waves and the transit time damping of low-frequency hydromagnetic waves in this region of high plasma beta are studied in this paper. The Alfven wave heating was shown to be the dominant mechanism for the observed proton heating, but it {{is found to be}} insufficient to account for the observed alpha particle heating. The transit time damping due to the interaction of the ions with the electric fields associated with the magnetic field compressions of magnetohydrodynamic waves is found to heat the alpha particles preferentially over the protons. Comparison of the calculated heating times for the transit time damping with the observations from comet Halley shows good agreement. These processes contribute to the thermalization of the solar wind by the conversion of its directed energy into the thermal energy in the transition region at comet-solar wind interaction...|$|R
