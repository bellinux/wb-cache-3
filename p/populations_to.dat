5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the black skimmer, brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its seed {{in response}} to bushfire, {{it is important that}} fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E

5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of <b>populations,</b> <b>to</b> the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E
5000|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{plays an}} important role in the survival and adaptability of a species. When a population's habitat changes, the <b>population</b> may have <b>to</b> adapt to survive; the ability of the <b>population</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the changing environment will determine their ability to cope with an environmental challenge. Variation in the populations gene pool allows natural selection to act upon traits that allow the <b>population</b> <b>to</b> adapt to changing environments. The more genetic diversity a population has, the more likelihood the population will be able to adapt.|$|R

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{is a type}} {{of genetic}} recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA. It is most widely used by cells to accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand breaks. Homologous recombination also produces new combinations of DNA sequences during meiosis, the process by which eukaryotes make gamete cells, like sperm and egg cells in animals. These new combinations of DNA represent genetic variation in offspring, which in turn enables <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> adapt during the course of evolution. Homologous recombination is also used in horizontal gene transfer to exchange genetic material between different strains and species of bacteria and viruses.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the {{tawny nurse shark}} as Vulnerable worldwide, as it faces heavy fishing pressure and its low reproductive and dispersal rates limit the ability of over-exploited <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> recover. Furthermore, this shark's inshore habitat renders it susceptible to habitat degradation, destructive fishing practices (e.g. poisons and explosives, especially prevalent off Indonesia and the Philippines), and human harassment. Localized declines or extirpations of the tawny nurse shark have been documented off India and Thailand. Off Australia, this species has been assessed as of Least Concern, as there it is not targeted by fisheries.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the Famine of 1740-41, which killed roughly two fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied {{over the next}} century, but another devastating famine in the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century the population was reduced by over half, {{at a time when}} the general trend in European countries was for <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> rise by an average of three-fold.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{recognised}} subspecies. E. c. citrinella (Linnaeus, 1758), the nominate subspecies, occurs in southeast England {{and most of}} Europe east to the northwestern corner of Russia and western Ukraine, E. c. caliginosa (Clancey, 1940) is the form found in Ireland, the Isle of Man and Great Britain (except southeast England), and E. c. erythrogenys (Brehm, 1855) breeds from Russia, central Ukraine and the eastern Balkans eastwards to Siberia and northwest Mongolia, and also has isolated <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> {{the east of the}} Black Sea and in the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{increasing}} attempts to preserve {{much of what}} survives from Scotland's architectural heritage, including the great buildings and monuments, and the classically influenced houses of towns such as Edinburgh and Glasgow. There have also been attempts at preserving the surviving Glasgow tenements, {{many of which have}} been renovated, restored to their original pink and honeyed sandstone from the black fronts created by pollution and brought up to modern standards of accommodation. Urban regeneration has also been attempted in areas of post-industrial decline, such as the Merchant City in Glasgow, which was returned to housing from the 1980s, with warehouse loft conversions and more recently the waterfront in Edinburgh, resulting in a return of resident <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> major urban centres.|$|E

5|$|Thompson and Russell {{found another}} {{evolutionary}} lineage that originates in a glacially restricted {{area of the}} Salmon River Mountains, Idaho. With {{the arrival of the}} Holocene interglacial, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Pleistocene glaciers receded and opened a migratory path linking these southern <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> northern areas where they currently overlap with A. m. krausei and co-migrated north into the Peace River (Canada) Valley. Ferguson also noted an intergradation in the same geographic area, but between the morphological subspecies A. m. columbianum and A. m. kraisei that run parallel to the Bitterroot and Selkirk ranges. Thompson and Russell suggest that this contact zone is between two different subspecies lineages because the A. m. columbianum lineage is geographically isolated and restricted to the central Oregon Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.|$|E
5|$|Barriers to {{reproduction}} {{between two}} diverging sexual populations {{are required for}} the <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be {{possible for them to}} produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype. The importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.|$|E

5|$|Diseases {{introduced}} to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these diseases ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520–1521, and {{is also likely to}} have spread throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived in the area in 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new diseases, against which they had no immunity. It is likely that disease had significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic diseases spread across Mesoamerica in 1545–1548, and again in 1576–1581, reducing indigenous <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> just 10% of their pre-contact levels, making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced diseases were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two <b>populations</b> <b>to</b> drift independently of each other.|$|E
