40|$|Despite several {{advantages}} associated with pre-fabricated glass-fiber posts, the coronal portion of these posts must be cut {{to allow their}} use in various clinical situations. However, <b>cutting</b> the cemented <b>post</b> can generate stress on the bonding interface and affect the bond strength. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect the of fiber <b>post</b> <b>cutting</b> on the bond strength of root canals. Sixty bovine incisor roots were included in resin cylinders with simulated periodontal ligaments. Glass-fiber posts were luted using regular resin cement RelyX ARC (3 M ESPE) or self-adhesive cement RelyX Unicem (3 M ESPE). The posts were cut prior to cementation, immediately after luting or after building up the core (n= 10). After storage for 24 h, the samples were cut and subject to push-out testing using a mechanical testing machine (EMIC DL 2000). Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA (resin cement x moment of <b>post</b> <b>cutting)</b> and Tukey's <b>post</b> hoc test (&# 945;= 0. 05). The moment of fiber <b>post</b> <b>cutting</b> did not affect the bond strength when Unicem was used. However, the bond strength was reduced when ARC was used and when the post was cut immediately.

30|$|Prevailing weather {{conditions}} {{during the time}} of <b>cutting,</b> <b>curing,</b> and baling can have huge adverse effect on the forage material. For example, alfalfa hay DM dropped by up to 22  % when exposed to about 10  mm of rainfall during curing (Rankin and Undersander 2004). According to Rankin and Undersander (2004), prevailing {{weather conditions}} affect forage quality through (i) plant respiration that reduces soluble carbohydrates and energy content during storage; (ii) leaching of soluble carbohydrates, protein, and minerals under unprotected storage; (iii) leaf shattering and loss of highly digestible proteins; (iv) microbial activity which metabolizes soluble carbohydrates, reducing forage energy content, and possibly producing harmful metabolites; and finally (v) color change through bleaching and excessive drying reducing palatability of the hay (Roberts 1995). Moldy hay can be a health hazard to livestock due to potential toxicity (Tangni et al. 2013). In a few cases, hay baled at high-moisture content can spontaneously heat to combustion (Rotz and Muck 1994).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to contribute to {{improving the quality of}} fresh-cut fruits by identifying how raw material use, processing, packaging and storage might be optimised. Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factor variables on the quality, microbiology and phytochemical content were determined. Following comprehensive quality evaluations, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed, and the biplots generated were effective in characterising patterns of deterioration and in tracking differences in quality in terms of the rate and extent of change. Ripeness stage/ physiological age, geographical origin, cut size and packaging type had large effects on quality (p< 0. 05) as did storage temperature and time (p< 0. 01). There were significant effects of controlled and modified atmospheres on quality (p 0. 05). In general, product modified atmosphere (PMA) packs displayed a steadier rate of quality loss with more consistent end-product quality. A CA of 5 %O 2 + 5 %CO 2 was best at maintaining fresh-cut pineapple and cantaloupe melon quality, while a CA of 97 %N 2 + 3 %O 2 was best for fresh-cut kiwifruit. Exposure to sub-optimal atmospheres resulted in physiological disorders such as discolouration, loss of firmness and off-odour development. Cut size (p< 0. 05) and storage time (p< 0. 01) had large effects on volatile aromatic compounds (VACs). VAC changes involved increased and/or decreased concentrations of existing volatiles rather than the emergence of new compounds. A total of 18, 16 and 20 odour-active compounds were detected and tentatively identified in the headspace of fresh-cut pineapple, cantaloupe melon and kiwifruit respectively. Based on PCA interpretation, the <b>post</b> <b>cutting</b> aroma life of fresh-cut pineapple and kiwifruit was adequate over 7 days for large cut pieces, and limited to less than 7 Days for smaller cut pieces. In contrast, fresh-cut melon aroma was limited to 4 and 7 Days for small and large cut pieces respectively. This was largely due to the presence of fermentative-like off-odours, which were more pronounced for smaller cut pieces. The effects of intrinsic and extrinsic variables on the respiration rate (RCO 2) of a number of fresh-cut fruits were determined. In general, the RCO 2 increased initially, peaked, and declined gradually to equilibrium within 24 h. The high initial rate was highly dependent on fruit type, physiological age and processing (p< 0. 05). Using data for fresh-cut pineapple, a mathematical model based on exponential decay was developed in order to predict the RCO 2 over time. From this, the oxygen and carbon dioxide transmission rates required in package design were estimated and validated. The model parameters were found to be a good fit with experimental data and could be successfully applied to other fresh-cut fruits to aid in product-package compatibility...|$|R

40|$|Fresh-cut or {{minimally}} {{processed vegetables}} are those {{which have been}} trimmed and/or peeled and/or cut into 100 % usable product and still maintain freshness. Contrary to other processing methods (freezing, canning and drying for example) the minimal processing operations reduce the shelf life {{in relation to the}} raw material (intact product). In this thesis the changes in quality of tomato fruits after cutting into transversal slices were analysed and quantified in relation to the stage of maturity of the fruit at harvest and to the storage temperature. Quality was analysed in relation to some attributes related with organoleptical (firmness) visual (colour and translucency) and nutritional (lycopene content and total antioxidant activity) quality. The firmness of the tomato pericarp, evaluated through puncture tests,   decreased exponentially during storage. Within a maturity stage, the firmness decreased only slightly during storage and major difference was found in the initial firmness at the different stages of maturity. The optical properties were evaluated through video image analysis and expressed as RGB (Red,Green,Blue) colour aspects. A mathematical model was used to describe the changes in the RGB colour aspects resulting from two different processes namely changes in colour due to the production and/or degradation of pigments (maturation) and development of translucency due to watersoaking of the pericarp. It incorporated in a single equation the effects of time, temperature, stage of maturity and background over which the tomato slices were imaged. Both translucency and maturation resulted in a decrease of the RGB values. The development of translucency was highly determined by the stage of maturity of the fruit at harvest and rather independent of temperature. Changes in colour due to maturation were much less pronounced. Using a spectrophotometric technique (Kubelka-Munk analysis) to evaluate the development of translucency these findings were confirmed. Changes in lycopene content were evaluated by HPLC. Cutting did not change the lycopene accumulation when the slices were kept at low temperature, while lycopene production predominated over degradation at temperature higher than 8 o C. The antioxidant activity of fresh-cut and intact tomato fruits was assessed by a radical (ABTS) scavenging method. Cutting induced a reduction of the hydrophilic antioxidant activity, while the lipophilic antioxidant activity was not affected. The antioxidant activity of both fractions increased with maturation. In short, the <b>post</b> <b>cutting</b> life based on appearance was shorter than that based on textural and nutritional value. The greatest range of changes happened in the first 2 days of storage for all quality attributes. The stage of maturity determined the initial values as much as the rate of decrease (or increase) along storage of each attribute. The effect of temperature although present was far lower than the effect of stage of maturity.   For a short period (less than 1 week) the low temperature was efficient to prevent most of the deleterious changes in quality (softening, over-ripening, loss of antioxidants) but not to prevent water-soaking of the pericarp and translucency development...|$|R

Under normal irrigation conditions, the highest grain yield was obtained from Zarrin cultivar, whereas, under drought stress conditions, the highest grain yield was obtained from Tabasi cultivar. The trait most sensitive to water stress was grain yield (mean reduction 51. 6 % compared to control) followed by harvest index (mean reduction 37. 2 % compared to control). Correlation coefficient results showed that under normal irrigation conditions the highest correlation was between grain yield and biological yield (0. 844 *) and under stress conditions was found between grain yield and grain number per spike (0. 895 **), CTD (0. 771 **) and 1000 Grain weight (0. 689 **).

The objective is to determine if {{it is possible to}} show a supposed fault scarp, the Bollnäs fault, in the bedrock and the valley morphology in a 3 D model based on the data available. During the last ice age, the land surface under the ice was depressed by several hundred meters. As the last ice sheet retreated, land uplift began and faulting occurred. These glacially-induced faults are dated to late or post glacial times since they are <b>cutting</b> <b>post</b> glacial sediments. The same goes for the Bollnäs fault.

In the model, the scarp cannot be seen in the bedrock, nor in the deposits nor in the valley morphology. Exporting the model to Arc GIS as a digital terrain model, a DTM, as a raster, shows that with the amount of data available a fair pixel resolution would be 150 m 2.

Additionally, studies on waste minimization through recycling of the waste brake lining dust into the virgin mix and the effect of this recycling on subsequent product performance quality were also carried out. The audit showed that there was generation of waste at just about every step of the process, as evidenced by weight loss calculations on the original mix entering the process. For example, in the cutting step this loss was about 30 percent, in grinding it ranged from 10. 64 percent to 13. 03 percent, in drilling from 2. 17 percent to 6. 8 percent, and in chamfering from 0. 49 percent to 1. 07 percent; in the case of cutting this included both cutting residues and fines while {{in the rest of the}} cases these were only fines. Next, in evaluating the recycling of the fines, recycling 5 percent to 10 percent of the lining waste dust into the virgin mix retained the specific gravity of the brake lining samples well within the specification requirement range of 2. 12 to 2. 32. Additionally, inertia dynamometer tests were carried out on the linings produced from the 5 percent and 10 percent recycling mix, with the virgin mix as the control.

Both the 5 percent and 10 percent recycled ones performed as good as the control one, although the S percent one exhibited lower green effectiveness and greater speed spread. Finally, based on an analysis of waste management and disposal costs, and in order also to minimize waste generation, a few simple process changes are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Adventitious rooting, whereby roots {{form from}} {{non-root}} tissues, {{is critical to}} the forestry and horticultural industries that depend on propagating plants from cuttings. A major problem is that age of the tissue affects the ability of the cutting to form adventitious roots. Here, a model system has been developed using Pisum sativum to differentiate between different interpretations of ageing. It is shown that the decline in adventitious rooting is linked to the ontogenetic switch from vegetative to floral and is mainly attributed to the cutting base. Using rms mutants it is demonstrated that the decline is not a result of increased strigolactones inhibiting adventitious root formation. Monitoring endogenous levels of a range of other hormones including a range of cytokinins in the rooting zone revealed that a peak in jasmonic acid is delayed in cuttings from floral plants. Additionally, there is an early peak in indole- 3 -acetic acid levels 6 h <b>post</b> excision in <b>cuttings</b> from vegetative plants, which is absent in cuttings from floral plants. These results were confirmed using DR 5 :GUS expression. Exogenous supplementation of young cuttings with either jasmonic acid or indole- 3 -acetic acid promoted adventitious rooting, but neither of these hormones was able to promote adventitious rooting in mature cuttings. DR 5 :GUS expression was observed to increase in juvenile cuttings with increasing auxin treatment but not in the mature cuttings. Therefore, it seems the vegetative to floral ontogenetic switch involves an alteration in the tissue’s auxin homeostasis that significantly reduces the indole- 3 -acetic acid pool and ultimately results in a decline in adventitious root formation...|$|R
40|$|Poverty and {{environmental}} degradation {{are among the}} severest challenges faced in the developing countries. Since {{the rise of the}} sustainable development paradigm, poverty came to be identified as one of the major causes of environmental degradation. However, there are many kinds of processes that can interact in varied ways between humans and the environment, making the poverty-environment interaction complex. In this context, the present study sought to examine if there was empirical evidence to support the poverty-environment hypothesis in smallholder tobacco production in Marondera district, Eastern Zimbabwe. The hypothesis premises that poverty encourages over-exploitation of the physical environment and this further impoverishes the environment (Scherr, 2000). The study was a qualitative case study which used household interviews, key informants and focus group discussions and secondary data. Using a sustainable livelihoods framework and drawing on political ecology, the study found that there was no significant connection between poverty {{and environmental}} degradation. Although tobacco is associated with environmentally damaging practices especially pollution through extensive agrochemicals use and land degradation through deforestation (<b>cutting</b> wood to <b>cure</b> tobacco leaves), these practices were found to be a function of household decisions and how the farmer perceives the tobacco management benefits (short-term benefits than long-term outcomes) rather than wealth. Although smallholder farmers were found to be the proximate agents/causes of the environmental degradation linked to tobacco, a chain of link analysis has shown a number of local and extra-local factors influencing this. The political ecology lens established that the environmental degradation in tobacco is more linked to political and economic factors. Policies that necessitated the growth of the tobacco industry among them the ‘growth with equity’ and ESAP in the 90 s supported export-oriented agricultural production. Furthermore, the government of Zimbabwe’s heavy dependence on tobacco (for almost 23 % of its total exports and almost 10 % of the national GDP) seems to have blocked serious considerations of environment concerns linked to tobacco production. The ultimate cause of the environmental degradation is therefore the international market for tobacco which creates demand at the local level rather than the poor farmers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} {{composite}} {{was made from}} epoxy resin of the type GY- 191 produced by Hexion Speciality Chemical Pty Ltd, epoxidised linseed oil locally produced from the University of Southern Queensland lab and fillers of sawdust and Evirospheres (SLG). Aradur- 250 amine was used as hardener. Ratio of epoxy resin to Aradur hardener was varied; the first ratio was 2 : 1 and last one was 3 : 1. Background information pressure on traditional building material such as concrete, timber and steel is becoming unbearable. As such a number of researches are being carried out throughout the world to look for material that will release pressure on building materials. For material to be accepted as a building material it’s physical, mechanical and structural properties have to be known to meet basic criteria for building material. Aims and objectives: The aims of the project were to investigate the physical, mechanical and structural properties of composite made from renewable resources (Epoxy resin and epoxidised vegetable oil (linseed oil (ELO)) and by using wastes material such as sawdust and SLG as fillers. Preparation Samples were prepared with different percentage in weight of sawdust and SLG. The two main sizes of sawdust used were 600 and 1650 microns. Percentage of SLG was varied as well as sawdust. The composite was subjected to preparation that includes weighing, mixing, <b>curing,</b> <b>cutting</b> to sizes and polishing. Curing was done {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours followed by 4 hours of 80 degrees Celsius in an industrial oven. Methodology: Three main tests were used in the investigation of the composite properties. The tests were flexural, impact fracture toughness and DMA analysis. Each of these tests was adopted to determine different expects of the mechanical, physical and structural properties. Both flexural and Impact fracture toughness tests were carried out using MTS alliance provided by CEEFC. The properties investigate in this methods include flexural modulus, peak load, peakstress, deflection and strain at failure. Samples specimen for flexural and impact toughness were made of bar shape with dimensions of 64 x 15 x 10 mm according MTS alliance specifications. DMA samples were smaller made according Q 800 specifications of 35 x 12 x 4 mm. DMA was used to determine thermal mechanical properties. The thermal properties determined were glass transition temperature (Tg), storage modulus, and tan delta. Results and Conclusion: Results obtained for the samples for flexural revealed flexural modulus of up to 1880 MPa for composite with sawdust and SLG in its composition. Composites samples with ELO have lower flexural modulus as compare to ones without ELO. The trend observed was that when more sawdust was added to the composite, storage, peak load, and flexural modulus increased up to a certain limit at which they drop. Addition of more sawdust was observed to lower deflections of composite bars. The result from various combinations of epoxy resin and waste material was compared to the one for the pure or neat epoxy resin. It was found that with addition of ELO, the physical, mechanical and structural properties were much lower compared with the neat epoxy resin properties...|$|R
25|$|Back at Fort William, Selkirk issued {{orders to}} his men on August 15 to {{prohibit}} the Nor'Westers from conducting their normal business in order to disrupt the NWC’s trade. As such, no canoes bearing trade goods were allowed {{to leave for the}} interior nor were any canoes bearing furs dispatched to Montreal, which disrupted the NWC’s trade for the ensuing year costing the company tens of thousands of pounds. The next day, Selkirk began a detailed inventory of Fort William in order to locate any stolen HBC goods and began searching official and personal correspondences for evidence concerning the destruction of the Red River colony. Among the papers at Fort William was found {{a list of all the}} Red River Métis who participated in the destruction of the Red River colony in 1815 as well as 20 bales of goods which were to be sent to these men as gifts. Selkirk also found 30 or 40 packs of furs he claimed were stolen from the HBC’s Brandon House which had apparently been repacked at Fort William. Selkirk sent these papers and the bales of goods and furs to Montreal as evidence. On the 18th, the NWC prisoners were made ready to depart. In all, eight NWC partners were taken prisoner and sent to Montreal, including the head of the company, William McGillivray. Before they departed, each partner’s cassette was searched and personal papers were confiscated. The prisoners were conveyed in three canoes with a fourth following containing armed guards. The canoes were grossly overcrowded, and while on Lake Superior, one canoe overturned and one Kenneth Mackenzie and 8 others drowned. Soon after a NWC canoe arrived at Fort William carrying John McGillivray and Archibald McGillivray who were promptly arrested. On the 25th, two canoes were dispatched under the command of Pierre Pambrun to seize the arms and ammunition at Fort Lac la Pluie, but the officer in charge would not surrender. Even though the fort’s complement was only 7 men, Selkirk’s party was not prepared for a siege so they retreated back to Fort William. Selkirk then dispatched Captain Proteus D’Orsonnens with a second party and 2 field pieces to besiege the fort. The Nor'Westers at Lac la Pluie, now running low on their stores of fish, could not maintain a siege and surrendered. Selkirk also dispatched parties to seize the NWC posts at Fond du Lac and Michipicoton on Lake Superior which was duly accomplished. Capturing Fond du Lac would eventually get Selkirk into some legal trouble as it was on American soil and the goods and furs there were partially owned by John Jacob Astor’s American Fur Company. Selkirk also hatched a plan to build outposts on the HBC’s land situated between Fort William and Lac la Pluie in order to stop all NWC communication between the two <b>posts.</b> He began <b>cutting</b> a road, but the plans were never completed. In September, Selkirk’s men, while helping the Nor’Westers unload cargo from their sloop, took away its 2 small brass cannons and accompanying ammunition. On September 2, Selkirk gathered together the NWC voyageurs and attempted to induce them to break their contracts and leave the company. One voyageur named Letemps refused to attend and campaigned with several clerks to convince the voyageurs to honour their contracts. For this he was arrested on trumped up charges of theft and was sent to Montreal.|$|R
