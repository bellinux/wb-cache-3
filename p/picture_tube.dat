5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> of his television set.|$|E
25|$|RCA {{inherited}} American Marconi's {{status as}} a major producer of vacuum tubes, which were branded Radiotron in the United States. Especially after the rise of broadcasting, they were a major profit source for the company. RCA's strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which {{were significantly higher than}} in Europe, where Lee de Forest had allowed a key patent issued to him to lapse. RCA was responsible for creating a series of innovative products, ranging from octal base metal tubes co-developed with General Electric before World War II, to miniaturized Nuvistor tubes used in the tuners of the New Vista series of TV sets. The Nuvistor tubes were a last major vacuum tube innovation, and were meant to compete with the newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the cathode ray tube (CRT) <b>picture</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
500|$|Mike Boone of The Gazette praised Belzer's {{performance}} and the hand-held camera style of photography, adding, [...] "But if your <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> blew Sunday night, you could still listen to an hour of the hippest, funniest dialogue on TV." [...] Not all reviews were positive. Some critics considered the photography style of jump cuts and hand-held camera movement too jarring; some said it made them feel seasick. James Endrst, television columnist for The Hartford Courant, felt the episode was over-hyped and said [...] "seen it, done it, been there before" [...] of the filming techniques otherwise being praised as cutting edge. Endrst, however, praised the performances of Braugher, Belzer, Polito and Secor in particular. Time reviewer Richard Zoglin said the episode had a strong cast and that he appreciated the lack of two-dimensional violence, but said, [...] "the characters are too pat, their conflicts too predictable", particularly the rookie character Bayliss.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} and develop the colour <b>picture</b> <b>tubes</b> with high and super-high resolution. The condition for optimum focusing of the electron beam has been determined, the method for analysis of the paraxial electron trajectories has been proposed and developed, the generalized numerical model of electron flow in the electron-optic system design with super-high resolution and also the complex of programs and alorithms for numerical simulation of the electron-optic systems (EOS) have been developed. EOS for the colour tubes with super-high resolution and increased durability has been developed. The methods of engineering design of the proposed gun have been given. The perspective designs of colour display <b>picture</b> <b>tubes</b> have been tested.

2500|$|Tubes have {{different}} functions, such as cathode ray tubes which create {{a beam of}} electrons for display purposes (such as the television <b>picture</b> <b>tube)</b> in addition to more specialized functions such as electron microscopy and electron beam lithography. X-ray tubes are also vacuum tubes. Phototubes and photomultipliers rely on electron flow through a vacuum, though in those cases electron emission from the cathode depends on energy from photons rather than thermionic emission. Since these sorts of [...] "vacuum tubes" [...] have functions other than electronic amplification and rectification they are described in their own articles.|$|E

5000|$|From 1946 to 1951 the 7JP4 was {{a common}} CRT (<b>Picture</b> <b>Tube</b> or Kinescope) used in lower priced {{televisions}} sold in the United States. These television were popular for portable carry around and small table top sets. These smaller sets were direct view electrostatic deflection designs. This required an extremely large amount of voltage to produce an image across the full display screen. In 1946, RCA influenced manufacturers (with royalty free circuit designs) to move toward electromagnetic deflection type televisions. Electromagnetic deflection uses varying magnetic fields to produce a full screen image. Horizontal and vertical electromagnets are placed at the <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> neck, called the [...] "yoke". This method allowed the image to be viewed on larger screens. The first heavily mass-produced large <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> to use this newer method of deflection was RCA's 10BP4, introduced in 1946. Soon after electrostatic picture tubes and the television electronic design would be completely replaced.|$|E
