5|$|The {{succession}} {{order is}} determined by primogeniture in most European monarchies. Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom now adhere to absolute primogeniture, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne, regardless of gender; Monaco and Spain have the older system of male-preference primogeniture, while Liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture. In 1990, Norway granted absolute primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes <b>precedence</b> {{in the line of}} succession. This was not, however, done retroactively (as, for example, Sweden had done in 1980), meaning that Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway continues to take <b>precedence</b> over his older sister.|$|E

This paper pro-poses and evaluates a number of techniques to better achieve the throughput guarantees in such networks. The proposed techniques consider (a) modifying the transport protocol at the sender, (b) modifying the marking strategies at the marker and (c) modifying the dropping policies at the router. It is shown that these techniques improve the likelihood of achieving the desired throughput guarantees and also improve the service dierentiation...|$|R
