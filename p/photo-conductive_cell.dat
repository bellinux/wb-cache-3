Here {{his name was}} Kyle Griffin, {{a man who was}} sent to jail five years earlier due to one of Lois Lane's articles. Griffin is assisted by a man named Victor (portrayed by Rick Overton) who is skilled at electrical engineering but lacks social graces which explains why the Prankster is the only man who would befriend him. In the first episode titled [...] "The Prankster," [...] Griffin escapes from prison and goes after Lois posing as her secret admirer. The Prankster's comic book identity was referenced when Lois suspected the admirer was an old school acquaintance named Randall Loomis, who's ruled out as a suspect when Lois and Clark learn he's now a wealthy man about to move to Paris with his wife. He then plotted to capture Lois Lane and demonstrated Victor's disintegrator ray on a nearby truck as part of a plot to disintegrate the Daily Planet. While Superman withstood the disintegrating ray in order to save the Daily Planet, Lois breaks free and manages to subdue the Prankster and Victor just as Superman arrives. The Prankster and Victor are later arrested by the authorities. He later returned in [...] "The Return of the Prankster" [...] where Prankster and Victor have escaped from prison. This time, Prankster is joined by his father Edwin Griffin (portrayed by Harold Gould) who was also put away because of a theory that Jimmy had. In Prankster's latest plot, Victor invents a light ray (disguised as a camera) capable of [...] "freezing" [...] people in their place which Prankster used to break out of prison where they froze the guard in the laundry room. Prankster and Victor first use it when they infiltrated Lois' apartment and froze her. Prankster then had Victor switch the device to flash mode in order to take a picture of her with Prankster in it stretching Lois' lips with his fingers. Before the effects of the light ray wore off, Prankster and Victor escape leaving a photo of him and Lois in Lois' hand. While in a condemned building, Prankster and Victor then work to upgrade the light ray to freeze even Superman where he also plans to use the device to kidnap the President (who was visiting Metropolis at the time to present the award for the lowest crime). Victor gives Prankster the <b>photo-conductive</b> <b>cell</b> despite a rat interference and has him pick it up again. With the light ray improved, Prankster and Victor plan to raid the Metropolis Department of Light and Power to obtain a micro lens as Edwin Griffin infiltrates disguised as a painter to get the company's chairman out. While Victor controls all of the lights in the city, Prankster later calls Lois Lane stating that he has an [...] "electrifying story" [...] that he had shut down the airport. When Lois goes to Metropolis Department of Light and Power and finds the workers frozen in place, Prankster was ready for Lois' arrival. Prankster and Victor try to get Lois Lane to say [...] "Help Superman" [...] with Prankster turning up the boiler pressure as Lois is chained up. Superman answers Lois' call as Prankster's device doesn't work on Superman. Prankster flees as Superman frees Lois before the boiler exploded. Prankster later modifies the light ray so that it can freeze Superman. Victor tells Prankster that Lois might have some file on the computer at the Daily Planet. While in their van, Prankster and Victor use the light ray on a piano mover and a woman with a baby carriage as their test subjects with Superman managing to save the woman and her baby before the piano can fall on them. Prankster and Victor then infiltrate the Daily Planet and freeze everyone in place so that Prankster can hack Lois Lane's computer in order to find info on Superman. At their hideout, Prankster and Victor find the information where Superman was temporarily blinded by Dr. Neal Faraday's ultra-violent light beam causing Prankster {{to find a way to}} strengthening the light ray in order to freeze Superman. Upon tapping into the phone lines, Prankster and Victor disguise themselves as waiters in order to freeze Lois Lane. Prankster then calls Clark Kent to tell Superman that he can find him and Lois Lane in the penthouse of Lakeside Tower. When Superman arrives finding Prankster, Victor, and Lois playing Pinochle, Prankster manages to successfully freeze Superman in place and push his frozen body off the balcony where Superman lands on the newsstand. Prankster then pushes Lois off the balcony where Superman moves in time to catch her. Bobby Bigmouth tells Lois and Clark about where Prankster's hideout is where they find a map of the route used by the President's motorcade. Prankster, Victor, and Edwin then block off the motorcade where they use the light ray on their van to freeze Lois and everyone else so that they can kidnap the President. Using special red contact lenses created by Professor Hamilton, Superman manages to hide in the President's limo and fool Prankster and Victor by pretending to be frozen in their place. Prankster is then frozen in place upon his contacts being knocked off. Prankster and Victor are then arrested by the Secret Service as Edwin states that he should have a daughter.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of i. r. {{detection}} is proposed, {{based on the}} change in Planck radiation of a black strip when it is heated by the radiation to be measured. The application of a <b>photo-conductive</b> <b>cell</b> is proposed {{for the detection of}} the Planck radiation which occurs in the near i. r. region at room-temperature. Some informative calculations on the detection limit will be given, showing that the expected results are good when compared with that of bolometers etc...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{so-called}} excess photon noise is theoretically considered {{with regard to}} noise power measurements with a single, illumined photo-emissive or <b>photo-conductive</b> <b>cell.</b> Starting from a modification of Mandel's stochastic association of the emission of photo-electrons with wave intensity, the frequency dependence of the excess noise power with photo-emissive cells is derived in Sect. 2. Use is made of formulas given by Rice for square-law detectors. In Sect. 3 a new hypothesis is introduced in order to calculate the excess photon noise effect with photo-conductive cells, in which the statistics of both the excitation and of the recombination have to be considered. It is shown {{that in the case}} of an ideal photo-conductor in thermodynamic equilibrium with the radiation field the result obtained is consistent with the expected Fermi-statistics for the electron gas. It is shown in Sect. 4 that under certain experimental conditions the excess photon-noise effect is detectable in noise-power measurements with a single photocell. This applies especially to the case of an infra-red sensitive photo-conductive or photo-emissive cell with a quantum-yield near to unity...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a lensless {{compressive}} sensing imaging architecture. The architecture {{consists of two}} components, an aperture assembly and a sensor. No lens is used. The aperture assembly consists of a two dimensional array of aperture elements. The transmittance of each aperture element is independently controllable. The sensor is a single detection element, such as a single <b>photo-conductive</b> <b>cell.</b> Each aperture element together with the sensor defines a cone of a bundle of rays, and the cones of the aperture assembly define the pixels of an image. Each pixel value of an image is {{the integration of the}} bundle of rays in a cone. The sensor is used for taking compressive measurements. Each measurement is the integration of rays in the cones modulated by the transmittance of the aperture elements. A compressive sensing matrix is implemented by adjusting the transmittance of the individual aperture elements according to the values of the sensing matrix. The proposed architecture is simple and reliable because no lens is used. Furthermore, the sharpness of an image from our device is only limited by the resolution of the aperture assembly, but not affected by blurring due to defocus. The architecture can be used for capturing images of visible lights, and other spectra such as infrared, or millimeter waves. Such devices may be used in surveillance applications for detecting anomalies or extracting features such as speed of moving objects. Multiple sensors may be used with a single aperture assembly to capture multi-view images simultaneously. A prototype was built by using a LCD panel and a photoelectric sensor for capturing images of visible spectrum. Comment: 12 pages, 13 figure...|$|E
