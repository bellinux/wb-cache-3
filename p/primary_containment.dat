40|$|The SPES 3 {{facility}} {{is being built}} at the SIET laboratories, {{in the frame of}} an R&D program on Nuclear Fission, led by ENEA and funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The {{facility is}} based on the IRIS reactor design, an advanced medium size, integral layout, pressurized water reactor, based on the proven technology of PWR with an innovative configuration and safety features suitable to cope with Loss of Coolant Accidents through a dynamic coupling of the <b>primary</b> and <b>containment</b> systems. SPES 3 is suitable to test the plant response to postulated Design and Beyond Design Basis Events, providing experimental data for code validation and plant safety analysis. It reproduces the <b>primary,</b> secondary and <b>containment</b> systems of the reactor with 1 : 100 volume scale, full elevation, prototypical fluid and thermal-hydraulic conditions. A design-calculation feedback process, based on the comparison between IRIS and SPES 3 simulations, performed respectively by FER, with GOTHIC and RELAP 5 coupled codes, and by SIET, with RELAP 5 code, led to reduce the differences in the two plants behaviour, versus a 2 -inch equivalent DVI line DEG break, considered the most challenging LOCA for the IRIS plant. Once available the final design of SPES 3, further calculations were performed to investigate Beyond Design Basis Events, where the intervention of the Passive Containment Condenser is fundamental for the accident recovery. Sensitivity analyses showed the importance of the PCC actuation time, to limit the containment pressure, to reach an early pressure equalization between the <b>primary</b> and <b>containment</b> systems and to allow passive water transfer from the containment to the RPV, enhanced by the ADS Stage-II opening...|$|R

40|$|One of {{two major}} {{facilities}} used for plutonium fuels research and development studies at Battelle-Northwest is the Plutonium Fuels Laboratory (PFL).

Air samples, taken throughout the facility, are constantly being monitored for free contamination. Personnel exposure caused by X, gamma, and neutron radiation has been primarily omitted by inspiring good work habits and housekeeping practices in personnel (i. e., uncontrolled accumulations of plutonium are avoided, plutonium is confined as much as possible, exposure times are limited, and shielding equipment is used whenever necessary).

25|$|In {{the morning}} of 18 July 2013 at 8:20a.m. (2320 GMT) small amounts of steam escaped from the reactor building. Video images made by a subcontractor, filming the {{destroyed}} building and preparing to remove rubble from the place, showed some vapors rising, but it was unclear where it came from. Although there was {{no change in the}} afternoon, TEPCO said that radiation levels did not change, and the reactor was still cooled.

25|$|On 26 and 27 March 2012 {{the inside}} of the {{containment}} vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with a 20 meter long endoscope.

The radiation level measured was 72.9 Sievert per hour. Because of this, the endoscope could only function a few hours at this place. For reactors number 1 and 3, no endoscopic survey was planned at that time, because the actual radiation levels at these places were too high for humans.|$|E

After that, refill would have been required to the isolation condenser tanks which are under atmospheric pressure (low pumping head requirements).

25|$|On 19 January 2012 the {{interior}} of the <b>primary</b> <b>containment</b> vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with an industrial endoscope.

The device was brought in by a hole at 2.5 meter above the floor where the vessel is located. The whole procedure lasted 70 minutes. The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the containment vessel. But they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside.

40|$|Gag-specific {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes (CTLs) exert strong suppressive {{pressure on}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication. However, it has remained unclear whether they can actually contain primary viral replication. Recent trials of prophylactic vaccines inducing virus-specific T-cell responses have indicated their potential to confer resistance against primary SIV replication in rhesus macaques, while the immunological determinant for this vaccine-based viral control has not been elucidated thus far. Here we present evidence implicating Gag-specific CTLs as responsible for the vaccine-based primary SIV control. Prophylactic vaccination using a Gag-expressing Sendai virus vector resulted in containment of SIVmac 239 challenge in all rhesus macaques possessing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype 90 - 120 -Ia. In contrast, 90 - 120 -Ia-positive vaccinees failed to contain SIVs carrying multiple gag CTL escape mutations that had been selected, {{at the cost of}} viral fitness, in SIVmac 239 -infected 90 - 120 -Ia-positive macaques. These results show that Gag-specific CTL responses do {{play a crucial role in}} the control of wild-type SIVmac 239 replication in vaccinees. This study implies the possibility of Gag-specific CTL-based <b>primary</b> HIV <b>containment</b> by prophylactic vaccination, although it also suggests that CTL-based AIDS vaccine efficacy may be abrogated in viral transmission between MHC-matched individuals...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. -Japan Security Alliance was the {{foundation}} of the United States' bilateral alliance system during the Cold War. The alliance suffered severe strains {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Cold War primarily due to the loss of its <b>primary</b> mission, <b>containment</b> of Soviet expansion. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 breathed new life into the alliance. Japan quickly joined in the anti-terrorism coalition, providing logistical support to U.

North Korea's October 2002 admission of a covert nuclear weapons program also changed the strategic dynamic for Japan, pushing it towards "normal" nation status. Multilateralism in Asia developed a life of its own during the 1990 's. Numerous multilateral organizations were created to help resolve regional security issues.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the propulsive requirements {{necessary to maintain}} the relative positions of satellites orbiting in a local cluster. Formation of these large baseline arrays could allow high resolution imaging of terrestrial or astronomical targets using techniques {{similar to those used}} for decades in radio interferometry. A key factor in the image quality is the relative positions of the individual apertures in the sparse array. The relative positions of satellites in a cluster are altered by “tidal ” accelerations which are a function of the cluster baseline and orbit altitude. These accelerations must be counteracted by continuous thrusting to maintain the relative positions of the satellites. Analysis of propulsive system requirements, limited by spacecraft power, volume, and mass constraints, indicates that specific impulses and efficiencies typical of ion engines or Hall thrusters (SPT’s) are necessary to maintain large cluster baselines. In addition, required thrust to spacecraft mass ratios for reasonable size clusters are approximately 15 µN/kg. Finally, the ability of a proposed linear ion microthruster to meet these requirements is examined. A variation of Brophy’s method is used to show that <b>primary</b> electron <b>containment</b> lengths on the order of 10 mm are necessary to achieve those thruster characteristics. Preliminary sizing of the linear ion microthruster is given. Nomenclature Ac = thruster chamber area, m 2 b = filled aperture characteristic dimensio...|$|R

[...] The Fukushima prefectural government reported radiation dose rates at the plant reaching 1.015 mSv/h. The IAEA stated on 13 March that four workers had been injured by the explosion at the Unit 1 reactor, and that three injuries were reported in other incidents at the site.

The exact dose rate remains unknown as the technicians fled the place after their first measurement went off-scale. Additional basement and trench-area measurements indicated 60mSv/h in unit 1, [...] "over 1000"mSv/h in unit 2, and 750mSv/h in unit 3. The report indicated the main source was iodine-134 with a half-life of less than an hour, which resulted in a radioactive iodine concentration 10million times the normal value in the reactor. TEPCO later retracted its report, stating that the measurements were inaccurate and attributed the error to comparing the isotope responsible, iodine-134, to normal levels of another isotope. Measurements were then corrected, stating that the iodine levels were 100,000 times the normal level.
