40|$|This thesis has {{analyzed}} {{the roles of}} meet personnel responsible {{for the conduct of}} a collegiate style wrestling tournament. The personnel considered were the meet director, matchmaker, announcer, <b>head</b> <b>scorer,</b> assistant to the <b>head</b> <b>scorer,</b> individual statistics recorder, timekeeper, assistant timekeeper, match scorer, assistant match <b>scorer,</b> referee, <b>head</b> referee, and judge. The data were gathered through library research and collated into job descriptions. An analysis of the official rules of collegiate wrestling provided the edited rules section for each of the meet personnel. The findings of the study were presented in handbook form with each section providing a separate job description. The job descriptions were further organized into six areas of personnel function. The qualifications, location, assistants, equipment, duties, and governing rules of each official were reported. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
50|$|After the {{successful}} 2001-02 season, {{six of the}} ten leading <b>scorers</b> and <b>head</b> coach Kari Eloranta left the team. His replacement was his former assistant coach, Petteri Hirvonen. The following season 2002-03 saw {{a turn for the}} worse as the Pelicans finished second-to-last with 36 points, seven points ahead of bottom-placed Ilves.|$|R
50|$|Strnad {{signed for}} FC Graffin Vlašim on a one-year loan deal from Baník Ostrava {{in the summer}} of 2010, a year later signing for Vlašim {{permanently}} {{in the summer of}} 2011. Despite finishing the autumn part of the 2011-12 Czech 2. Liga as top <b>scorer,</b> Strnad <b>headed</b> to Sokolov on a six-month loan deal in January 2012.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} {{official}} game, the USA was matched up against Argentina. The USA team turned the ball over on each of their first three possessions, but then settled down and beat Argentina convincingly, 91–32. All USA players scored, while Bria Hartley, Kayla McBride, Chiney Ogwumike and Stephanie Dolson were all double-digits <b>scorers.</b> <b>Head</b> Coach Jennifer Rizzotti {{was pleased with the}} overall effort, other than the first minute of play. In the second game, the USA played the team from Brazil. Ogwumike again was the leading scorer with 15 points, all in the first half. Bria Hartley added 14 points, while Alexis Jones and Kayla McBride were also double-digit scorers. The USA team started out strong, with Hartley scoring eight points as part of a 13–2 run. The team was 15 of 17 from the free throw line, setting a USA FIBA Americas U18 Championship for Women record.|$|R
50|$|In {{a weekend}} series versus St. Cloud State on January 6 and 7, 2012, Spooner had a record-breaking weekend. She scored three goals and added one assist in a two-game set while {{becoming}} the Buckeyes all-time leading goal <b>scorer.</b> <b>Heading</b> into the series, {{she was only}} three goals away from breaking the school record of 86 set by forward Jeni Creary. She tied the mark on January 6, 2012, as she scored both goals including the game-winner. In addition, she was acknowledged as the First Star of the Game in a 2-0 win. The following day, she set the record at 5:27 of the third period versus St. Cloud State in a 4-3 loss. Spooner was named Third Star of the Game. After the game, Spooner had accumulated 140 career points (87 goals, 53 assists) to rank fourth in that category. She was now six points shy of breaking the Buckeyes all-time scoring record.|$|R
50|$|On 20 August, Everton {{began their}} {{season with a}} 1-0 win over last year's runners-up Manchester United. Marouane Fellaini was the <b>scorer,</b> with a <b>headed</b> goal in the 57th minute. This {{was the first time}} in five years that Everton had won their opening league game.|$|R
50|$|The 'Royals,' as {{they are}} fondly {{referred}} to by fans, secured their third successive Shillong Premier League title, which is a new record. The final was won 3-1 against Rangdajied United F.C. who fielded their first side including Babatunde, Jeribe, Enyinnaya and Argha. In the match, the scores were locked at 1-1 after regulation time with Beekay being RWFC's lone goal <b>scorer.</b> Babatunde <b>headed</b> in an equaliser {{in the second half}} to put his side in contention. However, it was the extra time goals by Chencho and Milancy that did it for the 'Royals' and in the process, hand them their third successive finals win.|$|R
40|$|The {{data from}} 36 XB- 70 flights {{conducted}} over the mountainous {{regions of the}} western United States together with rawinsonde data were used to investigate relationships between conditions favorable for mountain waves and clear air turbulence. <b>Profiles</b> for the <b>Scorer</b> parameter and the gradient Richardson number were evaluated from the rawinsonde data. The Scorer parameter and the gradient Richardson number profiles were computed on those days when the XB- 70 flew, and these results compared to model profiles and related to the reported turbulence. Ascent rate profiles of rawinsonde balloons were analyzed from which the presence of mountain or lee waves was inferred...|$|R
5000|$|Vieri was a complete, quick, {{prolific}} and opportunistic striker, with a keen eye for goal. Due to his notable goal-scoring prowess, Vieri {{is regarded}} by pundits {{as one of}} the greatest Italian strikers of all time and one of the top strikers of his generation. In his prime, his unique and direct offensive style of play, which blended power with pace and a solid technique, led him to be compared to Luigi Riva and Roberto Boninsegna, as well as earning him the nickname of [...] "Il Toro" [...] ("The Bull"). Despite his goalscoring ability, he was also injury prone throughout his career, however, which greatly affected his pace, fitness and mobility in later years. Vieri was predominantly left-footed, although he was capable of scoring with both feet, as well as with his head, and from volleys. He has often been described as a large, old fashioned centre forward, due to his powerful physical presence and outstanding aerial ability; he is the all-time top <b>scorer</b> of <b>headed</b> goals in Italian league history. Despite being primarily a goal-scoring striker, he was also capable of providing assists to teammates, which was aided by his ability to use his strength to hold up the ball and play with his back to goal in order to participate in the build-up of attacking plays. Although he was primarily a goal-area threat, Vieri had an accurate and powerful shot from distance as well as inside the area; he was also an accurate penalty taker.|$|R
40|$|An ERS 1 {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) image of the island Hopen shows a distinct 7. 6 -km wavelength wave phenomenon near the island. This wave phenomenon is interpreted as the surface imprint on open water of atmospheric lee waves. The pattern is visible in the SAR image, since the lee waves modulate the horizontal wind speed near the ocean surface which, in turn, modulates the surface roughness and the radar cross section. The physical setting for the observation is presented and discussed. The lower bound on horizontal wind speed modulation is estimated to range from 3 ± 2 ms− 1 (for the wind speed minima) to 12 ± 2 ms− 1 (for the wind speed maxima) based upon the observed radar cross-section modulation and the ERS 1 scatterometer wind retrieval model CMOD 4. The wavelength and wind speed modulation are consistent with linear lee wave model predications. The model uses an atmosphere with an exponential <b>profile</b> of the <b>Scorer</b> parameter (ratio of buoyancy frequency to wind speed) to represent a shallow, ground-based inversion layer observed at Bear Island and a bell-shaped barrier to represent the forcing effects of Hopen...|$|R
50|$|In {{front of}} a Kansas City record 52,424 fans the Wizards beat English Superclub Manchester United. Peter Vermes kept the same {{starting}} eleven who had sparked the recent good form and it paid dividends immediately as the Wizards pressured high and got stuck in versus the Red Devils. In just the eleventh minute the home side would push ahead as Davy Arnaud was kept onsides by a lazy and slow moving Rafael and he easily tallied past backup Ben Amos. Like {{they had in the}} opening moments the club would keep creating serious chances throughout the first half with Teal Bunbury, Kei Kamara, and Englishman Ryan Smith all having good goes of it. While the Wizards were creating chances United was countering with only half chances until Jimmy Nielsen stopped a point blank attempt with his belly and the Wizards were forced onto their back foot, which is where they found themselves in the 39th minute when Ryan Giggs slipped Dimitar Berbatov between the KC centerbacks. Jimmy Conrad found himself a full step behind and {{on the wrong side of}} the Bulgarian striker but still made a play for the ball, he got man instead and the penalty was given by American Referee Terry Vaughn- who also gave Conrad an ejection. Berbatov's hesitation step sent Nielsen diving the wrong direction and he easily equalized the exhibition match. Just one minute later Kansas City's leading assist maker Smith crossed a corner into and off of leading <b>scorer</b> Kamara's <b>head</b> that gave the now ten man home side the lead once again. Manchester United fought for the equalizer playing all their starters until the 68th minute and Alex Ferguson decided to even keep playing Giggs and fellow Red Devil legend Paul Scholes the full 90 minutes but the Major League Soccer outfit held their lines and won the match 2-1.|$|R
40|$|Leaky trapped {{mountain}} lee {{waves are}} investigated {{by examining the}} structure of individual linear modes in multilayer atmospheres. When the static stability and cross-mountain wind speed are constant in the topmost unbounded layer,modes that decay exponentially downstream also grow exponentially with height. This growth with height occurs because packets containing relatively large-amplitude waves follow ray paths through the stratosphere, placing them above packets entering the stratosphere farther downstream that contain relatively low-amplitude waves. Nevertheless, if the trapped wave train is generated by a compact source, all waves disappear above some line parallel to the group velocity that passes just above the source region. The rate of downstream decay due to leakage into the stratosphere {{is strongly dependent on}} the atmo-spheric structure. Downstream dissipation is often significant under realistic atmospheric conditions, which typically include elevated inversions and strong upper-tropospheric winds. On the other hand, idealized <b>profiles</b> with constant <b>Scorer</b> parameters throughout each of two tropospheric layers can exhibit a wide range of behaviors when capped by a third stratospheric layer with typical real-world static stability. Assuming the Scorer parameter in the stratosphere is a little larger than the minimum value necessary to allow a particular mode to propagate vertically, the rate of downstream decay is more sensitive to changes in the height of the tropopause than to further increases in the stability of the stratosphere. Downstream decay isminimizedwhen the tropopause is high and the horizontal wavelength is short. 1...|$|R

50|$|Prague was {{the home}} of many Australian and ex-European {{representative}} footballers throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Prague {{was instrumental in the}} strengthening of Australian football throughout its time, and had strong player and coaching links with the Australia national football (soccer) team.In 1950 V J (Jimmy) Chalwin came across a number of Czech boys playing soccer at Rushcutters Bay and ended up playing regularly with them every Sunday afternoon. After a few weeks Jerry Vilimek asked Jimmy Chalwin if he thought they could form a team and enter a competition. On J. Chalwin’s initiative a first meeting was held at the Y.M.C.A. and shortly afterwards the Sydney Football Club Prague was formed and two teams were nominated to play in the N.S.W. Metropolitan League. The first general meeting was held in the Premier Restaurant, Kings Cross, and J. Vilimek was elected President; J. Chalwin, Vice-President; V. Profanta, Secretary; J. Baca, Treasurer and W.R. Ball Public Relations Officer. Mr Stan Slavik who provided the first boots, Jerseys and balls was made Patron of the Club.In its first year they almost finished as premiers, being beaten in the final. In 1952 the Club won its first trophy, the Metropolitan Cup and in 1953 they won the Metropolitan League. One of its most notable players was Milos Muller who was a prolific goal <b>scorer</b> and <b>headed</b> the goal-scoring list year after year. He scored a total of 378 goals for his Club and in 1955 scored 55 goals. Milos Muller was Prague’s first Australian International when he as a centre-forward was chosen to play in the Australian team to play South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground in September 1955.From 1951-1953 S.F.C. Prague was basically an all Czech team which included players such as M. Muller, K. Lender, O. Toula, P.Janovsky, V.Vohanka, J Horinek, F. Dubai and J. Polivka. Also in 1953 the Committee was enlarged and Mr K. Rodny became President; Mr Garden, Vice-President; J. Bruna, V. Sarka, Z. Hofer, O. Pick and J. Prazak also joined. Finally in 1955, Prague, after winning the Metropolitan League twice, was promoted to the Southern League, and won it outright by beating Sydney Austral in the final. Prague’s first year in the State League was rather disappointing as the team finished {{near the bottom of the}} competition although most games were lost by an odd goal. Despite this, the team was enjoying the reputation of being the fairest team in the competition and playing the continental short passing game.In January 1957 Prague, became one of the foundation clubs of the N.S.W. Federation, rebuilt the team, released many players to nearer clubs (without any transfer fees), signed new players such as R. Lord, K.Hiron, E. Schwartz. Also new players like L. Scheinflug and G. Geddes combined well with the rest of the team, where old-timers Muller and Toula still played. Prague gained notable victories against strong clubs like Canterbury, Gladesville and finished the season near the top of the table.In March 1958 Austrian Internationals Leopold Baumgartner and Karl Jaros joined Prague and later they were followed by Andy Saghi, Erich Schwartz, Walter Tamandl, Herbert and Erwin Ninaus.|$|R
