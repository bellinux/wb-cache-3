40|$|Cars {{are being}} sold more than ever. Developing {{countries}} adopt the lease culture instead of buying a new car due to affordability. Therefore, the rise <b>of</b> used <b>cars</b> sales is exponentially increasing. Car sellers sometimes {{take advantage of this}} scenario by listing unrealistic prices owing to the demand. Therefore, arises a need for a model that can assign a price for a vehicle by evaluating its features taking the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> other <b>cars</b> into consideration. In this paper, we use supervised learning method namely Random Forest to predict the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> used <b>cars.</b> The model has been chosen after careful exploratory data analysis to determine the impact of each feature on price. A Random Forest with 500 Decision Trees were created to train the data. From experimental results, the training accuracy was found out to be 95. 82 %, and the testing accuracy was 83. 63 %. The the model can predict the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> accurately by choosing the most correlated features. Comment: FICC Camera Read...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{definitive}} version is available at: [URL] pricing transport behavior {{to take account}} of the ‘external’ costs such as congestion, emissions and congestion imposed on society by excessive car use has long been a tenet of effective Transportation Demand Management. But while policy makers have striven to increase public transport subsidies, raise petrol taxes, and introduce road user charging schemes to change the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> travel, the wider influences of the personal tax regime has had relatively little attention. This paper is a review of reforms to the personal tax regime to favor more environmentally benign forms of travel and, in particular, to encourage employers to take part in TDM-type programs. The results reported are based on work undertaken for the UK Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions, and the Inland Revenue. In addition to reporting the British situation, it also outlines how this same process has been approached in the United States, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway, and at how successful they have been thus far with respect to TDM objectives. It then draws conclusions as to which direction policy makers could aim for the future...|$|E

Suppose that the initial <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> is represented by P1 with a quantity demanded of Q1. If the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> petrol were to decrease by some amount, this would result in a higher quantity <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> demanded.

First, holding car prices fixed, we find that a higher fuel tax leads {{households}} to choose <b>cars</b> <b>of</b> better fuel efficiency, provided that the demand for car use is inelastic. Surprisingly, a higher kilometre tax reduces the demand for fuel efficiency. Next, we study how car prices react to the tax changes. Fuel taxes make owning very fuel-efficient cars more expensive, while reducing <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> <b>of</b> low fuel efficiency. Both fuel taxes and kilometre charges imply lower prices for large and powerful cars...|$|R

50|$|While {{the company}} {{originally}} focused on short-term, hourly car rentals, over time, {{the majority of}} its growth was driven by longer duration rentals of 1 day or more. In 2013, RelayRides acquired Wheelz, one of its competitors, and discontinued support for hourly <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> rentals, turning its focus to long duration rentals. The average rental for the company is now more than five days. It started targeting travelers when it piloted the option to search by airport in 2013 and launched a delivery option in 2014 (the owner <b>of</b> the <b>car</b> drives it to a pick-up point).|$|R

Along with Pajero Sport, it also assembles Tata Motors buses and mini trucks, Ashok Leyland minibuses.

5000|$|Consumer {{preference}} for local goods gives local producers more market power, affording them {{the ability to}} lift prices to extract greater profits. Firms that produce locally produced goods can charge a premium for that good. Consumers who favor products by local producers may end up being exploited by profit-maximizing local producers. [...] For example; a protectionist policy in America placed tariffs on foreign cars, giving local producers (Ford and GM market) market power {{that allowed them to}} raise the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars,</b> which negatively affected American consumers who faced fewer choices and higher prices.|$|R
40|$|Buying {{and selling}} cars is a {{transaction}} frequently found in everyday life.

50|$|As the F3DM nearly doubles the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> {{that run}} on {{conventional}} fuel, BYD expects subsidies from the local government to make the plug-in affordable to personal buyers. Similar subsidies are expected in other cities. On June 1, 2010, the Chinese government announced a trial program to provide incentives to carmakers up to 50,000 yuan (~US$7,320) for plug-in hybrids that will benefit residents in five cities: Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Hefei and Changchun. After the plug-in subsidy is discounted from the F3DM cost, its sales price would be still almost US$5,900 higher than the gasoline-powered F3 model.|$|R
5000|$|International sanctions, high inflation, {{exacerbated}} by fuel price hikes, and dampened consumer demand have depressed {{growth in the}} passenger car segment, but industrial growth coupled with infrastructural development is spurring demand in the commercial vehicles segment. The sanctions have also created difficulties for the imports of spare parts and increased the cost for car manufacturers. To make matters worse, the factory sale <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars,</b> which are set by the government every year, have changed very little since 2006. Experts also believe that the removal of subsidies {{is likely to have}} an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector until 2013.|$|R
