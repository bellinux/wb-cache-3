BACKGROUND: In the late 1970 s, the staff identified an issue concerning the integrity of embrittled pressurized water reactor (PWR) pressure vessels that involved a rapid cooldown of the inside wall of the vessel, accompanied by either sustained high reactor coolant system pressure or a subsequent repressurization of the system. The identification of this issue, termed <b>pressurized</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> (PTS), resulted {{in the development of}} a proposed rule. This proposed rule was provided to the Commission in SECY- 82 - 465 (<b>Pressurized</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>Shock)</b> and received subsequent Commission approval. The <b>Pressurized</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>Shock</b> Rule, 10 CFR 50. 61, was established in 1983 as an adequate protection rule. The rule included a specified numerical value of a materials parameter (RT PTS) which would be used as a screening criterion, above which licensees would be required to demonstrate that their pressure vessels could be operated safely (Section 2 of the attachment summarizes key elements of the rule). RT PTS is a measure of the material toughness of the vessel at the end of its licensed life and the ability of the vessel materials to withstand a PTS event. The screening criterion (i. e., acceptable value of RTPTS) was set, in part, based on judgements regarding what frequency of vessel failure due to PTS was acceptable. The frequency of a through-wall crack, which was taken to be equivalent to reacto...|$|E

This paper describes calculations which were performed with the ANSYS CFD software for emergency core cooling injection into one loop at single-phase flow conditions. Following the OECD-/NEA CFD Best Practice Guidelines (Mahaffy, 2007) the influence of grid resolution, discretisation schemes, and turbulence models (Shear Stress Transport and Reynolds Stress Model) on the mixing in the cold leg were investigated.

Due to the conservative assumptions, the results of the precalculation lay on the safe side; this was intended as these results served, among other aspects, as the basi s for the experimental boundary condition.

40|$|AbstractThe {{integrity}} of a {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) related to <b>pressurized</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> (PTSs) has been extensively studied. This paper introduces an integrity assessment of an RPV subjected to a PTS transient based on the French codes. In the USA, the “screening criterion” for maximum allowable embrittlement of RPV material is developed based on the probabilistic fracture mechanics. However, in the French RCC-M and RSE-M codes, which are developed based on the deterministic fracture mechanics, there is no “screening criterion”. In this paper, the methodology in the RCC-M and RSE-M codes, which are used for PTS analysis, are firstly discussed. The bases of the French codes are compared with ASME and FAVOR codes. A case study is also presented. The {{results show that the}} method in the RCC-M code that accounts for the influence of cladding on the stress intensity factor (SIF) may be nonconservative. The SIF almost doubles if the weld residual stress is considered. The approaches included in the codes differ in many aspects, which may result in significant differences in the assessment results.

40|$|AbstractTransferability of {{fracture}} toughness data obtained on small scale specimens to a full-scale cracked structure {{is one of}} the key issues in integrity assessment of engineering structures. In order to transfer {{fracture toughness}} under different constraints, both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint effect should be considered for the specimens and structures. In this paper both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint effects of a crack in a reference reactor pressure vessel (RPV) subjected to <b>pressurized</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> (PTSs) are analyzed by two-parameter and three-parameter methods. The comparison between elastic and elastic–plastic analysis shows that the constraint effect varies with the material property. T 11 (the second term of William’s extension acting parallel to the crack plane) generally displays a reversed relation to the stress intensity factor (SIF) with the transient time, which indicates that the loading (SIF) plays an important role on the in-plane constraint effect. The thickness at the crack tip contributes more than the loading to the out-of-plane constraint, such that T 33 (the second term of William’s extension acting along the thickness) displays a similar relation to ε 33 (strain along the thickness direction) and a different relation to T 11 during the transient. The results demonstrate that both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint effect should be analyzed separately in order to describe precisely the stress distribution ahead of the crack tip...|$|R

These are important flow phenomena relevant for <b>pressurized</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> (PTS). The experimental data for assessing {{the accuracy of the}} CFD results have been obtained in the LAOKOON test facility of Technische Universität München. Computational results have been obtained with the NEPTUNE_CFD and ANSYS CFX CFD codes. Co- and counter current flows with energy and mass transfer at the free surface have been simulated. The mathematical models used in the calculations are based on the Euler-Euler two-fluid model concept. The ANSYS CFX study investigated mainly the influence of two-phase flow model parameters, like interfacial length scales and interfacial heat transfer coefficients. The influence of using a homogeneous two-phase model versus a full two-fluid model was also examined. The NEPTUNE_CFD calculations were run with more advanced models for the interfacial drag coefficient and interfacial energy transfer. For instance, the interfacial energy transfer models were based on the surface renewal theory, and different approaches to calculate the interfacial area density were studied. Both CFD codes showed qualitative agreement with the data, but tend to under-predict the temperature in the water layer which is an important quantity to assess the effects of PTS. Unfortunately the LAOKOON data are not very detailed regarding inlet and outlet boundary condition, which makes a more thorough investigation of the discrepancies between predictions and data difficult...|$|R

The research project consisted of PTS pilot analyses for three PWRs: Oconee Unit 1, designed by Babcock and Wilcox; Calvert Cliffs Unit 1, designed by Combustion Engineering; and H. B.

The primary objectives of the IPTS studies were (1) to provide {{for each of the three}} plants an estimate of the probability of a crack propagating through the wall of a reactor pressure vessel (RPV) due to PTS; (2) to determine the dominant overcooling sequences, plant features, and operator actions and the uncertainty in the plant risk due to PTS; and (3) to evaluate the effectiveness of potential corrective actions. The NRC is currently evaluating the possibility of revising current PTS regulatory guidance. Technical bases must be developed to support any revisions.

For the Sn–Ag solder, a fine rod-like Ag 3 Sn intermetallic was formed in the solder matrix after the <b>thermal</b> <b>shock.</b> On the other hand, Bi-rich and Sn-rich phases appeared in the Sn–Bi solder after the 25 to 125 C <b>thermal</b> <b>shock.</b> Moreover, fine cracks were observed along the Bi-rich grain-like phase boundary.

In addition, the thickness of intermetallic compound (IMC) of three solder alloys gradually grew {{with the number of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> cycles.

Controlled isothermal crack propagation experiments with macroscopic and microscopic observation are based on wedge splitting and compact tension test. To determine the resistance against crack propagation as an estimation of the potential <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> damage analytical relations have been applied. The <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> experiments focused on upard mode <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> via electron beam tests facilities. Due to the very fast (ms) upward mode <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> in vacuum in contrast to conventional <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> in air or water effects related to chemical interactions can be excluded. Due to a dependency on the sample size only carbon-free, alumina-based refractories were investigated. The influence due to the addition of zirconia and titania is shown. <b>Thermal</b> <b>shock</b> experiments with electron beam were mainly performed on carbon-containing refractories, since carbon-free refractories tended to electrical charging. For the investigated carbon-containing refractories the <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> damage is shown in dependence of different parameters (duration, number) ...|$|R
