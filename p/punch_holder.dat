40|$|Abstract: The Die itself needs a {{well-defined}} process while being {{transformed from a}} stock of material or while it is being assembled {{with the help of}} standard components. The varied elements of a die ranging from the standard Die set, the dieblock, the punch plate with the <b>punch</b> <b>holder,</b> compression springs and the other elements necessary for assembling the die calls for a make-or-buy decision. While standard parts are preferred to be bought out, the components to be manufactured in-house necessitates an elaborate `Process Plan ’ for yielding the most economic die with the prescribed specs for quality Sheet-metal die is an inseparable constituent of the development process of any given automotive or consumer appliance. In most of the cases, this accounts for a high proportion in the tooling needs of the large size and structural member in any automotive like the chassis and the BIW. Many other brackets and gussets along with peripheral clips etc are invariably made of Sheet-metal due to the strength characteristics complimented by this material and the process of stamping. Process planning is responsible for the conversion of design data to work instructions through the specification of the process parameters to be used as well as those machines capable of performing these processes in order to convert the piece part from its initial state to final form. The output of the planning includes the specification of machine and tooling to be used, the sequence of operations, machining parameters, and time estimates. Doing all this with computer-aided assistance is called computer-aided process planning (CAPP). CAPP uses computer software to determine how a part is t...|$|E

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} a {{punching}} process using the ABAQUS/Explicit FE- code. A damage model based on equivalent plastic strain {{has been used to}} describe crack initiation and propagation in the blank. An axisymmetric model created in ABAQUS/CAE was used throughout the study. The model consists of a <b>punch,</b> blank <b>holder,</b> die and blank. In this work the <b>punch,</b> blank <b>holder</b> and die are modelled as rigid bodies while the blank is considered elastic-plastic. The materials used in simulations are DC 04, Docol 350 YP, Docol 800 DP and DC 1400 M. This selection of steel qualities has a wide span in mechanical properties and fields of application. Material characterisation for simulation purposes has been done by conducting uniaxial tensile tests. The data from these tests have been extrapolated beyond the necking strain by double Voce extrapolation. Punching experiments have been performed in an excenter driven press equipped with position and force measurement devices. The experiments result in load curves for the different steel qualities and gives information about the characteristic zones of the sheet edges. The results from simulations have been evaluated by comparisons with experiments concerning load curves, characteristic zones of the sheet edge, work done during the operation, maximum forces and stroke to failure. A good compliance with experiments was found concerning maximum forces, characteristic zones and work done during the operation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{sheet metal}} industries, {{the ability to}} predict and avoid failures, such as necking, {{fracture}} and wrinkling are of great importance. It is important {{to work within the}} safe strain region to avoid these failures. The forming limit diagram (FLD) is the most appropriate tool to obtain the safe strain region for every sheet metal in different strain conditions and ration. In this paper, significance of important process parameters namely, <b>punch</b> speed, blank <b>holder</b> pressure (BHP) and temperature on FLD of a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy are investigated. Taguchi technique was employed to identify the influence of these parameters on major strain and minor strain. The finite element model of deep drawing process has been built up and analyzed using Dynaform version 5. 6. 1 with LS-Dyna version 971 as solver. The simulations have been performed in Taguchi order to obtain the values of major strain and minor strain. Furthermore, the values of major and minor strain is predicted using artificial neural network (ANN) considering input parameters as <b>punch</b> speed, blank <b>holder</b> pressure (BHP) and temperature and normalized distance of a cup.

40|$|Abstract. Flexible forming {{technology}} provides significant application {{potential in}} the manufacturing of complex shaped components even at miniaturized levels. The most attractive characteristic of this technology is simplicity, and its feasibility for prototype processes and low-volume production. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to clarify the decisive characteristics of micro deep drawing of metallic foils by using flexible forming technology. In this work a new technique is adopted using rigid <b>punch,</b> rigid <b>holder</b> and rubber pad, so that a particular gap is allocated between the blank holder and a fixed plate to allow the rubber pad to expand through it. The key process parameters studied here are rubber hardness, rubber-pad dimensions, drawing velocity, and initial gap value. Stainless steel 304 foils are used with thickness of 0. 1 mm. To investigate the effect of soft material properties, urethane rubber with hardness of 20, 40 and 60 shore A is utilized. Also, the punch diameter used in this study is 4 mm. Moreover, many drawing experiments are conducted with punch velocities range of (0. 1 mm/s- 100 mm/s) to show the effect of process velocity. FEA using the commercial software ABAQUS/Standard is used to simulate the drawing process at micro scale.

40|$|Abstract—The {{plastic forming}} process of sheet plate takes an {{important}} place in forming metals. The traditional techniques of tool design for sheet forming operations {{used in industry}} are experimental and expensive methods. Prediction of the forming results, determination of the <b>punching</b> force, blank <b>holder</b> forces and the thickness distribution of the sheet metal will decrease the production cost and time of the material to be formed.

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} meso-scale (100 µm to mm) punching of multiple holes of intricate shapes in metals. Analytical modeling, finite element (FE) simulation, and experimentations are used in this work. Two dimensional FE simulations in ABAQUS were done with an assumed material modeling and plane-strain condition. A known analytical model was used and compared with the ABAQUS simulation results to understand the effects of clearance between the punch and the die. FE simulation in ABAQUS was done for different clearances and corner radii at <b>punch,</b> die, and <b>holder.</b> A set of punches and dies were used to punch out a miniature spring-steel gripper. Comparison of compliant grippers manufactured by wire-cut electro discharge machining (EDM) and punching shows that realizing sharp interior and re-entrant corners by punching {{is not easy to}} achieve. Punching of circular holes with 5 mm and 2. 5 mm diameter is achieved. The possibility of realizing meso-scale parts with complicated shapes through punching is demonstrated in this work; and some strategies are suggested for improvement...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{aluminum}} alloy has tended to increase for building lightweight automobiles to reduce their automotive weight, which is helpful to save energy and protect the environment. In order to join aluminum alloy, a flat-clinching process combined with material forming technology was investigated to join aluminum alloy sheets using an experimental and a numerical method. Al 1060 {{was chosen as the}} material of the sheet, and DEFORM- 2 D software was used to build the numerical model. After the numerical model was validated by the experimental results, the influences of <b>punch</b> diameter and <b>holder</b> force on the materials deforming behavior of the clinched joint were analyzed using the numerical model. Then, the material flow, joining ability, and joining quality were investigated to assess the clinched joint. The results showed that an increase in punch diameter could give rise to an increase in neck thickness and interlocking length, while an increase in blank holder force induced a decrease in interlocking length and an increase in neck thickness. The joining quality could be increased by increasing the forming force. It can be concluded that a clinched joint has better joining quality for joining light-weight sheets onto automotive structures...|$|R
40|$|Thermoforming {{simulations}} are {{an essential}} part in engineering design of components made of Continuous Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) with thermoplastic matrix known as Organic Sheets (OS). Through the simulations, the post-deformed fiber orientation can be calculated, which {{is essential for the}} determination of the mechanical properties of the component. Furthermore, draping problems can be detected, which may be corrected by adjusting the geometry of the tools or reinforcing some sections of the component. This thermoforming simulation would help to avoid unexpected failure of thermoformed components. The challenge of the thesis is the implementation of a suitable material model using Finite Element Software (FES). ABAQUS {{is one of the leading}} software programs in non-linear simulations, which has an open architecture that allows a scientific study of complex material models. Finished material models for OS are not stored in the program. However, these material models can be incorporated through the ABAQUS fabric material behavior, using either the test data based fabric or a VFABRIC subroutine. The aim of this thesis is modeling the thermoforming Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of OS using ABAQUS. Therefore, the following objectives are outlined. The first objective is the definition of the boundary condition and the deformation mechanisms that are displayed in the thermoforming simulation. The second objective is to implement a preliminary thermoforming process in ABAQUS, modeling the die, the stamp, the holder as analytical rigid components, and modeling the blank as a flat surface made of a “Dummy Material” such as Aluminum. The third objective is to do a deep research of the different possibilities of defining a material model in ABAQUS, and the necessary software requirements to run the thermoforming simulation with user defined material models. The fourth objective is to implement a macro-scale material model for OS in ABAQUS. Probably, shear force dependence against shear angle of the material angle can be mapped. Further post-processing operations unknown for now are done, such as the possibility of evaluating the shear angle, the fiber orientations and any component folds. The fifth and last objective is to document all the research done and create a tutorial guide that would help future researchers to refine de model by mapping more deformation mechanisms or more adjusted material models. A sensibility analysis to capture the influence of the geometry tools (holder dimensions, blank dimensions), fabric material test data (uniaxial tensile tests and picture frame tests) and boundary conditions (<b>punch</b> speed, <b>holder</b> load, friction coefficient) with shear angles is performed...|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} mechanical joining and {{adhesive bonding}} interactions exist between these elementary joining methods. Tooling and process parameters {{that have been}} determined as optimum, separately, can not {{be transferred to the}} hybrid technology, directly. Mutual interactions lead to the necessity of fitting the respective process parameters of both elementary joining methods in order to achieve best results in the combined joining process. Optimizing parameters for the overall system is required in every case. Therefore accurate statements concerning dependencies in terms of quality production are needed, such as clear guidelines for adhesive properties and adhesive processing or adjustment of process kinematics. Understanding of the process can be accomplished not only by experimental studies, so the numerical description of hybrid joining processes and the generation of additional knowledge from simulations has to be worked out. Subjects of investigation are the mechanical joining processes clinching and self-pierce-riveting in combination with adhesive bonding, below called clinch-bonding and riv-bonding. In extensive experimental studies the influence of various parameters on the clinch-bonding process are studied. These studies are focussed on the influence of adhesive viscosity and process kinematics on the joint quality for several joining applications with identical overall gauge. A key parameter of process kinematics is the relative axial positioning of <b>punch</b> and blank <b>holder</b> {{at the beginning of the}} joining process. Another parameter is a non-continuous joining process with a defined stopping time during the joining process. For the hybrid bonding and mechanical joining technologies clinch-bonding and riv-bonding FEA reference models are developed regarding elementary joining by forming processes. These reference models are expanded with the displacement of the liquid adhesive to describe the hybrid joining processes. The influence of the described parameters is investigated in a variety of simulations. Positioning the punch 0. 5 mm till 1. 0 mm in front of the blank holder leads to significant improvement of the joint quality for clinch-bonding processes by reducing the adhesive bags in the joint area. Thus a greater undercut can be realised. Stopping the joining process for about 1. 0 s can provide an increased undercut value in the same dimension. Based on the increased process knowledge based on simulations, options for process optimization are derived. The developed simulations go beyond the state of the art, how-ever, are associated with numerical instability and high computational times. The principal numerical calculation of hybrid joining processes is demonstrated and provides a basis for further numerical investigations for hybrid joining technologies...|$|R
