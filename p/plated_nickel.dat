Silicon nitride layers deposited by PECVD or sputtering effectively hinder copper diffusion, which might occur e. g. at contact edges. To investigate the <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> diffusion barrier, fast degradation of full size 156 × 156  mm² cells at elevated temperatures on hotplates and module degradation in the climate chamber executing a damp heat test were performed. <b>Plated</b> <b>nickel</b> thickness influences the degradation speed on cell level. On module level, only the cell without diffusion barrier shows a degradation of 1. 2 % rel. in efficiency (IEC criteria passed) after 1500  h damp heat test (85  °C, 85 % r. h.). The cells with diffusion barrier do not show any degradation.

40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of {{impurities}} incorporated into <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> seed layer on silicide formation {{and the influence of}} annealing temperature on the fill-factor (FF) loss of solar cells with Ni-Cu contacts is investigated. The silicide growth of electro-less <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> seed layer is significantly retarded compared with literature data on physical-vapor-deposition (PVD) -based nickel annealed at 550 degrees C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction reveal the presence of SiO 2 at the Ni-Si interface and the formation of nickel phosphides in addition to nickel silicide. The retardation in silicide growth is attributed to the presence of (111) planes after the texturing process and contaminants in the seed layer. Varying the annealing temperature of fabricated cells from 350 degrees C to 425 degrees C led to a decrease in the average FF from 79. 3 % to 77. 5 %. The loss analysis is based on Suns-V-oc measurements, illuminated current-voltage parameters, and dark current-voltage curve fitting based on a three-diode model. It reveals that the FF loss is dominated by increased junction recombination, whereas losses due to third-diode component become significant for annealing at 400 degrees C and higher temperatures. The results highlight the need to carefully tune the seed layer annealing parameters to the interface conditions and junction depth of solar cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} the {{development}} and evaluation of a copper solar cell front side metallization based on a screen printed silver seed layer, a <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> diffusion barrier, a plated copper conductive layer and a plated silver capping is presented. Due to a slight adjustment of the standard screen printing process, and subsequent plating of Ni, Cu and Ag, silver consumption was reduced to < 16  mg per cell front side on standard BSF 15. 6  cm x 15. 6 cm mono crystalline wafers, produced only with inline capable techniques. Contact adhesion forces of 1. 5  N/mm and, efficiencies of 18. 4  % were achieved. For the long term stability analysis on cell and module level, cells with different nickel diffusion barrier masses (10 - 40 mg/cell) were treated on hotplates at 200, 225 and 250 °C while detecting degradation due to copper diffusion by measuring the pFF. Sufficient cell life times are predicted for 10  mg Ni by the resulting Arrhenius plot. After 750 h damp heat test of one cell modules no visible degradation was determined. This means that accelerated degradation on hotplates show the degradation due to copper diffusion more strongly than 750 hours damp heat test. In an additional SEM analysis the <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> diffusion barrier showed a closed layer on the fingers and an incomplete layer on the busbars, indicating busbars as possible weak points for copper diffusion due to inhomogeneous Ni platin...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{nanoporous}} {{nature of}} the inkjet printed silver nanoparticles entail low hardness and surface effective contact area for being compatible with pads that are suitable for wire-bonding in electronic packaging. Electroless nickel plating is a selective metal deposition technique which can brings the required thickness and hardness for further pads processing. Here, a 1. 7 μm thick nickel layer is deposited on top of 600 nm thick printed and sintered silver nanoparticles using Kapton polyimide as substrate. Prior to plating, a special attention was put on tuning microstructures of printed silver pads by sintering nanoparticles at various temperature ramps (0. 1, 10 and 50 °C/s) up to 200 °C. Results show that fast sintering exhibits the lowest electrical resistivity which is suitable in printed interconnects. However, wire-bonding on nickel pads is best achieved when low sintering ramp is used. This slow sintering presents the highest adhesion strength at the nickel/silver interface since the pores dimensions were restricted to the nanoscale. The validation of the optimized bonding process came from the low electrical contact resistance between <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> and the bonded gold wire, and from the wire-pull test which is {{in accordance with the}} MIL-STD 883 standard.

In this system, the activation of barrel <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> electrode (Ni-BPE) in alkaline media to form a Ni(OH) (2) /NiO(OH) film was found to trigger the adsorption of phosphate at the electrode surface. Based on the suppressed current of the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose at the activated Ni-BPE in 0. 1 M NaOH solution caused by adsorption of phosphate, we develop an FIA detection scheme for the determination of phosphate. Under the optimized conditions of flow rate = 300 mu L/min and detection potential = 0. 55 V vs Ag/AgCl with 25 mu M glucose in 0. 1 M NaOH as carrier solution, the calibration curve showed a linear range up to 1 mM.

40|$|AbstractAnnealing induced silicidation of <b>plated</b> <b>nickel</b> {{contacts}} can severly {{lower the}} solar cell performance due to deep nickel silicide spikes penetrating the space charge region. This work summarizes several attempts to characterize performance limiting deep silicide structures and determines {{the influence of}} different passivation layer structuring technologies on the silicide growth. Reverse biased electroluminescence measurements revealed that the deep nickel silicides occur after an anneal and arelocated along the structured and plated passivation layer openings. Cross-section studies of the plated contacts demonstrated that deep silicide growth is present independently of the applied passivation layer structuring technology. While for laser-ablation the critical silicide structures could be mostly attributed to accelerated silicide growth at laser induced defects, there are also deep silicide structures that appear without any obvious correlation even {{in the case of}} defect free wet chemical passivation structuring of the contact openings. By varying the emitter doping profile and the annealing temperature after plating the distance of the space charge region and the surface was found to influence the annealing-induced solar cell performance decrease. Considering the presented results there are three ways to overcome annealing induced degradation of Ni plated solar cells.
