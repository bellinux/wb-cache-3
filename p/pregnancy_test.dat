A sensitive serum <b>pregnancy</b> <b>test</b> is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy.

40|$|Implementation of best {{management}} practices into the beef cow enterprise is critical for long-term success. Previous literature suggests that <b>pregnancy</b> <b>testing</b> is valuable to the beef cow operation; however, {{less than half of}} producers in the southern Plains region of the United States utilize <b>pregnancy</b> <b>testing.</b> The objective of this research is to determine the expected value of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>testing</b> and the subsequent adoption of an effective culling practice on first-time non-pregnant beef cows relative to a system that does not use <b>pregnancy</b> <b>testing</b> or a culling strategy. Results show that the value of adopting <b>pregnancy</b> <b>testing</b> and an effective culling practice for first-time non-pregnant cows ranged between $ 54 and $ 76 head- 1, depending upon the year. With the cost of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>testing</b> ranging between $ 2 and $ 5 head- 1, the value of the risk-reducing information gleaned from <b>pregnancy</b> <b>testing</b> tends to warrant adoption...|$|R

Phoebe at first tricks Rachel and tells her that the <b>pregnancy</b> <b>test</b> is negative, {{in order to achieve}} Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The three of them rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage.|$|E

Glenn (Steven Yeun) is lowered down and saddles the walker with rope to pull it out, but as the group pulls it out, its body is ripped in half, its lower half falling back into the well and contaminating it. Maggie and Glenn decide to venture to the local pharmacy to find more supplies. Before he leaves, Lori asks Glenn to find a <b>pregnancy</b> <b>test</b> for her. At the pharmacy, Glenn is flustered with Lori's request, and Maggie seduces and has sex with him before they return.|$|E

Emma, who can always spot a lie, follows Mary Margaret to call out her {{stalking}} behavior and suggests she stop seeing him. Mary Margaret buys some chocolate to drown her woes and runs right into Kathryn, who is picking up a <b>pregnancy</b> <b>test.</b> Regina notices this, and warns Mary Margaret to stay away from David, and it was their personal life.|$|E

Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A <b>pregnancy</b> <b>test</b> comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95.

25|$|Pregnancy {{detection}} can {{be accomplished}} using one or more various <b>pregnancy</b> <b>tests,</b> which detect hormones generated by the newly formed placenta, serving as biomarkers of pregnancy. Blood and urine <b>tests</b> can detect <b>pregnancy</b> 12 days after implantation. Blood <b>pregnancy</b> <b>tests</b> are more sensitive than urine tests (giving fewer false negatives). Home <b>pregnancy</b> <b>tests</b> are urine tests, and normally detect a pregnancy 12 to 15 days after fertilization. A quantitative blood test can determine approximately the date the embryo was conceived because HCG doubles every 36 to 48 hours. A single test of progesterone levels can also help determine how likely a fetus will survive in those with a threatened miscarriage (bleeding in early pregnancy).|$|R

5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative <b>pregnancy</b> <b>test</b> and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E

5|$|A {{cancerous}} patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), {{is admitted}} {{into the hospital}} and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her <b>pregnancy</b> <b>test</b> is negative.

Total foetal dose in the Graves' patient was 100 mGy and compatible with survival, whereas a foetal dose of approximately 700 mGy together with induced hypothyroidism was fatal for the foetus of the cancer patient. Routine <b>pregnancy</b> <b>tests</b> may fail early and late in pregnancy.
