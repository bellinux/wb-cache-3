40|$|OBJECTIVE: Early {{studies of}} {{menopause}} recruited sample populations from clinical settings; however, in the 1970 s, populations drawn from health care settings were characterized as nonrepresentative because of symptom overreporting. This pilot study {{was carried out}} to test whether this characterization still holds true: that women who are drawn from clinical settings report more symptoms compared with women who are recruited from community and work sites. DESIGN: Open-ended interviews were carried out with patients aged 40 - 60 years in a physician 2 ̆ 7 s office (n = 50), in a chiropractor 2 ̆ 7 s office (n = 24), at two Breast Health Project sites (n = 50), and in several non-health care sites in the community (n = 81). Interviews were supplemented by anthropometrics and standardized return-by-mail questionnaires. RESULTS: Women who experienced hot flashes and sweating {{were more likely to}} report having spoken with a physician about menopause. However, women who were drawn from the clinical setting were not significantly more likely to describe hot flashes, sweats, or mood changes and were significantly less likely to report headaches in relation to menopause compared with a community sample. Women who were drawn from the physician 2 ̆ 7 s office were more likely to use hormone replacement therapy and to have had a hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that because of the medicalization of menopause, we need to rethink our assumptions about the characteristics of populations drawn from health care settings.

40|$|Background: Males {{have a lower}} life {{expectancy}} and a higher morbidity than females. Such trends are exacerbated in regions of social deprivation yet little is known on how best to intervene in this male population. The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a purpose-built active video game (AVG) intervention in a target population of sedentary males from a region of lower socio-economic status. Methods: This was a community-based pilot randomised controlled exploratory trial. We recruited men (n = 47) from areas of social deprivation in the North East of England in distinct community settings; a working men’s club (n = 6), taxi ranks (n = 22), mosque (n = 17) and home visits (n = 2). Following baseline measures of metabolic health and quality of life, participants were randomly allocated by a third party to an intervention (n = 27) or control (n = 17) group. A prototype boxing-based AVG was developed where participants were required to punch against resistance bands in time to music and on-screen prompts at varying frequencies. The exercise sessions (3 per week over 12 weeks) lasting no longer than 15 mins were delivered at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>recruitment.</b> We recorded heart rates for all exercise sessions. Outcome measures included metabolic risk factors and quality of life measures at baseline (0 weeks) and follow-up (13 weeks). Results: Both the intervention and research procedures were feasible and acceptable to participants. The tests were acceptable but some measures (i. e. free-living physical activity and lipid profiles) were influenced by a reluctance/forgetfulness of the participants to conform to protocol.

40|$|Objectives: BRIGHTLIGHT is a {{national}} evaluation of cancer services for teenagers and young adults in England. Following challenges with recruitment, {{our aim was to}} understand more fully healthcare professionals’ perspectives of the challenges of recruiting young people to a low-risk observational study, and to provide guidance for future recruitment processes. Design: Qualitative. Setting: National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. Methods: Semistructured telephone interviews with a convenience sample of 23 healthcare professionals. Participants included principal investigators/other staff recruiting into the BRIGHTLIGHT study. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Results: The emergent themes were linked to levels of research organisational management, described using the levels of social network analysis: micro-level (the individual; in this case the target population to be recruited—young people with cancer); meso-level (the organisation; refers to <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> and people responsible for recruitment); and macro-level (the large-scale or global structure; refers to the wider research function of the NHS and associated policies). Study-related issues occurred across all three levels, which were influenced by the context of the study. At the meso-level, professionals’ perceptions of young people and communication between professionals generated age/cancer type silos, resulting in recruitment of either children or adults, but not both by the same team, and only in the cancer type the recruiting professional was aligned to. At the macro-level the main barrier was discordant configuration of a research service with a clinical service. Conclusions: This study has identified significant barriers to recruitment mainly at the meso-level and macro-level, which are more challenging for research teams to influence. We suggest that interconnected whole-system changes are required to facilitate the success of interventions designed to improve recruitment. Interventions targeted at study design/management and the micro-level only may be less successful. We offer solutions to be considered by those involved at all levels of research for this population. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluating}} the effectiveness of educational strategy in group session from the use of the flipchart "I can feed my child" in the promotion of self-efficacy in breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding. It is a controlled, randomized clinical trial, with 104 mothers in the intervention group (IG) and 104 in the control group (CG). The intervention was characterized by the use of the flipchart "I can feed my child" in GI, applied in group session. Data collection was carried out in the rooming and by telephone accommodation in six times to 15 days after birth and monthly until 120 days. The <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> of participants was the Toco-gynecological Unit of a referral hospital for the Midwest region of Rio Grande do Sul in labor and birth attendance. It used the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale - Short Form (BSES-SF) to measure the scores of self-efficacy in nursing, as well as forms with sociodemographic, obstetric history, current pregnancy, parturition, and birth and child data to 120 days of life. It was assured the blinding of the four research assistants in data collection. There was compared to the average range by Student t test, Mann-Whitney and ANOVA. The associations between self-efficacy and categorical variables were analyzed by odds ratios and the test XÂ, likelihood ratio and of XÂ for linear trend in proportions. There was found a higher percentage of women with high self-efficacy during follow-up period in the intervention group (p = 0. 002) and an increase in average self-efficacy scores in that group at follow-up (p < 0. 05). The practice of exclusive breastfeeding at 120 days after birth was higher in the intervention group, with chance to exclusively breastfeed 1. 75 (0. 75 to 4. 04) times in the postpartum group who received the educational intervention. There were observed higher offer breastfeeding rates in the intervention group and remained above 52 % throughout the monitoring. The change of exclusive breastfeeding for other foods in the intervention group was 1. 8 (0. 3 to 9. 7) times higher in the age group up to 19 years old and 1. 3 (0. 5 to 3. 7) times for primiparous women; in the control group the chance to offer other food was of 1. 4 (0. 5 to 3. 8) times higher in primiparous. In the intervention group, the average self-efficacy in nursing was higher when associated with exclusive breastfeeding at 30 and 90 days of follow-up. We conclude that the scores of self-efficacy in nursing were higher in the GI from the rooming until 120 days after birth. Thus, there was modification or enhancement of maternal self-efficacy in nursing using the flipchart "I can feed my child" in group session, reflecting the offer of exclusive breastfeeding during the study period. O objetivo do estudo foi avaliar a eficÃcia da estratÃgia educativa em sessÃo grupal a partir da utilizaÃÃo do Ãlbum seriado âEu posso amamentar o meu filhoâ na promoÃÃo da autoeficÃcia em amamentar e do aleitamento materno exclusivo. Trata-se de um ensaio clÃnico controlado e randomizado, com 104 puÃrperas no grupo intervenÃÃo (GI) e 104 no controle (GC). A intervenÃÃo caracterizou-se pela utilizaÃÃo do Ãlbum seriado âEu posso amamentar o meu filhoâ no GI, aplicado em sessÃo grupal. A coleta de dados foi realizada no alojamento conjunto e por contato telefÃnico em seis momentos, aos 15 dias apÃs o parto e mensalmente atÃ os 120 dias. O local de recrutamento das participantes foi a Unidade Toco-GinecolÃgica de um hospital de referÃncia para a regiÃo centro-oeste do Rio Grande do Sul no atendimento ao parto e nascimento. Foi utilizada a Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale â Short Form (BSES-SF) para mensurar os escores de autoeficÃcia em amamentar, alÃm de formulÃrios com dados sociodemogrÃficos, antecedentes obstÃtricos, gestaÃÃo atual, parto, nascimento e dados da crianÃa atÃ os 120 dias de vida. Garantiu-se o cegamento dos quatro auxiliares de pesquisa na coleta dos dados. Compararam-se as mÃdias da escala pelos testes t de Student, Mann-Whitney e ANOVA. As associaÃÃes entre a autoeficÃcia e as variÃveis categÃricas foram analisadas pelas razÃes de chances e pelos testes de &# 61539; 2, razÃo de verossimilhanÃa e de &# 61539; 2 para tendÃncia linear em proporÃÃes. Encontrou-se maior percentual de mulheres com autoeficÃcia alta ao longo do perÃodo de acompanhamento no grupo intervenÃÃo (p= 0, 002) e um aumento da mÃdia dos escores de autoeficÃcia nesse grupo no perÃodo de acompanhamento (p< 0, 05). A prÃtica do aleitamento materno exclusivo aos 120 dias apÃs o parto foi superior no grupo intervenÃÃo, com chance de amamentar exclusivamente de 1, 75 (0, 75 - 4, 04) vezes no grupo de puÃrperas que receberam a intervenÃÃo educativa. Observaram-se maiores Ãndices de oferta do aleitamento materno no grupo intervenÃÃo, mantendo-se acima dos 52 % em todo o acompanhamento. A mudanÃa do aleitamento materno exclusivo para outros alimentos no grupo intervenÃÃo foi 1, 8 (0, 3 - 9, 7) vezes mais elevada na faixa etÃria atÃ 19 anos e 1, 3 (0, 5 - 3, 7) vezes para as primÃparas; no grupo controle a chance de oferecer outro alimento foi 1, 4 (0, 5 - 3, 8) vezes superior nas primÃparas. No grupo intervenÃÃo, a mÃdia de autoeficÃcia em amamentar foi superior quando associada ao aleitamento materno exclusivo aos 30 e 90 dias de acompanhamento. Conclui-se que os escores de autoeficÃcia em amamentar foram mais elevados no GI, desde o alojamento conjunto atÃ os 120 dias apÃs o parto. Assim, houve modificaÃÃo ou reforÃo da autoeficÃcia materna em amamentar com a utilizaÃÃo do Ãlbum seriado âEu posso amamentar o meu filhoâ em sessÃo grupal, repercutindo na oferta de aleitamento materno exclusivo ao longo do perÃodo de estudo...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEmbryonic {{development}} {{is controlled by}} a small set of signal transduction pathways, with vastly different phenotypic outcomes depending on the time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> their <b>recruitment.</b> How the same molecular machinery can elicit such specific and distinct responses, {{remains one of the}} outstanding questions in developmental biology. Part of the answer may lie in the high inherent genetic complexity of these signaling cascades, as observed for the Wnt-pathway. The mammalian genome encodes multiple Wnt proteins and receptors, each of which show dynamic and tightly controlled expression patterns in the embryo. Yet how these components interact {{in the context of the}} whole organism remains unknown. Here we report the generation of a novel, inducible transgenic mouse model that allows spatiotemporal control over the expression of Wnt 5 a, a protein implicated in many developmental processes and multiple Wnt-signaling responses. We show that ectopic Wnt 5 a expression from E 10. 5 onwards results in a variety of developmental defects, including loss of hair follicles and reduced bone formation in the skull. Moreover, we find that Wnt 5 a can have dual signaling activities during mouse embryonic development. Specifically, Wnt 5 a is capable of both inducing and repressing β-catenin/TCF signaling in vivo, depending on the time and site of expression and the receptors expressed by receiving cells. These experiments show for the first time that a single mammalian Wnt protein can have multiple signaling activities in vivo, thereby furthering our understanding of how signaling specificity is achieved in a complex developmental context...|$|R

Many questions remain regarding the basic physiologic principles <b>of</b> <b>recruitment,</b> and, therefore, the optimal way to perform recruitment maneuvers remains unknown. Moreover, apart from physiologic studies suggesting a potential benefit <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> maneuver in terms <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> and gas exchange, no data are yet available that demonstrate the ability of such a maneuver to improve outcome. In this article, we discuss the physiologic rules governing recruitment and derecruitment and review articles that provide new insights in the field <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> maneuver...|$|R
40|$|How can vacancy {{statistics}} be used {{to measure}} friction in job matching {{and the effects of}} friction on unemployment? First, measure deviations from instantaneous hirings by the average duration <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> as measured by the number of job vacancies divided by the number of hirings per month. Second, measure direct effects <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> times on employment by measuring unfilled jobs, defined as unoccupied job vacancies which are available immediately. Third, measure indirect effects <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> times on employment by estimating first the effect <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> times on product prices and then the effect of a price change on sales, production and employment. Fourth, measure ‘search ineffectiveness’ with potential effects on the NAIRU by the rate of unfilled jobs. Unemployment; vacancies; matching function; labour demand; friction...|$|R

5000|$|Brigham Young, President of the LDS Church, {{personally}} {{supervised the}} founding of many outlying communities. Exploring parties were sent out to find settlement sites, and to identify sources of appropriate minerals, timber, and water. Western historian Leonard Arrington asserts that within ten years of the LDS arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, “…nearly 100 colonies had been planted; by 1867, more than 200; {{and by the time}} of (Brigham Young’s) death in 1877, nearly 400 colonies.” [...] These colonies had four distinct purposes: [...] "...first, settlements intended to be temporary <b>places</b> <b>of</b> gathering and <b>recruitment,</b> such as Carson Valley in Nevada; second, colonies to serve as centers for production, such as iron at Cedar City, cotton at St. George, cattle in Cache Valley, and sheep in Spanish Fork, all in Utah; third, colonies to serve as centers for proselytizing and assisting Indians, as at Harmony in southern Utah, Las Vegas in southern Nevada, Fort Lemhi (north-central Idaho near the Lemhi Pass), and present-day Moab in eastern Utah; fourth, permanent colonies in Utah and nearby states and territories to provide homes and farms for the hundreds of new immigrants arriving each summer." ...|$|R
