40|$|The {{treatment}} of diseases often requires the employ of either systemic or topical medication during {{certain period of}} time. Usually the treatment coincides with exposures to electromagnetic radiations coming from different types of sources (such as sunlight and artificial radiations). The contemporary exposure to drug and light {{may lead to the}} appearance of unexpected effects 1, 2 such as photo-sensitization, <b>photo-allergy,</b> photo-mutagenesis, photo-carcinogenesis and photo-aging. Moreover, not only external organs (eyes and skin) are affected by drug photo-toxicity, but sometimes even internal organs are damaged. A drug exposed to the light before the subministration may undergo to photo-decomposition lowering its bio-pharmacological activity or generating sub-products, which may be toxic to the human body themselves. Generally, interactions between the electromagnetic radiation and the matter encompasses a great number of events among which photophysical and photochemical processes can be included. In some cases the incremented specificity of a drug irradiated with light (mostly visible) can be employed to increase the drug therapeutics. It is commonly accepted that photo-toxicity and photo-therapy share the same mechanisms of action. It is possible to refer to photo...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} procedure for photopatch testing includes 24 -h occlusion of the allergen, followed by irradiation at 5 J/cm 2 ultraviolet A (UVA). Due to the timing, a separate {{visit to the}} clinic is needed for UV irradiation. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether a reduction in occlu-sion time from 24 h to 1 h, in order to simplify the testing procedure, influences test results when photopatch tes-ting with ketoprofen. A total of 22 patients with a known or suspected <b>photo-allergy</b> to ketoprofen were simulta-neously photopatch-tested with ketoprofen using both 1 h and 24 h occlusion. One side of the patient’s back was irradiated with 5 J/cm 2 UVA, and the other side was covered. Measurements were made after 3 days on both irradiated and non-irradiated sides. A total of 20 controls were photopatch-tested with ketoprofen using 1 h occlu-sion. All of the patients showed positive reactions on the irradiated side. No positive reactions were observed on the non-irradiated side. All controls were negative. In conclusion, 1 h occlusion time is sufficient to establish photo-contact allergy to ketoprofen. No adjustments in UVA or ketoprofen dose were needed. Limiting occlu-sion time to 1 h could simplify the photopatch test proce-dure by eliminating one visit to the clinic. These results apply only to ketoprofen; further studies are needed to determine whether a similar approach can be used with other components of photopatch test series.

40|$|Healthy skin {{is a sign}} of {{positive}} self-worth, attractiveness and vitality. Compromises to this are frequently caused by extended periods of recreation in the sun and in turn exposure to the harmful effects of UV radiation. To maintain strength and integrity, protection of the skin is paramount. This can be achieved by implementing skin-care products which contain sunscreen active ingredients that provide UV protection. Unfortunately, photo-degradation, toxicity, and <b>photo-allergies</b> limit the effectiveness of present day sunscreen ingredients. Currently, this is moderated by physically embedding within inert silica particles, but leaching of the active ingredient can occur, thereby negating protective efforts. Alternatively, this research details the preparation and investigation of bridged silsesquioxane analogues of commercial ingredients which can be chemically grafted to the silica matrix. Studies with bridged salicylate particles detail facile preparation, minimized leaching, and enhanced UV stability over physically encapsulated and pendant salicylate counterparts. In terms of UVB protective ability, the highest maintenance of sun protection factor (SPF) after extended UV exposure was achieved with bridged incorporation, and has been attributed to corollary UV stability. Additionally, bridged salicylate particles can be classified as broad-spectrum, and rate from moderate to good in terms of UVA protective ability. Particles incorporated with a bridged curcuminoid silsesquioxane were also prepared and displayed comparable results. As such, an attractive method for sunscreen isolation and stabilization has been developed to eliminate the problems associated with current sunscreens, all while maintaining the established UV absorbance profiles of the parent compound. To appreciate the technology utilized in this research, a thorough understanding of sol-gel science as it pertains to hybrid organic/silica particles, including methods of organic fragment incorporation and insight on the effect of incorporation method on ingredient leaching and UV stability, is vital. This was afforded by analysis of hybrid fluorescent dansyl particles, prepared by both O/W microemulsion polymerization and a modified Stöber process, which detailed that covalent entrapment of bridged dansyl silsesquioxane is the incorporation method of choice to ensure minimized leaching and enhanced UV stability. As such, use of this method can provide exciting applications in fields where stability and retainment of the embedded ingredient is paramount for efficacy...|$|R
