50|$|From the outset, {{there were}} {{problems}} with printing this issue as {{there are a number}} of missing colours present, in some cases more than one colour, indicating poor quality control. Some of the missing colours are now very difficult to find as in some cases only few stamps on a sheet were affected, generally 10 or less. Many of these varieties were the result of one of the <b>printing</b> <b>colour</b> supplies being interrupted during the print run and restarting, causing a missing colour on one or more columns.|$|E

40|$|<b>Printing</b> <b>colour</b> {{pictures}} in a TEX document needs a driver {{program that is}} able to exploit the capabilities of a colour device.

The most important chemical added into the fountain solution is isopropyl alcohol. Fundamental features of isopropyl alcohol are reducing surface tension and adjusting and stabilizing pH. However, {{in the course of}} time, the disadvantages of using alcohol have emerged. In the present study, the quality levels of IPA-based and IPA-free offset prints were compared. Specially designed test scale printing was carried out after IPA-based and IPA-free fountain solutions were prepared with the same ink on matt-coated paper under optimal printing conditions. Densitometric and spectrophotometric measurements were carried out on the prints and it was ensured that they were printed in accordance with ISO- 12647 - 2 : 2013 offset printing standards. Special test scales that were printed were read through scale readers and colour profiles were obtained. Comparisons were carried out on the obtained IPA-free and IPAbased <b>printing</b> <b>colour</b> gamut. Microscopic images of the smallest dots were taken and edge sharpening was examined. Print brightness measurements were carried out for the selected areas on the test scale. The study practically demonstrated that printing performed by using IPA-free fountain solution produced a better and wider colour gamut, edge sharpening was better in the IPA-free systems as the number of prints increased and the prints made by using IPA-free fountain solution were brighter...|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} surface treatment on permanence and stability of various graphic paperboard types - board for books, brochures, business cards, calendars, protection package - under the conditions of accelerated ageing with increased temperature and relative humidity {{in the absence of}} light according to ISO/ 5630 / 3, and as specified for material on paper/board of permanent value by EN/ISO 9706 (8). Paperboards were coated with various coating colours, and subsequently lab printed in offset technique. The effect of artificial ageing on surface properties as well as on image optical and colour stability was monitored. The changes observed in surface characteristics such as smoothness, roughness, air permeability, absorptivity before and after the accelerated ageing process revealed a strong influence of coating components (pigments, binders) and surface treatment type. Increase in roughness, alteration of board absorption behaviour and change in optical and colour parameters - decrease in brightness, increase in yellowness, colour shift with samples containing higher amount of optical brightening agents - were the most pronounced results. Measured differences in <b>printing</b> <b>colour</b> (dE) and optical density values indicated that colour stability of offset image approached the limit values, which are set for an image of still acceptable quality. Black (K) exhibited the highest stability among CMYK colours. Image colour stability significantly depends on surface and optical board characteristics, especially on gloss and optical brightener agent, as well as on board fibre composition and coating pigments. </p...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{focused on}} physico-chemical {{modifications}} of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nonwoven fabric fibre surface. To improve the adhesive properties of textile products towards TiO 2, their surface was treated in low-temperature plasma (cold plasma). Plasma treatment of PET fabrics {{was performed in}} carbon dioxide and/or argon pressure. Poten-tial changes in the chemical structure of polyester fabric {{can be caused by}} the following: a homolytic splitting of the ester bonds, a release of volatile degradation products (mainly CO and CO 2), a cross-linking, reactions of macro radicals [alkyl (•CH 2 -CH 2 ~) and phenyl (•C 6 H 4 ~) ] with oxygen, and a subsequent formation of hydroxy-aromatic rings. Experimen-tal investigations confirmed the fact of modification of the chemical structure of the PET surface caused by plasma treatment of the fibre surface. Key words: plasma treatment, poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabrics, nonwovens, surface modification, oxide particles. Plasma can be used to modify surfaces of poly(ethylene terephthalate) textiles. Recently many investigations have been directed towards the development of plasma technologies to improve the prop-erties of textile surfaces. Plasma treat-ment has found numerous applications in the textile industry, namely in dyeing/ <b>printing,</b> <b>colour</b> fastness or coating adhe-sion and many other related applications [6 - 10]. In this paper we present results for the plasma treatment of PET nonwoven as a way to improve their adhesion properties towards TiO 2. The main aim of these re-search works was the estimation of phys-ico-chemical modifications of a polyeth-ylene terephthalate nonwoven fabric sur-face after plasma treatment application. n Experimental Material use...|$|E
40|$|The Paper {{industry}} {{is vital for}} social, cultural, economic and educational development of a country. As such, it needs to survive and compete with global giants in the world. Therefore, it has to produce standard products at minimum cost. Against this background and for maximisation of contribution, two paper mills i. e. private and joint sectors are brought into the sample. The optimal product mix for private sector paper mill is writing and printing paper and coated board while writing and <b>printing,</b> <b>colour</b> printing / process paper and newsprint for joint sector paper mill. The duality analysis shows that one hour of working in pulp mill and paper making departments increase profit contribution by Rs. 95, 149 {{in the private sector}} paper mill whereas Rs. 82, 621 in paper making department of joint sector paper mill. The sensitivity analysis reveals that within the range, a change either positive or negative in profit contribution per unit of optimal product mix would not cause for change in the optimal solution. The sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal product mix for writing and printing paper is in the range of 43, 400 1 pC 50, 100 and 26, 946 34, 848 for coated board. Similarly in the joint sector paper mill, writing and printing paper in the range of 41, 167 1, 13, 583; colour printing / process paper 38, 917 41, 750 and news print 15, 418 35, 064. Finally, the private sector paper mill should produce 2, 378 tonnes of writing and printing paper and 37, 449 tonnes coated board to earn maximum profit. Lik...|$|E
