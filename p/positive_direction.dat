25|$|The {{theory of}} contour {{integration}} comprises {{a major part}} of complex analysis. In this context the direction of travel around a closed curve is important– reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by 1. By convention the <b>positive</b> <b>direction</b> is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the <b>positive</b> <b>direction</b> when we start at the point z = 1, then travel up and to the left through the point z = i, then down and to the left through 1, then down and to the right through i, and finally up and to the right to z = 1, where we started.|$|E

25|$|Angles are {{commonly}} defined {{according to the}} right-hand rule.

The opposite convention (left hand rule) is less frequently adopted.|$|E

At point B, we have a roller joint and hence we only have 1 reaction force in the y direction.

25|$|In two dimensions, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} {{is a single}} number with an orientation but no direction. The angular velocity in two dimensions is a pseudoscalar, a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example {{if one of the}} axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The <b>positive</b> <b>direction</b> of rotation is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the y axis from the x axis. If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of a rotation is not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.|$|E
25|$|For example, a PID loop is used {{to control}} the {{temperature}} of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the <b>positive</b> <b>direction.</b> This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after {{the opening of the}} door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.|$|E

25|$|While things {{appeared}} to be promising to move in a <b>positive</b> <b>direction</b> for the Cyclones, Rhoads' future teams were unable to recapture {{the success of his}} earlier teams. In his final three seasons, the Cyclones won just four Big 12 games (including a winless conference record in 2014) and went 8–27 overall. The 2015 season proved to be particularly difficult, as in two games, the Cyclones held double-digit halftime leads against both Oklahoma State and Kansas State only to lose late in the fourth quarter. Following a 38–35 loss to Kansas State on November 21, in which he came under heavy criticism for play-calling in the game's final 90 seconds, Rhoads was fired as head coach, effective the conclusion of the season.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout {{delayed the}} start of the season, which was {{shortened}} to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic, three games to one, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49–33, fifth in the East. Again, the Sixers won their first round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a <b>positive</b> <b>direction,</b> Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated {{to the point where it}} seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000–01.|$|E
