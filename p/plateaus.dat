5|$|The park {{is located}} in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it {{is located on the}} Markagunt and Kolob <b>plateaus,</b> at the {{intersection}} of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado <b>Plateaus,</b> the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the Kolob Canyons section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit40.|$|E
5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and <b>plateaus</b> in some areas. These <b>plateaus</b> rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High <b>Plateaus</b> by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado <b>Plateaus</b> and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two <b>plateaus</b> adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E

It {{is part of}} the Fraser <b>Plateau</b> that itself is a northward extension of the North American <b>Plateau.</b> The southern limit of the <b>plateau</b> is the Bonaparte River although some definitions include the Bonaparte <b>Plateau</b> between that river and the Thompson, but it properly is a subdivision of the Thompson <b>Plateau.</b> The portion of the Fraser <b>Plateau</b> west of the Fraser River is properly known as the Chilcotin <b>Plateau</b> but is often mistakenly considered {{to be part of the}} Cariboo <b>Plateau,</b> which is east of the Fraser.|$|R
5|$|Other {{geographical}} features {{inside the}} park include: U-shaped valleys, 660 tropical glaciers (the largest glaciated area in the tropics), 300 glacial lakes and high <b>plateaus</b> intersected by ravines with torrential creeks.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{formations}} {{were also}} created but were mostly eroded away following two major periods of uplift. The Laramide orogeny affected the entire {{western part of}} what would become North America starting about 70million to 50million years ago. This event helped to build the Rocky Mountains {{and in the process}} closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The Colorado <b>Plateaus</b> were uplifted 16million years ago and were segmented into different <b>plateaus,</b> each separated from its neighbors by faults and each having its own uplift rate. The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.|$|E

5|$|Features on Io {{are named}} after {{characters}} and places from the Io myth, {{as well as}} deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from Dante's Inferno: names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen up close by Voyager 1, the International Astronomical Union has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, <b>plateaus,</b> and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types of volcanic features include patera ("saucer"; volcanic depression), fluctus ("flow"; lava flow), vallis ("valley"; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was {{the first sign of}} volcanic activity at a particular volcano). Named mountains, <b>plateaus,</b> layered terrain, and shield volcanoes include the terms mons, mensa ("table"), planum, and tholus ("rotunda"), respectively. Named, bright albedo regions use the term regio. Examples of named features are Prometheus, Pan Mensa, Tvashtar Paterae, and Tsũi Goab Fluctus.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{mountains}} {{appear to}} be in some stage of degradation. Large landslide deposits are common at the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation. Scalloped margins are common among Io's mesas and <b>plateaus,</b> the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.|$|E

40|$|Geomorphology is an {{expression}} of processes acting upon an area. The links between driving processes and the resulting geomorphology are far from being fully understood. This thesis investigates controls on the dynamics and behaviour of fluvial systems from the interior of orogenic <b>plateaux</b> to the tectonically active <b>plateaux</b> margins. Orogenic <b>plateaux</b> provide a good study area by juxtaposing different tectonic and climatic settings that are served by the same sediment transport systems, allowing for observation of different variables on the same or similar fluvial systems. This {{is the first time that}} rivers draining orogenic <b>plateaux</b> have been extensively investigated. The Turkish-Iranian and Tibetan <b>plateaux</b> are the study areas. Forms of rivers draining from <b>plateaux</b> interiors, through the <b>plateaux</b> margins are analysed, along with alluvial fans within both the <b>plateaux</b> interior and <b>plateaux</b> margins. <b>Plateau</b> draining rivers act as the major route for material leaving the <b>plateau</b> region and a first-order control on erosive processes retarding <b>plateau</b> growth. Alluvial fans redistribute material within the <b>plateau</b> interior, enhancing the low relief topography diagnostic of a <b>plateau.</b> It is found that rivers draining <b>plateaux</b> show a sigmoidal form associated with the edge of the <b>plateaux.</b> High gradients and curvatures occur within the mountain ranges at the <b>plateaux</b> margins, while low values are present within the <b>plateau</b> interiors. Modelling work demonstrates that such forms to be likely responses for all plateau-draining rivers, but are most sensitive to the effects of precipitation upon a river’s ability to incise in-to the underlying sedimentary cover and bedrock lithologies. Alluvial fans in orogenic <b>plateau</b> regions are larger and with a lower surface gradient within the <b>plateau</b> interior than those nearer the active tectonic margins. It is theorised that this is due to the lack of lateral control on the accommodation space of alluvial fans within the <b>plateau</b> interior. ...|$|R

5|$|Malawi's {{climate is}} {{hot in the}} low-lying areas {{in the south of}} the country and {{temperate}} in the northern highlands. The altitude moderates what would otherwise be an equatorial climate. Between November and April the temperature is warm with equatorial rains and thunderstorms, with the storms reaching their peak severity in late March.

5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in {{the western}} United States. The High Cascades have long been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava <b>plateaus,</b> Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the <b>plateaus.</b> Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way.
