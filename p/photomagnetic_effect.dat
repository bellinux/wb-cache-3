The experimental techniques that have been employed include spectroscopic ellipsometry, magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation, and an all-optical pump-and-probe technique. The most important result of this work is the discovery of two ultrafast <b>photomagnetic</b> <b>effects</b> that allow for direct optical control of the magnetization in this material on the femtosecond time scale. Linearly polarized laser pulses of 100 femtoseconds duration are demonstrated to instantaneously create a long-lived modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy field, while circularly polarized laser pulses additionally act as strong 1 Tesla magnetic field pulses. Using these effetcs, all-optical switching of the magnetization vector within 100 femtoseconds has been demonstrated, as well as coherent optical control of the precessional magnetization dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarize}} the recent progress on laser-induced magnetization dynamics in magnetic dielectrics. Due to the slow phonon–magnon interaction in these materials, direct thermal effects of the laser excitation can only {{be seen on the}} time scale of almost a nanosecond and thus are clearly distinguished from the ultrafast nonthermal effects. However, via the crystal field, laser pulses are shown to indirectly modify the magnetic anisotropy in rare-earth orthoferrites and lead to the spin reorientation within a few picoseconds. More interesting, however, are the direct nonthermal effects of light on spin systems. We demonstrate coherent optical control of the magnetization in ferrimagnetic garnet films on a femtosecond time scale through a combination of two different ultrafast and nonthermal <b>photomagnetic</b> <b>effects</b> and by employing multiple pump pulses. Linearly polarized laser pulses are shown to create a long-lived modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy via optically induced electron transfer between nonequivalent ion sites. In addition, circularly polarized pulses are shown to act as strong transient magnetic field pulses originating from the nonabsorptive inverse Faraday effect. An all-optical scheme of excitation and detection of different antiferromagnetic resonance modes with frequencies of up to 500 GHz will be discussed as well. The reported effects open new and exciting possibilities for ultrafast manipulation of spins by light, and provide new insight into the physics of magnetism on ultrafast time scales...|$|R

The first striking result from the MOKE study is that a relatively large hysteresis loops appeared just below Tc for all the films measured in polar configuration (magnetic field perpendicular to the surface sample). The difference between MOKE and other magnetometer like superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) is probably due to the local surface character of the MOKE technique, which is more sensitive to subtle variations in the morphology of the sample.

In this context, the design of metal complexes showing a light-induced crossover from one spin state to another, leading to a major change of magnetic and optical properties, {{is probably one of}} the most appealing challenges. The so-denoted spin-crossover materials undergo, in some cases, a reversible photoswitch between two magnetic states, but, unfortunately, lifetimes of the photomagnetic states for compounds known so far are long enough only at low temperatures; this prohibits any applications.

Hereby we review the recent progress made by using the T(LIESST) procedure, which consists of systematically measuring the limit temperature above which a <b>photomagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> in a material is erased by warming the material from 10 K at a rate of 0. 3 K min 21.

Along these lines, intense efforts are focused on the investigation of cyanido–bridged coordination polymers: Prussian Blue Analogs and bimetallic coordination networks constructed of octacyanidometallates. Within this family, the CuII–[Mo(CN) 8] 4 - assemblies have been extensively studied for their photomagnetic properties. The main aim of this work was the design, synthesis, as well as structural, spectroscopic and magnetic characterization of novel molecular material based on copper(II) complex with aliphatic bidentate polyamine and octacyanidometallate(IV) which shows a high number of cyanido bridges. The consequent objective was the study of potential photomagnetic properties of this new material. Methods: A newly synthesized compound [CuII(Me 2 en) ][CuII(Me 2 en) 2][MoIV(CN) 8]· 6 H 2 O (1), Me 2 en = N,N– dimethylethylenediamine, was investigated structurally using single crystal X-ray diffraction, spectroscopically by studying IR and UV/Vis spectra, and photo- and magnetically characterized by studying its magnetic response in the dark and under irradiation in a variety of magnetic fields and temperatures. Results: Incorporation of N,N–dimethylethylenediamine (Me 2 en) into the CuII–[MoIV(CN) 8] 4 - system leads to the construction of a novel coordination polymer [CuII(Me 2 en) ][CuII(Me 2 en) 2][MoIV(CN) 8]· 6 H 2 O (1). The assembly reveals the unique structure consisting of 1 –D chains constructed of {[Cu(Me 2 en) ][Mo(CN) 8]}n 2 n- ladders with {[Cu(Me 2 en) 2] 2 n+ pendant arms connected through cyanido–bridges to the Mo(IV) centers. Structural parameters of 1 were compared with other Cu(II) –Mo(IV) compounds with bidentate aliphatic polyamine ligands. Magnetic studies of 1 indicate paramagnetic behavior with weak antiferromagnetic interactions at low temperature. Photomagnetic studies with the application of 405, 473, 532 and 650 nm light sources and white light show no detectable <b>photomagnetic</b> <b>effect.</b> Conclusion: Novel 1 –D ladder with pendant arms [CuII(Me 2 en) ][CuII(Me 2 en) 2][MoIV(CN) 8]· 6 H 2 O (1) coordination polymer reveals unprecedented topological pattern and shows one of the highest complexities among 1 –D octacyanidometallate– based chains. The local environments of metal centers were compared with other Cu(II) –Mo(IV) assemblies containing bidentate chelating polyamine ligands. In accordance with this analysis, two types of copper(II) moieties were distinguished among this kind of assemblies. Moreover, the analysis of [Mo(CN) 8] 4 - for systems with various dimensionalities shows the same geometry and structural parameters of the moieties, differing in the number of bridging cyanides. Despite similar structural, spectroscopic and magnetic properties of 1 in comparison with other copper(II) complexes with aliphatic polyamines and octacyanidomolybdate(IV) revealing <b>photomagnetic</b> <b>effect,</b> no light induced increase of magnetization was observed.

While the Fe(qsal- 5 NO 2) 2 ·Solv solid is essentially low spin (S = 0) and requires temperatures above 300 K to undergo a S = 0 ↔ S = 2 spin-state switching, the Fe(pap- 5 NO 2) 2 one presents a strongly cooperative first-order transition (T↓ = 291 K, T↑ = 308 K) centered at room temperature associated with a <b>photomagnetic</b> <b>effect</b> at 10 K (TLIESST = 58 K). The investigation of these magnetic behaviors was conducted with single-crystal X-ray diffraction (1, 100 and 320 K; 2, 100 K), Mössbauer, IR, UV–vis (1 and 2 ·Solv), and differential scanning calorimetry (1) measurements. The Mössbauer analysis supports a description of these compounds as FeII Schiff-base complexes and the occurrence of a metal-centered spin crossover process. In comparison with FeIII analogues, it appears that an expanded coordination sphere stabilizes the valence 2 + state of the Fe ion in both complexes. Strong hydrogen-bonding interactions that implicate the phenolato group bound to FeII promote the required extra-stabilization of the S = 2 state and thus determines the spin transition of 1 centered at room temperature. In the lattice, the hydrogen-bonded sites form infinite chains interconnected via a three-dimensional network of intermolecular van der Waals contacts and π–π interactions. Therefore, the spin transition of 1 involves the synergetic influence of electrostatic and elastic interactions, which cause the enhancement of cooperativity and result in the bistability at room temperature...|$|E
