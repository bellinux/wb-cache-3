40|$|In {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} drives, the combination of power-electronic converter and a motor phase defines a resonant circuit, comprised by the motor phase inductance and the parasitic capacitance of converter switches, power cables and motor phase winding. If a motor <b>phase</b> <b>is</b> <b>excited</b> by applying very short voltage pulses, the resonance frequency of the circuit can be observed through the subsequent damped oscillation of the induced voltage in the phase. As the phase inductance and associated resonance frequency depend on the rotor position, the method provides a means for estimating the rotor position. This paper discusses {{the influence of the}} magnetic inductive coupling between motor phases on the observed damped voltage resonance. It is shown that the motor-converter combination can be modelled as a system comprising different resonant circuits, each associated with one phase of the machine, which are mutually coupled due to the inductive coupling between the motor phases. An eigenvalue analysis reveals the different eigenfrequencies and modes of oscillation for this system. It follows from the analysis that damped voltage resonances occur in all phases of the machine due to the mutual coupling. The model is used to determine the influence of voltage pulses, applied to a single phase or simultaneously applied to different phases, on the observed damped voltage oscillations, and thus on the rotor position estimation...|$|E

Parker and Porter stimulated these fibers by cutting them transversely, a procedure that was particularly successful when it was carried out near the base of a fin. Under such circumstances a light band quickly appeared on the fin in what was obviously the area of peripheral distribution for the severed nerve-fibers. That the operation had caused no serious disturbance in the blood supply to the region concerned could be shown by a microscopic examination of the living skin in the band itself. By this means an unimpeded flow of blood in the light area could easily be demonstrated. Parker and Porter em ployed no other method for stimulating the chromatophoral nerve-fibers than cutting them. In the present paper it is intended to show that an electric current from an inductorium is as efficient a means of stimu lating these fibers is is their severance. It was found convenient to experiment on the anterior dorsal fin of the dogfish. This fish, with its dorsal fin uppermost, can be tied to a wooden carrier and kept indefinitely quiescent by providing it with a current of sea water over its gills. Near the root of its dorsal fin and not far from the anterior edge of this structure a cut 5 mm. long, trans verse to the fin rays and completely through the fin was made as a means of exciting a peripheral light band. Posterior to this cut and in line with it twt moderately large needle holes were made through the fin and about 5 mm. apart. Into each hole was inserted the platinum ele...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the synchronous micromotor concept and presents new investigations on its application as an integrated driving mechanism in microfluidic systems. A spiral channel viscous micropump and a microstirrer are considered and tested as examples {{to verify the}} concept. The fabrication technology of such integrated systems is based on UV depth lithography, electroplating and soft lithography. The synchronous micromotor consists of a stator including double layer coils, and a rotor disk containing alternate permanent magnets. The coils are distributed evenly around the stator and arranged in three <b>phases.</b> The <b>phases</b> <b>are</b> <b>excited</b> by sinusoidal currents with a corresponding phase shift resulting in a rotating magnetic field. Regarding the spiral channel viscous micropump, a spiral disk was fixed onto the rotor disk and run at different rotational speeds. Tests showed very promising results, with a flow rate up to 1023 µL·min− 1 at a motor rotational speed of 4500 rpm. Furthermore, {{for the application of}} a microstirred-tank bioreactor, the rotor disk design was modified to work as a stirrer. The performance of the developed microbioreactor was tested over a time period of approximately 10 h under constant stirring. Tests demonstrated the successful cultivation of S. cerevisiae through the integration of the microstirrer in a microbioreactor system. These systems prove that synchronous micromotors are well suited to serve as integrated driving mechanisms of active microfluidic components...|$|R

The semi-elastic interactions between exact bright solitons and exotic incident waves are illustrated such that we find that exact nonlinear modes almost keep their shapes after interactions even if the exotic incident waves have evidently been changed.

The electron <b>phase</b> space vortices <b>were</b> <b>excited</b> in a strongly magnetized Q-machine plasma by applying a pulse to a segment of a waveguide surrounding the plasma. Depending on the temporal variation of the applied pulse, one or more phase space vortices can <b>be</b> <b>excited,</b> and their interaction can be followed in space and time. We were able to demonstrate, for instance, an irreversible coalescence of two such vortices. These results are extended by numerical simulations, showing how electron phase space vortices can also be formed by beam instabilities. Furthermore, a study of ion <b>phase</b> space vortices <b>is</b> performed by numerical simulations. Both codes allow for an externally applied magnetic field in three spatial dimensions. Ion <b>phase</b> space vortices <b>are</b> formed by the nonlinear saturation of the ion-ion two-stream instability, excited by injecting an ion beam at the plasma boundary.

40|$|We {{consider}} torsional oscillations {{that are}} trapped in a layer of spherical-hole (bubble) nuclear structure, {{which is expected to}} occur in the deepest region of the inner crust of a neutron star. Because this layer intervenes between the phase of slab nuclei and the outer core of uniform nuclear matter, torsional oscillations in the bubble <b>phase</b> can <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> separately from usual crustal torsional oscillations. We find from eigenmode analyses for various models of the equation of state of uniform nuclear matter that the fundamental frequencies of such oscillations are almost independent of the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter, but strongly depend on the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy $L$. Although the frequencies are also sensitive to the entrainment effect, i. e., what portion of nucleons outside bubbles contribute to the oscillations, by having such a portion fixed, we can successfully fit the calculated fundamental frequencies of torsional oscillations in the bubble phase inside a star of specific mass and radius as a function of $L$. By comparing the resultant fitting formula to the frequencies of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed from the soft-gamma repeaters, we find that each of the observed low-frequency QPOs can be identified either as a torsional oscillation in the bubble phase or as a usual crustal oscillation, given generally accepted values of $L$ for all the stellar models considered here...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the dynamics of}} a mathematical model for the mobile barriers designed to close the tidal inlets of the Venice Lagoon and to defend the city from recurrent high waters. The barriers consist {{of a large number}} of steel caissons (hereafter referred to as gates) connected to the seabed with hinges. The gates usually rest horizontally on the sea bottom allowing mass exchange between the sea and the lagoon and are brought into operation during high tides by the inflow of compressed air. When in operation the gates close the lagoon openings even though they may oscillate around their mean position. In the present contribution the barriers are modelled by vertical rigid plates which can slide along the bottom and are subjected to a recoil effect simulating Archimedes' force acting on the real gates. First, the in-phase motion of the gates produced by an incoming wave is studied. Then, by means of a linear stability analysis of this basic motion, it is shown that oscillations of the gates, such that contiguous gates oscillate out of <b>phase,</b> can <b>be</b> <b>excited</b> for suitable values of the wave and barrier characteristics. In particular, the existence of a critical value of the amplitude of the incoming waves is pointed out, below which the in-phase motion of the gates is stable.

40|$|The {{applications}} of switched reluctance machines in electrical vehicles, {{as well as}} in wind and hydro turbines, are gaining increasing attentions from the industries because of their low cost, low inertia and simple construction. In this paper, a low cost high-side power supply for the gate driver of switched reluctance machine is presented. With the use of a bootstrap technology, the high-side circuit acquires energy from the power supply of the low-side when the high-side switch is turned off. The acquired energy is utilized to support the high-side gate driver and current sensor when the <b>phase</b> winding <b>is</b> <b>excited</b> with the DC-link voltage. The circuit requires only a power diode and capacitor for each high-side power electronic switch. Comparing with traditional isolated power supply solutions, the cost and size of the proposed method are reduced. The necessary control algorithm of the gate drive to sustain the high-side voltage is also presented in this paper. Although it slightly increases the computational burden of the controller, it imposes no limit on the control of the phase winding of the machine with proper selection of the bootstrap capacitor. The guideline on the selection of the power electronic components is derived based on the parameters of the switched reluctance machine. Experimental results prove that the proposed scheme is practically feasible, for normal operations of SRM. Department of Electrical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: K. W. E.

40|$|In this paper, an {{alternative}} approach is described that is suited for longer wavelength SARs in particular, employing a large, deployable reflector antenna and a much simpler phased array feed. To illuminate a wide swath, a substantial fraction of the <b>phased</b> array feed <b>is</b> <b>excited</b> on transmit to sub-illuminate the reflector. Shorter transmit pulses are required than for conventional SAR. On receive, a much smaller portion of the <b>phased</b> array feed <b>is</b> used to collect the return echo, so that a greater portion of the reflector antenna area is used. The locus of {{the portion of the}} phased array used on receive is adjusted using an analog beam steering network, to 'sweep' the receive beam(s) across the illuminated swath, tracking the return echo. This is similar in some respects to the whiskbroom approach to optical sensors, hence the name: SweepSAR. SweepSAR has advantages over conventional SAR in that it requires less transmit power, and if the receive beam is narrow enough, it is relatively immune to range ambiguities. Compared to direct radiating arrays with digital beam- forming, it is much simpler to implement, uses currently available technologies, is better suited for longer wavelength systems, and does not require extremely high data rates or onboard processing...|$|R

40|$|We use kinetic particle-in-cell and {{magnetohydrodynamic}} simulations {{supported by}} an observational dataset to investigate magnetic reconnection in clusters of null points in space plasma. The magnetic configuration under investigation {{is driven by}} fast adiabatic flux rope compression that dissipates {{almost half of the}} initial magnetic field energy. In this <b>phase</b> powerful currents <b>are</b> <b>excited</b> producing secondary instabilities, and the system is brought into a state of `intermittent turbulence' within a few ion gyro-periods. Reconnection events are distributed all over the simulation domain and energy dissipation is rather volume-filling. Numerous spiral null points interconnected via their spines form null lines embedded into magnetic flux ropes; null point pairs demonstrate the signatures of torsional spine reconnection. However, energy dissipation mainly happens in the shear layers formed by adjacent flux ropes with oppositely directed currents. In these regions radial null pairs are spontaneously emerging and vanishing, associated with electron streams and small-scale current sheets. The number of spiral nulls in the simulation outweighs the number of radial nulls by a factor of 5 [...] 10, in accordance with Cluster observations in the Earth's magnetosheath. Twisted magnetic fields with embedded spiral null points might indicate the regions of major energy dissipation for future space missions such as Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that normal mode {{coupling}} in large diameter piezoelectric plates causes serious difficulties when attempting to operate over wide frequency bands. As a consequence transducers are commonly constructed as a mosaic of elemental resonators, each of which has a predominant single mode of mechanical oscillation at the frequency of interest. Such transducer arrays may be electrically steered to angles other than normal by applying different phases of driving voltages to different elements. A continuous plate {{can also be used to}} steer a radiated beam using normal mode coupling in a narrow band system. 	The technique is to adjust the frequency of the driving voltage to match the travelling wave velocity of the normal mode which possesses the desired spatial phase relationship across the face of the plate. If the electrodes of a continuous piezoelectric plate are segmented so that regions of the plate can be driven with different phases, adjacent normal modes corresponding to a sine-cosine spatial <b>phasing</b> can <b>be</b> preferentially <b>excited</b> to generate a travelling wave.
