5|$|Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins still {{recite the}} Rig Veda at {{religious}} ceremonies, prayers and other occasions. These ceremonies include birth, wedding, initiation ceremonies, {{as well as}} death rituals. Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include Vastushanti which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house, Satyanarayana Puja, originating in Bengal in the 19th century, is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no <b>particular</b> <b>reason.</b> Invoking {{the name of the}} family's gotra and the kula daivat are important aspects of these ceremonies. Like most other Hindu communities, Deshasthas have a shrine called a devaghar in their house with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities. Ritual reading of religious texts called pothi is also popular.|$|E

25|$|In World War I, in Ottoman-ruled Syria {{the total}} number of {{civilian}} casualties was as many as 500,000. The civilian casualties of Greater Syria, including Akkar, were covered in a detailed article by Linda Schatkowski Schilcher. Scholars acknowledge one <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> for civilian deaths attributed to Germany (Ottoman ally in World War I), the callousness of German military officials in Syria, and systematic hoarding by the population at large.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the {{suggestion}} that John's son Donald Balloch stirred up rebellion in 1429 to avenge his father's death. However Alexander will have {{wanted to make a}} show of force in Ross following his wife's death, and his imprisonment in Inverness gave him a <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to take revenge on that town. His great-nephew's Raid on Ross in 1491 provides a possible template – capture the garrison at Inverness, then head north to ravage the lands of royalist sympathisers in Ross.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, the {{franchise}} was still available to wealthier Catholics. Until 1728, Catholics voted in House of Commons elections and held {{seats in the}} Lords. For no <b>particular</b> <b>reason,</b> beyond a general pressure for Catholics to conform, they were barred from voting in the election for the first parliament in the reign of George II. Privileges were also mostly limited to supporters of the Church of Ireland. Protestants who did not recognise the state-supported Church were also discriminated against in law, so non-conformists such as Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Quakers also had a subservient status in Parliament; after 1707 they could hold seats, but not public offices. Thus, the new system favoured a new Anglican establishment in Church and State.|$|E

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970s, transformations like HSV or HSI were used as a {{compromise}} between effectiveness for segmentation and computational complexity. They {{can be thought of}} as similar in approach and intent to the neural processing used by human color vision, without agreeing in particulars: if the goal is object detection, roughly separating hue, lightness, and chroma or saturation is effective, but there is no <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to strictly mimic human color response. John Kender’s 1976 master’s thesis proposed the HSI model. Ohta et al. (1980) instead used a model made up of dimensions similar to those we have called I, α, and β. In recent years, such models have continued to see wide use, as their performance compares favorably with more complex models, and their computational simplicity remains compelling.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There {{is no way of}} determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was no <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason of}} the {{interest}} for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve case, is that K may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves C that have no point defined over K, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to E, which by definition has a point over K to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish C that have genus 1, from elliptic curves E that have a K-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in K). The curves C {{turn out to be}} torsors over E, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that K is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve C over Q has no <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over K to put C into that form over K.|$|E

25|$|Also {{at about}} this time, John C. Bennett {{reported}} that Smith had offered a cash reward {{to anyone who}} would assassinate Boggs, and that Smith had admitted to him that Rockwell had done the deed. He {{went on to say}} that Rockwell had made a veiled threat against Bennett's life if he publicized the story. Joseph Smith vehemently denied Bennett's account, speculating that Boggs — no longer governor, but campaigning for state senate — was attacked by an election opponent. Mormon writer Monte B. McLaws, in the Missouri Historical Review, supported Smith, averring that while there was no clear finger pointing to anyone, Governor Boggs was running for election against several violent men, all capable of the deed, and that there was no <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> to suspect Rockwell of the crime. This opinion was not shared by Rockwell's most noted biographer, Harold Schindler. Whatever the case, the following year Rockwell was arrested, tried, and acquitted of the attempted murder (Bushman, p.468), although most of Boggs' contemporaries remained convinced of his guilt.|$|E

500|$|Like Albany's flag, the Prince's Flag was an orange, white, {{and blue}} tricolor. The orange {{was derived from}} the coat of arms of the Prince of Orange, William the Silent. After 1660, the orange stripe had been {{replaced}} by a red one, as the Dutch flag still remains, though no <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> is cited. [...] Albany chose to use the historic flag as its base. The flag was surrounded by controversy in 1916, when Albany's Common Council voted to change the colors to red, white, and blue as a show of patriotism during World War I. The change was vetoed by Mayor Joseph Stevens.|$|E
500|$|Broadcasters {{could also}} collect {{carriage}} {{fees for the}} stations they operate under sharing agreements {{on behalf of their}} owner, often bundling its carriage agreements with those of stations they own outright. This could, especially in LMAs between two stations affiliated with the [...] "major" [...] networks, allow the broadcaster to charge higher fees for retransmission consent to television providers for carrying the stations, which could result in smaller cable companies not being able to afford the higher fees imposed. Cable television providers advocated barring sharing agreements between television stations for this <b>particular</b> <b>reason.</b> In the United States, the FCC no longer allows broadcasters to collude with one another in negotiating retransmission consent fees.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} reasons why crusaders volunteered to [...] "take the cross". One <b>particular</b> <b>reason</b> was the desire of repentance. Remorse for the cruelty that he had inflicted upon his own brother may well have {{played a part in}} Lǫgmaðr's decision. If remorse was not a factor, it is {{possible}} that Lǫgmaðr merely intended to earn a pardon by way of a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Embarking upon a crusade could also be a means of escaping political tribulations and pressure at home, {{as in the case of}} the embattled Robert II, Duke of Normandy (died 1134). In Lǫgmaðr's case, his participation may have been a direct after-effect of Magnús' conquest of the Isles in 1098, or the aforesaid later revival of Uí Briain encroachment in Dublin and the Isles.|$|E
