5|$|At {{the age of}} six, Flanagan's parents {{gave him}} a {{clarinet}} for Christmas. He learned to read music from playing the clarinet, but {{within a few years}} he preferred the piano. The family had a <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house, and Flanagan received lessons from one of his brothers, Johnson, and Gladys Wade Dillard, who also taught Kirk Lightsey and Barry Harris. Flanagan graduated from Northern High School, which he attended with other future musicians, including Sonny Red.|$|E
5|$|He {{married the}} violinist and {{composer}} Claire Delbos also in 1932. Their marriage {{inspired him to}} both compose works for her to play (Thème et variations for violin and <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year they were married) and to write pieces to celebrate their domestic happiness, including the song cycle Poèmes pour Mi in 1936, which he orchestrated in 1937. Mi was Messiaen's affectionate nickname for his wife. In 1937 their son Pascal was born. The marriage turned to tragedy when Delbos lost her memory after an operation and {{spent the rest of}} her life in mental institutions.|$|E
5|$|The Foehls knew {{many in the}} Hollywood film industry, and {{a number}} of film stars stayed at the hotel. In late December 1957, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood celebrated their wedding {{reception}} at the hotel. Bette Davis, Roy Rogers, Bing Crosby, Frankie Avalon, Humphrey Bogart, Betty Grable, Janet Leigh, Marilyn Monroe, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and Tony Curtis were known to have stayed there. Sometimes late at night, Jimmy Durante would come down from his room to play the <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lounge for other sleepless guests. The Foehls ran the hotel very closely—they lived on the premises.|$|E

5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom. By connecting the output {{of a network of}} student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} {{a mix of}} seating options. At one end are eight tables, four to each side, each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a wet bar and several groups of seats. The stairs to the lower level are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an electric <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower level, which has since been removed.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his mental problems, and {{suggested}} that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family's basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa {{died of a heart attack}} on September 17, 2002, in a veterans' hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.|$|E

5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting in the attic, where he had several Studer tape recorders. Little was done with them until fellow Beatle Paul McCartney came over and helped re-install them in sequence, so overdubs could be made. Lennon could thus record his own doubletracked song demos. (These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made in the attic, have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting. Lennon also wrote on an upright <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunroom.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. There was always a <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought him a new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E
5|$|The Medical City Lewisville (formerly Medical Center of Lewisville) Grand Theater, known informally as the MCL Grand, is on {{the east}} side of Interstate 35E in Lewisville's Old Town. It is a hub for the arts in Lewisville, able to show films, host meetings, and provide a venue for various kinds of artistic performance. The project began in 2004 and aimed to fulfill a {{long-term}} goal of building an arts center to coincide with the 2011 opening of the Old Town Station. The facility opened in January 2011 with a series of performances, children's shows, concerts, and exhibits, and the Greater Lewisville Arts Alliance presented the theater with a $25,000 contribution to begin their fundraiser to place a Steinway <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theater. In 2011 and 2012, The Flower Mound Connection newspaper named the MCL Grand the best events venue in Denton County.|$|E

5|$|The {{instrument}} {{evolved from}} Rhodes' attempt to manufacture pianos to teach recovering soldiers during World War II under a strict budget, and development continued throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Fender started marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down {{version of the}} piano, but the full-size instrument did not appear until after the sale to CBS in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in jazz, pop, and soul music. It fell out of fashion {{for a while in}} the mid-1980s, principally due to the emergence of polyphonic and later digital synthesizers, especially the Yamaha DX7, and partly through inconsistent quality control in production due to cost-cutting measures. The company was eventually sold to Roland, which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization or approval from its inventor.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits {{on top of the}} piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} games were {{developed}} by Atlus, while Ronde was handled by Multimedia Intelligence Transfer, and the Blind Thinker titles by Bbmf Corporation. All the games were published by Atlus in Japan; {{none of them have}} been released in English, but the user interface of Majin Tensei II is in English rather than Japanese. Rather than the Megami Tensei series regular Tsukasa Masuko, the soundtracks for the {{first two games}} were composed by Hidehito Aoki; he composed the Majin Tensei music on his own, and cooperated with Misaki Okibe on Majin Tensei II. He made use of ambient music, while also incorporating elements of funk, electronic distortion and sound effects; for the second game, he also introduced a focus on synthesized <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> compositions. Music albums featuring the first two games' original soundtracks, along with new arrangements, were released by Pony Canyon: Majin Tensei Excellence Sound Collection was published on March 18, 1994, and Majin Tensei II: Spiral Nemesis Excellence Sound Collection on May 19, 1995. A Majin Tensei manga by Shinshū Ueda, titled Majin Tensei: The True Remembrance, was published by Enix in five volumes.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore {{was also}} home to the piano-building {{businesses}} of William Knabe and Charles Steiff. Knabe emigrated to <b>the</b> United States <b>in</b> 1831, and he founded the firm, with Henry Gaehle, in 1837. It began manufacturing <b>pianos</b> <b>in</b> 1839. <b>The</b> company {{became one of the}} most prominent and respected <b>piano</b> manufacturers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, and was <b>the</b> dominant corporation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern market. The company floundered after a fire destroyed a factory, and the aftermath of the Civil War lessened demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern area where Knabe's sales were concentrated. By the end of the 19th century, however, Knabe's sons, Ernest and William, had re-established the firm as one of <b>the</b> leading <b>piano</b> companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. They built sales <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west and north, and created new designs that made Knabe & Co. the third best-selling <b>piano</b> manufacturer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. <b>The</b> <b>pianos</b> were well regarded enough that the Japanese government chose Knabe as its supplier for schools <b>in</b> 1879. After <b>the</b> death of William and Ernest Knabe, the company went public. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, Knabe's company became absorbed into other corporations, and the pianos are now manufactured by Samick, a Korean producer.|$|R
50|$|Baldwin, {{like many}} other manufacturers, began {{building}} player <b>pianos</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. A <b>piano</b> factory was constructed <b>in</b> Cincinnati, Ohio. <b>The</b> models became unpopular {{by the end of}} the 1920s, which, coupled with the beginning of the Great Depression, could have spelled disaster for Baldwin. However, the company's president, Lucien Wulsin II, had created a large reserve fund for such situations, and Baldwin was able to ride out the market downturn.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the <b>piano</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E
