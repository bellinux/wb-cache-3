500|$|Percy Olsen, {{television}} {{editor for}} Student Life, said [...] "The Coon" [...] was {{an improvement over}} [...] "The Ring" [...] because it was less heavy-handed in its morals.

She also said the target material for [...] "The Coon" [...] is too easy, but she said the episode was [...] "really likable" [...] and she particularly liked Cartman's growing frustration when his superhero persona is ignored. Travis Fickett of IGN also said he did not like the ending and, although he liked Butters' part in the episode and the riffing on comic book stereotypes, Fickett felt the episode lacked any [...] "brilliant moments" [...] and [...] "ultimately runs out of steam with the super-hero riff". Mitchell Geller of The Tufts Daily said the episode would be more enjoyable to <b>people</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> comic book film franchise it was spoofing than it would be for those who are not, although he said Cartman [...] "never ceases to be funny".

2500|$|Brian Wayne Peterson and Todd Slavkin {{revealed}} that {{they planned to}} introduce more DC Comics characters into Smallville this season.

This version of Maxima {{had the ability to}} make herself irresistible to men, including Clark, whom she set her sights on; actress Charlotte Sullivan was cast as Maxima. Smallville also introduced the futuristic heroes from the Legion of Super-Heroes. Comic book scribe Geoff Johns wrote the episode that featured the Legion of Super-Heroes, and suggested that <b>people</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Legion would recognize them when they appeared on the show, as they had some of the quintessential elements of their comic book counterparts. Darren Swimmer stated that they would be using Saturn Girl, Cosmic Boy and Lightning Lad for this episode. In the seventeenth episode, [...] "Hex", Smallville puts its spin on the DC character Zatanna. Portrayed by Serinda Swan, Zatanna is a magician who comes to town and grants Chloe a birthday wish that results in Chloe's body transforming into Lois. In an interview, writer Bryan Q. Miller explains that he read through archived comics featuring the Zatanna character, but was more influenced by Grant Morrison’s writing turn on Seven Soldiers, as well as the television episodes of [...] and Justice League Unlimited that Zatanna made appearances on. Swan won the role of Zatanna after [...] "acing" [...] her audition thanks to the actress recording Zatanna's spells into her iPod and studying them in reverse—to cast a spell Zatanna recites the words in reverse.|$|E
