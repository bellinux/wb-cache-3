5000|$|During the Bronze Age, a {{significant}} settlement arose that had {{contacts with the}} civilizations of the Aegean; these contacts are most visible during the Subapennine phase, when fragments of Mycenaean ceramics are found at the site. From {{the beginning of the}} Protoapennine phase, there is evidence for the extraction of <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> from <b>murex</b> shells and for pressing of olives to extract olive oil. The <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> production, starting around 1800 BC, is the earliest yet attested in Italy. This dye production increased through the 14th century BC, but sharply dropped off by the 12th century in the Subapennine phase. Some areas near the fortifications and on the shore of the lagoon were dedicated both to the processing and storage of cereals and to the extraction of purple dye; these activities were later moved within the settlement. The site was defended by dry stone fortification walls.|$|R
5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources of <b>purple</b> <b>dye,</b> particularly the <b>murex</b> snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{is based on}} the references in some versions to purple or purple-dyed cloth. The purple dye extracted from the <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> <b>murex</b> snail and related species was highly prized in ancient times. Clothing made of cloth dyed with Tyrian purple was a mark of great wealth and high station (hence the phrase [...] "royal purple"). The association of gold with purple is natural and occurs frequently in literature.|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> <b>murex</b> (Bolinus brandaris) from the Gulf of Gabès was studied through gonad histology and calculation of bio-physiological indices (general condition index - K and gonadosomatic index - GSI). The shell length at first sexual maturity (SL 50) of B. brandaris was also investigated using a macroscopic maturation scale. The population sex ratio was statistically unbalanced (M:F = 1 : 1. 5), with a significant dominance of females. Monthly variation in gonad maturation stages, K and GSI revealed that B. brandaris has an annual reproductive cycle, long period of gonadal activity and slight asynchrony between sexes. The spawning season extended between April and July, with a clear spawning peak from May to June. The SL 50 was reached at 56. 4 mm in females and 54. 6 mm in males. At present, B. brandaris has no commercial value in Tunisia, but it is predictable that {{it will become a}} fishery-exploited species in the near future. The present data, particularly the timing of spawning season and the size at first sexual maturity, constitute baseline information for the proposal of fishery management measures, aiming to ensure sustainable exploitation and long-term preservation of this alternative fishing resource...|$|E
40|$|The {{artisanal fishery}} for muricid {{gastropods}} in the Ria Formosa lagoon (Algarve coast, southern Portugal) is a locally important fishing activity because the banded murex (Hexaplex trunculus) and the <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> <b>murex</b> (Bolinus brandaris) are greatly appreciated seafoods with high commercial {{value in the}} Portuguese seafood market. An integrated study was implemented to monitor the muricid gastropod fishery with the artisanal fishing gear (“wallet-line”) through monthly experimental fishing operations carried out during one year. The aim was to describe the fishing operations and fishing gear, to estimate the fishing yield, to characterise the target species catch composition, and to identify by-catch species and discards. The “wallet-line” is neither a species-specific nor a size-selective fishing gear, because the catches comprised a variety of by-catch species and {{a high proportion of}} commercially under-sized target species. The vast majority of the by-catch is discarded immediately on board, so mortality is presumably negligible. The CPUE of both target species and by-catch species decreased during consecutive fishing days, mainly due to declining bait attraction. Considering the overall information gathered on this fishing activity, some management measures are proposed for this artisanal fishery, which might ultimately contribute to the long-term sustainable exploitation of the fishing resource...|$|E
5000|$|The {{textiles}} {{industry in}} Carthage probably started in private homes, but {{the existence of}} professional weavers indicates that a sort of factory system later developed. Products included embroidery, carpets, {{and use of the}} <b>purple</b> <b>murex</b> <b>dye</b> (for which the Carthaginian isle of Djerba was famous). Metalworkers developed specialized skills, i.e., making various weapons for the armed forces, as well as domestic articles, such as knives, forks, scissors, mirrors, and razors (all articles found in tombs). Artwork in metals included vases and lamps in bronze, also bowls, and plates. Other products came from such crafts as the potters, the glassmakers, and the goldsmiths. Inscriptions on votive stele indicate that many were not slaves but 'free citizens'.|$|R
25|$|The Paleolithic {{showcase}} {{displays the}} journey of man through the stone age, covering important {{events such as the}} discovery of fire, hunting and cave paintings. The Neolithic showcase covers the dawn of agriculture, animal domestication, the beginnings of pottery, villages and religion. The terracotta figurines collection shows their evolution from the Bronze Age to the Roman era, and their importance in the development of religion. The metal figurines collection includes mostly males and gods, used as symbols of power. The Bronze Age displays show artefacts dated between 3000 BC and 1200 BC including evidence of early writing, trade and urbanization. The Iron Age displays shows evidence of the invasions of seafaring raiders and city states during the period between 1200 BC and 400 BC. The Phoenician showcases display the extraction of <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> from <b>murex</b> shells, pottery and Phoenician glass. Phoenician religion is represented by a large stelae of a priest, a throne of Astarte, libation spoons and a glass amulet. Another notable feature of this section is the Ford Mandible dating from the 5th century BC showing the earliest known example of dentistry. The Bodashtar inscription is also displayed along with an explanation of the development of the linear alphabet. The Classical period collection includes funerary reliefs from Palmyra, Egypt and the Levant, a Byzantine mosaic and collection of funerary sarcophagi displayed on the staircase leading to the mezzanine. The Islamic period displays materials from the Umayyad Period in 656 AD to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century where glazed tiles and plates are shown. The newly-added mezzanine includes table cases displaying small objects such as a collection of coins, scarabs and seals, lamps, amulets, cosmetics, jewelry, tools and weapons.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} sex, size and reproductive status on the meat yield (soft tissues proportion) of the <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> <b>murex</b> (Bolinus brandaris) from the Ria Formosa lagoon (southern Portugal). During one year of monthly sampling (October 2008 - September 2009), average meat yield of B. brandaris was 40. 5 ± 6. 1 % (range: 25. 8 - 56. 1 % wet weight), with {{no significant differences between}} sexes. Relationships established between specimen size and soft parts weight indicated that both shell length and total weight are excellent indicators of meat yield. Significant differences in meat yield between size classes further reinforced the trend of increasing meat yield during ontogeny. Meat yield exhibited significant monthly variation and a similar temporal trend in both sexes, which were directly related to the reproductive status. Meat yield of B. brandaris was compared with that of other muricid species and the marked influence of the reproductive status on meat yield prompted a comparative assessment of the spawning season and peak of three sympatric muricids (B. brandaris, Hexaplex trunculus and Stramonita haemastoma). Overall, these findings have implications at diverse levels, including the management, regulation and inspection of this fishing/harvesting activity and the commercialization and consumption of this seafood product...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} reports {{the growth rate}} of the <b>purple</b> <b>dye</b> <b>murex,</b> Bolinus brandaris (Gastropoda: Muricidae), {{estimated}} from mark-recapture experiments. A total of 1067 specimens (shell length = 43. 4 ± 8. 1 mm, range = 14. 6 − 78. 4 mm) were marked with Dymo® tape tags and released in a semi-intensive fish culture earthen pond. After a period at liberty ranging from almost two months to around two years, 288 individuals were recaptured (shell length = 67. 4 ± 6. 2 mm, range = 45. 3 − 88. 6 mm), which corresponded to a recapture rate of 27. 0 %. At recapture, only one specimen had lost the tag (tag loss rate < 0. 1 %) and all remaining tags were intact and legible. Mean monthly growth rates were 0. 9 ± 1. 0 mm in shell length, 0. 4 ± 0. 5 mm in shell width and 0. 7 ± 0. 7 g in total weight. Growth rates showed high inter-individual variability and an evident decreasing trend with specimen size. Comparison of growth rates with similar information available for other muricids confirmed that B. brandaris is a relatively slow-growing species. This provides valuable information for both fisheries management and for assessing the potential of B. brandaris as a candidate species for molluscan aquaculture...|$|E
