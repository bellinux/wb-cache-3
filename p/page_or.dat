5|$|The Florida State University Libraries {{house one}} of the largest {{collections}} of documents in the state of Florida. The Libraries' collections include over 3.2 million volumes, with a website offering access to more than 1,064 databases, 119,385 e-journals, and over 1.1 million e-books. In total, Florida State has thirteen libraries and millions of books and journals to choose from. The collection covers virtually all disciplines and includes a wide array of formats – from books and journals to manuscripts, maps, and recorded music. Increasingly collections are digital and are accessible on the Internet via the library web <b>page</b> <b>or</b> the library catalog. The FSU Library System also maintains subscriptions to a vast number of online databases which can be accessed from any student account on or off campus. The current dean of the Library System is Julia Zimmerman, who oversees a staff of over 268 employees and a $17.5million annual budget recorded in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics <b>page</b> <b>or</b> Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E

50|$|Electronic Yellow <b>Pages</b> <b>or</b> Online Yellow <b>Pages</b> use {{software}} to quickly edit and change online content for display on the internet. Printed Yellow <b>Pages</b> <b>or</b> business directories often discontinue publication to limit printing costs and instead publish {{directly to the}} internet as a web directory. Online yellow <b>pages</b> <b>or</b> directories continue publishing online because advertisers pay for the visual exposure from those who read or use these online publications on the internet. Publishers or people that create these online directories create software with their own resources or use opensource or Off-the shelf {{software to}} build their website or online directory. Banana Pages was an online directory function built with their own resources. The cost of online yellow <b>pages</b> <b>or</b> online directory software is limited compared to the large cost of physical printing and distribution of a phone book or directory of information.|$|R
