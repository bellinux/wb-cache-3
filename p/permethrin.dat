5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack jumper ant is {{successful}} in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals like bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and <b>permethrin</b> are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests {{if they are in}} a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, <b>permethrin,</b> pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E
25|$|Wear proper {{clothing}} to reduce mosquito bites. When weather permits, wear long sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clothes with repellent containing <b>permethrin</b> or another EPA-registered repellent will give extra protection. Clothing treated with <b>permethrin</b> is commercially available. Mosquito repellents containing <b>permethrin</b> are not approved for application directly to skin.|$|E
25|$|For the larval (and nymph stage) ticks you may use <b>permethrin</b> cream (available at pharmacies).|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatments}} include lindane, benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, malathion, and sulfur preparations. Lindane is effective, but {{concerns over}} potential neurotoxicity have limited its availability in many countries. It is banned in California, {{but may be}} used in other states as a second-line treatment. Sulfur ointments or benzyl benzoate are often used in the developing world due to their low cost; Some 10% sulfur solutions {{have been shown to be}} effective, and sulfur ointments are typically used for at least a week, though many people find the odor of sulfur products unpleasant. Crotamiton has been found to be less effective than <b>permethrin</b> in limited studies. Crotamiton or sulfur preparations are sometimes recommended instead of <b>permethrin</b> for children, due to concerns over dermal absorption of <b>permethrin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Permethrin</b> sprayed on {{clothing}} kills ticks on contact, and is {{sold for}} this purpose. According to the CDC, only DEET is effective at repelling ticks.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{insecticides}} {{used for}} the treatment of head lice include organochlorines (lindane), organophosphates (malathion), carbamates (carbaryl), pyrethrins (pyrethrum), pyrethroids (<b>permethrin,</b> phenothrin, bioallethrin), and spinosad (spinosyn A and spinosyn D).|$|E
25|$|Pesticides - Biopesticides such as {{chitosan}} {{have been}} tested for protection against the mountain pine beetle, and pesticides such as carbaryl, <b>permethrin,</b> and bifenthrin are used for smaller area applications.|$|E
25|$|Ivermectin is {{the normal}} {{treatment}} for riding rabbits and small mammals of Haemaphysalis leporispalustris. Insecticides such as pyrethrin, <b>permethrin,</b> and amitraz are dangerous to small mammals {{and must be}} avoided.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} {{that all people}} {{in areas that are}} endemic for malaria use long-lasting insecticide nets. A cohort study found that within refugee camps in Pakistan, insecticide treated bed nets were very useful in reducing malaria cases. A single treatment of the nets with the insecticide <b>permethrin</b> remained protective throughout the 6 month transmission season.|$|E
25|$|Another crucial {{preventive}} measure {{is the use}} of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or <b>permethrin</b> (pyrethroids). These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active ticks in the environment. Formulations of these ingredients are available in a variety of topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are available to}} treat those infected, including <b>permethrin,</b> crotamiton, and lindane creams and ivermectin pills. Sexual contacts within the last month and {{people who live in}} the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{simplest}} methods of prevention and treatment focus on preventing infestation of body lice. Complete change of clothing, washing the infested clothing in hot water, {{and in some cases}} also treating recently used bedsheets all help to prevent typhus by removing potentially infected lice. Clothes also left unworn and unwashed for 7 days also cause both lice and their eggs to die, as they have no access to their human host. Another form of lice prevention requires dusting infested clothing with a powder consisting of 10% DDT, 1% malathion, or 1% <b>permethrin,</b> which kill lice and their eggs.|$|E
25|$|Mass-treatment {{programs}} that use topical <b>permethrin</b> or oral ivermectin {{have been effective}} in reducing the prevalence of scabies {{in a number of}} populations. No vaccine is available for scabies. The simultaneous treatment of all close contacts is recommended, even if they show no symptoms of infection (asymptomatic), to reduce rates of recurrence. Since mites can survive for only two to three days without a host, other objects in the environment pose little risk of transmission except in the case of crusted scabies, thus cleaning is of little importance. Rooms used by those with crusted scabies require thorough cleaning.|$|E
25|$|The hairy rove beetle is {{considered}} beneficial {{in the environment}} {{because it is a}} successful scavenger and predator. However, infestation of houses has been reported by this beetle. A reason why C. maxillosus infests houses is not known for certain, but a study of rearing this beetle in the laboratory has shown that adults like to lay eggs in fresh sand and not sand that is old or contaminated. To solve the problem of infestation certain pesticides have been found to affect the adults and larvae of this beetle and can be used to control their numbers. Atroban, a chemical pesticide composed of <b>permethrin</b> (0.05%), decreases the number of adults and larvae of the family Staphylinidae. Short term reductions of this family were caused by a chemical named demethoate (0.05%). Both of these pesticides were tested on moist spots on poultry dung.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{strategies}} used for monitoring and controlling V. pensylvanica include trapping with synthetic chemical attractants and tree shaking. Experiments on chemical attractants of V. pensylvanica and other generalist wasps show {{the effectiveness of}} using acetic acid in combination with these chemicals separately: isobutanol, heptyl butyrate, and butyl butyrate. Acetic acid alone {{did not have the}} same attractive effects as the chemical combinations. Using a vial dispenser, releasing up to an estimated 2.3 mg of heptyl butyrate per hour increased the number of yellowjackets attracted. In Hawaii, the Christmas tree is a large seasonal import each year. Over 90% of these trees contain live insects. Although V. pensylvanica typically resides in ground nests, queens occasionally choose these trees as overwintering sites. One potential strategy {{to reduce the number of}} yellowjackets and other generalist predators is applying preharvest <b>permethrin</b> sprays in combination with mechanical tree-shaking.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and <b>permethrin</b> are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
2500|$|Aggressively searching out, removing, and {{destroying}} the brood in infested trees {{is the best}} way to slow the spread of mountain pine beetles; however, it may not protect specific trees. Spraying trees to prevent attack is the most effective way to protect a small number of high-value trees from mountain pine beetles. Carbaryl, <b>permethrin</b> and bifenthrin are registered in the United States for use in the prevention of pine beetle infestations. Carbaryl is considered by the EPA to likely be carcinogenic to humans. [...] It is moderately toxic to wild birds and partially to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. <b>Permethrin</b> is easily metabolized in mammalian livers, so is less dangerous to humans. Birds are also practically not affected by <b>permethrin.</b> [...] Negative effects can be seen in aquatic ecosystems, as well as it being very toxic to beneficial insects. Bifenthrin is moderately dangerous to mammals, including humans; it is slightly more toxic to birds and aquatic ecosystems than <b>permethrin,</b> as well as extremely toxic to beneficial insects.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Permethrin</b> is {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment for scabies, and remains the treatment of choice. It is applied from the neck down, usually before bedtime, and left on for about eight to 14 hours, then washed off in the morning. Care should be taken to coat the entire skin surface, not just symptomatic areas; any patch of skin left untreated can provide a [...] "safe haven" [...] for one or more mites to survive. One application is normally sufficient, as <b>permethrin</b> kills eggs and hatchlings, as well as adult mites, though many physicians recommend a second application three to seven days later as a precaution. [...] Crusted scabies may require multiple applications, or supplemental treatment with oral ivermectin (below). <b>Permethrin</b> may cause slight irritation of the skin that is usually tolerable.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, the Department of Health {{distributed}} free Olyset anti-dengue nets treated <b>permethrin</b> insecticide to Gen. T. de Leon High School. Over 150 {{rolls of}} the nets were given and installed {{to the windows}} of the said school, as part of DOH's [...] "Dalaw sa Barangay: Aksyon Kontra Dengue" [...] (Visit Barangay: Action against Dengue) campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in late U.S. Army {{soldiers}} {{deployed to}} Afghanistan (starting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade) were issued an Army-developed {{variant of the}} Crye Precision [...] "MultiCam" [...] pattern, which was seen as far more effective in Afghanistan's terrain. These flame-retardant uniforms are designed to prevent third-degree burns, along with up to thirty percent of second degree burns. Additionally, the uniforms are treated with the chemical <b>permethrin</b> to help protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases like malaria. Some U.S. Army soldiers during the latter stages of the Iraq War also wore the ACU in MultiCam; some were seen wearing them as late as December 2011, when the United States withdrew its military forces from {{the country at the}} end of the war. This particular version has been replaced by the newer ACU in the Operational Camouflage Pattern, as described below.|$|E
2500|$|The journal Pediatrics has {{published}} a study in which lice can be killed by suffocating them using a non-toxic face cleanser to effectively [...] "shrink wrap" [...] them {{over an extended period}} of time achieving a success rate of roughly 95%. The procedure in the study used application of the product Nuvo lotion (Cetaphil), thoroughly combed in with a regular comb and blow dried, and then hair was shampooed after 8 hours. This was repeated once per week for 3 weeks using two study groups: one that followed up by removing nits and the other that did not. There was no appreciable difference in success rates in the groups. In its conclusion, the Journal stated, [...] "Dry-on, suffocation-based, pediculicide lotion effectively treats head lice without neurotoxins, nit removal, or extensive house cleaning. These results are comparable or superior to the results previously reported for treatments with <b>permethrin,</b> pyrethrin, and malathion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several neurotoxins, {{both natural}} and synthetic, are {{designed}} to block the action potential. [...] Tetrodotoxin from the pufferfish and saxitoxin from the Gonyaulax (the dinoflagellate genus responsible for [...] "red tides") [...] block action potentials by inhibiting the voltage-sensitive sodium channel;* * [...] similarly, dendrotoxin from the black mamba snake inhibits the voltage-sensitive potassium channel. [...] Such inhibitors of ion channels serve an important research purpose, by allowing scientists to [...] "turn off" [...] specific channels at will, thus isolating [...] the other channels' contributions; {{they can also be}} useful in purifying ion channels by affinity chromatography or in assaying their concentration. However, such inhibitors also make effective neurotoxins, and have been considered for use as chemical weapons. [...] Neurotoxins aimed at the ion channels of insects have been effective insecticides; one example is the synthetic <b>permethrin,</b> which prolongs the activation of the sodium channels involved in action potentials. [...] The ion channels of insects are sufficiently different from their human counterparts that there are few side effects in humans.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Permethrin</b> can {{be applied}} as a spray. The effects {{are not limited to}} mites: lice, cockroaches, fleas, mosquitos, and other insects will be affected. <b>Permethrin,</b> however, is not known to seriously harm most mammals or birds, as it has a low {{mammalian}} toxicity and is poorly absorbed by skin. However, <b>permethrin</b> is toxic and potentially fatal to cats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Permethrin</b> {{is listed}} as a [...] "restricted use" [...] {{substance}} by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to its high toxicity to aquatic organisms, so <b>permethrin</b> and permethrin-contaminated water should be properly disposed. <b>Permethrin</b> is quite stable, having a half life of 51-71 days in an aqueous environment exposed to light. It is also highly persistent in soil.|$|E
5000|$|Wear proper {{clothing}} to reduce mosquito bites. When weather permits, wear long sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clothes with repellent containing <b>permethrin</b> or another EPA-registered repellent will give extra protection. Clothing treated with <b>permethrin</b> is commercially available. Mosquito repellents containing <b>permethrin</b> are not approved for application directly to skin.|$|E
50|$|Distribution of <b>permethrin</b> {{has been}} studied in rat models, with highest amounts accumulating in fat and the brain. This can be {{explained}} by the lipophilic nature of the <b>permethrin</b> molecule.|$|E
50|$|<b>Permethrin</b> {{is used in}} {{tropical}} areas to prevent mosquito-borne disease such as dengue fever and malaria. Mosquito nets used to cover beds may be treated with a solution of <b>permethrin.</b> This increases {{the effectiveness of the}} bed net by killing parasitic insects before they are able to find gaps or holes in the net. Military personnel training in malaria-endemic areas may be instructed to treat their uniforms with <b>permethrin,</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Permethrin</b> is an 'insecticide' {{that kills}} ticks on contact. <b>Permethrin</b> {{can be used}} on {{clothing}} but not on skin.One application of <b>permethrin</b> to pants, socks, and shoes typically stays effective through several washings.Pre-treated clothing is available and remains protective for many (up to 70) washings.Check skin and clothes for ticks edaily. The immature forms of these ticks are very small and may be hard to see.Check hair, underarms, and groin for ticks.|$|E
50|$|Pesticide-grade <b>permethrin</b> is {{toxic to}} cats. Many cats die after being given flea {{treatments}} intended for dogs, or by contact with dogs having recently {{been treated with}} <b>permethrin.</b> In cats it may induce hyperexcitability, tremors, seizures, and death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Permethrin</b> {{does not}} present any notable {{genotoxicity}} or immunotoxicity in humans and farm animals, but is classified by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen, based on reproducible {{studies in which}} mice fed <b>permethrin</b> developed liver and lung tumors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Permethrin</b> {{was first}} made in 1973.|$|E
50|$|Excessive {{exposure}} to <b>permethrin</b> can cause nausea, headache, muscle weakness, excessive salivation, shortness of breath, and seizures. Worker {{exposure to}} the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the urinary metabolites, while severe overdose may be confirmed by measurement of <b>permethrin</b> in serum or blood plasma.|$|E
5000|$|Toxic {{exposure}} of <b>permethrin</b> can cause several symptoms, including convulsion, hyperaesthesia, hyperthermia, hypersalivation, {{and loss of}} balance and coordination. Exposure to pyrethroid-derived drugs such as <b>permethrin</b> requires treatment by a veterinarian, otherwise the poisoning is often fatal. This intolerance {{is due to a}} defect in glucuronosyltransferase, a common detoxification enzyme in other mammals (that also makes the cat intolerant to paracetamol and many essential oils). The use of any external parasiticides based on <b>permethrin</b> is contraindicated for cats. (Cat ecotoxicology : cutaneous 100 mg/kg - oral 200 mg/kg.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Permethrin</b> kills ticks and {{mosquitoes}} on {{contact with}} treated clothing. A method of reducing deer tick populations by treating rodent vectors involves stuffing biodegradable cardboard tubes with permethrin-treated cotton. Mice collect the cotton for lining their nests. <b>Permethrin</b> on the cotton instantly kills any immature ticks feeding on the mice.|$|E
