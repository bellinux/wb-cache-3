5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997.

We show that in rats, vaccination with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine can induce good antibody responses even after splenectomy, particularly after a second dose. The spleen remains necessary for a fast, primary response to (blood-borne) polysaccharides, even when they are presented in a conjugated form. Coadministration of a conjugate vaccine with additional nonconjugated polysaccharides of other serotypes did not improve the response to the nonconjugated polysaccharides. We conclude that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines can be of value in protecting asplenic or hyposplenic patients against pneumococcal infections...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{determine}} serotype-specific IgG antibody {{responses to}} reimmunization with <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>vaccine</b> at age 5 years ski children with {{sickle cell anemia}} and (2) to determine whether continued penicillin prophylaxis had any adverse effects on these responses. Study design: Children with sickle cell anemia, who had been treated with prophylactic penicillin for at least 2 years before their fifth birthday, were randomly selected at age 5 years to continue penicillin prophylaxis or to receive placebo treatment, These children had been immunized once or twice in early childhood with <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>vaccine</b> and were reimmunized {{at the time of}} randomization. Results: Serotype-specific IgG antibody responses to reimmunization varied according to pneumococcal serotype but in general were mediocre or poor; the poorest response was to serotype 6 B. The antibody responses were similar in subjects with continued penicillin prophylaxis or placebo treatment, and in subjects who received one or two pneumococcal vaccinations before reimmunization. The occurrence of pneumococcal bacteremia was associated with low IgG antibody concentrations to the infecting serotype. Conclusions: Reimmunization of children with sickle cell anemia who received <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>vaccine</b> at age 5 years induces limited production of serotype-specific IgG antibodies, regardless of previous pneumococcal vaccine history, Continued penicillin prophylaxis does not interfere with serotype-specific IgG antibody responses to reimmunization...|$|E

All patients received PCV 7 at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months following transplantation, and serotype-specific antibody concentrations were determined after each dose.

With regard to PPV 23, {{there has been some}} debate, however, about its protective efficacy against all-cause pneumonia, as opposed to invasive pneumococcal disease, in high-risk cases. PCVs, on the other hand, have been included in many national immunisation programmes for prevention of severe pneumococcal disease in infants and young children, as well as for adults in various high-risk categories. Although innovative and effective, the protective efficacy of PCVs, the composition of which is based on the geographic prevalence and virulence of pneumococcal serotypes, is limited due to colonisation of the nasopharynx with non-vaccine serotypes. This phenomenon of serotype replacement has provided the impetus for development of new generation recombinant protein and whole cell pneumococcal vaccines with the potential to provide serotype-independent protection.

Methods: We searched for relevant publications on six different aspects of usefulness in Online Contents (1992 - 1997), Science Citation Index (1992 - 1997) and Medline (1996 - 1997). Effectiveness studies were ranked according to level of validity and precision. Cited cost-effectiveness analyses determined prevalent direct costs from a societal perspective. Results: Among all pneumococcal infections, pneumonia has most impact on public health but valid and precise data on incidence rates in general practice are lacking. <b>Pneumococcal</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> <b>vaccines</b> induce a protective antibody response in patients at risk.
