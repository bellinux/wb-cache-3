5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several <b>projects</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> {{and improve the}} subway. In the 1990s, it started {{converting}} the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving block signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{relationship}} between hydroelectric projects and the river environment is analyzed. Recently, the large-scale regulation of runoff by large hydroelectric projects in the Ningxia Reach of the Yellow River has altered natural runoff processes, causing {{an increase in the}} probability of low discharge and an overall adjustment of riverbed evolution and river characteristics. During low-flow years, the combined effects of these two changes can weaken the self-purification capacity and reduce the water environmental capacity of the river. This {{is one of the main}} reasons for the recent decrease of water quality in the Ningxia Reach. This research shows that it is necessary to implement river training <b>projects</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> stable flow paths, not only for adjusting river regimes and for flood control, but also for increasing the self-purification capacity and the water environmental capacity of the river.

This study aimed to identify the occurrence of hybrid 'Surubim'in rivers of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, applying molecular techniques. Pseudoplatystoma corruscans, Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum and hybrid 'Surubim'were detected using multiplex PCR and PCR-RFLP in RAG 2, GLOBIN, EF 1 alpha, 18 S rRNA nuclear genes, and mitochondrial 16 S rRNA gene. The results revealed the presence of F- 1 hybrids in rivers and the occurrence of genetic introgression, evidenced by the Post-F- 1 hybrids. Furthermore, discrepancies between the morphological and genetic identification were observed, demonstrating the effectiveness of using different molecular markers for the correct identification of these hybrids. The necessity of implementation of management and conservation <b>projects</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the genetic integrity of native species populations threatened by hybridization in the rivers of Mato Grosso do Sul State is evident...|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{ecological}} integrity necessitates {{a proactive}} approach of identifying and acquiring lands to conserve unfragmented landscapes, {{as well as}} evaluating existing mitigation strategies to increase connectivity in fragmented landscapes. The increased use of highway underpasses and overpasses to restore connectivity for wildlife species offers clear conservation benefits, yet also presents {{a unique opportunity to}} understand how weather conditions may impact movement of wildlife species. We used remote camera observations (19, 480) from an existing wildlife highway underpass in Wyoming and daily meteorological observations to quantify weather conditions associated with autumn migration of mule deer in 2009 and 2010. We identified minimal daily temperature and snow depth as proximate cues associated with mule deer migration to winter range. These weather cues were consistent across does and bucks, but differed slightly by year. Additionally, extreme early season snow depth or cold temperature events appear to be associated with onset of migration. This information will assist wildlife managers and transportation officials as they plan future <b>projects</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> and enhance migration routes for mule deer...|$|E

Critical lessons were drawn from government initiatives in project institutional settings regarding government support, procurement method, tariff formulae, approval system, and dispute resolution process. Four generic strategies used by private sponsors were identified through these case studies including cost leadership, transaction size maximization, localization, and involvement of multilateral financial organization.
