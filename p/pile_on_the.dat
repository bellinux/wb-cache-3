25|$|Kirtley and Naved-ul-Hasan {{continued}} to <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure on the}} third morning, as they eked out two catches and reduced Hampshire to 28 for 5, a lead of 21. However, once again, the all-rounders fought back. Australian Shane Watson made 82, while Pothas added 74, and number 11 Chris Tremlett made an unbeaten 44 to ensure that Hampshire set a competitive target of 271, despite Kirtley's five for 67. Ian Ward made 60 and Murray Goodwin an unbeaten 51 as Sussex cruised to 167 for 3 after only 38 overs on day three, needing 104 more to win on the fourth day.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{ended the}} first day on 132 runs {{for the loss of}} no wickets, thanks to an opening stand between Mohammad Hafeez and Taufeeq Umar. It was the 21st {{consecutive}} Test in which Hafeez and Taufeeq had opened for Pakistan, a record for the team. Taufeeq was dismissed the next morning, leg before wicket to Mahmudullah; Hafeez went on to score his fourth Test century, eventually falling for 143 runs. Pakistan continued to <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> runs with another large partnership, a fifth-wicket stand of 259 runs between Younus Khan and Asad Shafiq over the Test's second and third days. Shafiq scored his first Test century before being dismissed for 104; Younus scored his third Test double century. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq declared with Younus not out for 200 and Pakistan at 594/5.|$|E

25|$|On March 3, 1995, Hug {{entered the}} 1995 Grand Prix at {{the round of}} sixteen {{qualifier}} where his rivalry with Mike Bernardo began. Both fighters traded heavy shots with Bernardo seemingly getting the better until Hug dropped him with a high kick {{towards the end of}} the first round. The South African boxer continued to <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pressure, however, and in the third, knocked Hug down with a left hook shortly followed by a standing eight count. Finally, he forced Hug into a corner and delivered a relentless beating on the Swiss karateka until referee Nobuaki Kakuda finally stopped the bout after a prolonged barrage of unanswered punches. Hug had a quick turnaround, as he was back in the ring on May 4, 1995, scoring a forty-five second knockout over Peter Kramer in a K-1 World Grand Prix 1995 non-tournament affair. On June 10, 1995, Hug made the first defence of his UKF title against Dennis Lane at K-1 Fight Night in Zurich, the first K-1 event held in Switzerland. In a rather one-sided fight, Andy Hug knocked Lane down twice in the first two rounds before the American quit on his stool.|$|E

In a mixed review, Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly praised Aguilera's vocals, which [...] "reaches high enough to dust the angels with bronzer". However, Maerz criticized the overused synthesizers in the track, commenting that [...] "she could be anyone". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen wrote [...] "You can measure a singer's place in the pop-star pecking order by the quality of the Max Martin/Shellback song she releases.

[...] Gregory Hicks for The Michigan Daily criticized that the song's lyrics [...] "aren't even worth a discussion"; he also criticized the synthesizers used in the song and commented that [...] "even Aguilera's flop Bionic had more musical complexity".|$|E
500|$|Hines {{discovered}} {{a way to}} escape from the Ohio Penitentiary. He had been reading the novel Les Misérables and was said to be inspired by Jean Valjean and Valjean's escapes through the passages underneath Paris, France. Hines noticed how dry the lower prison cells felt and how they were lacking in mold, even though sunlight never shined there. This caused him to believe that escape by tunneling down was possible. [...] After discovering an air chamber underneath them, which he had deduced, Hines begun the tunneling effort. The tunnel was only eighteen inches wide, which was just large enough for him to enter the four foot by four foot air chamber that was surrounded by heavy masonry. As Hines and the six others who accompanied Hines and John Hunt Morgan worked on the tunnel, a thin crust of dirt was used to hide the tunneling from the prison officials. They tunneled for six weeks, with the tunnel's exit coming between the inner and the [...] outer prison walls, near a coal <b>pile.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> day of escape, November 26, 1863, Morgan switched cells with his brother, Colonel Richard Morgan. The day was chosen as a new Union military commander was coming to Columbus, and Morgan knew that the prison cells would be inspected at that time. Together, after the daily midnight inspection, Hines, John Hunt Morgan and five captains under Morgan's command used the tunnel to escape. Aided {{by the fact that the}} prison sentries sought shelter from the raging storm occurring at the time, the Confederate officers climbed the [...] wall effortlessly, using metal hooks to effect their escape.|$|E

2500|$|Before World War II, most maize in North America was {{harvested}} by hand. This {{involved a}} {{large numbers of}} workers and associated social events (husking or shucking bees). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the stover) and corn binders, which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize (for example, [...] ). The latter produce sheaves that can be shocked. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash asked why, in [...] Jacob [...] "offered {{sacrifices to}} the God {{of his father}} Isaac," [...] {{and not to the}} God of Abraham and Isaac. Judah ben Pedayah, the nephew of Ben HaKappar, {{explained}} that when one encounters a teacher and the teacher's disciple walking on a road, one first greets the disciple and then the teacher. Rabbi Johanan said that the reason was because a person owes more honor to a parent than to a grandparent. Resh Lakish said that Jacob offered sacrifices (in thanksgiving) for the covenant with the ancestors (which Isaac had conveyed to Jacob with his blessing). Bar Kappara discussed the question with Rabbi Jose bar Patros. One of them said that Jacob declared that as Isaac had been eager for his food (for, as [...] reports, Isaac loved Esau because Esau brought Isaac venison), so Jacob was eager for his food (and thus was headed to Egypt to avoid the famine). The other explained that as Isaac had distinguished between his sons (as [...] reports, loving Esau more than Jacob), so Jacob would distinguish among his sons (going to Egypt for Joseph's account alone). But then Jacob noted on reconsideration that Isaac was responsible for only one soul, whereas Jacob was responsible for 70 souls. Rabbi Judan said that Jacob declared that Isaac blessed him with five blessings, and God correspondingly appeared five times to Jacob and blessed him (in [...] and [...] ). Rabbi Judan also said that Jacob wanted to thank God for permitting Jacob to see the fulfillment of those blessings. And the blessing that was fulfilled was that of [...] "Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you," [...] which was fulfilled with regard to Joseph. (And thus Jacob mentioned Isaac then on going down to witness Joseph's greatness.) Rabbi Berekiah observed that God never unites God's Name with a living person (to say, for example, [...] "I am the God of Jacob," [...] while they are alive) except with those who are experiencing suffering. (And thus Jacob referred to the God of Isaac instead of the God of Jacob.) And Rabbi Berekiah also observed that Isaac did indeed experience suffering. The Rabbis said that we look upon Isaac as if his ashes were heaped in a <b>pile</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> altar. (And thus Jacob referred to Isaac to invoke the memory of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac in [...] {{as if it had been}} carried out).|$|E
