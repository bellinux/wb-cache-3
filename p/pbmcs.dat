CONCLUSIONS: <b>PBMC</b> from CHF patients show an upregulation of A(2 A) R-mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha, which may represents a mechanism of protection against inappropriate cytokine production...|$|R
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a chronic}} skin disorder associated with elevated serum IgE and colonization {{of the skin}} by Staphylococi which secrete toxins with superantigenic activity. The present study examined the immunomodulatory effects of toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) - 1, a prototypic superantigen, on IgE synthesis by interleukin (IL) - 4 -stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (<b>PBMC)</b> from five patients with AD and five normal subjects. TSST- 1 inhibited IL- 4 -induced IgE synthesis by AD and normal <b>PBMC</b> (P 0. 30). Inhibition of IL- 4 -induced IgE production was associated with induction of interferon (IFN) -gamma synthesis by TSST- 1 (P < 0. 02). Normal <b>PBMC</b> synthesized significantly more (P < 0. 005) IFN-gamma than AD <b>PBMC.</b> A neutralizing antibody to IFN-gamma reversed TSST- 1 -induced suppression of IgE synthesis by the normal <b>PBMC</b> (P < 0. 03), but not the AD <b>PBMC.</b> In AD, but not normal, <b>PBMC</b> anti-IFN-alpha antibody reversed the suppression of IgE synthesis induced by TSST- 1. These results demonstrate that TSST- 1 uses different mechanisms for modulation of IgE synthesis in AD versus normal <b>PBMC.</b> Furthermore, the reversal of TSST- 1 -induced suppression of IgE synthesis in AD <b>PBMC</b> by anti-IFN-alpha, but not anti-IFN-gamma, is consistent with the concept that AD is associated with defective Th 1 cell function and enhanced monocyte activity...|$|R
