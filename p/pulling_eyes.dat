50|$|The Coyote {{was first}} {{introduced}} in public at a San Antonio Spurs game on April 13, 1983. He's known for his slapstick comedy routine, including impromptu interactions with game officials during time-outs, rehearsed skits and dance numbers with the Silver Dancers (the Spurs cheerleading team), {{as well as for}} his trick filled antics, such as riding a unicycle, <b>pulling</b> his <b>eyes</b> off, dribbling a ball with his feet or spinning a ball on a pen.|$|R

He does not like working with his fellow henchman, Talanna. Ocular is capable of <b>pulling</b> people's <b>eyes</b> out with his wooden club, as well as storing and preserving the eyes in a see-through bag. All of the eyes obey his commands. The only eyeballs he uses are ones that emit sonic waves that can have concussive effects.|$|R
5000|$|Convergence-Retraction nystagmus: Attempts at upward gaze often {{produce this}} phenomenon. On fast up-gaze, the <b>eyes</b> <b>pull</b> {{in and the}} globes retract. The easiest way to bring out this {{reaction}} is to ask the patient to follow down-going stripes on an optokinetic drum.|$|R

She has regularly thrown my sight away, as much as if she had <b>pulled</b> my <b>eyes</b> out and thrown them over the hedge." ...|$|R
50|$|Higher gaze control {{centers in}} the frontal cortex and {{superior}} colliculus are only concerned with pointing gaze {{in the right direction}} and {{do not appear to be}} involved in 3-D eye control or the implementation of Listing's law. However the brainstem reticular formation centers that control vertical eye position (the interstitial nucleus of Cajal; INC) and saccade velocity (the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus; riMLF) are equally involved in torsional control, each being divided into populations of neurons that control directions similar to those of the vertical and torsional <b>pulling</b> <b>eye</b> muscles. However, these neural coordinate systems appear to align with Listing's plane in a way that probably simplifies Listing's law: positive and negative torsional control is balanced across the midline of the brainstem so that equal activation produces positions and movements in Listing's plane. Thus torsional control is only needed for movements toward or away from Listing's plane. However, it remains unclear how 2-D activity in the higher gaze centres results in the right pattern of 3-D activity in the brainstem. The brainstem premotor centers (INC, riMLF, etc.) project to the motoneurons for eye muscles, which encode positions and displacements of the eyes while leaving the 'half angle rule' to the mechanics of the eyes itself (see above). The cerebellum also plays a role in correcting deviations from Listing's plane.|$|R
50|$|Congenital {{fibrosis}} of the extraocular muscles, or CFEOM, is a {{class of}} rare genetic disorders affecting {{one or more of}} the muscles that move the eyeballs. Individuals with CFEOM have varying degrees of ophthalmoplegia (an inability to move the eyes in one or more directions) and ptosis. The condition is present from birth and non-progressive, runs in families, and usually affects both eyes similarly. In the most common form, the superior recti are dysfunctional and the inferior recti, lacking proper opposition, <b>pull</b> the <b>eyes</b> down, forcing the head to be tilted upward in order to see straight ahead.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked up}} and saw a square-set, brown-faced young man {{advancing}} towards them in his shirt-sleeves; he came deliberately, finding his way in and out among the logs, till he stood smiling down, through a heavy mustache and thick black lashes, into the face of the girl, as if she were some sort of joke. The sun struck into her face as she looked up at him, and made her frown with a knot between her brows that <b>pulled</b> her <b>eyes</b> still closer together, and she asked, with no direct reference to his shirt-sleeves,--"A'n't you forcing the season?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor, evading his <b>eye,</b> <b>pulled</b> a {{long face}} {{and shook his}} head. [...] "It may be the cooking," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "I’m not a good cook, I admit.

60|$|Ant. I cannot. I could <b>pull</b> out an <b>eye,</b> and bid it go, And t'other {{should not}} weep. Oh, Dolabella, How many deaths {{are in this}} word, depart!

60|$|It was once, {{returning}} {{from one of}} his voyages, that he found his wife with a black-eyed, curly-headed little creature, who called him papa, and climbed on his knee, nestled under his coat, rifled his pockets, and woke him every morning by <b>pulling</b> open his <b>eyes</b> with little fingers, and jabbering unintelligible dialects in his ears.|$|R
50|$|Bright {{colors were}} no longer favored as much of Op Art is black and white with little use of color. The designs {{presented}} migrated back to the Minimalist idea of art simply existing and not representing an ideal. A well noted artist of this style is Bridget Riley who shaped the contemporary art scene of the early 50s and 70s. Her works are designed to <b>pull</b> the <b>eye</b> {{in such a way}} to stretch and disorder the perceptual sense. She is considered a ground breaking artist in the realm of modern art. Her work mainly consists of detailed line and circle patterns to create an optical challenge for the viewer.|$|R
50|$|The {{superior}} {{oblique muscle}} originates {{at the back of}} the orbit (a little closer to the medial rectus, though medial to it, getting rounder as it courses forward to a rigid, cartilaginous pulley, called the trochlea, on the upper, nasal wall of the orbit. The muscle becomes tendinous about 10mm before it passes through the pulley, turning sharply across the orbit, and inserts on the lateral, posterior part of the globe. Thus, the superior oblique travels posteriorly for the last part of its path, going over the top of the eye. Due to its unique path, the superior oblique, when activated, <b>pulls</b> the <b>eye</b> downward and laterally.|$|R
