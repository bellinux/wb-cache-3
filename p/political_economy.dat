5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of <b>Political</b> <b>Economy,</b> {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of <b>Political</b> <b>Economy),</b> which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of <b>Political</b> <b>Economy,</b> Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of <b>Political</b> <b>Economy</b> created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E

5|$|Born in Trier to {{a middle-class}} family, Marx later studied <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became {{stateless}} and {{spent much of}} his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, of which the two most well-known are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital.

5|$|Given the {{repeated}} failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx {{also sought to}} understand capitalism and {{spent a great deal}} of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of the Critique of <b>Political</b> <b>Economy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Innis {{laid the}} basis for {{scholarship}} that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As {{the head of the}} University of Toronto's <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E
