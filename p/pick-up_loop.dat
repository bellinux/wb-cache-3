40|$|In {{plasma physics}} it is a {{commonly}} cited and often valid approximation that magnetic fieldlines are "frozen" to the plasma fluid. However, {{in certain situations}} in solar and astrophysics, {{as well as in}} fusion engineering, this approximation of "ideal magnetohydrodynamics" leaves out important physical processes. Large gradients in the field can arise, causing effects that were previously negligible to become significant, and allowing the fieldlines to slip through the plasma.

40|$|The cryoEDM neutron {{electric}} dipole moment experiment requires a SQUID magnetometry system with <b>pick-up</b> <b>loops</b> inside a magnetically shielded volume connected to SQUID sensors by long (up to 2 m) twisted-wire pairs (TWPs). These wires run outside the main shield, and therefore must run through superconducting capillaries to screen unwanted magnetic pick-up. We show that the average measured transverse magnetic pick-up {{of a set of}} lengths of TWPs is equivalent to a loop area of 5. 0 × 10 - 6 m 2 /m, or 14 twists per metre. From this we set the requirement that the magnetic shielding factor of the superconducting capillaries used in the cryoEDM system must be greater than 8. 0 × 104. The shielding factor - the ratio of the signal picked-up by an unshielded TWP to that induced in a shielded TWP - was measured for a selection of superconducting capillaries made from solder wire. We conclude the transverse shielding factor of a uniform capillary is greater than 107. The measured pick-up was equal to, or less than that due to direct coupling to the SQUID sensor (measured without any TWP attached). We show that discontinuities in the capillaries substantially impair the magnetic shielding, yet if suitably repaired, this can be restored to the shielding factor of an unbroken capillary. We have constructed shielding assemblies for cryoEDM made from lengths of single core and triple core solder capillaries, joined by a shielded Pb cylinder, incorporating a heater to heat the wires above the superconducting transition as required. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) gradiometers based on the high temperature superconductor YBa sub 2 Cu sub 3 O sub 7 sub - subdelta (YBCO). A step-edge Josephson junction fabrication process was developed to produce sufficiently steep (> 60 deg) step-edges such that junctions exhibited RSJ-like current-voltage characteristics. The mean I sub C R sub N product of a sample of twenty step-edge junctions was 130 mu V. Step-edge dc SQUIDs with inductances between 67 pH and 114 pH were fabricated. Generally the SQUIDs had an intrinsic white flux noise in the 10 - 30 mu PHI sub 0 /sq root Hz range, with the best device, a 70 pH SQUID, exhibiting a white flux noise of 5 mu PHI sub 0 /sq root Hz. Different first-order SQUID gradiometer designs were fabricated from single layers of YBCO. Two single-layer gradiometer (SLG) designs were fabricated on 10 x 10 mm sup 2 substrates. The best balance and lowest gradient sensitivity measured for these devices were 1 / 300 and 308 fT/cm sq root Hz (at 1 kHz) respectively. The larger baseline and larger flux capture area of the <b>pick-up</b> <b>loops</b> in a large area SLG design, fabricated on 30 x 10 mm sup 2 substrates, resulted in significant improvements in the balance and gradient field sensitivity with 1 / 1000 and 50 fT/cm sq root Hz (at 1 kHz) measured respectively. To reduce the uniform field effective area of SLOs and therefore reduce the direct pick-up of environmental field noise when operated unshielded, a novel gradiometric SQUID (G-SQUID) device was developed. Fabricated from a single layer of YBCO, the G-SQUIDs with inductances of 67 pH, had small uniform field effective areas of approximately 2 mu m sup 2 - more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the uniform field effective areas of conventional narrow linewidth SQUIDs of similar inductance.

The probes include <b>pick-up</b> coils, flux <b>loops,</b> Hall sensors, and a temperature sensor. The data provided by the system are regularly acquired and recorded within the set of JET Pulse Files. They can be used in studies implying measurement of the stray field due to the residual magnetization, as well as for all the modeling activities involving 3 D studies, in particular resistive wall mode studies, more accurate modeling for the vertical stabilization, interactions between NBI and magnetic field. In addition, the experience gained with Hall transducers is considered valuable in view of their potential use in ITER. Unlike the limb probes, the collar probe did not pass the functional commissioning, due to an unexpected discrepancy between the signals from Hall sensors and pick-up coils. The analysis illustrated in the paper shows that a critical assessment of the local configuration and a suitable magnetic modeling solve the issue of the observed discordance, by putting it in relation with a local geometrical effect due to the peculiar shape of the ferromagnetic collar teeth.

Comparative measurements with the thermometric and electric methods have demonstrated the validity of the electric method despite the problem of a distribution of the loss electric field. Using these two methods the effect of a longitudinal distribution of critical current along the tape has been shown. The influence of a transverse distribution of the local Jc through the core of the tape is also examined. Studies of the magnetic field dependence of the self-field losses have shown that different regions of the core have a different Jc(B) dependence, in contrast to the temperature dependence where all regions of the core show a similar dependence. Measurements at higher frequencies show the importance of flux diffusion where an increased dB/dt gives an increased induced critical current. At sufficiently higher frequencies (> 200 Hz) the self-field of the core is shown to induce eddy current losses within the silver sheath of the tape. For the external a. c. field case in parallel fields the losses are well described by the infinite slab geometry. For the case of the perpendicular field the losses are considerably less than those expected from either the thin ellipse or rectangle geometry. Possible mechanisms for this discrepancy include granularity of the tape or partial uncoupling of the filaments. For the combined action of an a. c. external field and a d. c. transport current our results show that the total losses cannot be obtained using only using a <b>pick-up</b> <b>loop</b> to measure the flux changes within the tape. An additional loss sustained by the d. c. current source also needs to be measured via a pair of voltage taps...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{the demand}} for {{improved}} health care delivery while managing escalating costs is a major challenge. Measuring the biomagnetic fields that emanate from the human brain already impacts the treatment of epilepsy, brain tumours and other brain disorders. This roadmap explores how superconducting technologies are poised to impact health care. Biomagnetism {{is the study of}} magnetic fields of biological origin. Biomagnetic fields are typically very weak, often in the femtotesla range, making their measurement challenging. The earliest in vivo human measurements were made with room-temperature coils. In 1963, Baule and McFee (1963 Am. Heart J. 55 95 - 6) reported the magnetic field produced by electric currents in the heart ('magnetocardiography'), and in 1968, Cohen (1968 Science 161 784 - 6) described the magnetic field generated by alpha-rhythm currents in the brain ('magnetoencephalography'). Subsequently, in 1970, Cohen et al (1970 Appl. Phys. Lett. 16 278 - 80) reported the recording of a magnetocardiogram using a Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID). Just two years later, in 1972, Cohen (1972 Science 175 664 - 6) described the use of a SQUID in magnetoencephalography. These last two papers set the scene for applications of SQUIDs in biomagnetism, the subject of this roadmap. The SQUID is a combination of two fundamental properties of superconductors. The first is flux quantization - the fact that the magnetic flux Φ in a closed superconducting loop is quantized in units of the magnetic flux quantum, Φ 0 ≡ h/ 2 e, ≈ 2. 07 × 10 - 15 Tm 2 (Deaver and Fairbank 1961 Phys. Rev. Lett. 7 43 - 6, Doll R and Nabauer M 1961 Phys. Rev. Lett. 7 51 - 2). Here, h is the Planck constant and e the elementary charge. The second property is the Josephson effect, predicted in 1962 by Josephson (1962 Phys. Lett. 1 251 - 3) and observed by Anderson and Rowell (1963 Phys. Rev. Lett. 10 230 - 2) in 1963. The Josephson junction consists of two weakly coupled superconductors separated by a tunnel barrier or other weak link. A tiny electriccurrent is able to flow between the superconductors as a supercurrent, without developing a voltage across them. At currents above the 'critical current' (maximum supercurrent), however, a voltage is developed. In 1964, Jaklevic et al (1964 Phys. Rev. Lett. 12 159 - 60) observed quantum interference between two Josephson junctions connected in series on a superconducting loop, giving birth to the dc SQUID. The essential property of the SQUID is that a steady increase in the magnetic flux threading the loop causes the critical current to oscillate with a period of one flux quantum. In today's SQUIDs, using conventional semiconductor readout electronics, one can typically detect a change in Φ corresponding to 10 - 6 Φ 0 in one second. Although early practical SQUIDs were usually made from bulk superconductors, for example, niobium or Pb-Sn solder blobs, today's devices are invariably made from thin superconducting films patterned with photolithography or even electron lithography. An extensive description of SQUIDsand their applications {{can be found in the}} SQUID Handbooks (Clarke and Braginski 2004 Fundamentals and Technology of SQUIDs and SQUID Systems vol I (Weinheim, Germany: Wiley-VCH), Clarke and Braginski 2006 Applications of SQUIDs and SQUID Systems vol II (Weinheim, Germany: Wiley-VCH)). The roadmap begins (chapter 1) with a brief review of the state-of-the-art of SQUID-based magnetometers and gradiometers for biomagnetic measurements. The magnetic field noise referred to the <b>pick-up</b> <b>loop</b> is typically a few fT Hz- 1 / 2, often limited by noise in the metallized thermal insulation of the dewar rather than by intrinsic SQUID noise. The authors describe a pathway to achieve an intrinsic magnetic field noise as low as 0. 1 fT Hz- 1 / 2, approximately the Nyquist noise of the human body. They also descibe a technology to defeat dewar noise. Chapter 2 reviews the neuroscientific and clinical use of magnetoencephalography (MEG), by far the most widespread application of biomagnetism with systems containing typically 300 sensors cooled to liquid-helium temperature, 4. 2 K. Two important clinical applications are presurgical mapping of focal epilepsy and of eloquent cortex in brain-tumor patients. Reducing the sensor-to-brain separation and the system noise level would both improve spatial resolution. The very recent commercial innovation that replaces the need for frequent manual transfer of liquid helium with an automated system that collects and liquefies the gas and transfers the liquid to the dewar will make MEG systems more accessible. A highly promising means of placing the sensors substantially closer to the scalp for MEG is to use high-transition-temperature (high-T c) SQUID sensors and flux transformers (chapter 3). Operation of these devices at liquid-nitrogen temperature, 77 K, enables one to minimize or even omit metallic thermal insulation between the sensors and the dewar. Noise levels of a few fT Hz- 1 / 2 have already been achieved, and lower values are likely. The dewars can be made relatively flexible, and thus able to be placed close to the skull irrespective of the size of the head, potentially providing higher spatial resolution than liquid-helium based systems. The successful realization of a commercial high-T c MEG system would have a major commercial impact. Chapter 4 introduces the concept of SQUID-based ultra-low-field magnetic resonance imaging (ULF MRI) operating at typically several kHz, some four orders of magnitude lower than conventional, clinical MRI machines. Potential advantages of ULF MRI include higher image contrast than for conventional MRI, enabling methodologies not currently available. Examples include screening for cancer without a contrast agent, imaging traumatic brain injury (TBI) and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, and determining the elapsed time since a stroke. The major current problem with ULF MRI is that its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low compared with high-field MRI. Realistic solutions to this problem are proposed, including implementing sensors with a noise level of 0. 1 fT Hz- 1 / 2. A logical and exciting prospect (chapter 5) is to combine MEG and ULF MRI into a single system in which both signal sources are detected with the same array of SQUIDs. A prototype system is described. The combination of MEG and ULF MRI allows one to obtain structural images of the head concurrently with the recording of brain activity. Since all MEG images require an MRI to determine source locations underlying the MEG signal, the combined modality would give a precise registration of the two images; the combination of MEG with high-field MRI can produce registration errors as large as 5 mm. The use of multiple sensors for ULF MRI increases both the SNR and the field of view. Chapter 6 describes another potentially far-reaching application of ULF MRI, namely neuronal current imaging (NCI) of the brain. Currently available neuronal imaging techniques include MEG, which is fast but has relatively poor spatial resolution, perhaps 10 mm, and functional MRI (fMRI) which has a millimeter resolution but is slow, on the order of seconds, and furthermore does not directly measure neuronal signals. NCI combines the ability of direct measurement of MEG with the spatial precision of MRI. In essence, the magnetic fields generated by neural currents shift the frequency of the magnetic resonance signal at a location that is imaged by the three-dimensional magnetic field gradients that form the basis of MRI. The currently achieved sensitivity of NCI is not quite sufficient to realize its goal, but it is close. The realization of NCI would represent a revolution in functional brain imaging. Improved techniques for immunoassay are always being sought, and chapter 7 introduces an entirely new topic, magnetic nanoparticles for immunoassay. These particles are bio-funtionalized, for example with a specific antibody which binds to its corresponding antigen, if it is present. Any resulting changes in the properties of the nanoparticles are detected with a SQUID. For liquid-phase detection, there are three basic methods: AC susceptibility, magnetic relaxation and remanence measurement. These methods, which have been successfully implemented for both in vivo and ex vivo applications, are highly sensitive and, although further development is required, it appears highly likely that at least some of them will be commercialized.
