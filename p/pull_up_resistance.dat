Method: The study is based on an experiment consisting in the performance of different testing protocols, the same group of probands and subsequent comparison probands ordinal position in selected test methodologies. Selected tests, the maximum number of pull-ups with their own weight, the maximum number of pull-ups with essential military equipment (15 kg), the maximum number of pull-ups with 40 % of your own body weight, the maximum load lifted in <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> excercise and the absolute <b>pull</b> <b>up,</b> which was calculated on the maximum load lifted.
