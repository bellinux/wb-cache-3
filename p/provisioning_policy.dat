The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether and to what extent <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy</b> are procyclical. We focus on the interaction between business cycle and <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy</b> (loan loss reserves and loan loss provisions) consistent with the Basel Accord of 1988 which made loan loss reserves no longer part of Tier I capital in the numerator of the capital adequacy ratio. An empirical model on panel data is then adapted on European banks from 1992 to 2004. In this model we consider two types of <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy</b> determinants: loan loss provisions and loan loss reserves. We identify banks with different strategies and different characteristics based on the ratio of non interest income in total revenue. We find that large banks tend to hold less risk. They establish fewer reserves than small banks. However, our results provide that functional diversification have no impact on <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy.</b> We also find that risk weighted assets reduce the volatility of the <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy</b> (loan loss provisions and loan loss reserves) during the cycle. The findings of our research are consistent with the empirical work of Bikker and Hu (2002), Laeven and Majnoni (2003), of Bikker and Metzemakers (2005) who show that banks more fund loans losses in period of economic downturn than in period of economic upturn for a whole of the OECD countries...|$|E

First, we consider a simpler scenario where tunnel routes are fixed, and present an approach for adjusting the tunnel bandwidths dynamically.

40|$|Provisioning of the Imperial capital Istanbul {{had been}} one of the major {{concerns}} of the Ottoman rulers from the classical age to the dawn of the modern era. Grain occupied a particularly important place in the <b>provisioning</b> <b>policies</b> of the Ottoman state due to the fact that the Ottoman sultans considered the steady supply of "people's bread" in the capital city as one of the ways to promote and reproduce their image of sovereignty in the general public opinion. This consideration remained unchanged throughout the eighteenth century during which time the Ottoman economy faltered vis-à-vis the European centered world-economy and the Ottoman polity began to gradually withdraw from the economic realm. In the face of mounting fiscal burdens, the Ottoman state limited its <b>provisioning</b> <b>policies</b> to the raw materials needed by the military industries and to the basic foods consumed by the populace. In this context, the traditional protectionist attitude of the state towards the craft guilds of the imperial capital was abandoned, leaving these organizations at the mercy of circumstances not to say the market principle. The only institutions that were insulated from the changing policy of the state were the grain-related crafts, i. e. bakers' guild.

40|$|A new policy, {{referred}} to as the condition-based replacement and spare <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy,</b> is presented for deteriorating systems with a number of identical units. It combines the condition-based replacement policy with periodical inspections and the (S,s) type inventory policy, noted as the (T,S,s,Lp) policy, where T is the inspection interval, S is the maximum stock level, s is the reorder level, and Lp is the preventive replacement threshold for the deterioration levels of units. The deterioration level of each unit in the system can be described by a scalar random variable, which is continuous and increasing monotonically. Furthermore, the deterioration level just when the unit failure occurs, termed deterioration to failure, is uncertain. Therefore, the condition-based reliability is proposed in order to characterize various and uncertain deterioration levels when unit failure occurs. A simulation model is developed for the system operation under the proposed condition-based replacement and spare <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy.</b> Thus, via the simulation method and the genetic algorithm, the decision variables T, S, s, and Lp can be jointly optimized for minimizing the cost rate.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Public Management and Administration)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996), in Section 152, {{states that}} a {{municipality}} must strive, within its capacity, {{to achieve the}} objectives regarding efficient service delivery, and the South African Local Government Association's (SALGA) objective is to build the capacity of local government to contribute towards a developmental democratic governance system that addresses and meets basic human needs. In this way, increased pressure is being placed on local government, especially in Metsimaholo, Moqhaka and Ngwathe in the Northern Free State, to provide more and improved services to their communities. This can be ascribed to changes taking place within the country, and which, {{in the spirit of}} Batho Pele require the municipalities to adapt to such changes in a manner that will ensure that proper services are provided to the communities. One way to relieve the pressure on the Northern Free State is to ensure that the statutory and regulatory framework for human resources provisioning is known and practiced in the municipalities; principles of municipal policy-making are strongly adhered to and executed; and theory and principles of human resource provisioning understood and implemented correctly, for proper services to be delivered to the communities. This realization resulted in the objectives as outlined in this study. During the study it was determined that the process in policy-making for the Northern Free State municipalities was not adhered to, was influenced by political interference and thus led to poor performance by municipalities. It was also determined that, due to lack of adherence to steps in the policy-making process in these municipalities skilled and professional people were not being employed. A further objective with the study is to construct a single human resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy</b> for the Northern Free State municipalities through which shortcomings in human resource provisioning can be limited and uniform human resource provisioning arrangements can be determined for these municipalities. It was determined that the universal human resource provisioning model offered scientifically based guidelines for human resource provision policy-making. The aforementioned determination lead {{to the conclusion that the}} human resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy</b> model created an ideal framework within the three municipalities; could identify problems; determine objectives; and formulate, implement and evaluate human resource provisioning policies. In fact, it creates a framework within which policy-makers and human resource provisioning officials can work to determine human resource provisioning policies. The policy-making model and the human resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>policy</b> are of universal value because they offer guidelines which can be applied by any other municipality in the Free State province and the entire Republic of South Africa's municipalities.
