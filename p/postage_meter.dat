25|$|A <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence of postage, or franking, to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> was invented by Chicago inventor Arthur Pitney, receiving a patent for the invention on October 14, 1902.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{inception}} of the name, the Chamber stated that it would not limit the label of Tech Valley to just the Capital District; rather, Tech Valley was envisioned as running from IBM's Westchester County plants and headquarters north to Saratoga Springs and west up the Mohawk Valley. Early businesses that used the Tech Valley name helped spread the word, businesses such as Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) who used the phrase in its job recruitment material, MapInfo Corporation, Tech Valley Communications, Tech Valley Office Interiors, and [...] The first use of the phrase by a business may have been the accounting firm Urbach, Kahn, & Werlin in 1998, which put the Tech Valley name and logo on its <b>postage</b> <b>meter,</b> shortly before that the Chamber had begun instituting a new telephone greeting, [...] "Albany-Colonie Chamber.

2500|$|The mail or post is {{a system}} for {{physically}} transporting postcards, letters, and parcels. A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems. Since the mid-19th century, national postal systems have generally been established as government monopolies with a fee on the article prepaid. Proof of payment is often {{in the form of}} adhesive postage stamps, but <b>postage</b> <b>meters</b> are also used for bulk mailing. Modern private postal systems are typically distinguished from national postal agencies by the names [...] "courier" [...] or [...] "delivery service".|$|R
50|$|A {{variable}} value stamp, is a gummed or self-adhesive {{postage stamp}} {{of a common}} design, issued by a machine similar to an Automatic Teller Machine, with a value of the user's choice printed {{at the time the}} stamp is dispensed. The value may be variable or from a fixed selection of postal rates. The stamps and machines are typically for use in retail or post office environments. As only the postal value varies from stamp to stamp, these stamps have been described as key type stamps. They are also closely related to <b>meter</b> stamps from <b>postage</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|R

50|$|Not {{content with}} simple success, Johnson was {{determined}} to expand the Friden Company worldwide. By the mid-1950s the organization had moved into complete office machine outfitting, producing adding machines, typesetting machines, weight scales and <b>postage</b> <b>meters.</b> Johnson had a fight on his hands trying to convince his complacent board members {{to move into the}} international market. Eventually, he won out and headed to Europe, opening offices in the Netherlands and Belgium. European sales surged and offices sprung up in Italy, England and West Germany. Johnson found himself a world traveler as he made the rounds of the Friden family of companies. Friden grew and profited, becoming well known for its punched-tape typewriters, including the iconic Flexowriter.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the mail}} sorting machine was {{eventually}} broken up for scrap, it was highly influential outside of Canada. Lewis' original suggestion that {{some sort of}} invisible or see-through ink be used to store routing information on the front face of the letters is now practically universal, as is the basic workflow of the address being converted to bar code form as soon as possible by typists and then sent into automated machinery for actual sorting. Use of bar-coded ZIP codes printed directly at the sending point when using <b>postage</b> <b>meters</b> became mandatory in the U.S. in 1973. During the 1960s the use of optical character readers replaced typists for letters with typewritten addresses, and in the 1990s, handwritten ones as well.|$|R
2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of postage stamps, mail in the UK was {{paid for by the}} recipient, a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem: the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by [...] the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items, and senders had no incentive to restrict the number, size, or weight of items sent, whether or not they would ultimately be paid for. The postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner, with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced. Concurrently with the first stamps, the UK offered wrappers for mail. [...] Later related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaid-postage envelopes, post cards, lettercards, aerogrammes, <b>postage</b> <b>meters,</b> and, more recently, specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the U.S. postal service for priority or express mailing.|$|R
50|$|By 1919, {{the two men}} {{combined}} their {{firms and}} the Pitney-Bowes <b>Postage</b> <b>Meter</b> Company was born. While Pitney was the inventor, Bowes concentrated his activities in Washington, lobbying for {{the passage of the}} necessary legislation that would open the door for the <b>postage</b> <b>meter.</b> The United States Congress passed the enabling legislation in 1920, and the first piece of metered mail—a letter from Bowes to his wife—was posted on December 10, 1920. By 1922, 400 meters were in service, accounting for more than $4 million in postage.|$|E

5000|$|With Digital Print <b>Meters,</b> <b>postage</b> {{is added}} through a modem connection. [...] Postage is printed through an inkjet {{cartridge}} using special postage ink. The most advanced systems print Information Based Indicia (IBI), a 2-dimensional Data Matrix or bar code combined with visually identifiable characters and symbols. The data matrix contains such information as amount of postage, origin zip code, destination, mail class, weight, and confirmation/tracking numbers. Examples include: USPS Intelligent Mail barcode, Royal Mail Mailmark® and Canada Post Postal Indicia.|$|R
25|$|The {{postage stamp}} afforded {{convenience}} {{for both the}} mailer and postal officials, more effectively recovered costs for the postal service, and ultimately resulted in a better, faster postal system. With the conveniences stamps offered, their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries. Postage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail; however, {{by the end of}} the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of <b>metered</b> <b>postage</b> and bulk mailing by businesses.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous system, which merely canceled and postmarked the upper {{right corner of the}} envelope, thereby missing any stamps which were inappropriately placed, the Advanced Facer-Canceler System locates indicia (stamp or <b>metered</b> <b>postage</b> mark), regardless of the orientation of the mail as it enters the machine, and cancels it by applying a postmark. Detection of indicia enables the AFCS to determine the orientation of each mailpiece and sort it accordingly, rotating pieces as necessary so all mail is sorted right-side up and faced in the same direction in each output bin.|$|R
