40|$|The {{concept of}} {{pressure}} proof testing of fuselage structures with fatigue cracks to insure structural integrity was evaluated from a fracture mechanics viewpoint. A generic analytical and experimental investigation {{was conducted on}} uniaxially loaded flat panels with crack configurations and stress levels typical of longitudinal lap splice joints in commercial transport aircraft fuselages. The results revealed that the remaining fatigue life after a proof cycle was longer than that without the proof cycle because of crack growth retardation due to increased crack closure. However, based on a crack length that is slightly less than the critical value at the maximum proof stress, the minimum assured life or proof test interval must {{be no more than}} 550 pressure cycles for a 1. 33 <b>proof</b> <b>factor</b> and 1530 pressure cycles for a 1. 5 <b>proof</b> <b>factor</b> to prevent in-flight failures...|$|E
40|$|The FAA and NASA have {{recently}} completed independent technical {{evaluations of the}} concept of pressure proof testing the fuselage of commercial transport airplanes. The results of these evaluations are summarized. The objectives of the evaluations were to establish the potential benefit of the pressure proof test, to quantify the most desirable proof test pressure, and to quantify the required proof test interval. The focus of the evaluations was on multiple-site cracks extending from adjacent rivet holes of a typical fuselage longitudinal lap splice joint. The FAA and NASA do not support pressure proof testing the fuselage of aging commercial transport aircraft. The argument against proof testing is as follows: (1) a single proof test does not insure an indefinite life; therefore, the proof test must be repeated at regular intervals; (2) for a <b>proof</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 33, the required proof test interval must be below 300 flights to account for uncertainties in the evaluation; (3) conducting the proof test at a <b>proof</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 5 would considerably exceed the fuselage design limit load; therefore, it is not consistent with accepted safe practices; and (4) better safety can be assured by implementing enhanced nondestructive inspection requirements, and adequate reliability can be achieved by an inspection interval several times longer than the proof test interval...|$|E

40|$|Single-cycle and multiple-cycle {{proof testing}} (SCPT and MCPT) {{strategies}} for reusable aerospace propulsion system components are critically evaluated and compared from a rigorous elastic-plastic fracture mechanics perspective. Earlier MCPT studies are briefly reviewed. New J-integral estimation methods for semielliptical surface cracks and cracks at notches are derived and validated. Engineering methods are developed to characterize crack growth rates during elastic-plastic fatigue crack growth (FCG) and the tear-fatigue interaction near instability. Surface crack growth experiments are conducted with Inconel 718 to characterize tearing resistance, FCG under small-scale yielding and elastic-plastic conditions, and crack growth during simulated MCPT. Fractography and acoustic emission studies provide additional insight. The relative merits of SCPT and MCPT are directly compared using a probabilistic analysis linked with an elastic-plastic crack growth computer code. The conditional {{probability of failure}} in service is computed for a population of components that have survived a previous proof test, based on an assumed distribution of initial crack depths. Parameter studies investigate the influence of <b>proof</b> <b>factor,</b> tearing resistance, crack shape, initial crack depth distribution, and notches on the MCPT versus SCPT comparison.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the methodology of using metalogics for reasoning about programming languages. As a concrete example we consider a fragment of ML corresponding to call-by-value PCF and translate it into a metalogic which contains (amongst other types) computation types and a fixpoint type. The main result is a soundness property (⋆) : if the denotations of two programs are provably equal in the metalogic, {{they have the same}} operationally observable behaviour. As usual, this follows from a computational adequacy result. In early notes, Plotkin showed how such <b>proofs</b> could be <b>factored</b> into two stages, the first non-trivial and the second (essentially) routine; our contribution is to rework his suggestion within a new framework. We define a metalogic, which incorporates computation and fixpoint types, and specify a modular translation of the ML fragment. Our <b>proof</b> of (⋆) <b>factors</b> into two parts. First, the term language of the metalogic is equipped with an operational semantics and a (generic) computational adequacy result obtained. Second, a simple syntactic argument establishes a correspondence between the operational behaviour of an object program and of its denotation. The first part is not routine but is proved once and for all. The second is a detailed but essentially trivial calculation that is easily adaptable to other object languages. Such a <b>factored</b> <b>proof</b> is important because it promises to scale up more easily than a monolithic one. We show that it may be adapted to an object language with call-by-name functions and one with a simple exception mechanism. ...|$|R

Can Bayesian inference be used directly to provide private access to data? The answer is yes: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from the posterior distribution {{can lead to a}} desired level of privacy and utility. For a uniform treatment, we define differential privacy over arbitrary data set metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal with non-i. i. d or non-tabular data sets. We then prove bounds on the sensitivity of the posterior to the data, which delivers a measure of robustness. We also show how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on the utility of answers to queries and on the ability of an adversary to distinguish between data sets. The latter are complemented by a novel use of Le Cam's method to obtain lower bounds on distinguishability. Our results hold for arbitrary metrics, including those for the common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric, we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions. *.

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} {{two fundamental}} questions in propositional proof complexity: lower bounds {{on the size}} of the shortest proof and automatizability of propositional proof systems. With respect to the first part, we develop a new paradigm for proving lower bounds in propositional calculus. Our method is based on the purely computational concept of pseudorandom generator. Namely, we call a pseudorandom generator Gn: [0, 1] - [0, 1]m hard for a propositional proof system P if P cannot efficiently prove the (properly encoded) statement G (xl, [...] .,xn) f b for any string b [0, 1]m. We consider a variety of "combinatorial" pseudorandom generators inspired by the Nisan-Wigderson generator on the one hand, and by the construction of Tseitin tautologies on the other. We prove that under certain circumstances these generators are hard for such proof systems as Resolution, Polynomial Calculus and Polynomial Calculus with Resolution (PCR). As to the second part, we prove that the problem of approximating the size of the shortest <b>proof</b> within <b>factor</b> 2 log 1 -o(1) is NP-hard. This result is very robust in that it holds for almost all natural proof systems, including: Frege systems, extended Frege systems, resolution, Horn resolution, the sequent calculus, the cut-free sequent calculus, as well as the polynomial calculus. We introduce the Monotone Minimum (Circuit) Satisfying Assignment problem and reduce it to the problem of approximating the length of proofs. Finally, we show that neither Resolution nor tree-like Resolution is automatizable unless the class W[P] from the hierarchy of parameterized problems is fixed-parameter tractable by randomized algorithms with one-sided error. by Mikhail Alekhnovitch.
