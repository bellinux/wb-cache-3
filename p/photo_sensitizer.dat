Water soluble sensitizers are sought after for the convenience of delivery into the body. Thus, phthalocyanine (pc), tetrapyridinoporphyrazines (tppa) and tetramethyltetrapyridinoporphyrazines (tmtppa) with non-transition central metal atoms of Ge, Si, Sn and Zn were studied. First was the synthesis of these complexes, followed by their characterisation. The characterisation involved the use of ultraviolet and visible absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electrochemical properties and elemental analysis. Photochemical properties of the complexes were then investigated. Photolysis of these macrocycles showed two processes; -reduction of the dye and photobleaching, which leads to the disintegration of the conjugated chromophore structure of the dye. Photobleaching is the reductive quenching of the excited state of the sensitizers. The intensity of the quenching decreased progressively from tmtppa, tppa to pc metal complexes with photobleaching quantum yields, 6. 6 x 10. 5 ⁻¹, 1. 8 x 10. 5 ⁻¹ and 5. 4 x 10 ⁻⁶ for Zntmtppa, Zntppa and Znpc, respectively. Efficiency of singlet oxygen sensitization is solvent dependent with very different values obtained for the same compound in different solvents, for example, 0. 25 and 0. 38 were observed as singlet oxygen quantum yields for Gepc complex in DMSO and DMF respectively. In DMSO the efficiency of ¹O₂ generation decrease considerably from pc to tppa and finally tmtppa.

40|$|Abstract. High {{efficiency}} of light-to-energy conversion in {{dye-sensitized solar cell}} (DSSC) was achieved by applying anthocyanin as <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer</b> and TiO 2 as photo electrode. TiO 2 anatase phase was synthesized by using co-precipitation method from TiCl 3 precipitate. Anthocyanin (A) from Garcinia mangostana pericarp was combined with β-carotene (B) from Daucus carota and curcumin (C) pigments from Curcuma longa. According to UV-Vis analysis the wavelength absorptions of anthocyanin, β-carotene, and curcumin are 399 nm, 471 nm, and 470 nm, respectively. The A–B–C produced the short-circuit current density (JSC) of 77. 7 µA, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 343. 2 mV, the fill factor (FF) of 32. 3, and the efficiency (η) of 0. 042 %. It is found that there exists a synergistic effect between anthocyanin and curcumin as indicated by broader absorption wavelengths, whilst the mixture between anthocyanin and β-carotene does not show the synergistic effect. The high {{efficiency of}} layered co-sensitization is attributed to the high adsorption capacities of curcumin in the outer layer.

Current study is focused on molecular activation by light, specifically addressing the class of singlet oxygen reactions. A laboratory-scale annular recirculating photoreactor and a scalable microreactor unit were designed, assembled and tested in oxygenation of α-pinene and stereoselective oxygenation of homoallylic alcohols by the photogenerated singlet oxygen. Efficiencies of light utilization and the quantum yields of the reactions for different sources of light in various lamp-reactor geometries were quantified using actinometry. It was shown that optimal thickness of the reaction layer, high intensity of light and elevated oxygen pressures in continuous gas-liquid segmented flow are crucial for both safe and efficient oxygenation. This study proved the viability of a novel concept of compact reactors with embedded light emitting diodes. Finally, a methodology of efficient oxyfunctionalization of allylic compounds was developed. Following the developed methodology, the applicability of functional nanomaterials based on pure and dye-modified porous silicon as heterogeneous <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizers</b> of singlet oxygen was studied in detail. It was demonstrated that the photosensitizing efficiency of all the samples is much lower than that of conventional dye photosensitizers. Low activity of the novel photosensitizers was attributed to quenching of the photogenerated singlet oxygen by the surface quenching groups of porous silicon, low quantum yield of photoluminescence in the case of pure porous silicon and to thermodynamically favorable quenching of the photoexcited porphyrin states due to energy/electron transfer to silicon nanocrystals in the case of dye modified porous silicon...|$|R

Ternary Copper (II) complexes containing L-methionine, S-methy 1 -L-cysteine and phenanthroline bases are prepared and characterized. They display DNA binding and visible light induced DNA cleavage activity. An enhancement of the DNA cleavage activity is observed for analogous ternary copper (II) complexes contained L-lysine with a pendant cationic amine moiety as a photo-induced DNA Cleavage activity using binary and ternary copper (II) complexes of L-arginine and phenanthroline bases. We have observed AT selective DNA binding and visible light –induced DNA cleavage activity. The crescent-shaped bis-arginine Copper (II) complex mimics the natural antiviral antibiotic netropsin. T o investigate the role of the pendant groups of the amino acids, we have explored the DNA binding and DNA cleavage activity of analogues L-glutamine and L-asparagine complexes. We have prepared ternary copper (II) complexes containing two photosensitizers, viz., L-tryptophan (L-trp) and dipyridoquininoxaline/dipyridophenazine to achieve double strand breaks forming linear DNA. Complex [Cu(L-trp) (dppz) (H 2 O) + shows a stacking arrangement of the indole and dppz rings giving a separation that fits with the base pair separation of ds-DNA. Photosensitizes in these complexes approach two different complementary stands of the ds-DNA, leading to double strand breaks and formation of linear DNA. Mechanistic studies on the DNA photocleavage reactions reveal the formation of singlet oxygen(1 O 2) species by a type-II pathway in preference to the hydroxyl radical generation.

In this study, we investigated the mechanistic actions of a {{recently developed}} second generation <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer,</b> Zn-BC-AM, on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. Zn-BC-AM was found to localize in the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and golgi body. Photoactivation of Zn-BC-AM loaded NPC cells resulted in a rapid collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) (15 min), followed by the release of cytochrome c (I h), and activation of caspases- 9 and - 3 (4 h). Expression of ER chaperones Bip/Grp 78 and Grp 94, and ER resident lectin-like chaperone calnexin (CNX) was also enhanced in PDT-stressed NPC cells. Caspase- 12, an important caspase involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis, was also activated. Inhibition of Ca 2 + uptake into mitochondria by ruthenium red (RR) or loading the cells with EGTA-AM, an agent that buffers intracellular Ca 2 + released from ER, resulted in a significant reduction of Zn-BC-AM PDT-induced cell death. These observations suggest that both ER and mitochondria are the subcellular targets of Zn-BC-AM. Effective activation of ER- and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways is responsible for Zn-BC-AM PDT-induced NPC cell death. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

Methods: PDI experiments were performed using white light (30 mW cm(- 2)) and the cationic 5 -phenyl- 10, 1 5, 20 -tris(N-methyl- 4 pyridyl) porphyrin chloride (TriP[4]) as <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer.</b> Results: The microorganisms could be successfully photoinactivated by TriP[4] when suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In this medium, P. aeruginosa was the most resistant microorganism. Changing the suspending medium from PBS to human blood plasma reduced the PDI of all three microorganisms. In human blood plasma C. albicans was the most resistant microorganism. The same results were obtained with 4. 5 % and 7 % HSA/PBS suspensions. Conclusions: Albumin inhibits the PDI of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans in a dose dependent manner.

Através da análise da absorção {{molecular}} UV-Vis, foram investigadas a interação com surfactantes, as reações de fotobranqueamento, a geração de oxigênio singlete e a capacidade de agregação em diferentes proporções água/etanol. A ação fotodinâmcia dos compostos estudados foi analisada através de ensaios {{in vitro}} com microorganismos, foram realizados testes com Artemia salina e com a bactéria Staphylococcus aureus. Foi utilizado sistema de LEDs de diferentes faixas de emissão (vermelho, laranja e verde) para iluminação das amostras nos testes para avaliação da ação fotodinâmica. Primeiramente, analisou-se o comportamento espectral da porfirina H 2 (TNBPyP), com a variação do pH em meio aquoso e em acetato/fosfato e na presença dos surfactantes HPS (zwiteriônico), SDS (aniônico) e CTAB (catiônico). Observou-se que a porfirina é estável numa ampla faixa de pH nos vários sistemas estudados. O comportamento espectral da porfirina H 2 (TNBPyP) em misturas água/etanol de diferentes proporções indicou que não houve a formação de agregados na faixa de concentração analisada. A análise de fotobranqueamento foi realizada para as duas porfirinas sob iluminação de sistemas de LEDs durante um período total de 1 hora, foi observado que ambas as porfirinas são foto-estáveis nas condições analisadas. Quanto a geração de oxigênio singlete, observada através do teste do ácido úrico, verificou-se que a H 2 (TNBPyP) apresentou maior atividade fotodinâmica (AF) que a Zn(TPPS 4). Os resultados dos testes microbiológicos mostraram que o maior índice de mortalidade sobre A. salina ocorre na presença da porfirina H 2 (TNBPyP) e sob iluminação com LED vermelho, indicando ação fotodinâmica da porfirina. Nos testes com a bactéria Staphylococcus aureus, observou-se ação fotodinâmica para as duas porfirinas analisadas e com os dois tipos de LEDs testados, sendo que os melhores resultados de fotoinativação foram obtidos para o tempo de iluminação de 30 min.

The System used was of LEDs of different emission bands (red, orange and green) for illumination of the samples in the tests for the evaluation of the photodynamic action. First, we analyzed the spectral behavior of porphyrin H&# 8322;(TNBPyP), with the variation of pH in water and ethyl acetate/phosphate and in the presence of surfactant HPS (Zwitterionic), SDS (anionic) and CTAB (cationic). It was observed that porphyrin is stable {{in a wide range of}} pH in the various systems studied. The spectral behavior of porphyrin mixtures H&# 8322;(TNBPyP) in water/ethanol in different proportions indicated that there was no clustering in the concentration range examined. Analysis of photo bleaching was performed for the two porphyrins in light of LED systems for the total of 1 hour; it was observed that both porphyrins are photo-stable under the conditions studied. As the generation of singlet oxygen, observed through the test of uric acid, it was found that the H&# 8322;(TNBPyP) showed a higher photodynamic activity (PA) than Zn(TPPS&# 8324;). The results of microbiological tests showed that the highest mortality rate of A. saline occurs in the presence of porphyrin H&# 8322;(TNBPyP) and under illumination with red LED, indicating photodynamic action of porphyrin. In tests with the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, we observed the effects of photodynamic action for the two porphyrins examined and the two types of LEDs tested, and the best results were obtained by photo inactivation under lighting time of 30 minutes. Thus, the results show that the porphyrins tested have potential for the use in Photodynamic Therapy...|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} photosensitizers, 9, 10 -dicyanoanthracene (DCA) and benzophenone (BzO) or a silica bound derivative (BzO-Si) {{have been}} compared for the photooxidation of di-n-butyl sulfide and di-n-butyl disulfide. With either photosensitizer, sulfide photooxidation in acetonitrile leads very efficiently to sulfoxide, with sulfone and disulfides as by-products. Although an electron transfer mechanism {{has previously been}} established starting with DCA, our results are indicative of two competitive mechanisms using BzO as the <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer,</b> instead of singlet oxygen addition and electron transfer. The more sluggish photooxidation of disulfides leads to a complex mixture of products, among which n-butyl butanethiosulfonate and strong acids (alkylsulfonic and sulfuric) are the major ones. The relative ratio thiosulfonate : acids depends, among other factors, on the medium polarity with acid formation favored starting with BzO or BzO-Si in a methanol-water mixture. An electron transfer mechanism only can account for the observed products. Superoxide anion, the formation of which is much easier starting from BzO than from DCA, is suggested to {{play a crucial role}} in this oxidative radical pathway. Starting from disulfides, grafted benzophenone is more efficient for acid formation than its soluble counterpart. As this photosensitizer can easily be recycled, an easy and smooth way to acid formation is thus available, provided that the reaction solvent is properly chosen...|$|E

Os resultados estatisticos obtidos pelo Teste t-student demonstraram que os grupos de terapia fotodinamica (PDT) (grupos 6, 7, 8) sao diferentes do grupo controle para p= 0, 05 e os valores percentuais de reducao bacteriana dos grupos PDT foram de 99, 8 % no grupo 6, 81, 9 % no grupo 7 e 99, 8 % no grupo 8 para o Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, de 93, 7 % no grupo 6, 84 % para o grupo 7 e 99, 8 % no grupo 8 para o Fusobacterium nucleatum e 26, 3 % no grupo 6, 38, 6 % no grupo 7 e 49, 5 % no grupo 8 para a Prevotella intermedia, demonstrando assim, que o corante azul de toluidina 0, 01 % associado aos lasers e ao LED apresenta um {{excelente}} potencial para a utilizacao em PDT, na sensibilizacao letal dessas bacterias nos parametros utilizados no experimento (¢t= 3 minutos). The {{aim of the}} present study is to evaluate in vitro lethal sensibilization of periodontopathogenic bacteria: Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Prevotella intermedia (Pi) by using toluidine blue (0. 01 % w/v) as <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer</b> and comparing the irradiation of identical solutions of bacteria with <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer</b> by three light sources: two lasers systems of different companies (660 nm) and one LED equipment (light emitting diode, 630 nm). For each species, they were established a control group and different test groups, among them: Group 6 (Fn, Aa and Pi) bacteria solution irradiated by laser 1; Group 7 (Fn, Aa and Pi) bacteria solution irradiated by laser 2 and Group 8 (Fn, Aa and Pi) bacteria solution irradiated by LED. Irradiation protocol followed the literature recommendations: 5 minutes of preirradiation time and 3 minutes of irradiation. Results reveal that the bacteria reduction for the irradiated groups (6, 7 and 8) in comparison with control group is statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans presented important level of reduction (99. 8 % for Group 6 Aa, 81. 9 % for Group 7 Aa and 99. 8 % for Group 8 Aa) as well as Fusobacterium nucleatum (93. 7 % for Group 6 Fn, 84 % for Group 7 Fn and 99. 8 % for Group 8 Fn). Prevotella intermedia presented low level of reduction (26. 3 % for Group 6 Pi, 38. 6 % for Group 7 Pi and 49. 5 % for Group 8 Pi). Toluidine blue at concentration of 0. 01 % w/v is an effective photosensitizer for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum when irradiated with the light wavelength in the range of 630 to 660 nm using laser or LED light sources...|$|E
40|$|Keratoconus is a {{condition}} characterized by biomechanical instability of the cornea, presenting in a progressive, asymmetric and bilateral way. Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) with riboflavin and Ultraviolet-A (UVA) is a new technique of corneal tissue strengthening that combines the use of riboflavin as a <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer</b> and UVA irradiation. Studies showed that CXL was effective in halting the progression of keratoconus {{over a period of}} up to four years. The published studies also revealed a reduction of max K readings by more than 2 D, while the postoperative spherical equivalent (SEQ) was reduced by an average of more than 1 D and refractive cylinder decreased by about 1 D. The major indication for the use of CXL is to inhibit the progression of corneal ecstasies, such as keratoconus and pellucid marginal degeneration. CXL may also be effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of iatrogenic keratectasia, resulting from excessively aggressive photo ablation. This treatment has been used to treat infectious corneal ulcers with apparent favorable results. Most recent studies demonstrate the beneficial impact of CXL for iatrogenic ecstasies, pellucid marginal degeneration, infectious keratitis, bullous keratopathy and ulcerative keratitis. Several long-term and short-term complications of CXL have been studied and documented. The possibility of a secondary infection after the procedure exists because the patient is subject to epithelial debridement and the application of a soft contact lens. Formation of temporary corneal haze, permanent scars, endothelial damage, treatment failure, sterile infiltrates, bullous keratopathy and herpes reactivation are the other reported complications of this procedure...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{has shown}} to be a {{promising}} technique to treat various forms of malignant neoplasia. The photodynamic eradication of the tumor cells is achieved by applying a photosensitizer either locally or systemically and following local activation through irradiation of the tumor mass with light of a specific wavelength after a certain time of incubation. Due to preferential accumulation of the photosensitizer in tumor cells, this procedure allows a selective inactivation of the malignant tumor while sparing the surrounding tissue to the greatest extent. These features and requirements make the PDT an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of retinoblastoma, especially when surgical enucleation is a curative option. This extreme solution is still in use in case of tumours that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy or handled too late due to poor access to medical care in less advanced country.

40|$|In this work, a photophysical, {{photochemical}} {{and photo}} biological study of various psoralens has been made. The photophysical study has include {{the determination of}} parameters such as fluorescence and triplet formation quantum yields and fluorescence lifetime of psoralens in pure solvents and in dioxane: water mixtures. This mixtures represents the dielectric behaviour of {{a large group of}} protic and aprotic pure solvents, as well as organized molecular systems such as micelles, liposomes and lipoproteins. They are used as solvent model for psoralens and allows to mimic the micro environments sensed by these photosensitizers in biological medium. The dependence of singlet excited state parameters to solvation is due to the variation of internal conversion rate constant. The <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer</b> character of psoralen have been tested by studying the photodegradation of 3 -methylindole, by a 365 nm irradiation of psoralen, in various dioxane: water and dioxane: deuterated water mixtures. Kinetic models have been attempted to fit the experimental results. In the absence of oxygen, the chemical and physical quenching rate constants for psoralen triplet state by the indolin ring have been determined. In the presence of molecular oxygen, the applicability of a kinetic model involving both type I and type II mechanisms at once for the photodynamic degradation of 3 -methylindole have been tested. Finally, a study of the in vivo phototoxic effects of five psoralens in terms of cell viability and lipid peroxidation induced in Nctc 2544 keratinocytes in culture have been made. The cell mortality induced by psoralens + UV A radiation is not followed by an increased lipid peroxidation. This results are discussed in terms of localization site of psoralens and microenvironment sensed by this compounds in cells.

40|$|Recently, organic {{photovoltaic}} devices (OPVDs) have been extensively studied and demonstrated as promising candidates for light sensing applications. The novel materials {{are used in}} optoelectronic applications, utilizing their intrinsic physical, chemical and electrical characteristics. Organic semiconductors offer many {{physical and chemical properties}} that can be easily tailored by incorporating functional groups or manipulating physical conditions to meet specific requirements. The best feature of organic semiconductors is their solution processability at room temperature using simple and low cost deposition techniques. Aiming at the interesting properties of organic semiconductors, in this thesis, we have extensively explored organic semiconductors based solar cells and light sensors for optoelectronic applications. Dye sensitized photo sensors using water soluble organic <b>photo</b> <b>sensitizer,</b> Nickel (II) phthalocyanine-tetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (NiTsPc) have been fabricated and investigated. Two different types of TiO 2 films (untreated and NaOH-treated) are prepared to serve as anodes for the sensors. Both films are subsequently sensitized by NiTsPc using aqueous solution. Commercially available Iodolyte Z 100 and platinum coated indium doped tin oxide (ITO) are used as electrolyte and cathode, respectively. The NaOH-treated sensor demonstrates 2. 81 times increase in sensitivity in terms of photo-conductivity as compared to the untreated sensor. The NaOH-treated sensor, however, surpasses the other sensor in terms of response/recovery times and stability in plateau values of the photocurrent. The proposed photosensor is eco-friendly and economical for commercial applications. A binary blend of two polymers, poly[2, 6 -(4, 4 -bis-(2 -ethylhexyl) - 4 H-cyclopenta [2, 1 -b; 3, 4 -b’]dithiophene) -alt- 4, 7 (2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole) ] (PCPDTBT) and poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 -ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) as a sensitizer has been employed for a visible light dye sensitized photo sensor (DSPS). The proposed combination of the polymers covers almost the entire visible light spectrum. iv The dependence of the current generation in the dye sensitized photo sensor is investigated as a function of varied incident light intensities. The output shows a linear relation as a function of incident light in the range of 0 - 30000 lx. The photo-conductivity sensitivity of the dye sensitized photo sensor is about 2. 02 × 10 − 5 Sm/W. The average response time of the sensor is found ∼ 382 ms. In addition to consistency and repeatability, the fabrication of this sensor is economical and environmentally friendly. The effect of thermal annealing on the optical, morphological and photovoltaic properties of bulk heterojunction solar cell based on the poly[2, 5 -bis(3 -dodecylthiophen- 2 -yl) thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene] (PBTTT-C 12) and[6, 6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 71 BM) has been investigated. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBTTT-C 12 :PC 71 BM/Al devices are fabricated on glass substrates from the PBTTT-C 12 :PC 71 BM (1 : 4) solution in dichlorobenzene. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is used to investigate the surface morphology of the PBTTT-C 12 :PC 71 BM thin films. The AFM results show that the surface roughness of the thin film decreases with increasing annealing temperature, making the annealed film smoother as compared to the non-annealed sample.
