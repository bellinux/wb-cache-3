40|$|Whether as {{a result}} of low crime rates, the {{financial}} pressures of the 2008 credit crunch, or other factors, policymakers {{on both sides of the}} aisle are trying to rein or even reduce the US incarceration rate after an unprecedented forty-year expansion. Unfortunately, reforms are hampered by the fact that we do not have a solid empirical understanding of what caused the explosion in the first place. In fact, the 2 Ì 2 Standard Story 2 Ì 2 of prison growth generally overemphasizes less important factors and overlooks more important ones. This essay thus does two things. First, it points out the flaws in five key aspects of the Standard Story: its argument that the War on Drugs is of central importance, that trends in violent and <b>property</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> relatively unimportant, that longer sentence lengths drive growth, that the 2 Ì 2 criminal justice system 2 Ì 2 is a fairly coherent entity advancing specific goals, and that the âpolitics of crime controlâ is uniquely dysfunctional. And second, it argues that an increased willingness of the part of prosecutors to file charges â a causal factor almost completely overlooked by the Standard Story â is likely the most important force behind prison growth, at least for the past two decades...|$|E
40|$|All {{criminal}} legislations envisage {{a system}} of different criminal sanctions and measures for preventing and counteracting crime in general and property crime in particular. Nowadays, <b>property</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> the most frequent and prominent form of crime, both in Serbia and in other countries. As an efficient social response to the commission of such criminal offences, criminal legislations prescribe different types of punishment for the perpetrators of property crimes. The imposed measures may include: 1) property-related penalties: fine and confiscation of property; 2) safety measure that includes seizure of objects, 3) confiscation of financial benefits obtained by the commission of a criminal offence; and 4) confiscation of property acquired by the commission of a criminal offence. Considering the specific nature, character, effects and significance of these crimes, the most prominent among these measures are financial criminal sanctions and measures. The nature of these criminal offences and the perpetrators' personality necessitate {{the use of a}} special financial sanction: the forfeiture of instrumenta sceleris, as a safety measure which has a repressive as well as a preventive effect. In this paper, the author discusses the concept, characteristics, distinctive features, and the system of imposing the safety measure of forfeiture according to the new legal solutions prescribed in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Serbia and the comparative criminal law...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three empirical studies detecting {{the determinants of}} crime in England and Wales. We firstly apply time series analyses to look for cointegrating relationships between property crimes and unemployment as well as law enforcement instruments. We extend our study by employing panel data and corresponding techniques to control for area-specific fixed effects {{as well as the}} endogeneity of law enforcement variables. In our third study, we allow crime rate to have spatial spillover effect, in other words, the crime rate in one area is affected by, in addition to its local crime-influential factors, the crime rates and crime-related factors in its neighbouring areas. We demonstrate this result by constructing a theoretical model and testing it by applying spatial analysis regressions. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: First, <b>property</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>are</b> better explained by economic models of crime than violent crimes. Second, law enforcement instruments always have negative effects on both property and violent crimes, indicating their deterrence and incapacitation effects as predicted. Third, social-economic factors, such as unemployment and income level, have two effects on property crimes: opportunity and motivation. Their net effects on property crime rates depend on the type of crime as well as the time period being examined. And finally, there is indeed spillover effect existing in crime rate. For burglary, theft and handling, and robbery, the crime rate in one area is positively and significantly correlated with the crime rates from its neighbouring areas. Furthermore, the crime rate of sexual offences of one area is negatively related to such crime rates in neighbouring areas. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between socioeconomic conditions and <b>property</b> <b>crime</b> rates has <b>been</b> {{a subject of}} interest to social scientists for many decades.

Additionally, studies that focus on states, metropolitan areas or cross-national data have reported conflicting results on the {{relationship between}} the socioeconomic environment and <b>property</b> <b>crime</b> rates. ^ Architects of socioeconomic policy cannot operate effectively in designing policies to lower <b>property</b> <b>crime</b> rates in the absence of definitive and supportive studies indicating strong and consistent relationships of unemployment and income distribution on <b>property</b> <b>crime</b> rates.
