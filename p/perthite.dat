40|$|The {{investigated}} area forms {{part of the}} {{crystalline basement}} of the southwestern half of the Iberian peninsula (Hesperian Massif). In it, Precambrian paragneisses of predominantly greywacke composition surround granite-gneisses with whole-rock Rb-Sr ages of 486 - 500 m. y. Hercynian granites are intrusive into the older rocks. It is argued that the paragneisses underwent a Barrovian type regional metamorphism (probably low P-T portion of the almandine-amphibolite facies) in the Precambrian, were locally thermometamorphosed by some types of the Cambro-Ordovician granite complex, while in the hercynian orogeny they were again subjected to regional metamorphism, but now of the Abukuma-type (andalusite-cordierite-muscovite subfacies of cordierite-amphibolite facies). The Precambrian metamorphism is represented by elongated quartz, biotite flakes and relics of garnet, all enclosed within early-hercynian minerals, the thermometamorphism by altered, fine-grained cordierite and by fine-grained rock structures, the hercynian metamorphism by the occurrence of cordierite, andalusite and cummingtonite, in appropriately composed rocks, on a regional scale. The granite-gneiss complex consists of per-alkaline gneiss (containing quartz, albite, microcline, riebeckite, aegirine, lepidomelane, astrophyllite, zircon, fluorite, xenotime, pyrochlore and some less frequent accessories), biotite gneiss (composed of quartz, microcline, plagioclase, biotite, occasionally muscovite or green amphibole, accessories) and a hybrid series of basic rocks both enclosed within and assimilated by alkaline granite-gneiss. Evidence is presented {{in support of the}} hypothesis that the per-alkaline gneisses were onefeldspar granites before their (hercynian) gneissification, which caused separation of the <b>perthites</b> into very pure albite and microcline, both in the maximum low-temperature state and that riebeckite in its present composition was not an original constituent of the per-alkaline granite either. Considerations on the stability of riebeckite, aegirine and lepidomelane yield P-T conditions compatible with those deduced from the paragneiss mineral assemblage. Sodium, apparently mobile after the separation of the <b>perthites</b> into their composing minerals, migrated into neighbouring rocks, causing the formation of albite porphyroblasts. The influence of prehercynian alkali metasomatism from per-alkaline granite is also locally visible. The hercynian megacrystal, muscovite, two-mica and coarse-grained biotite granites and cordierite-quartzdiorite are petrographically described and their origin and mode of emplacement discussed. Chemical analyses were made of paragneiss, metasomatosed paragneiss, per-alkaline gneiss, amphibolites, rocks of the hybrid series and of microcline, riebeckite, aegirine and lepidomelane.

The textures developed range from allotriomorphic granular to porphyroclastic to mosaic granulob-lastic. The nepheline syenites are pyroxene-poor. Pyroxenes occur most commonly as corroded diopside to diopsidic hedenbergite cores surrounded by amphibole and less commonly as acmitic hedenbergite overgrowths upon cores of iron-rich amphiboles. Amphiboles are the dominant mafic phase and range from magnesian hastingsitic hornblende to hastingsite to hastingsitic hornblende to ferroedentic hornblende.

40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{two distinct}} generations of authigenic K-feldspar in Fucoid Bed sandstones from An-t-Sron and Skiag Bridge, NW Highlands, Scotland, which have experienced post-growth heating to levels {{in excess of}} the predicted Ar-closure temperature. Authigenic K-feldspars show microtextural similarities to patch perthites; that is subgrains separated by dislocation-rich boundary networks that potentially act as fast diffusion pathways for radiogenic argon. The two generations of authigenic K-feldspar in the Fucoid Bed sandstones can be distinguished by different microtextural zones, bulk mineral compositions, fluid-inclusion populations, and inferred temperatures and chemistries of parent fluids. Ar–Ar age data obtained using high-resolution ultraviolet laser ablation, show that the first cementing generation is Ordovician and the second cementing generation is Silurian. Modelling of Ar diffusion using subgrain size as the effective diffusion dimension and a simplified tectono–thermal thrust model assuming transient heating of the Fucoid Beds is inconsistent with observed data. Removal of heat from the thrust zone through rapid flushing of heated fluids rather than transient heating can be invoked to explain the observed Ar–Ar ages for both generations of cement. Alternatively, Ar-diffusion modelling using overgrowth thickness as the effective diffusion dimension instead of subgrain size also yields models that are consistent with both the Fucoid Bed palaeothermal maxima and determined Ar–Ar age ages for the two generations of K-feldspar cement. Based on this alternate explanation, we propose a theoretical microtextural model that highlights fundamental differences between the microtextures of deuterically formed patch <b>perthites</b> and authigenic K-feldspars, explaining the apparent robustness of authigenic K-feldspar with respect to Ar-retention. </p...|$|R

It is the aim of this paper to provide data to identify alkali felspars in groundmasses of extrusive rocks, <b>perthites</b> and other fine grained structures. Moreover the variation of the intensities and the position of spacings of the powder patterns of natural alkali felspars is compared with the variation in optical properties and chemical composition. To this purpose alkali felspars of different localities, chemical composition, crystallization temperature and rate of cooling are investigated with optical methods, X-ray powder analysis and as far as possible, chemical analysis. The optical examination of the alkali felspars was made with the four axes universal stage.

40|$|Charge {{contrast}} imaging in {{the scanning}} electron microscope can provide {{new insights into the}} scale and composition of alkali feldspar microtextures, and such information helps considerably with the interpretation of their geological histories and results of argon isotope thermochronological analyses. The effectiveness of this technique has been illustrated using potassium-rich alkali feldspars from the Dartmoor granite (UK). These feldspars contain strain-controlled lamellar crypto- and microperthites that are cross-cut by strain-free deuteric microperthites. The constituent albite- and orthoclase-rich phases of both microperthite generations can be readily distinguished by atomic number contrast imaging. The charge contrast results additionally show that sub-micrometre-sized albite ‘platelets’ are commonplace between coarser exsolution lamellae and occur together to make cryptoperthites. Furthermore, charge contrast imaging reveals that the orthoclase-rich feldspar is an intergrowth of two phases, one that is featureless with uniform contrast and another that occurs as cross-cutting veins and grains with the { 110 } adularia habit. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the featureless feldspar is tweed orthoclase, whereas the veins and euhedral grains are composed of irregular microcline that has formed from orthoclase by ‘unzipping’ during deuteric or hydrothermal alteration. The charge contrast imaging results are especially important in demonstrating that deuteric <b>perthites</b> are far more abundant in alkali feldspars than would be concluded from investigations using conventional microscopy techniques. The unexpected presence of such a high volume of replacement products has significant implications for understanding the origins and geological histories of crustal rocks and the use of alkali feldspars in geo- and thermochronology. Whilst the precise properties of feldspars that generate contrast remain unclear, the similarity between charge contrast images and corresponding cathodoluminescence images of deuteric microperthites indicates that trace element chemistry and possibly also elastic strain within the crystal play a major role...|$|R

40|$|Various {{measurements}} of thermal trap depth are evaluated for K-feldspar grains extracted from a bedrock sample. The initial rise method {{and the various}} heating rates method yield consistent results for both the natural signal (E = 1. 23 and 1. 16 eV, respectively) and for a regenerative dose of 64 Gy (0. 83 and 0. 78 eV). For the fractional glow curve, apparent E-values range from 0. 39 eV to a plateau around 1. 50 eV. The highest values for the natural and regenerative signals are obtained using the newly-developed post-isothermal TL (pI-TL) method wherein the isothermal loss curves (gotten by subtracting TL curves obtained after different preheat durations) are fitted in the initial rise region on an Arrhenius plot. For a dose of 12. 8 Gy, this method measures apparent E-values ranging from 0. 73 eV to a plateau near 1. 84 ± 0. 06 eV. We repeat this analysis on three additional feldspar samples (two <b>perthites</b> and a high albite) to get a mean value of E = 1. 86 ± 0. 03 eV. The same analysis of natural aliquots of the K-feldspar sample yields similar results, with the two highest E-values at 1. 81 and 1. 86 eV. The kinetic order does not systematically vary with isothermal holding temperature or duration but remains relatively constant at 1. 6 ± 0. 3 (regenerative dose) and 1. 5 ± 0. 5 (natural dose). The apparent frequency factor, measured assuming a single E -value of 1. 86 eV, decreases systematically (View the MathML source) with hold temperature and duration, a result {{which is consistent with}} a thermally-activated, distance-dependent tunneling model for feldspar thermoluminescence (i. e., a single trap depth and a continuum of apparent frequency factors). Frequency factor values measured following identical isothermal treatments are comparable between the natural and regenerative post-isothermal TL curves.

40|$|The Coldwell Complex, northwestern Ontario, is a {{multiphase}} alkaline intrusion that is host to {{rare earth}} element, actinide and other high field strength element mineralization. Preliminary {{studies have shown}} that these minerals are concentrated in pegmatites associated with Center One ferrorichterite-ferroaugite syenites and Center Three syenites. The Center One syenites differentiate to pegmatitic residua and are characterized by cumulus perthitic-to-cryptoperthitic alkali feldspar, hedenbergite-aegirine pyroxenes, and intercumulous quartz, calcite, and calcicto- sodic-calcic-to-sodic amphiboles. Center Three residua are similar, except that amphiboles are limited to calcic varieties (hastingsite) and precipitate before feldspar (as opposed to after). All pegmatitic residua are of the niobium-yttrium-fluorine (NYF) type. Back-scattered electron petrography has been used to characterize the mineral paragenesis. Pegmatitic syenitic residua emplaced in, but not derived from the border gabbro (Border Gabbro pegmatite), and residua within ferroaugite syenite units (Railway pegmatites) contain a wide range of rare element minerals which include britholite, chevkinite, fergusonite, monazite, allanite, kainosite, xenotime, REE tluorocarbonates bastnaesite, synchysite and parisite. Other rare element enriched minerals include apatite, thorite, zircon, zirconolite, niobium rutile and U-Th-Sipyrochlore. Early-formed rare element minerals such as allanite, britholite, chevkinite, kainosite, and pyrochlore are commonly replaced by complex aggregates of later-forming phases such as REE-tluorocarbonates. Other riebeckite-quartz (Upper Marathon Shore pegmatites), richteritequartz (Black pegmatites) and hastingsite-quartz (Center Three pegmatites) bearing pegmatitic residua contain a more restricted range of rare element minerals, which include zircon, xenotime, monazite and tluorocarbonates together with REE-bearing apatite, thorite and pyrochlore. The differences in rock forming and accessory mineralization suggest that most, if not all, residua are derived from different batches offerroaugite syenite and syenite magma. Intensive parameters have been estimated using the habit of <b>perthites,</b> the coexistence of zircon and baddeleyite, Fe-Ti-oxide compositions, amphibole mineralogy, and tluorocarbonate stability.

Their contacts are sharp or gradational, when feldspars of S 1 - 2 type are enclosed as xenocrysts in S 3. Basic alkaline rocks form a discontinuous zone {{at the top of}} S 2; calc-silicate rocks occur at the same horizon. Similar basic types grade into limestone xenoliths in the north of the intrusion. A magnetometer survey showed anomalies corresponding to the outcrop of the ultrabasic rocks allowing their continuation to be traced. The magnetic properties of these rocks require that the induced component of the magnetization be used in interpretation of the anomalies. They are caused by a steeply inclined sheet. Further ultrabasic masses were proved by excavation. Brief petrographic description of the rook types is made with modal data. Cell dimensions of pyroxenes from metamorphosed limestones and basic and ultrabasic types are identical. The mafic aggregates in the basic rocks represent the remains of material of metamorphic origin. The alkali feldspars are described in terms of their appearance in thin section, optic axial angle, bulk composition and X-ray powder and single crystal properties. They are low albite-microcline and low albite-orthoclase <b>perthites</b> in the compositional range Or(_ 27) -Or(_ 41). Only S 1 and S 2 have mono-clinic material in the potassium phase. There may be a systematic distribution of microcline obliquities with locality. Little modification of feldspars was found at contacts between syenites and xenocrysts preserve higher temperature features than host material. Minimum crystallization temperatures are suggested. The variation depended on concentration of volatiles during cooling. A mechanism is suggested for the metastable preservation of orthoclase. The ultrabasic rocks are a skarn between limestone and syenite.

The purpose has been to apply process mineralogical methodology for characterizing and quantifying granitic pegmatite used for industrial mineral products like quartz, feldspar and muscovite. The first part included the development of Rietveld X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods for quantification of the main mineralogy of granitic pegmatites from two pegmatite deposit areas; Glamsland (Norway) and Limbergsbo (Sweden). This Rietveld XRD method was tested against other known quantification methods like X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and element to mineral conversion based on mineral chemistry data achieved from Electron Probe Micro Analyser (EPMA). The result of the comparison was that Rietveld XRD was an accurate and precise quantification method. Also because the method is mathematically based, the analyses were reproducible and {{the handling of the}} method was user friendly not demanding an expert interpretation for every sample analysed. The second part of the project included a characterization of the mineralogy. The methods used were XRF, the newly developed Rietveld XRD methods, Point Counting using an optical microscope (PC), Image Analysis (IA) and Mineral Liberation Analysis (MLA) using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and mineral chemistry and element mapping of certain elements using the EPMA. The main perspective was to characterize the mineralogy of the granitic pegmatite from Glamsland and Limbergsbo deposits, with a special focus on feldspar and the defined quality parameters. The quality parameters were different for the two deposit areas. For the Glamsland deposit area the main quality parameter was content of iron (Fe), and also types of feldspar. Quartz was not considered due to documented quality parameters for the products confirming Fe content to be stable and low (0. 01 Wt. %). During the analysis it was discovered that the feldspars (microcline and albite) had several inclusions of contaminating minerals, in addition to microtextures like graphic granite, <b>perthites</b> and anti-perthites. The albite investigated was more exposed to alteration than microcline, and had a higher content of contaminating mineral inclusions. For albite and microcline in two of the raw materials investigated elevated levels of Fe 2 O 3 was observed in the mineral chemistry. The reason for this was that Fe was able to enter the crystal lattice in feldspar influencing the chemical assays. For the Limbergsbo deposit the quality parameters covered content of iron (Fe) and also fluorine (F) in the pegmatites. During the analysis it was discovered that content of both Fe and F was present in muscovite, a discovery that lead to further analysis of muscovite. The results of these extra analyses were that at least three types of muscovite were present in the pegmatite, a Fe-rich type, an F-rich type, and more regular muscovite. The methods included in this project have proved to cover several kinds of information of the materials investigated, and in summary provide important chemical, mineralogical and textural knowledge. As process mineralogical methods for exploration, the different methods can be used in combinations well suited for the deposits which are to be investigated. For industrial companies to be able to utilize a deposit in the best way both considering cost efficiency and environmental aspects the most important step is thoroughly exploration of the deposit area before opening. This should be done to reveal the geological settings like structural geology and process mineralogy. Based on the knowledge received from the exploration, it is then possible to develop an enrichment process best fitted for refining of the raw materials. The findings from an exploration {{can also be used to}} set up quality control management procedures covering daily quality control of the material and periodically quality controls. These periodically quality controls can reveal changes in the mineralogy and distribution of contaminating elements, an information that can be used to update the methods used for daily quality control management.

40|$|The palaeoproterozoic Djebel Drissa ring complex (Eglab shield, Algeria) is {{composed}} of metaluminous and peralkaline granites: {{the first group of}} granites is red to pink, contains biotite (annite) as Mg-Fe constituent and forms the core of the complex. The second group is greyish and outcrops at the rim of the complex; the mafic minerals in this second group of granites are Na-Fe rich amphiboles and pyroxenes (arfvedsonite, riebeckite, aegyrine). In the peralkaline granites, the textural relations between the Na-Fe minerals are ambiguous. In some cases, amphibole seems to be replaced by pyroxene; in other cases the relations seem opposites. Optical observations suggest that these minerals crystallized at late and hydrothermal stages from alkaline/peralkaline liquids, with the appearance of isolated albite crystals, diffuse albitization, droplets of quartz around <b>perthites</b> and ferruginization of zircon. The Agpaitic Index (Na+K) /Al of the rocks controlled the crystallization of these minerals; both the amphiboles and the pyroxenes show, from the core of the complex to the rim, a general increase in Na and Si and a decrease in Ca + IVAl. Several amphibole crystals from the ring complex were characterized using EMP and FTIR spectroscopy. Microchemical analyses show that the Djebel Drissa amphiboles must be classified in the arfvedsonite compositional space; they are Mn- and F-rich, and less magnesian and more sodic than those from the same type of granites (type Negal and alkaline pink) outcropping at Fort Trinquet in Mauritania. The evolution of the amphibole composition can be well described (Fig. 1) by a complex relationship: ANa + BM 2 + + 2 CM 2 + = A + BNa + 2 CM 32 + [1]. As experimentally demonstrated, for decreasing fO 2 conditions, this substitution proceeds toward more riebeckitic compositions, and can be effectively used to monitor the oxidation conditions during crystallization[1]. In the case of the studied suite of samples, the amphibole from the core of the complex notably show higher arfvedsonite component, allowing us to infer evolution toward more reducing conditions, in agreement with petrographic and petrological observations[2, 3]. Micro-FTIR OH-stretching spectra were collected on several crystal fragments manually extracted from the host-rocks, under unpolarized light. They show systematically a two-band pattern, consisting of a very sharp intense absorption at 3618 cm- 1 and a second, broader and composite band centred at 3648 cm- 1. On the basis of our previous experience with these amphibole compositions, the former absorption can be assigned to configurations involving Fe 2 + at M(1, 3), while the broader band at 3648 cm- 1 can be assigned to configurations involving CLi; both configurations are associated with vacant A-sites in the structure. Calculation of the crystal-chemical formulae following the suggestions of [4] for Li-bearing, sodic amphiboles, shows that the studied samples from Drissa in fact have a composition close to potassian fluoro-ferroleakeite, (Na,K) Na 2 (Fe 2 + 2 LiFe 3 + 2) Si 8 O 22 F 2. Interpretation of the FTIR patterns based on the stoichiometries obtained by EMP suggests extreme short-range-order in the structure of these amphiboles, the main feature of which can be summarized as: (1) all Fe 3 + is strongly ordered at M(2), (2) CLi is ordered at an OH-coordinated site (M(3), e. g. [5]), (3) ANa is strongly associated with O 3 F, and (4) CLi is strongly associated with vacant A-sites. Features (1), (2) and (3) are in agreement with extensive single-crystal refinement on amphiboles (e. g. [4, 5]), while feature (4) is in apparent contrast with previous findings (e. g. [4]).
