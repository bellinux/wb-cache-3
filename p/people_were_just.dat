500|$|After {{the end of}} {{her visit}} in England, Marie {{returned}} to Paris, where the <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as excited for her arrival as they had been a few weeks before. Crowds gathered around her frequently, waiting to see the [...] "exotic" [...] Queen of Romania. American President Woodrow Wilson remained unimpressed by Marie, and her comments on Russian laws dealing with sexual relations, which were considered inappropriate, did not help. Marie shocked many officials by waving all her ministers aside and leading negotiations herself. On this, she would later comment, [...] "Never mind, you'll all just {{have to get used to}} accepting me with the faults of my virtues." [...] Marie left Paris with numerous supplies for Romania's relief and later that year, the conference resulted in the international recognition of Greater Romania, thus doubling Ferdinand and Marie's kingdom to [...] and increasing the population by ten million. This led Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, who briefly lived in Bucharest, to conclude that [...] "by her charm, beauty, and ready wit, [...] could obtain anything she desired".|$|E
500|$|Munroe {{stated in}} terms of the story line that ideas were floated as extreme as the Turtles being in space, but {{eventually}} it just came back to New York City, and the theme of the family that had fallen apart. When developing the screenplay, Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or [...] "less Cowabunga" [...] and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience. [...] "I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing. Most <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> coming and wanting to make it too funny. I think that version of the movie could do really well, but we wanted to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting!" [...] Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation, he was after the feel of a comic book. Karai was one of Munroe's favoriite characters from the comics and he [...] "was the one who really pushed for Karai" [...] to appear in the film. TMNT co-creator Peter Laird stated it takes place in its own universe separate from the previous films. However, director Munroe says the film exists in the same continuity as the other films, which was supported by the memento wall {{at the end of the}} film.|$|E

[...] A breakdown of the statistical figures showed that 85 people were assaulted in places of worship, compared to 66 at adult entertainment locations. [...] Incidents of both sexual assault and harassing and threatening behavior were also greater at places of worship. [...] The report included churches, synagogues, monasteries, mosques, convents, cathedrals and chapels as places of worship. [...] Premises listed as adult entertainment sites included strip clubs, sex shops, brothels, massage parlors, gay clubs, gaming houses, and gambling clubs.

The following year Robinson introduced Keys to her future A at Arista Records, Peter Edge, who later described his first impressions to HitQuarters: [...] "I {{had never met}} a young R artist with that level of musicianship. So many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> singing on top of loops and tracks, but she had the ability, not only {{to be part of}} hip-hop, but also to go way beyond that." [...] Edge helped Robinson create a showcase for Keys and also got involved in developing her demo material. He was keen to sign Keys himself but was unable to do so at that time due to being on the verge of leaving his present record company. Keys signed to Columbia Records soon after. At the same time as signing a recording contract with Columbia Records, Keys was accepted at Columbia University. At first, Keys attempted to manage both, but after a month, she dropped out of college to pursue her musical career full-time.|$|E

It was, however, a lesson to me not to meddle with men of {{temperament}} so different from my own. I wrote to young Holsteig and asked him to come and lunch with me. He thanked me, but could not, of course, being confined to a five-mile radius. Really anxious to see him, I motorbiked down to their house. I found a very changed youth; moody and introspective, thoroughly forced in upon himself, and growing bitter. He had been destined for his father's business, and, marooned as he was by his nationality, had nothing to do but raise vegetables in their garden and read poetry and philosophy--not occupations to take a young man out of himself. Mrs. Holsteig, whose nerves were evidently at cracking point, had become extremely bitter, and lost all power of seeing the war as a whole. All the ugly human qualities and hard people which the drive and pressure of a great struggle inevitably bring to the top seemed viewed by her now as if they were the normal character of her fellow countrymen, and she made no allowance for the fact that those fellow countrymen had not commenced this struggle, nor for the certainty that the same ugly qualities and hard <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> as surely to the fore in every other of the fighting countries. The certainty she felt about her husband's honour had made her regard his internment and subsequent repatriation as a personal affront, as well as a wicked injustice. Her tall thin figure and high-cheekboned face seemed to have been scorched and withered by some inner flame; she could not have been a wholesome companion for her boy in that house, empty even of servants. I spent a difficult afternoon in muzzling my sense of proportion, and journeyed back to Town sore, but very sorry.|$|E
