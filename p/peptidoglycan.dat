5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{possess a}} thick cell wall containing {{many layers of}} <b>peptidoglycan</b> and teichoic acids. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall consisting of a few layers of <b>peptidoglycan</b> surrounded by a second lipid membrane containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. Lipopolysaccharides, also called endotoxins, are composed of polysaccharides and lipid A {{that is responsible for}} much of the toxicity of gram-negative bacteria. Most bacteria have the gram-negative cell wall, and only the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have the alternative gram-positive arrangement. These two groups were previously known as the low G+C and high G+C gram-positive bacteria, respectively. These differences in structure can produce differences in antibiotic susceptibility; for instance, vancomycin can kill only gram-positive bacteria and is ineffective against gram-negative pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. If the bacterial cell wall is entirely removed, it is called a protoplast, whereas if it is partially removed, it is called a spheroplast. β-Lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, inhibit the formation of <b>peptidoglycan</b> cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. The enzyme lysozyme, found in human tears, also digests the cell wall of bacteria and is the body's main defence against eye infections.|$|E
5|$|Most archaea (but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma) {{possess a}} cell wall. In most archaea {{the wall is}} {{assembled}} from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules that cover {{the outside of the}} cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack <b>peptidoglycan</b> in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial <b>peptidoglycan</b> in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make <b>peptidoglycan,</b> therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of the}} ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{antitumor}} {{effect of}} <b>peptidoglycans</b> of various struc-tures extracted from different gram-positive bacteria was studied, on chemically induced fibrosarcomas, in C 3 H/He, C 57 BL/ 6, and (C 57 BL/ 6 x C 3 H/He) F, mice. When given sc admixed with tumor cells, only some <b>peptidoglycans</b> (those extracted from Bacillus mega-terium and Staphylococcus aureus) enhanced tumor resistance in syngeneic and semiallogeneic hosts, whereas other <b>peptidoglycans</b> (those extracted from Micrococcus Iysodeikticus and Corynebacterium poinsettiae) possessed no antitumor effect. When tumor cells were given ip, administration of <b>peptidoglycans</b> {{by the same}} route was either without effect on tumor growth or it induced tumor enhancement.

40|$|Cell wall lytic enzyme (Kyowa lytic no. 2 enzyme) liberated arthritogenic {{hydrosoluble}} <b>peptidoglycans</b> {{from both}} arthritogenic and non-arthritogenic bacterial cell walls. From these cell walls, mutanolysin (peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme) also liberated hydrosoluble <b>peptidoglycans</b> which, however, lacked arthritogenicity. Based on the chemical composition of these <b>peptidoglycans,</b> {{it was suggested}} that their arthritis-inducing ability depends on a relatively long chain of glycan units that consists of repeated units of N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramic acid. However, the glycan chain lengths on these <b>peptidoglycans</b> appeared to be related to their adjuvancy rather than to an antigen(s) responsible for development of arthritis in rats...|$|R
40|$|The {{organization}} of type I collagen {{and how it}} is affected by glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans (PGs), and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components have been extensively studied. Type III collagen and its interactions with GAGs and PGs have not been widely studied. Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) are found incorporated in all collagenous tissues and have been shown to modulate collagen fibrillogenesis. In a previous study, type I collagen-binding <b>peptidoglycans</b> were synthesized to mimic the native SLRP decorin. Synthetic <b>peptidoglycans</b> consist of a collagen-binding peptide attached to a GAG chain, such as dermatan sulfate (DS). This study examines the effects of type III collagen-binding <b>peptidoglycans</b> on collagen organization. The effects of two <b>peptidoglycans,</b> DS-KELNLVYTGC and DS-GSITTIDVPWNVGC, on type III collagen fibrillogenesis, morphology, viscoelastic properties, and biological properties are assessed in this study. These <b>peptidoglycans</b> affect the fibril diameter and density, enhance the viscoelastic properties, and alter the biological properties of type III collagen gels. The ability to control the {{organization of}} type III collagen demonstrates the tissue engineering application of <b>peptidoglycans.</b> Type I collagen has been widely studied as a biomaterial for varied tissue engineering applications. The prevalence of type III collagen in vascular tissue indicates that it may be an advantageous component of tissue engineered blood vessels. Future work may investigate vascular tissue engineering materials consisting of types I and III collagen in the presence of synthetic collagen-binding <b>peptidoglycans.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin <b>peptidoglycan</b> layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides a barrier to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called <b>peptidoglycan.</b> Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains {{a thick layer}} of <b>peptidoglycan</b> and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the mitogenic and immunomodulating effects of {{bacterial}} cell wall preparations were investigated. Cell walls, <b>peptidoglycans,</b> and teichoic acids from Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus Wood 45 activated both human T cells (supplemented with 10 % monocytes) and B cells to proliferate and to produce leukocyte-inhibitory factor. Similar results were obtained with adult and umbilical cord blood cells, suggesting that these bacterial preparations were acting as mitogens. Cell walls and <b>peptidoglycans</b> had a modulating effect on purified protein derivative- or protein A-induced proliferation. In the presence of suboptimal concentrations of these stimulants, bacterial components enhanced the proliferative response. However, at optimal concentrations of purified protein derivative or protein A, bacterial components suppressed lymphocyte proliferation. <b>Peptidoglycans</b> solubilized by lysozyme activated B lymphocytes but not T cells. Solubilization {{had no effect on}} the immunomodulating capacity...|$|R

25|$|The {{chloroplast}}idan chloroplasts, {{or green}} chloroplasts, are another large, highly diverse primary chloroplast lineage. Their host organisms are {{commonly known as}} the green algae and land plants. They differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes, and contain chlorophyll b instead. Most green chloroplasts are (obviously) green, though some aren't, like some forms of Hæmatococcus pluvialis, due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls' green colors. Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the <b>peptidoglycan</b> wall between their double membrane, leaving an intermembrane space. Some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the <b>peptidoglycan</b> layer, though they've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} {{classification}} include: method of killing (pore-forming, nuclease activity, <b>peptidoglycan</b> production inhibition, etc.), genetics (large plasmids, small plasmids, chromosomal), molecular weight and chemistry (large protein, peptide, with/without sugar moiety, containing atypical amino acids such as lanthionine), and {{method of production}} (ribosomal, post-ribosomal modifications, non-ribosomal).|$|E
40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{represent a}} major group of pathogens that infect all eukaryotes from plants to mammals. Gram-negative microbe-associated molecular patterns include lipopolysaccharides and <b>peptidoglycans,</b> major immunostimulatory determinants across phyla.

25|$|As a {{phospholipid}} bilayer, the lipid {{portion of}} the outer membrane is impermeable to charged molecules. However, channels called porins {{are present in the}} outer membrane that allow for passive transport of many ions, sugars and amino acids across the outer membrane. These molecules are therefore present in the periplasm, the region between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes. The periplasm contains the <b>peptidoglycan</b> layer and many proteins responsible for substrate binding or hydrolysis and reception of extracellular signals. The periplasm is thought to exist in a gel-like state rather than a liquid due to the high concentration of proteins and <b>peptidoglycan</b> found within it. Because of its location between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, signals received and substrates bound are available to be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using transport and signalling proteins imbedded there.|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA), a {{debilitating}} disease {{starts at the}} articular surface of cartilage and deteriorates the entire joint. This clinical need has yet to see a conclusive treatment. While etiologies and exact molecular mechanisms that cause this chronic disease remain elusive, key pathophysiological changes occurring during the degradation process have been identified. Of these, loss of aggrecan, a major proteoglycan in cartilage, is considered to occur first, after which other cartilage matrix components become extremely susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Therapies that protect the matrix from degradation have been proposed as ideal candidates to mitigate the inflammatory cycle of OA. ^ To address this clinical need, our laboratory has designed molecules, coined <b>peptidoglycans,</b> modeled to functionally mimic proteoglycans and limit proteolytic degradation. This dissertation studied the efficacy of two such <b>peptidoglycans,</b> consisting primarily of a chondroitin- 6 -sulfate backbone functionalized with either hyaluronan or collagen type II binding peptides, as a potential therapy to prevent cartilage degradation and promote repair. These <b>peptidoglycans</b> are able to directly adhere to cartilage extracellular matrix components and are less prone to proteolytic cleavage. The efficacy of these <b>peptidoglycans</b> were tested in three different cartilage degradation models: type I collagen scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes and stimulated with interleukin- 1 β, trypsin treated cartilage explants stimulated with interleukin- 1 β and cartilage explants treated with synovial fluid from OA patients. ^ Our findings indicated the ability to enhance bulk mechanical properties in collagen scaffolds and aggrecan depleted cartilage explants. In addition the mimic shows the ability to prevent cytokine induced degradation and modulate anabolic (collagen type II and aggrecan) and catabolic (MMP- 13 and ADAMTS 5) gene expression of chondrocytes. ^ The findings in this dissertation support our hypothesis that by reducing fragmentation of matrix components {{during the early stages}} of OA, the inflammatory cycle can be curbed. This technology shows promising potential to be pursed further as a treatment in early stage OA, preventing excessive cartilage damage and providing a healthy environment for tissue repair and regeneration. ...|$|R
