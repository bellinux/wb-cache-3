40|$|A <b>portion</b> of food {{is usually}} {{considered}} as {{the norm for}} consumption. Due to the <b>portion</b> size effect, people tend to eat more when they are served a larger, {{as opposed to a}} smaller, <b>portion.</b> Here, spontaneous simulations of the experience of eating a <b>portion</b> of food by consumers (i. e., simulated eating) helped to reduce this <b>portion</b> size effect. Those participants who reported more eating simulations selected a smaller percentage of food from the very large <b>portion.</b> However, the quantity of food selected from this very large <b>portion</b> was nevertheless still larger than from the medium <b>portion.</b> Thus, simulated eating reduced but did not eliminate entirely the <b>portion</b> size effect. However, when the participants were encouraged to deliberatively imagine the sensory experiences associated with eating a <b>portion</b> of food (imagined eating), initial <b>portion</b> size no longer influenced the amount of food selected. Potential implications of these results for the consumer, for the food industry, and for public health are discussed...|$|R
