For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment.

30|$|One {{cornerstone}} within Health Care {{that has}} had great impact on cancer patients is {{the increasing number of}} <b>personalized</b> <b>medicines</b> being introduced into the market. The interest in <b>personalized</b> <b>medicines</b> actually results from understanding the molecular biology of diseases. This is mandatory, where the alignment of molecular signatures with particular disease forms, and our ability to measure markers associated with prognosis and outcomes is at the focus of Clinical and Translational Medicine. In this respect, <b>personalized</b> <b>medicines</b> treatment has now become a part of large cohort studies. I have been involved in large such non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in several studies in Asia, and the outcome and impact has been overwhelming. In my view, the Clinical and Translational Medicine is a research field that bridges knowledge of disease processes, gained by in vitro and experimental animal models, with the disease pathways found in humans.|$|R
25|$|<b>Personalized</b> <b>medicine,</b> also termed {{precision}} medicine, is {{a medical}} procedure that separates patients into different groups—with medical decisions, practices, interventions and/or products being tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease. The terms <b>personalized</b> <b>medicine,</b> precision medicine, stratified medicine and P4 medicine are used interchangeably to describe this concept though some authors and organisations use these expressions separately to indicate particular nuances.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} subcategories {{of the concept}} of <b>personalized</b> <b>medicine</b> such as {{predictive}} medicine, precision medicine and stratified medicine. Although these terms are used interchangeably to describe this practice, each carries individual nuances. Predictive medicine describes the field of medicine that utilizes information, often obtained through personal genomics techniques, to both predict the possibility of disease, and institute preventative measures for a particular individual. Precision medicine is a term very similar to <b>personalized</b> <b>medicine</b> in that it focuses on a patient's genes, environment, and lifestyle; however, it is utilized by National Research Council to avoid any confusion or misinterpretations associated with the broader term. Stratified medicine is a version of <b>personalized</b> <b>medicine</b> which focuses on dividing patients into subgroups based on specific responses to treatment, and identifying effective treatments for the particular group.|$|E

25|$|Today in medicine, it {{is common}} that {{physicians}} often use a trial and error strategy until they find the treatment therapy that is most effective for their patient. With personalised medicine, these treatments can be more specifically tailored to an individual and give insight into how their body will respond to the drug and if that drug will work based on their genome. The personal genotype can allow physicians to have more detailed information that will guide them in their decision in treatment prescriptions, which will be more cost-effective and accurate. As quoted from the article Pharmacogenomics: The Promise of Personalised Medicine, “therapy with the right drug at the right dose in the right patient” is a description of how <b>personalized</b> <b>medicine</b> will affect the future of treatment. For instance, tamoxifen {{used to be a}} drug commonly prescribed to women with ER+ breast cancer, but 65% of women initially taking it developed resistance. After some research by people such as David Flockhart, it was discovered that women with certain mutation in their CYP2D6 gene, a gene that encodes the metabolizing enzyme, were not able to efficiently break down Tamoxifen, making it an ineffective treatment for their cancer. Since then, women are now genotyped for those specific mutations, so that immediately these women can have the most effective treatment therapy.|$|E

25|$|Mitochondrial {{diseases}} {{range in}} severity from asymptomatic to fatal, and are most commonly due to inherited rather than acquired mutations of mitochondrial DNA. A given mitochondrial mutation can cause various diseases {{depending on the}} severity of the problem in the mitochondria and the tissue the affected mitochondria are in. Conversely, several different mutations may present themselves as the same disease. This almost patient-specific characterization of mitochondrial diseases (see <b>Personalized</b> <b>medicine)</b> makes them very hard to accurately recognize, diagnose and trace. Some diseases are observable at or even before birth (many causing death) while others do not show themselves until late adulthood (late-onset disorders). This is because the number of mutant versus wildtype mitochondria varies between cells and tissues, and is continuously changing. Because cells have multiple mitochondria, different mitochondria in the same cell can have different variations of the mtDNA. This condition is referred to as heteroplasmy. When a certain tissue reaches a certain ratio of mutant versus wildtype mitochondria, a disease will present itself. The ratio varies from person to person and tissue to tissue (depending on its specific energy, oxygen, and metabolism requirements, and the effects of the specific mutation). Mitochondrial diseases are very numerous and different. Apart from diseases caused by abnormalities in mitochondrial DNA, many diseases are suspected to be associated in part by mitochondrial dysfunctions, such as diabetes mellitus, forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease, lactic acidosis, specific forms of myopathy, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsons's disease, stroke, male infertility and which are also believed {{to play a role in}} the aging process.|$|E
