25|$|George Hodson, who {{had been}} having lunch in the prison officers' mess near the Number 1 post, responded to Lange's whistle. Bennett shouted to Hodson {{that he had a}} prisoner, Walker, pinned down behind the low church {{boundary}} wall. Hodson headed for Walker and picked up Walker's pipe. Hodson grappled with Walker but the escapee managed to break free so Hodson began hitting him over his head with the <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe.</b> Walker was a faster runner than Hodson, but Hodson continued to chase after Walker with the pipe still in his hand. Both men ran towards the armed Ryan.|$|E
2500|$|A {{guard at}} the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center {{discovered}} a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> about five inches long in a telephone booth. [...] A second guard {{thought it might be}} useful in a plumbing project and took it home on the bus to New Jersey, where it exploded on his kitchen table early the next morning. [...] No one was injured.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the help}} of {{geologist}} Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the Cleetwood, a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From {{the stern of the}} Cleetwood, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> {{on the end of a}} spool of piano wire sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points. [...] Their deepest sounding, , was very close to the modern official depth of [...] made in 2000 by sonar. [...] At the same time, a topographer surveyed the area and created the first professional map of the Crater Lake area.|$|E

30|$|Another reason {{accounting}} for temporary material shortage in the spool fabrication practice {{is attributed to}} the fact that raw materials can be misused in fabrication of spools. For example, a 12 -meter-long piece and two 6 -meter-long <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>of</b> the same size, thickness and material type are procured to fabricate Spools A and B. Note the two 6 -meter-long <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>pipe</b> are intended for fabricating the two 5 -meter-long pipe runs on Spool A. However, in the fabrication process, the 12 -meter-long <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>pipe</b> is cut into the two 5 -meter-long pipe runs. This happens to cause material storage in fabricating the 10 -meter-long pipe section on Spool B, which actually requires the 12 -meter-long <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> raw <b>pipe.</b>|$|R

By the time his parents returned about 7.30pm Miles had decided what to do. He {{went down to the}} garage and using a piece of lead pipe he beat his father to death. Taking the same <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> into the house he then went into the kitchen and bludgeoned his mother to death. He took the bodies and tipped them over the cliff {{at the end of the}} garden and then got in the car and drove to see his girlfriend in London. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{earliest}} days of tankships, the need to safely and efficiently transfer bulk liquid to a moored ship has been fundamental. [...] An insufficient solution to this problem led to one of the world's first oil tanker disasters. [...] In 1881, the Branobel tanker Nordenskjöld was taking on kerosene in Baku. [...] The ship was connected to the pier with a simple <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe.</b> [...] While loading, the ship was hit by a gust of wind and the cargo pipe carrying was jerked away from the hold. [...] Kerosene then spilled onto the deck and down into the engine room, where mechanics were working in the light of kerosene lanterns. [...] The ship then exploded, killing half the crew. [...] Ludvig Nobel responded to the disaster by creating a flexible, leakproof loading pipe which was much more resistant to spills.|$|E
60|$|The {{tool room}} was {{supplied}} {{with the necessary}} wrenches {{and all of the}} boys spent two hours in fitting in the new <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe.</b> Then they inspected the other pipes and the engine, but everything appeared to be in first-class shape.|$|E
5000|$|The seventy-third car of 1871 East, Baltimore and Ohio 254645, {{was loaded}} with 58 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe.</b> Each pipe was {{approximately}} 35 feet long and 18 inches in diameter. The conductor found the side stakes had broken {{on the north side}} of the car and part of the lading had fallen from the car. He observed that the ends of high tension bands used to secure the load were trailing over the sides of the car, counted 49 <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> on the car and later made a notation on the waybill that nine <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> were missing. After he completed his examination of the car he uncoupled it from the rear portion of the train and instructed the front brakeman to assist in the movements necessary to set out the car on an adjacent auxiliary track. Before the car was set out he communicated by telephone with the train dispatcher to inform him of the delay to his train and that some pipe were missing from the car. The dispatcher then informed him that the accident had occurred.|$|R
50|$|The cost of {{installation}} is {{high because}} of the number of elbows and small <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> required. The largest cost outlay with modern plastic drain pipes is labor. Use of Street elbows is helpful.|$|R
50|$|Segmental {{sliplining}} is {{very similar}} to continuous sliplining. The difference is primarily based on the pipe material used as the new carrier pipe. When using any bell and spigot pipe such as FRP, PVC, HDPE or Spirally Welded Steel <b>Pipe,</b> the individual <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> are lowered into place, pushed together, and pushed along the existing pipe corridor.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} {{evening as}} Jimmy alighted from the Indiana Avenue car at Eighteenth Street, two men left the car behind him. He {{did not notice}} them, although, {{as he made his}} way toward his boarding-house, he heard footsteps directly in his rear, and suddenly noting that they were approaching him rapidly, he involuntarily cast a glance behind him just as one of the men raised an arm to strike at him with what appeared to be a short <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pipe Mania is {{a puzzle}} game {{developed}} in 1989 by The Assembly Line for the Amiga. It was ported to several other platforms by Lucasfilm Games, {{who gave it}} the name Pipe Dream and acted as general distributors for the US. In this game, the player must connect randomly appearing <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> on a grid to a given length within a limited time.|$|R
50|$|Pipe layers {{operate the}} {{backhoes}} and trenching machinery that dig the trenches {{to accommodate the}} placement <b>of</b> sanitary sewer <b>pipes</b> and stormwater sewer drainpipes. They use surveyor’s equipment to ensure the trenches have the proper slope and install the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> in the trenches, joining the ends with cement, glue or welding equipment. Using an always-open or always-closed valve called a tap, pipe layers connect them to a wider system and bury the pipes.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} pool noodle {{connectors}} on the market. One connector is a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> {{made out of}} foam, slightly larger than a pool noodle {{so that it can}} connect two pool noodles by encasing the end of each. The other connector is made of food grade polypropylene and manufactured in the USA.|$|E

50|$|Mt. Tom was {{a leader}} in snow making in the United States. It made snow almost from its start with hand crafted snow {{machines}}. The snow machines were put together with several pieces of galvanized pipe and were little more that one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> connected to an air source with another pipe connected directly onto {{the side of the}} air pipe that fed water into the air stream.|$|E
5000|$|A finger type {{slug catcher}} {{consists}} <b>of</b> several long <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> ('fingers'), which together form the buffer volume. The {{advantage of this}} type of slug catcher is that pipe segments are simpler to design for high pressures, which are often encountered in pipeline systems, than a large vessel. A disadvantage is that its footprint can become excessively large. An example of a large finger-type slugcatcher can be seen in Den Helder, The Netherlands, using Google Maps.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} use of swaging is to attach {{fittings}} to pipes or cables (also called wire ropes); the parts loosely fit together, and a mechanical or hydraulic tool compresses and deforms the fitting, creating a permanent joint. Pipe flaring machines are another example. [...] Flared <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> are sometimes known as [...] "swage nipples", [...] "pipe swages", or [...] "reducing nipples". In furniture, legs made from metal tubing (particularly in commercial furniture) are often swaged to improve strength {{where they come}} in contact with the ground, or casters.|$|R

5000|$|Hollow milling cutters, {{more often}} called simply hollow mills, are {{essentially}} [...] "inside-out endmills". They are {{shaped like a}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> (but with thicker walls), with their cutting edges on the inside surface. They are used on turret lathes and screw machines {{as an alternative to}} turning with a box tool, or on milling machines or drill presses to finish a cylindrical boss (such as a trunnion).|$|E

After ignoring the order, he was shot by a rookie officer, and died 90 minutes later in hospital. He was the first known shooting victim on White House grounds. [...] It is unknown whether Plummer intended to attack President Gerald Ford or had another motive.|$|E
50|$|Regular cattle prods can {{actually}} be anything from a baton (goad) or <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> properly wired, to a manufactured fiberglass rod with a rubber handle or even a rectangular-shaped device similar to today's stun guns, which also feature batons. Most prods use two metal tips, but some are rubberized for herding stubborn animals. A Wiffleball bat is also often used as an effective prod because the hollow plastic bat makes a sharp ringing sound when slapped against the skin.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the stages}} of post-harvest {{handling}} is drying rice. The rice drying process for this is still done by direct drying under the sun. The drying process depends {{on the amount of}} solar radiation, especially the rainy winter weather. The results showed that the air flow rate and the number <b>of</b> heating <b>pipes</b> are very influential on the energy supplied air to evaporate the water in the grain. Where the highest energy 3. 948. 7353, 979 Watt blower, wind speed 13 m / s with variations <b>of</b> two heating <b>pipes,</b> while the lowest energy 469, 041. 223 Watt blower, wind speed 13 m / s with variations <b>of</b> three heating <b>pipes.</b> The air flow rate and the number <b>of</b> heating <b>pipes</b> also affect the thermal energy which can be used for drying grain.

A spontaneously gathered fish-audience applaud after the performance, but the now docile cephalopod interrupts them to play a tune on the piano, scatting as he plays. The boy and the fishes clap and cheer until the great fish from a few moments ago appears again; the other sea-creatures having escaped, the boy runs to a large <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> suspended in the sea-floor.|$|E
5000|$|The local jails have {{a history}} of abuse. One former jailor, who started work for the Jefferson County Convict Department in 1919 {{described}} beatings, the administration of laxatives and confinement in a tiny two-by-three-foot cell as well as beatings with rubber hoses. He said, [...] "You can work a man pretty good with a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> and never mark him." [...] In mid-2015, the Department of Justice announced an investigation of the conditions imposed on juveniles in the county jail. It said that young people with mental illnesses were locked in solitary confinement for months at a time. Others were housed with adult prisoners who raped them.|$|E

5000|$|Greebles {{are also}} used to enhance the {{interest}} of interior sets. In Star Trek, the original series, walls of the corridors were decorated with bits and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> things that looked interesting. <b>Pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe</b> poked out <b>of</b> walls, usually with several fittings, and a label implying this was an important <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the infrastructure of the ship. In the original movie Alien, {{the interior of the}} ship, Nostromo, was thoroughly greebled. Art director Roger Christian said, [...] "Let's have a go at it. So we recruited some dressing prop people, got a hold of several tons of scrap, and went to work on the Nostromo's bridge... encrusting the set with pipes and wires and switches and tubing... then we painted it military green and began stenciling labels on everything." ...|$|R
50|$|The saboteur can crouch, climb ladders, run {{and attack}} enemies by {{punching}} and drop-kicking them. He {{begins with a}} single shuriken as a weapon and can also utilise improvised weapons (such as bricks and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipe)</b> found in rubbish piles and boxes around the warehouse. The warehouse contains many security systems the player will need to defeat or avoid. These include guards (who can use hand to hand combat and guns) who stand still and will chase and attack the player if they see him or if he makes too much sound. The guards are assisted by guard dogs and automatic gun emplacements.|$|R
