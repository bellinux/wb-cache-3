5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually {{spent a great deal of}} time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E

Before the referendum, Yeltsin had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies.

25|$|When French {{troops had}} {{approached}} the rivers Rhine and Meuse in November 1794, the Patriots started {{to prepare for}} a revolution and to stockpile weapons. The hiding place was discovered, and Jacobus van Staphorst and Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff had to leave the city to avoid being captured. The society in the Kalverstraat was closed down by the police and Wiselius, the <b>president,</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> announce the message to its members. In January 1795 Wiselius and Nicolaas van Staphorst were part of the revolutionary committee that occupied the townhall. Wiselius stood before the city government in the nearby townhall on the Dam Square to state that the time had arrived for them to resign. The next morning, the new leaders moved in without much ado and voted Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck as their president. Stadholder William V escaped by boat from the beach near the Hague to England; there were no casualties and it is known as a velvet revolution.|$|E

The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two number of questions to the president. They asked whether the president agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed explanation about the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House.

There is no clear consensus on the unfolding of the 1963 events; in fact, there may have been no plot at all and the entire series of events may have been part of a plan by Houphouët-Boigny to consolidate his hold on power. Between 120 and 200 secret trials were held in Yamoussoukro, in which key political figures—including Mockey and the president of the Supreme Court Ernest Boka—were implicated. There was discontent in the army, as the generals grew restive following the arrest of Defense Minister Jean Konan Banny, and the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> intervene personally to pacify them.|$|E

Smith and Strang were some 225miles (362km) apart at the time, and Strang offered witnesses to affirm that he had made his announcement before news of Smith's demise was publicly available. [...] Strang's letter is held today by Yale University.

500|$|As {{in other}} crises, Chamorro's ability to {{compromise}} was pivotal. The {{executive and legislative}} branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but the <b>president</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government; and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote. Though {{some of the changes}} also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures—creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others—failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration's ability to prosecute, it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek transitional justice. [...] Sofía Montenegro, editor of the Sandinistan paper Barricada and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse if she could have, but others, like Bishop Bernardo Hombach, are confident that her faith would have required her to forgive. Prosecutions would have prolonged conflict and harsh retaliation would not have brought about the reconciliation and peace she desired.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the role}} of President of Ireland was largely ceremonial, Hyde did make {{important}} decisions during his presidency. He was confronted with a crisis in 1944 when de Valera's government unexpectedly collapsed in {{a vote on the}} Transport Bill and the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{decide whether or not to}} grant an election to de Valera. Under the Constitution the President of Ireland may grant or refuse a dissolution to a Taoiseach who has [...] "ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann". If a dissolution is granted, a general election is proclaimed to fill the seats now vacated by the dissolution. However, this means that for four to six weeks, until the new Dáil assembles, there is no Dáil. Fearing this gap might facilitate an invasion during World War II, during which no parliament could be called upon to deal with the invasion, the Oireachtas enacted emergency legislation (under Article 28.3.3°) - [...] - which allowed an election to be called separate from a dissolution, with the Dáil only being dissolved just before new Dáil would assemble, so ensuring the gap between Dála (plural of Dáil) would be too short to facilitate an invasion. Under the Act the President could [...] "refuse to proclaim a general election on the advice of a Taoiseach who had ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann".|$|E

Within a week of the inauguration in 1869, Grant's first choice for the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander T. Stewart, was found ineligible, and the <b>President</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> look for a replacement. Republicans on Capitol Hill, feeling that the cabinet as a whole was weak in members combining Washington experience with solid party credentials, joined to urge him to accept Boutwell, and, tendered the Treasury portfolio, Boutwell accepted. (His selection caused some embarrassment to Grant's Attorney General, Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, who was himself from Massachusetts: by custom, no state was allowed more than one Cabinet seat, and Hoar offered to retire. Grant refused the offer, but a year later, without warning or explanation, sent a messenger demanding his resignation). The business community hailed Boutwell's selection. The news of his appointment created an immediate jump in government bonds on the money markets. [...] "Nor is this to be wondered at," [...] the Commercial and Financial Chronicle commented, [...] "for Mr. Boutwell is well known as an earnest advocate of conservative financial reform. That he is an able administrative officer he gave conspicuous proofs when in 1862 he was entrusted with the organization of the new Internal Revenue Bureau." [...] Boutwell, at that time popular for his two impeachment attempts of President Johnson, was easily confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. [...] Secretary Boutwell often acted independently of President Grant and took on a haughty attitude toward other Cabinet members. [...] Secretary of State Hamilton Fish noted that Boutwell was frequently evasive, noncommittal, and gave [...] "no reasons, and rarely indicates or explains anything of his policy." ...|$|E
