50|$|In 1931 the Swedish {{engineer}} Arne Asplund filed {{a patent}} on a method to defibrate wood chips. As opposed to the Masonite-method, the defibrator-method (also known as the Asplund-method) uses pressurised steam to soften the wood chips, then grinding discs to pull the wood fibres apart. This grinding unit is what Asplund called the defibrator. It became the key product of his company, AB Defibrator.

40|$|Issue: Fiber {{composite}} <b>panelboard</b> mills {{were originally}} designed and constructed to use virgin wood feedstocks as a raw material. Some of the virgin wood fiber {{used for the}} <b>panelboard</b> mills are from low value roundwood. This wood fiber is too small, an undesirable species or too defective for solid wood manufacturing. The remaining virgin feedstocks are typically derived from the residual chips produced by primary wood products manufacturers (sawmills and plywood plants) that use round logs for their raw material. The virgin wood fiber is generally free of non-wood contaminants and relatively uniform in specie, geometry, color, and moisture content. Millions of tons a year of such residuals are generated. The feedstocks produced from wood waste for the <b>panelboard</b> mills are more complex. They frequently contain various quantities of non-wood contaminants, consist {{of a number of}} different species (softwood and hardwood varieties), lack uniform geometry, include weathered wood colors, and might vary significantly in moisture content (green wood to kiln dried).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringAnil PahwaWarren N. WhiteThis thesis {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} the power loss from power panelboards {{by means of}} power loss models. The model {{is intended to be}} used by HVAC engineers to help estimate building heat loss. While McDonald & Hickok (1985) did not report power losses for power panelboards, Rubin (1979) did. These publications present the power losses of electrical devices at rated loads in tables. In this thesis, the models for electrical devices are created and used, instead of tables, to estimate power losses. The use of curve fit models presents a convenience in calculation of power losses. Breaker, fusible switch, and motor starter power losses presented by McDonald & Hickok (1985) and Rubin (1979) were updated using manufacturer published data, technical papers, industrial standards, and test samples. Test, manufacturer, and analytical model data are collected and power loss curve fit models are created for breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures. The <b>panelboard</b> power loss is calculated as the sum of partial power losses of the component electrical equipment, i. e. breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures used in power panelboards. A power loss model for main breaker and fusible switch power panelboards are created based on the sum of breaker, fusible switch, motor starter, and bus bars with enclosure power loss models. The main breaker and fusible switch power <b>panelboard</b> power loss models are used in a heat loss example. It is shown that power <b>panelboard</b> power losses can be significantly overestimated when calculated with one of the methods currently used (Rubin, 1979).

40|$|Urea-{{formaldehyde}} (UF) resin is {{a common}} binder in many fibre- and particleboards today. However, formaldehyde is a fairly reactive compound with many negative affects on health and environment. This paper describes a process to make thin high density fibreboards without use of conventional resin such as UF. Initially we found that wood particles such as ones used in particle board had, when activated with hydrogen peroxide and iron catalyst, self-bonding capability when hot-pressed into boards. Low swelling board, although at somewhat higher density than conventional glued ones, could be formed by pressing activated wood particles at 170 oC in a laboratory press. We found that the activation technique was applicable to dry or semi-dry board processes and {{was considered to be}} well suited for fibreboards from refined wood fibers especially as their specific (contact) area is high. Activated wood fibres were produced at Metso <b>Panelboards</b> Pilot-refiner in Sundsvall and mats were also formed and pressed into boards 50 x 60 cm 2 at fairly conventional pressing conditions. At a hydrogen peroxide charge of 4 % boards made from birch fibres with good mechanical properties (in terms of bending strength and internal bonding) were produced. Thickness swelling in water was low (TS 24 h., 15 - 20 %). At lower hydrogen peroxide charges (< 2 %) the swelling was higher. Development of the process to also include other wood species than birch is in our interest. Furthermore, properties of the boards were strongly dependent on the moisture content of fibres; at low moisture content (MC< 8 %) thickness swelling increased. We see a high potential in the process as the glue-free technique is estimated to reduce production cost of boards as well as give environmental advantages.

40|$|Autumn QuarterThe {{majority}} of the Autumn Quarter was spent developing a suitable program. This was impeded {{by the lack of}} specific verbage both from Dr. Michael and the Office of Extended Services, and the lack of data on the subject of Continuing Education for research purposes. The client had only an approximate idea of what he wanted, and could be specific in only the number of residential units and administrative offices. The site analysis was again hindered by lack of information. The size of the site was much larger than was needed, making it difficult to do detailed research. The schematics done during this period established the basic relationships, both horizontal and vertical, between general spatial categories. Winter QuarterAfter investigating various organizations it was decided that a lineal design was most appropriate. A strong central circulation spine would enable many differing spatial types and functions to be related to one another. In addition, mechanical systems and services would have their horizontal movement concentrated in this core. The initial scheme at mid-quarter was essentially linear with a series of activity nodes along the central spine. The spine was bent for the following reasons: 1. to provide closer physical relationships between the terminal areas of the spine; 2. to provide segregation of various spatial groups in terms of noise; and 3. to provide a semi-enclosed outdoor area. After re-examining the initial scheme, other lineal schemes were investigated. The lower twenty-acre portion of the site was decided the best location and more defined circulation and site zoning concepts were developed. The residential sector of the program, primarily because of privacy, was imposed over the other activity areas, and various schemes evolved. The final scheme incorporated a central spine terminated by entrances and registration areas for out of town and community and university participants. Administrative spaces, laboratories and studios, were organized {{on the north side of}} the spine; and the dining, recreation, and remaining conference and learning areas, on the south. Residential spaces were arranged on a single-loaded corridor. The corridor related to the spine and the rooms received southern sunlight. The auditorium and resource center are centrally located as is the service entrance. Spring QuarterThe largest part of the spring was expended in developing the mechanical, electrical and structural systems for the building. The heating system is a high velocity air system with air handling units distributed in the two central and two terminal equipment areas. Fifty-five degree air is supplied at 3000 feet per minute to attenuation/reheat/distribution boxes that are each controlled by separate thermostats. Air is returned at 1500 FPM. The residential floors are air-conditioned by fan-coil units in the individual spaces. The boilers, shillers, domestic hot water and incinerator are located in the central mechanical equipment spaces and two cooling towers are on the auditorium roof. The storm sewer runs along the central core west to the end of the building and south to Bethel Pike. The sanitary sewer comes in at the service entrance from McGalliard joining the building drain which runs along the central core. Electrical service is from the east end of the building and transformer vault, emergency generators and main switchboards are located at the east end of the basement. <b>Panelboards</b> are located in conjunction with the elevator towers and mechanical chases. The structural system consists of reinforced concrete bearing walls and precast concrete deck. The only exception to this is in the auditorium where the roof is framed with long span structural steel bar joists. The bearing walls gain lateral stability at the terminations of the linear core where they are turned out and in the stair and elevator towers where they are turned in and out again at the interior of the central core.
