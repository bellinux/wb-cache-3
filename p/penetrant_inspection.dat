40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is the fatigue {{assessment}} of a main component of a valve actuator used for oil & gas, power and chemical industries, in order to comply with its heavy-duty applications. To do this, full-scale valve actuator assemblies made of S 355 J 2 steel have been fatigue tested under nominal axial loading. All specimens have been tested under stress-relieved conditions by adopting a nominal load ratio R=- 1. After experimental tests, the fatigue crack paths have been analysed by means of liquid <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspections.</b> The fatigue strength class of the considered yoke has been determined by statistically re-analysing the experimental results, {{expressed in terms of}} range of the nominal applied load, and it has been compared with the design condition required by the relevant European Standard, EN 15714 - 3 / 4. Finally, two methodologies for fatigue strength assessment of the considered scotch yokes have been proposed, which are based on experimental fatigue data derived from smooth or sharp V-notched specimens, respectively, made of the same yoke material. The assessment capability of the proposed methodologies has been evaluated and discussed by comparing theoretical estimations with the experimental fatigue results of the scotch yokes...|$|R
40|$|The {{suitability}} of wrought oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloy sheet for {{gas turbine engine}} combustor applications was evaluated. Two yttria (Y 2 O 3) dispersion strengthened alloys were evaluated; Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes Development Alloy (HDA) 8077 (NiCrAl base). Preliminary tests showed both alloys to be potentially viable combustor materials, with neither alloy exhibiting a significant advantage over the other.

40|$|During the {{lifetime}} of aircraft structures, paint removal and re-application cycles are conducted to restore appearance and to enable inspection for fatigue cracks and corrosion damages. Current paint removals processes, including chemical and abrasive media blasting, yield large amounts of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants, and generate large quantities of waste which require proper disposal/treatment. They also {{have the potential to}} mask surface cracks and decrease the effectiveness of Liquid <b>Penetrant</b> <b>Inspections</b> (LPI). This study compares current paint stripping methods to a novel Atmospheric Plasma (AP) system, which claims to be a more environmentally friendly method. Aluminium and steel coupons were prepared with military aircraft quality topcoat and primer paint schemes and subjected to the three aforemen-tioned paint stripping processes. The results were then characterized in terms of paint removal effectiveness, potential damages to the metallic substrates, and effect on the LPI process. Hardness and conductivity measurements as well as metallographic sectioning and microscopy, were used to characterize the stripped samples. The results indicated that AP had no negative ramifications on detecting fatigue cracks in the substrates, and did not alter the temper, mechanical properties of the aerospace alloys studied. The AP process has the potential to replace current hazardous and less environmentally friendly paint removal methods; though a full systematic qualification and evaluation process is still required for it to be considered as an accepted industrial paint removal process.

Inspection {{has been found to}} be an important part of the manufacturability evaluation made in a large CAD-based parametric environment for making multidisciplinary design simulations in early stages of design at an aircraft component manufacturer. The paper explains how the proposed method is to be included in the design platform at the company. It predicts the expected probability of detection of cracks (POD) in situations where the geometry of the parts is unfavourable for inspection so that potential problems can be discovered and solved in early stages. It is based on automatically extracting information from CAD-models and making a rule-based evaluation. It also provides a scale for how favourable the geometry is for inspection. In the paper it is also shown that the manufacturability evaluation need to take into consideration the expected stresses in the structures, highlighting the importance of multi-disciplinary simulations...|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers and {{operators}} of aircraft have a financial interest in ensuring that the inspection schedule is as cost-efficient as possible. Because aircraft are often revenue producing, {{there is an opportunity}} cost associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself. Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul. Crack growth, as shown by fracture mechanics, is exponential in nature; meaning that the crack growth rate is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see Paris' law). A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has {{led to the development of}} non-destructive testing methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include eddy current, ultrasonic, dye <b>penetrant,</b> and X-ray <b>inspections.</b> By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair.|$|R
