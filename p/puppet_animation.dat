25|$|Anime {{follows the}} typical {{production}} of animation, including storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production (Shirobako, itself a series, highlights {{many of the}} aspects involved in anime production). Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve {{the efficiency of the}} production process. Artists like Noburō Ōfuji pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion <b>puppet</b> <b>animation</b> work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.|$|E
