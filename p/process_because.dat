5|$|The {{direct or}} American process starts with diverse {{contaminated}} zinc composites, such as zinc ores or smelter by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with {{a source of}} carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect <b>process.</b> <b>Because</b> of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process {{as compared to the}} indirect one.|$|E

5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction <b>process.</b> <b>Because</b> there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining <b>process</b> <b>because</b> it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|From the 17th century onwards, some keeps were {{deliberately}} destroyed. In England, {{many were}} destroyed {{after the end}} of the Second English Civil War in 1649, when Parliament took steps to prevent another royalist uprising by slighting, or damaging, castles so as to prevent them from having any further military utility. Slighting was quite expensive and took considerable effort to carry out, so damage was usually done in the most cost efficient fashion with only selected walls being destroyed. Keeps were singled out for particular attention in this <b>process</b> <b>because</b> of their continuing political and cultural importance, and the prestige they lent their former royalist owners – at Kenilworth, for example, only the keep was slighted, and at Raglan, the keep was the main focus of parliamentary activity. There was some equivalent destruction of keeps in France in the 17th and 18th centuries, such as the slighting of Montaiguillon by Cardinal Richelieu in 1624, but the catalogue of damage was far less than that of the 1640s and early 1650s in England.|$|E

5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized <b>process.</b> <b>Because</b> of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
5|$|Sense8 was edited in the Wachowskis' {{headquarters}} in Chicago, Kinowerks, by Joe Hobeck and Joseph Jett Sally {{in the first}} season and by Sally and Fiona Colbeck in the second. Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on Speed Racer and editor on Ninja Assassin. The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be a challenging <b>process</b> <b>because</b> of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as mandated by the Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of Sense8 {{they had to be}} moving at a pace of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) every two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive <b>process</b> <b>because</b> each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E

5|$|Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uranium–thorium dating, {{involving}} {{the decay of}} 234U to 230Th, and ionium–thorium dating, which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. (The name ionium for 230Th is a remnant from a period when different isotopes were not recognised {{to be the same}} element and were given different names.) These rely on the fact that 232Th is a primordial radioisotope, but 230Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238U. Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range <b>process</b> <b>because</b> of the short half-lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process {{involving the}} alpha decay of 235U into 231Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both 232Th and 230Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230Th to 232Th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW <b>process.</b> <b>Because</b> the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
