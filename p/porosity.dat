5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas <b>porosity,</b> shrinkage <b>porosity,</b> hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} quality {{problems}} associated with SMAW include weld spatter, <b>porosity,</b> poor fusion, shallow penetration, and cracking.|$|E
5|$|Two {{variants}} are pore-free die casting, {{which is}} used to eliminate gas <b>porosity</b> defects; and direct injection die casting, {{which is used}} with zinc castings to reduce scrap and increase yield.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} and appearance characteristics of <b>porosities</b> in laser penetrated weld of aluminum alloy were observed, {{and the formation}} mechanisms of <b>porosities</b> were analyzed in detail, and the influences of twin spot laser energy distribution on <b>porosities</b> were investigated. It showed {{that there are two}} kinds of <b>porosities,</b> metallurgical and technologic <b>porosities,</b> in laser penetrated weld of aluminum alloy. The formation of metallurgical <b>porosities</b> is related to the separation, congregation and incorporation of hydrogen in the weld pool, while instantaneous instability of the keyhole is an essential reason for the occurrence of technologic <b>porosities.</b> Twin spot laser energy distribution can enlarge diameters of the opening and the root of the keyhole, improve fluctuating conditions of the wall of the keyhole, increase stability of the keyhole, and consequently decrease technologic <b>porosities</b> in number, but it has no obvious influence on metallurgical <b>porosities...</b>|$|R
40|$|We study <b>porosities</b> in the Mandelbrot {{percolation}} process. We show that, {{almost surely}} at almost all points {{with respect to}} the natural measure, the mean <b>porosities</b> of the set and the natural measure exist and are equal to each other for all parameter values outside of a countable exceptional set. As a corollary, we obtain that, almost surely at almost all points, the lower <b>porosities</b> of the set and the natural measure are equal to zero, whereas the upper <b>porosities</b> obtain their maximum values...|$|R
30|$|The common defects {{are three}} types, namely spherical <b>porosities,</b> irregularly {{incomplete}} fusion holes, and cracks. Spherical <b>porosities</b> are randomly distributed, while incomplete fusion holes are generally distributed between {{the tracks and}} layers.|$|R
5|$|When no <b>porosity</b> {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It is {{identical}} to the standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas <b>porosity.</b> An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to <b>porosity</b> in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause <b>porosity</b> and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause <b>porosity,</b> its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to <b>porosity</b> problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
30|$|The histograms of both {{individual}} <b>porosities</b> and well-mean <b>porosities</b> exhibit good degrees of symmetry. Furthermore, the kernel density distributions {{in both cases}} match closely with the respective normal distributions; just as the Normal Q–Q plots confirmed the plausibility of normal distribution approximations.|$|R
30|$|It is {{therefore}} understood that such spherical <b>porosities</b> are generally {{resulted from the}} entrapped gases in the molten pool due to the excessive energy input or unstable process conditions. The spherical <b>porosities</b> are randomly distributed in an SLM fabricated part, and difficult to eliminate completely.|$|R
40|$|Measurements were {{performed}} to determine the pressure drops for gaseous flow through porous materials of different microstructures, <b>porosities,</b> and thickness under isothermal and nonisothermal conditions at various temperature levels. Results were satisfactorily correlated by a simple equation relating the friction factor to the Reynolds number and <b>porosities...</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, <b>porosity,</b> and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell <b>porosity</b> at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell <b>porosity</b> and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of <b>porosity</b> is gas {{entrapment}} in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional <b>porosity.</b> To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating can also help reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the fluid flow in a periodic, {{non-isotropic}} dual scale porous media consisting of permeable square rods in inline arrangement is analyzed to determine permeability, numerically. The continuity and Navier-Stokes equations are solved {{to obtain the}} velocity and pressure distributions in the unit structures of the dual scale porous media for flows within Darcy region. Based on the obtained results, the intrinsic inter and intraparticle permeabilities and the bulk permeability tensor of the dual scale porous media are obtained for different values of inter and intraparticle <b>porosities.</b> The study is performed for interparticle <b>porosities</b> between 0. 4 and 0. 75 and for intraparticle <b>porosities</b> from 0. 2 to 0. 8. A correlation based on Kozeny-Carman relationship in terms of inter and intraparticle <b>porosities</b> and permeabilities is proposed to determine the bulk permeability tensor of the dual scale porous media...|$|R

5|$|<b>Porosity,</b> {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
5|$|Tanaka et al. (2015) {{found that}} among modern archosaurs (the group {{including}} birds, crocodilians, and dinosaurs), the <b>porosity</b> of eggshells {{can be used}} to accurately predict whether the eggs are buried or laid in open nests. They concluded that Macroolithus nests were either open or only partially covered with vegetation. The eggs' blue-green coloration could have acted as a camouflage to hide the nest from predators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{in order}} to {{optimize}} casting design of an automobile part (Gear Box), Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) was performed by using the simulation software (Z-Cast). The simulation results were analyzed and compared with experimental results. During the filling process, internal <b>porosities</b> caused by air entrap were predicted and reduced remarkably by the modification of the gate system and the configuration of overflow. With the solidification analysis, internal <b>porosities</b> caused by the solidification shrinkage were predicted and reduced by the modification of the gate system. For making better permanent High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) mold, cooling systems on several thick areas are proposed {{in order to}} reduce internal <b>porosities</b> caused by the solidification shrinkage...|$|R

5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause <b>porosity</b> in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E
25|$|Specific yield (Sy) {{is also a}} ratio between 0 and 1 (Sy ≤ <b>porosity)</b> and {{indicates}} {{the amount of water}} released due to drainage from lowering the water table in an unconfined aquifer. The value for specific yield is less than the value for <b>porosity</b> because some water will remain in the medium even after drainage due to intermolecular forces. Often the <b>porosity</b> or effective <b>porosity</b> is used as an upper bound to the specific yield. Typically Sy is orders of magnitude larger than Ss.|$|E

40|$|A {{suite of}} geoelectric {{techniques}} {{were used to}} characterize an aquifer for a pollution study. Vertical electrical soundings were used to define aquifer layer resistivities and thicknesses. <b>Porosities,</b> hydraulic conductivities, and transmissivities were then estimated from the resistivities and thicknesses. The mise-a-la-masse method was used to define direction of flow, tracer velocity, and dispersion coefficients. Finally, borehole logging was used to obtain additional information on <b>porosities</b> and velocities...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: As per {{the review}} of {{literature}} very {{few studies have been}} carried on recasting of dental casting alloy and in particlular its effect on occurrence of <b>porosities.</b> Purpose of Study: This study was designed to find out occurrence of <b>porosities</b> in new alloy and recasted alloy using a scanning electron microscope. Materials and Methods: Different percentage combinations of new and once casted alloy were used to produce twenty five samples. Castings obtained from new alloy were used as control group. All the samples were scanned under scanning electron mocroscope and photographs were taken from three specific sites for comparison. Results: There is no significant difference in occurrence of <b>porosities</b> in casting obtained by using new alloy and recasted alloy. Conclusion: With in the limitations of the study it is conducted that the prorosities will not be affected by recasting of neckel-chromium alloy.

50|$|Porotic {{hyperostosis}} is {{a pathological}} condition affecting the cranial vault. It {{is characterized by}} <b>porosities</b> in the outer table of the cranial vault or orbital roof. When <b>porosities</b> are exhibited in the orbital roof it is called cribra orbitalia. Since the 1950s, the most widely accepted probable cause of porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia is chronic iron-deficiency anemia. While dietary deficiencies are the most probable cause, other possibilities include nutrients lost to intestinal parasites.|$|R

25|$|If a rock unit of low <b>porosity</b> {{is highly}} fractured, {{it can also}} make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), {{provided}} the rock has a hydraulic conductivity sufficient to facilitate movement of water. <b>Porosity</b> is important, but, alone, it does not determine a rock's ability {{to act as an}} aquifer. Areas of the Deccan Traps (a basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock formations with high <b>porosity</b> but low permeability, which makes them poor aquifers. Similarly, the micro-porous (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk of south east England, although having a reasonably high <b>porosity,</b> has a low grain-to-grain permeability, with its good water-yielding characteristics mostly due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Porosity</b> (n) is a {{directly}} measurable aquifer property; it is {{a fraction}} between 0 and 1 indicating {{the amount of}} pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the <b>porosity</b> available to flow (sometimes called effective <b>porosity).</b> Permeability {{is an expression of}} the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high <b>porosity</b> (it has lots of holes between its constituent grains), but a low permeability (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.|$|E
