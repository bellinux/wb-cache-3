In particular, Carrier Enterprise added <b>product</b> <b>depth</b> to Watsco’s markets with premium level residential products, commercial products and the latest energy-efficient technology. Likewise, Carrier Enterprise locations were provided the opportunity to sell additional parts, supplies and other complementary accessories through its existing operating structure, leveraging existing customer relationships and costs. Carrier Enterprise is structured similar to Watsco’s other acquisitions, with a decentralized management structure that keeps the existing management team in place; a cornerstone of Watsco’s operating philosophy. The Carrier Enterprise joint venture resulted in an expansion of Watsco’s revenues by approximately US$1.3 billion in 2010. “For its part, Carrier found a powerful new partner with extensive distribution expertise that would expand sales of its product lines.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines three empirical {{questions in}} the U. S. beer industry. The effect of large container consumption has been well explored in other food categories. However, its effect has been ignored in the U. S. beer industry. Although authorities have been imposing different public policies to lower negative externality of excessive alcohol consumption, statistics still clearly provide evidence related to severity of this problem. Therefore, first manuscript studies the impact of large container beer purchases on alcohol-related accidents. The study finds a statistically significant and positive relationship between large container beer purchases and alcohol-related accidents. Approximately 90 % of the alcohol consumption by youth {{is in the form}} of binge drinking. Thus, second manuscript examines the impact of an unanticipated determinate of binge drinking behavior, minimum wage laws. The study finds a statistically significant and positive relationship between minimum wage increases and binge drinking among youth population. Third manuscript focuses on industry structure of the beer industry. There are many studies focusing on the impact of product variety on different outcome variables. Nonetheless, there is no study aiming to explore the impact of <b>product</b> <b>depth</b> on demand or supply side. In particular, the study examines the effect of <b>product</b> <b>depth</b> on market demand. Results suggest that an optimal product line depth for beer firms might be to provide more package size options than container size options...|$|E

Outshopping is a phenomenon that particularly affects retailers in small, rural communities. Reasons given for such behavior include better prices, more stores and broader <b>product</b> <b>depth.</b> This paper looks at the shopping habits of two distinctly different groups of buyers in a rural county in western Maryland {{to determine the extent}} and reasons for outshopping behavior. The study found that prices and convenience were the most important reasons community residents had for buying certain products. However, local business owners were more influenced by their desire to purchase from local merchants when they made personal buying decisions.

Among various snow cover parameters, snow depth which can indicate snow accumulation is essential for retrieving snow water equivalent. In arid zone of western China, based on different inversion models, snow <b>depth</b> <b>products</b> retrieved from passive microwave remote sensing sensors have been issued. However, none of them can promise a high accuracy due to the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover especially in mountain areas with complex terrain. This study aims to analyse the reliability of existing long-term snow <b>depth</b> <b>products</b> in arid zone of western China. Two datasets are compared including GlobSnow snow water equivalent (SWE) <b>product</b> and snow <b>depth</b> dataset provided by Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China. Statistical techniques like regression and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) models are employed to examine the consistency of these two remote sensing based snow <b>depth</b> <b>products</b> in a selected sampling site.

40|$|Information load {{at various}} {{thresholds}} has been asserted {{to cause a}} decline in decision quality across several domains, including marketing (Eppler and Mengis 2004). The influence of each information load dimension may vary by study and context (Malhotra 1982; Lurie 2002; Lee and Lee 2004). Given the explosion of information available on the internet, attracting an estimated 144 million U. S. users (Burns 2006 a), this experimental research examined how three dimensions of online product information load influenced consumers’ perceived cognitive effort. To the researcher’s knowledge, online <b>product</b> breadth, <b>depth,</b> and density have not been empirically tested together, in a multi-page within website context. A nationwide panel of 268 adult consumers participated in the web-based consumer electronics online search and selection task. Results suggest that a consumer’s perceived cognitive effort with the search and selection task negatively influences choice quality and decision satisfaction. Although product breadth directly influenced both choice quality and cognitive effort negatively, cognitive effort mediated <b>product</b> <b>depth’s</b> influence on choice quality and decision satisfaction. The perception of informational crowding also negatively influenced cognitive effort. Additionally, a choice involvement scale was adapted and developed based upon Schwartz’s (2004) Maximizer and Satisficer scale. Results suggest that the higher one’s choice involvement (tendency toward being a Maximizer), the lower one’s perceived cognitive effort with the search and selection task. Both product and choice involvement demonstrated a direct negative influence on cognitive effort, lending further empirical support for the information processing theory of consumer choice (Bettman 1979). A stimulus-organism-response framework, adapted from environmental psychology, was employed to model the relationships among the constructs tested. Results suggest that this framework may be helpful for guiding future online consumer research...|$|R

40|$|The {{suspended}} particulate organic matter, SPOM, in the autumnal Black Sea has been characterised using catalytic hydropyrolysis (HyPy) {{of the total}} (bound plus free) lipid material. The technique, which generates maximum yields of volatile products from sediments, kerogens and phytoplankton, was followed using gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The generated alkanes were dominated by n-C 18, hypothesised to arise predominantly from unsaturated C 18 fatty acids. Steranes were generated from reductive conversion of free and bound sterols. The generation of branched alkanes and especially of hopanes provided formal evidence for the participation of bacteria in the mineralisation of the SPOM. Whereas similar distributions of n-alkanes were generated from SPOM sampled from different depths of the comparatively well-stirred Rhodes Gyre (eastern Mediterranean), mineralisation of the SPOM at each depth of the central Black Sea produced characteristic changes in the composition and concentration of the HyPy <b>products.</b> <b>Depth</b> profiles of the n-alkanes generated from SPOM {{in the region of}} the Rim Current were affected by the local hydrography.

Improper or "slow" cooling has been identified by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as a contributing factor in foodborne illness outbreaks. This {{study was designed to}} test the efficacy of cooling technique combinations on controlling microbial growth within pre-cooked taco meat, chili con carne with beans, low sodium marinara sauce, and brown rice food products. These products were cooked to 73. 8 °C (165 °F) and then portioned to 2 and 3 -inch depths in steam table pans. Food product was allowed to cool to 60 °C ± 5 °C (140 °F ± 5 °F) before inoculation with surrogate Escherichia coli (E. coli) or Biosafety Level I (BSL I) Bacillus cereus (B. cereus). Pans were uncovered or covered with one or two layers of aluminum foil to allow or restrict air exposure and then placed in a - 20 °C (- 4 °F) commercial walk-in freezer or situated in ice water baths in a commercial walk-in refrigerator 4 °C (39. 2 °F). Food products were sampled over a 24 -hour period (0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hour time points) for enumeration of microbial populations. Conclusions from the cooling temperature data in this study revealed uncovered pans and pans stored in the freezer at 2 -inch food <b>product</b> <b>depths</b> cooled most rapidly. However, few cooling methods achieved the two-step US FDA Food Code requirement for pre-cooked taco meat, chili con carne with beans, and brown rice products and none of the cooling methods tested achieved the US FDA food code requirement for low sodium marinara sauce. Surrogate E. coli and BSL I B. cereus microbial population data revealed pre-cooked taco meat, chili con carne with beans, and brown rice products all exhibited a certain degree of overall population decline during the 24 -hour cooling period. However, a small recovery of surrogate E. coli population was observed in the low sodium marinara sauce product as well as 2 -inch <b>product</b> <b>depths</b> of the chili con carne with beans product. This observed growth was less than 0. 50 log₁₀ CFU/g, indicating low risk for microbial proliferation from the cooling methods tested. It is possible that the surrogate E. coli and BSL I B. cereus population changes observed were not the result of cooling failure or risk, but rather due to natural variations within the food products. These results indicate all 12 cooling methods tested were low risk and therefore effective at controlling E. coli and B. cereus microbial populations within the four food products...|$|R
