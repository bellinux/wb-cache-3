Sixteen scuba divers have lost their lives diving on the wreck, and diving conditions at the wreck site are considered very treacherous. Strong currents and heavy sediment that can reduce visibility to zero pose serious hazards to diving this site. Dr. Robert Ballard (the man responsible for locating the wrecks of the ocean liner Titanic, the German battleship Bismarck, and the American aircraft carrier [...] and <b>patrol</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> PT-109), who visited the site in a U.S. Navy submersible in 1995, reported that thick fishing nets draped the hull. An invisible web of thin fishing lines, which can easily snag scuba gear, provides more danger. Furthermore, the wreck is slowly collapsing; {{the top of the}} wreck is now at , and many of the passageways have begun to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|... (A PT is a <b>patrol</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> and a bluejacket is an enlisted sailor.) These incidents, {{along with}} many other perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E

50|$|A PT boat (short for <b>Patrol</b> <b>Torpedo</b> <b>boat)</b> was a torpedo-armed fast attack craft {{used by the}} United States Navy in World War II. It was small, fast, and {{inexpensive}} to build, valued for its maneuverability and speed but hampered {{at the beginning of}} the war by ineffective torpedoes, limited armament, and comparatively fragile construction that limited some of the variants to coastal waters.|$|E

5000|$|The Huckins <b>patrol</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> {{platform}} {{was designed}} to handle four torpedoes, two 50-caliber gun turrets and depth charges on the stern. The Huckins boats were generally well-regarded by the sailors who manned them. They had relatively high freeboard, with good headroom below the decks. A man could stand in the engine room, so engineers had plenty of space to work. Sleeping quarters on the Huckins PT vessels {{were considered to be}} comfortable by their captains and crews, who called them [...] "the yachts".|$|E

50|$|Wachapreague dropped anchor at Motor Torpedo Boat Base 21, at {{that time}} the largest <b>patrol</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boat</b> (PT boat) {{operating}} base in the Pacific. She reported to Commander, Motor Torpedo Boats, United States Seventh Fleet, and commenced tending the 10 PT boats of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron (MTBRon) 12. This unit had previously taken a heavy toll of Japanese barge traffic and had wreaked much havoc upon Japanese shore installations in almost nightly actions during the New Guinea campaign. As Allied forces wrapped up the New Guinea operations, Wachapreague received an additional five PT boats from Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 7 (MTBRon 7) as the Navy prepared for operations to liberate the Philippines from Japanese occupation.|$|E

President Makarios of Cyprus paid her a visit on 7 October 1963, after which she took part in bilateral U.S.-Italian exercises in the Adriatic with Italian <b>patrol</b> <b>torpedo</b> <b>boats,</b> and U.S.-French exercises, which pitted her aircraft against French interceptors and a surface action with the French cruiser Colbert (C611).
