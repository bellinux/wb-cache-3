5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the <b>pop</b> <b>star</b> on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E

5|$|American musicians such as Juan Atkins, using names {{including}} Model 500, Infinity {{and as part}} of Cybotron, {{developed a}} style of electronic dance music influenced by synth-pop and funk that led to the emergence of Detroit techno in the mid-1980s. The continued influence of 1980s synth-pop could be seen in various incarnations of 1990s dance music including trance. Hip hop artists such as Mobb Deep have sampled 1980s synth-pop songs. Popular artists such as Rihanna, UK stars Jay Sean and Taio Cruz, as well as British <b>pop</b> <b>star</b> Lily Allen on her second album, have also embraced the genre.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical <b>pop</b> <b>star</b> for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

5|$|Mottola {{had assumed}} the top {{position}} at Sony, the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through {{various stages of}} change. One he felt was {{very important for the}} label's success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival Whitney Houston from Arista Records, or a <b>pop</b> <b>star</b> to match Madonna, who was signed to Sire Records at the time. He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola's confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey's demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|The series {{revolves}} around Kirby, the series' protagonist, and his adventures in {{the fictional world}} of <b>Pop</b> <b>Star.</b> A common gameplay element is Kirby's ability to copy enemy skills, allowing him {{to use them to}} progress through levels. This and other changes in gameplay from traditional platform games distinguish the series from other entries in the genre. Currently, the series contains twenty games. A one-hundred episode anime series based on the video games, , was created in Japan and formerly distributed by 4Kids TV in North America. A special 101st episode was created for the now retired Nintendo Video service, and was not in the anime style of the original 100 episodes. The Kirby series is among the best-selling video game franchises with over twenty million games sold worldwide.

5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a <b>pop</b> <b>star.</b> Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
