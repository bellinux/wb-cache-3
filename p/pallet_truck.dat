That <b>pallet</b> <b>truck</b> won a design excellence award from the American Iron and Steel Institute in 1965. Good design became part of Crown’s corporate strategy. [...] Crown focused on niche markets, which didn’t affect competitors whose bread and butter were gas trucks and electric rider trucks. In 1970, Levitz, the furniture discounter, placed an order for 67 Crown stockpickers, which got momentum for sales going.

50|$|Variations of {{the basic}} Auto-Truck were soon produced. These {{included}} lifting platform bodies with a hydraulic pump and a long hand lever alongside the driver's saddle. They were used either for moving heavy loads around factories, to avoid lifting, or else as a <b>pallet</b> <b>truck</b> which could be moved under a wooden platform before lifting it off the floor to move it. Tipping hoppers were also made, although owing to {{the limitations of the}} small wheels, these were not intended for gardens or construction sites, as has often been claimed, but were mostly for collecting waste materials around factories. Another variation shortened the body and the truck was used for towing trailers.|$|E

40|$|Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC) are an {{attractive}} power source for {{applications in the}} low kW-range like pallet trucks or uninterruptable power supplies. A significant problem during the past years, however, was the limited durability of DMFC systems. While single cells could be operated for thousands of hours, DMFC systems degraded significantly often within less than 1, 000 hours. In an evolution of six generations of DMFC systems in the kW power range over the past decade, we identified {{the main reasons for}} degradation. Causes for fast degradation had to be removed first in order to identify what leads to slower degradation over several hundreds or thousands of hours. Interactions of cells and system components also had to be considered. As a result, the operating conditions of all cells must be carefully controlled by suitable operating algorithms and reproducible manufacturing technologies, in order to avoid high potentials on the anode, which would lead to ruthenium corrosion and subsequent poisoning of the cathode catalyst. All components of the stack and the peripheral system must be corrosion-proof and free from contaminants that might leach into the membranes. Finally, a DMFC system for a <b>pallet</b> <b>truck</b> was operated in a realistic load cycle for 20, 000 hours...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of a {{logistics}} company that has to serve its customers by first putting the products on pallets and then loading the <b>pallets</b> into <b>trucks.</b> Besides the standard geometric constraints of products not overlapping each other and not exceeding the dimensions of <b>pallets</b> and <b>trucks,</b> in this real problem, there are many other constraints, related to the total weight of the load, the maximum weight supported by each axle, and the distribution of the load inside the truck. Although the problem can be decomposed into two phases, <b>pallet</b> loading and <b>truck</b> loading, we have taken a combined approach, building and placing pallets at the same time. For each position in the <b>truck,</b> a <b>pallet</b> is built and tailored for that position according to the constraints of height and weight. We have developed a GRASP algorithm, in which the constructive algorithm is randomized and an improvement phase is added to obtain high-quality solutions. The algorithm has been tested on two sets of real instances with different characteristics, involving up to 44 trucks. The results show that solutions with an optimal or near optimal number of trucks are obtained in very short computing times...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{in mechanical}} engineering was performed during the spring 2015 in collaboration with Composite Consulting Group in Laholm. TheComposites Consulting Group works mainly with design and details of differentcomposite projects, their main area is FE-calculations, 3 D-modelling andmechanical tests with composite materials. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to simplify the calculation process of solidmechanics for sandwich panels by simulation with computer software. The goalwas to decrease {{the time for the}} design and calculation process of the constructionand the cost of the practical tests. Our task was to build a static three dimensionalmodel with the computer software Abaqus, where the result should correspondwith the practical pressure tests in laboratory. The project started with collection of material data from Composites ConsultingGroup and by learning the software Abaqus, simultaneously a specification wasdeveloped in corporation with the company. Later on, a static wheel pressuremodel in the software Abaqus was produced which simulated the behavior of thesandwich panel during static wheel-pressure by a <b>pallet</b> <b>truck.</b> The results from thewheel-pressure model were verified with the practical tests. The project led to a static three dimensional wheel- contact model with thesoftware Abaqus to calculate complex wheel-contact problems on sandwichpanels. The wheel-contact model corresponded to the practical test results. Thecontact model with Abaqus enabled faster and more efficient design anddevelopment process of new sandwich panels. It also provided better analysis ofthe sandwich panels’ behavior during wheel- contact loading...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{transpiration}} efficiency (TE) {{and its relationship}} with the stable carbon isotope ratio of wood was investigated in the saplings of three tropical tree species. Five individuals each of Platymiscium pinnatum (Jacq.) Dugand, Swietenia macrophylla King and Tectona grandis Linn. f. were grown individually in large (760 l) pots over 16 months in the Republic of Panama. Cumulative transpiration was determined by repeatedly weighing the pots with a <b>pallet</b> <b>truck</b> scale. Dry matter production was determined by destructive harvest. The TE, expressed as experiment-long dry matter production divided by cumulative water use, averaged 4. 1, 4. 3 and 2. 9 g dry matter kg− 1 water for P. pinnatum, S. macrophylla and T. grandis, respectively. The TE of T. grandis was significantly lower than that of the other two species. Instantaneous measurements of the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO 2 partial pressures (c(i) /c(a)), taken {{near the end of the}} experiment, explained 66 % of variation in TE. Stomatal conductance was lower in S. macrophylla than in T. grandis, whereas P. pinnatum had similar stomatal conductance to T. grandis, but with a higher photosynthetic rate. Thus, c(i) /c(a) and TE appeared to vary in response to both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity. Stem-wood δ 13 C varied over a relatively narrow range of just 2. 2 ‰, but still explained 28 % of variation in TE. The results suggest that leaf-level processes largely determined variation among the three tropical tree species in whole-plant water-use efficiency integrated over a full annual cycle...|$|E
40|$|BT is {{a global}} company within the lift truck industry. The main office is located in Mjölby. In Europe all sales and service {{activities}} are carried out by fully owned sales companies. I North America, BT RAYMOND develop and distribute trucks under a different brand. For {{the rest of the}} world BT works together with a distributor network, most of them are fully independent others BT has a small ownership in. BT is today own by TOYOTA material handling. This report is a study about BT’s possibilities to start an Electronic Commerce sales channel. At the beginning BT will most likely aim for a pilot project for Electronic Commerce for the Division Hand Trucks. The main reason is that the hand <b>pallet</b> <b>truck</b> is well suited for the web since it is rather standardized. This study can be an embryo for BT Europe to reach new customers who may discover BT’s products on-line. The goal for the future is to cover these customers in a better way and the Internet and Electronic Commerce could be one way of doing just that. We are not proposing a turnkey solution to BT. Instead this report aims to increase the knowledge within BT itself in this area. In addition we also try to highlight a number of important areas BT needs to address before an official launch of E-Commerce. Since a new on-line sales channel would impose major changes within BT we have also chosen to analyse important factors during a possible implementation phase. Together with our project company we have also decided to explore the CRM perspective with a new channel on the web. There seems to be possibilities for BT to improve their methods in this area and E-Commerce may be one tool to use. The authors focus on four important areas in this thesis. These are, Price, Sales and Marketing, Design of EC portal and Logistics. We also show several theoretical models like Key factors during a project process, Business Process Reeingineering and the Six-step model. The authors also discuss different forms of data collection methods. One key element of this report is the results of the questionnaire given to key people working for BT in Europe. There are also interviews from another company (SECTRA) about organisational change which can give the readers other perspectives in this area. At the end of this report (chapter 11) the readers could study our recommendations for BT in the event they will go through with implementing an E-Commerce channel. Those recommendations are summarized in both a long term and a short term perspectiv...|$|E

5000|$|Dock {{plates and}} dock boards are simply metal ramps, {{bridging}} {{the gaps between}} dock and truck. [...] Dock plates are generally made out of aluminium whilst dock boards are generally made out of steel.

Dock plates are simple flat plates, whereas dock boards have curbs, bolted or welded {{to the edge of the}} board. Run-off is prevented by a simple painted yellow strip along the edge of a dock plate, whereas it is the curbs (also generally painted yellow) that prevent run-off on dock boards; these curbs are also where the higher weight capacities of dock boards come from. Run-off is thus a significant risk on dock plates, since the yellow strip is not a particularly effective mechanism for preventing it.|$|R
