Based on this experience he wrote the book “Italy During the World War”, published in 1922.|$|E

5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal {{lifestyle}} {{and is a}} workaholic and introvert. Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers). Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian <b>politician</b> <b>to</b> interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín had {{lung cancer}} {{for almost a}} year before his death, which led to pneumonia. His medic Alejandro Sandler {{explained}} that his health had worsened at several points, which were followed by brief recoveries. In his last days he was visited by vice president Julio Cobos and monsignor Justo Laguna, who gave him the Anointing of the Sick. He received home care, as Sandler preferred him to stay with his family. The president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was out of the country and phoned several times; Ricardo Alfonsín called her at 17:00 and informed her of his father's health. He died on March 31, 2009, at 20:30; Sandler announced it at 21:03. Alfonsín was sleeping at the moment, next to his family. Cobos was the first <b>politician</b> <b>to</b> arrive at his home.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a few of}} Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge {{initially}} retained all of them, out of {{an ardent}} conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter Judson T. Welliver; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925. Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal <b>politician,</b> <b>to</b> work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President (a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff).|$|E
40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that democratic institutions shape politicians’ incentives {{to cater to}} certain constituencies, but which electoral system causes <b>politicians</b> <b>to</b> be most responsive to narrow interests is still debateable. Some argue that plurality electoral rules provide the greatest incentives for <b>politicians</b> <b>to</b> cater {{to the interests of}} a few; others say proportional systems prompt <b>politicians</b> <b>to</b> be relatively more prone to narrow interests. This study suggests that both positions can be correct under different conditions. Politicians competing in plurality systems privilege voters with a shared narrow interest when such voters are geographically concentrated, but when they are geographically diffuse, such voters have greater political influence in proportional electoral systems. Government spending on subsidies in fourteen developed countries provides empirical support for this argument...|$|R

Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action – including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims – must accompany words {{for them to have}} real meaning.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, all {{prisoners and}} parolees in Queensland have been {{prohibited}} by law (section 132 of Queensland's Corrective Services Act, {{introduced by the}} Beattie Labor Government) from speaking to reporters without permission. Thus, {{for the duration of}} his imprisonment and parole, Wotton could not lawfully speak to the media or attend public meetings without prior approval from his parole officer. Gracelyn Smallwood of the Indigenous Human Rights Committee believed it was designed to muzzle the truth. Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, has called it 'obnoxious'. Stewart Levitt, the director of the Black and White Justice Foundation remarked that it was unusual for a public spokesman and former <b>politician</b> <b>to</b> be prohibited from a public meeting. Welcoming Wotton back home, Alf Lacey, mayor of Palm Island, commented that the conditions were excessive.|$|E
