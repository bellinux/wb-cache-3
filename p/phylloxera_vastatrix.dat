50|$|Planchon {{is remembered}} {{for his work}} in saving French grape {{vineyards}} from <b>Phylloxera</b> <b>vastatrix,</b> a microscopic, yellow aphid-like pest that was an exotic species from the United States. He performed this task with assistance from French botanist Pierre-Marie-Alexis Millardet and American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley. The solution involved introduction of American grapevines {Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris} to France for grafting purposes.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, several {{outbreaks}} of vine diseases occurred among the Vitis vinifera vines {{of the classical}} European wine regions. These outbreaks were caused by pests to which these vines lacked resistance, carried on vines brought to Europe as botanical specimens of American origin. These pests included not only the Great French Wine Blight caused by the aphid <b>Phylloxera</b> <b>vastatrix,</b> but also mildew and other diseases caused by fungi.|$|E

50|$|He then {{played an}} important, but little known role in rescuing the French wine industry. In the 1870s French {{vineyards}} {{came under attack}} by a small insect, <b>Phylloxera</b> <b>vastatrix,</b> an aphid-like pest which sucks sap from the roots of grape vines. Growers observed that certain imported American vines resisted this pest, and the French government dispatched a scientist to St. Louis to consult with the Missouri state entomologist and with Engelmann, who had studied American grapes since the 1850s. Engelmann verified that certain living American species had resisted Phylloxera for nearly 40 years. In addition, Vitis riparia, a wild vine of the Mississippi Valley, did not cross pollinate with less resistant species, the cause of previous grafting failures. Engelmann arranged to have millions of shoots and seeds collected and sent to France, where the species proved to be very successful in providing rootstock.|$|E
5000|$|Research into {{identifying}} {{the cause of}} the disease began in 1868, when grape growers in Roquemaure, near Pujaut, asked the agricultural society in Montpellier for help. [...] To investigate the disease, the society appointed a committee consisting of botanist Jules Émile Planchon, local grower Felix Sahut, and the society's president, Gaston Bazille, among others. Sahut soon noticed that the roots of dying vines were infested with [...] "lice", which were sucking sap from the plants. The committee named the new insect Rhizaphis vastatrix. [...] Planchon consulted French entomologists Victor Antoine Signoret and Jules Lichtenstein (Planchon's brother-in-law). Signoret suggested renaming the insect <b>Phylloxera</b> <b>vastatrix,</b> due to its similarity to Phylloxera quercus, which afflicted oak leaves. [...] In 1869, English entomologist John Obadiah Westwood suggested that an insect that had afflicted grape leaves in England circa 1863 was the same insect afflicting grape vines' roots in France. [...] Also in 1869, Lichtenstein suggested that the French insect was an American [...] "vine louse" [...] that had been identified in 1855 by the American entomologist Asa Fitch, which he'd named Pemphigus vitifoliae. [...] However, there was a problem with these suggestions: French grape lice were known to infest only a vine's roots, whereas American grape lice were known to infest only its leaves. [...] The British-born American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley had been following news of the outbreak in France. He sent Signoret specimens of American grape lice, which Signoret concluded — in 1870, while besieged in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War — were indeed identical to French grape lice. [...] Meanwhile, Planchon and Lichtenstein had found vines with afflicted leaves; lice that were transferred from those leaves to the roots of healthy vines attached themselves to the vines' roots as other French grape lice did. [...] Also in 1870, Riley discovered that American grape lice wintered on American grape vines' roots, which the insects damaged, albeit less than in the case of French vines. Using American grape vines and American grape lice, Riley also repeated Planchon and Lichtenstein's experiment, with similar results. [...] Thus the identity of the French and American grape lice was proved. Nevertheless, for another three years, a powerful majority in France argued that Phylloxera was not the cause of vine disease; instead, vines that were already sickly became infested with Phylloxera. Thus, in their opinion, Phylloxera was merely a consequence of the [...] "true" [...] disease, which remained to be found. [...] Regardless, Riley had discovered American grape varieties that were especially resistant to Phylloxera, and by 1871, French farmers began to import them and graft French vines onto the American rootstock. [...] (Leo Laliman had suggested importing American vines as early as 1869, but French farmers were reluctant to abandon their traditional varieties. Gaston Bazille then proposed grafting traditional French vines onto American rootstock.) However, importation of American vines did not entirely solve the problem: some American grape varieties struggled in France's chalky soils and succumbed to Phylloxera. [...] By trial and error, American vines were found that could tolerate chalky soils. [...] Meanwhile, entomologists worked to unravel the strange life cycle of Phylloxera, a project that was completed in 1874.|$|E
