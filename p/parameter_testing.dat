40|$|This {{investigation}} aims {{to examine}} and demonstrate {{the problems associated with}} unbalanced voltages and voltage harmonics during the operation of a three-phase induction motor. The application of an induction motor under balanced voltages is used as a comparison tool to explore in more detail the effects of the motors process under unbalanced voltages and voltage harmonics. In implementing this project, MATLAB was used as the simulation software. Through MATLAB, three separate programs were created that calculate and plot the torque-speed characteristics, line currents and the input and output power, which allowed for direct comparisons of each condition. However, to obtain such results, analysis of the motor operations must be considered for balanced and unbalanced voltages, and voltage harmonics, that involves <b>parameter</b> <b>testing.</b> This project was completed to a satisfactory level, however due to the <b>parameter</b> <b>testing</b> resulting in incorrect values, this affected the direct comparison of the final simulation programs of the motor under each case.

It also allows for greater expansion into the realm of unbalanced voltage harmonics, which are ever present in real life three-phase induction motors...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Discrete choice {{experiments}} with duration (DCETTO) {{can be used}} to estimate utility values for preference-based measures, such as the EQ- 5 D- 5 L. For self-completion, the health dimensions are presented in a standard order. However, for valuation, this may result in order effects. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} whether health state dimension ordering affects values. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of dimension ordering on DCE values using EQ- 5 D- 5 L. METHODS: A choice experiment presenting two health profiles and a third immediate death option was developed. A three-arm study was used, with the same 120 choice sets presented online across each arm (n =  360 per arm). Arm 1 presented the standard EQ- 5 D- 5 L dimension order, arm 2 randomised order between respondents, and arm 3 randomised within respondents. Conditional logit regression was used to assess model consistency, and scale <b>parameter</b> <b>testing</b> was used to assess model poolability. RESULTS: There were minor inconsistencies across each arm, but the magnitudes of the coefficients produced were generally consistent. Arm 3 produced the largest range of utility values (1 to - 0. 980). Scale <b>parameter</b> <b>testing</b> suggested that the models did not differ, and the data could be pooled. Follow-up questions did not suggest variation in terms of difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the level of randomisation used in DCE health state valuation studies does not significantly impact values, and dimension order may not be as important as other study design issues. The results support past valuation studies that use the standard order of dimensions...|$|E

Three different eco-friendly extraction methods are tested: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), pressurized fluid extraction (PFE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). Various specific parameters are optimized for each of them. Global extraction yields are calculated for all extracts. Moreover, the extracts are analyzed by HPLC–DAD–ELSD, and the obtained profiles are compared to estimate qualitatively and semi-quantitatively their composition.
