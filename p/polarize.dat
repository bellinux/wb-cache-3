The film was a financial success, earning more than $263 million at the box office on a $90 million budget.

5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} <b>polarize</b> a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E

5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both <b>polarize</b> the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E
5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically <b>polarize,</b> with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to <b>polarize</b> the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for calculating the diffraction efficiency kinetics of the grating recorded by two parallel circular <b>polarized</b> recording beams was proposed, based on Jones-matrix and photochromic two-state theory. The diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating {{was measured by}} system of four-wave coupled light path. The theoreical analysis and the experimental results show that, in the condition of adding linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet light, when linearly <b>polarized</b> reconstruction light parallel with linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet light, the diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is maximum; when linearly <b>polarized</b> reconstruction light perpendicular to linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet light, the diffraction efficiency of bacteriorhodopsin grating is minimum. The angle between linearly <b>polarized</b> reconstruction light and linearly <b>polarized</b> auxiliary violet light produces a cosine modulation on the kinetics of the diffraction efficiency.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out a NLO {{analysis}} of the world data on <b>polarized</b> DIS in the MS scheme. We have studied two models of the parametrizations of the input parton densities, the first due to Brodsky, Burkhardt and Schmidt (BBS) which gives a simultaneous parametrization for both the <b>polarized</b> and unpolarized densities and in which the counting rules are strictly imposed, the second in which the input <b>polarized</b> densities are written {{in terms of the}} unpolarized ones in the generic form ∆q(x) = f(x) q(x) with f(x) some simple smooth function. In both cases a good fit to the <b>polarized</b> data is achieved. As expected the <b>polarized</b> data do not allow a precise determination of the <b>polarized</b> gluon density. Concerning the <b>polarized</b> sea-quark densities, these are fairly well determined in the BBS model because of the interplay of <b>polarized</b> and unpolarized data, whereas in the second model, where only the <b>polarized</b> data are relevant, the <b>polarized</b> sea-quark densities are largely undetermined. 1 1.

50|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, the {{analyzing}} filters are constructed of a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and a linearly <b>polarized</b> filter (LPF).
