40|$|The {{constant}} {{demand for}} increased power and reduced mass {{has raised the}} internal temperature of conventionally cooled <b>power</b> <b>magnetics</b> toward the upper limit of acceptability. The conflicting demands of electrical isolation, mechanical integrity, and thermal conductivity preclude significant further advancements using conventional approaches. However, the size and mass of multikilowatt power processing systems may be further reduced by the incorporation of heat pipe cooling directly into the <b>power</b> <b>magnetics.</b> Additionally, by maintaining lower more constant temperatures, the life and reliability of the magnetic devices will be improved. A heat pipe cooled transformer and input filter {{have been developed for}} the 2. 4 kW beam supply of a 30 -cm ion thruster system. This development yielded a mass reduction of 40 % (1. 76 kg) and lower mean winding temperature (20 C lower). While these improvements are significant, preliminary designs predict even greater benefits to be realized at higher power.

The resultant design must also yield low weight, high efficiency, high reliability and maintainability, and long life. The weight savings and high efficiency that results by going to high frequency and unique thermal control techniques is demonstrated by the development of a 25 kVA, 20 kHz space type transformer under the <b>power</b> <b>magnetics</b> technology program.

40|$|Non-isolated step-up voltage {{converters}} are commonly required as Battery Discharge Regulators (BDR’s). The Weinberg and boost derived topologies are traditionally employed in modules {{up to one}} or two kilowatts. The Interleaved Boost Converter (IBC) is a distributed power processing approach that provides some advantages: reduced power processing (current) per phase, distributed losses (<b>power</b> semiconductors and <b>magnetics),</b> input and output current ripple cancellation, improved dynamic response and better modularity, among others. The IBC converter as BDR has been previously treated and advantages and drawbacks discussed. In this paper a new approach is proposed, a multi-switch, multi-phase interleaved boost converter (named Multi Interleaved Boost Converter, MIBC) that provides inductor and switching frequency decoupling, which in turn affects in different aspects, such as, magnetics, input and output current ripples or part count.

40|$|Abstract—The {{losses in}} European Union {{distribution}} trans-formers are estimated at about 33 TW · h/year, whereas reactive power and harmonic losses add a further 5 TW · h/year. The re-duction of distribution transformer no-load loss is particularly im-portant as {{the ratio of}} no-load to load losses is nearly three. In this paper, the no-load operation of wound-core transformers under sinusoidal and distorted supply-voltage conditions is investigated. For that purpose, a 2 -D nonlinear transient finite-element analysis taking into account hysteresis has been developed. The hysteresis model {{is based on a}} modified Jiles–Atherton representation, and the proposed analysis is compared to experimental data.

5000|$|Inventor Lawrence F. Glaser has {{developed}} and patented technology which appears {{at first to}} be a high definition display. However, unlike displays with 2 dimensional pixel arrays, this technology incorporates pixel stacks, accomplishing a series of goals leading to the capture of a multi-biometric. It {{is believed to be}} the first man-made device which can capture 2 or more distinct biometrics from the same region of pixel stacks (forming a surface) at the same instant, allowing for the data to form a third biometric, which is a more complex pattern inclusive as to how the data aligns. An example would be to capture the finger print and the capillary pattern at precisely the same moment. Other opportunities exist with this technology, such as to capture kirlean data which assures the finger was alive during an event, or capture of bone details forming another biometric used with the others previously mentioned. The concept of stacking pixels to achieve increased functionality from less surface area is combined with the ability to emit any color from a single pixel, eliminating the need for RGB (RED GREEN BLUE) surface emissions. Lastly, the technology was tested with high <b>power</b> cadmium <b>magnetics</b> to check for distortion or other anomalies, as the inventor wanted to also embed magnetic emission and magnetic collection with this same surface technology, but without exhibiting any magnetic stripes on the surface. Devices, such as smart cards, can pass magnetic data from any orientation by automatically sensing what the user has done, and using data about where the card is when [...] "swiped" [...] or inserted into a reader. This technology can detect touch or read gestures at distance, without a user side camera and with no active electronics on its surface. Reference material and drawings are available at the US Patent Office, US Patent #s 9065893, 9122966 and published specification 20150356285. The use of Multibiometrics hardens automated identity acquisition by a factor of 800,000,000 and will prove to be very difficult to hack or emulate.|$|R

This power supply is specifically designed for a 5. 0 V, 2. 0 A output and a maximum duty cycle of 48 %. It meets IEC and UL requirements. EMI is minimal and a 70 % achievable efficiency or greater is possible. The NCP 1055 is a family of monolithic high voltage switching regulators designed to work in rectified AC line sources and flyback converter applications. They are capable of providing an output power ranging from 6. 0 W to 40 W with a fixed AC input of 100 V, 115 V, or 230 V and 3. 0 W to 20 W with a variable AC input ranging from 85 V to 265 V.
