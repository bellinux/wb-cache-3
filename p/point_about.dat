5|$|In {{the second}} part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest {{of the weekend}} up to that <b>point,</b> <b>about</b> half a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning {{that he would be}} able to start the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E

5|$|Just {{after its}} {{intersection}} with the PIP, the road intersects two former Rockland County Routes (CR106A & CR69). Also, {{at this point}} CR106 enters the village limits of Stony Point, and becomes a , highway with extra lanes in some places. The highway intersects CR108, CR47, and CR33 as Central Drive. CR106 {{comes to an end}} shortly after these intersections at US9W and US202 in downtown Stony <b>Point,</b> <b>about</b> a mile west from the Hudson River and the Stony Point Marina.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on 2 August, Atkinson's forces awoke {{and began}} to break camp, setting out before sunrise. They had moved {{only a few miles}} when they ran into the rear scout element of the {{remaining}} Sauk and Fox forces. The Sauk scouts attempted to lead the enemy away from the main camp and were initially successful. The combined U.S. forces fell into formation for battle: Generals Alexander and Posey formed the right wing, Henry the left wing, and Dodge and the regulars the center element. As the Native Americans retreated toward the river, the militia's left wing were left in the rear without orders. When a regiment stumbled across the main trail to the camp, the scouts could only fight in retreat and hope that they had given their comrades a chance to escape the militia, while the Sauk and Fox kept retreating to the river. However, Warrior returned after obtaining more wood in Prairie du Chien, leaving the refueling <b>point</b> <b>about</b> midnight and arriving at Bad Axe about 10 a.m. The slaughter that followed continued for the next eight hours.|$|E
5|$|Before {{he worked}} for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in 1943, Bazna was hired to do some {{household}} and vehicle repairs for Douglas Busk, the first secretary of the British Embassy. Due to Bazna's poor English, he answered all interview questions in French. Although he supplied some written biographical information, excluding having been employed and fired by Albert Jenke, none of the biographical information was checked. Turkish secret service apparently warned the embassy at some <b>point</b> <b>about</b> Bazna. Over the few months that Bazna worked for Busk, he secretly photographed a few documents and, {{with the help of}} Mrs. Busk's nursemaid named Mara, he tried to gain access to more valuable forms of intelligence.|$|E

5|$|In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{passed by}} the riverbanks where the city of Omaha would be built. Between July 30 and August 3, 1804, members of the expedition, {{including}} Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, met with Oto and Missouria tribal leaders at the Council Bluff at a <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 20miles (30km) north of present-day Omaha. Immediately south of that area, Americans built several fur trading outposts in succeeding years, including Fort Lisa in 1812; Fort Atkinson in 1819; Cabanné's Trading Post, built in 1822, and Fontenelle's Post in 1823, in what became Bellevue. There was fierce competition among fur traders until John Jacob Astor created the monopoly of the American Fur Company. The Mormons built a town called Cutler's Park {{in the area in}} 1846. While it was temporary, the settlement provided the basis for further development in the future.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} literature over the naming of Russula brevipes. Some early 20th-century American mycologists {{referred to it as}} Russula delica, although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Fries with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. Fries's concept of R.delica included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named Russula delica. Robert Shaffer summarized the taxonomic conundrum in 1964: Russula delica is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, but the evidence indicates that R.delica sensu Fries (1838) is not R.delica sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not R.delica sensu Kühner and Romagnesi (1953)…It is best to use R.brevipes for the North American collections which most authors but not Kühner and Romagnesi (1953), call R.delica. The name, R.brevipes, is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable <b>point</b> <b>about</b> which a species concept can be formed.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish party {{retreated from}} the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were {{surrounded}} by about 2,000 Itza warriors who attempted to disarm them; the Itzas managed to seize another Spaniard and immediately struck off his head. At this <b>point</b> <b>about</b> 10,000 Itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate. A Christian Maya musketeer and six other Indians fled {{at the start of}} the battle and took news to García that the entire expedition had been slaughtered; Zubiaur and the survivors of his expedition marched back into the base camp at Chuntuki two days later. Ursúa later reported that the Spanish prisoners were taken back to Nojpetén where they were all killed; this was also confirmed by AjChan at a later date. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the final assault on Nojpetén in 1697; AjK'in Kan Ek', the Itza high priest, later reported that he had bound San Buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes and cut out their hearts.|$|E

25|$|As {{capital of}} British Punjab, the area {{south of the}} Walled City {{contains}} many British colonial municipal structures built in the Indo-Saracenic style, such as the General Post Office, and Lahore Museum.
