5|$|In September 2008, Valve {{added support}} for Steam Cloud, {{a service that}} can {{automatically}} store saved game and related custom files on Valve's servers; users can access this data from any machine running the Steam client. Games must use the appropriate features of Steamworks for Steam Cloud to work. Users can disable this feature on a per-game and per-account basis. In May 2012, the service added the ability for users to manage their game libraries from remote clients, including computers and mobile devices; users can instruct Steam to download and install games they own through this service if their Steam client is currently active and running. Some games sold through retail channels can be redeemed as titles for users' libraries within Steam by entering a <b>product</b> <b>code</b> within the software. For games that incorporate Steamworks, users can buy redemption codes from other vendors and redeem these in the Steam client to add the title to their libraries. Steam also offers a framework for selling and distributing downloadable content (DLC) for games.|$|E

40|$|A {{class of}} codes, {{half-product}} <b>codes,</b> derived from <b>product</b> <b>codes,</b> is characterized. These codes have the implementation advantages of <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> and possess a special structural property which {{leads them to}} have larger (at least 3 / 2 times more) minimum distance than <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> With the same length and rate, they have better scaling in the error floor than <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> They also have a larger minimum stopping-set size under iterative decoding which provides better scaling. The main results of this thesis are summarized as follows: 1. Encoding and decoding methods of half-product codes are described. 2. The minimum distance of these codes is derived, and proved {{to be at least}} 3 2 times larger than that of the <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> for the same rate and block length. 3. The performance of iterative decoding in the error floor region is analyzed by enumerating the minimum stopping-set patterns for these codes. The results are compared with <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> Simulations are also performed to compare the half-product <b>codes</b> with <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> We conclude that half-product codes scale better in the error floor than <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> in the region where the minimum stopping-sets dominate the error floor, and that they have same threshold as <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> when rate is same and code length is increased to infinity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{coding theory}} is to design codes which can achieve the {{fundamental}} limits of communication [52] and yet are simple to implement. On average randomly constructed codes can achieve this goal, {{but with a}} decoding complexity that is impractical. Consequently, highly structured codes with practical decoding algorithms have been extensively studied. Unfortunately {{the vast majority of}} these codes do not approach capacity. Recent advances involving simple 'random like' codes with practical iterative decoding algorithms have closely approached capacity as the blocklength increases. This thesis investigates single parity check (SPC) <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> and introduces the class of randomly interleaved (RI) SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> It will be shown that RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> can asymptotically force the probability of error to zero, at code rates up to capacity, for almost all codewords. Furthermore the structure of these codes allows a very simple, sub-optimal, iterative decoding algorithm to be used. This thesis also derives an asymptotic analysis on SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> from the decoding point of view. It is shown that the probability of error can be driven to zero, as the blocklength increases, for signal to noise ratios within 2 dB of capacity on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Simulation results for both SPC and RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> in an AWGN channel are presented. These results indicate that RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> perform very well, typically within 1. 5 dB of capacity over a wide range of blocklengths and code rates. Further analysis on the weight enumerator of finite length RI SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> is used to confirm the error floor of these codes. Extensions to parallel and serially concatenated SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> are also investigated. Simulation results show an advantageous trade-off between code rate, blocklength and performance for three dimensional parallel concatenated SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes.</b> The design of irregular SPC <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> is also considered, and some simulation results are presented...|$|R

25|$|A primary RFID {{security}} {{concern is}} the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security.

More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic <b>product</b> <b>code</b> (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to skimming and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.|$|E

In this paper, we investigate {{the use of}} Reed-Solomon (RS) turbo <b>product</b> <b>codes</b> for 40 [*]Gbps transmission over optical transport networks and 10 [*]Gbps transmission over passive optical networks. An algorithmic study is first performed in order to design RS TPCs that are compatible with the performance requirements imposed by the two applications.
