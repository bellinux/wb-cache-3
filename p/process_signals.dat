5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and <b>process</b> <b>signals</b> from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to <b>process</b> <b>signals,</b> and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to explore {{possibilities}} of implementing low-cost instruments such as spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes by applying Digital Alias-free Signal Processing (DASP) techniques. For most of signal processing tasks where traditional DSP is applied the information of bandwidth of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is required to be known. Here the sampling rate is decided {{to be at least}} twice the actual bandwidth of the signal. However, there are cases where the exact bandwidth information of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is unknown or the reconstructibility of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is not needed. Then this demand on sampling rates leads to oversampling of the analysed signal. Review of literature shows that application of DASP is an ideal solution on this issue. In comparison with traditional DSP, DASP does not require the exact bandwidth information of the signal and can still <b>process</b> the analysed <b>signals</b> for different signal processing tasks at lower sampling rates such as sub-Nyquist, even sub-Landau rates. Therefore the work reported in this thesis concentrates on the investigation of DASP techniques for reducing the costs of contemporary instruments.

30|$|The wavelet {{transform}} (WT) [15, 16] {{is an effective}} technique {{that can be used}} to analyze both time and frequency contents of the signal. However, WT uses some fixed basis mother wavelets, independent of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal,</b> which makes it non-adaptive. Another successful method for feature extraction, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [17], represents the non-linear and non-stationary signal in terms of modes that correspond to the underlying signal. EMD is a data-driven approach that does not use a fixed set of basis functions, but is self-adaptive according to the <b>processed</b> <b>signal.</b> It decomposes a signal into finite, well-defined, low-frequency and high-frequency components known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) or modes.|$|R
