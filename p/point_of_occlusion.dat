40|$|AbstractThe {{visual system}} is {{constantly}} {{faced with the}} problem of identifying partially occluded objects from incomplete images cast on the retinae. Phenomenologically, the visual system seems to fill in missing information by interpolating illusory and occluded contours at <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion,</b> so that we perceive complete objects. Previous behavioural [1 – 7] and physiological [8 – 12] studies suggest that the visual system treats illusory and occluded contours like luminance-defined contours in many respects. None of these studies has, however, directly shown that illusory and occluded contours are actually used to perform perceptual tasks. Here, we use a response-classification technique [13 – 20] to answer this question directly. This technique provides pictorial representations — ‘classification images’ — that show which parts of a stimulus observers use to make perceptual decisions, effectively deriving behavioural receptive fields. Here we show that illusory and occluded contours appear in observers’ classification images, providing the first direct evidence that observers use perceptually interpolated contours to recognize objects. These results offer a compelling demonstration of how visual processing acts on completed representations, and illustrate a powerful new technique for constraining models of visual completion...|$|R
5000|$|Tunnelled {{catheter}} access {{involves a}} longer catheter, which is tunnelled {{under the skin}} {{from the point of}} insertion in the vein to an exit site some distance away. It is usually placed in the internal jugular vein in the neck and the exit site is usually on the chest wall. The tunnel acts as a barrier to invading microbes, and as such, tunnelled catheters are designed for short- to medium-term access (weeks to months only), because infection is still a frequent problem. Aside from infection, venous stenosis is another serious problem with catheter access. The catheter is a foreign body in the vein and often provokes an inflammatory reaction in the vein wall. This results in scarring and narrowing of the vein, often to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion.</b> This can cause problems with severe venous congestion in the area drained by the vein and may also render the vein, and the veins drained by it, useless for creating a fistula or graft at a later date. Patients on long-term hemodialysis can literally 'run out' of access, so this can be a fatal problem. [...] Catheter access is usually used for rapid access for immediate dialysis, for tunnelled access in patients who are deemed likely to recover from acute renal failure, and for patients with end-stage renal failure who are either waiting for alternative access to mature or who are unable to have alternative access. [...] Catheter access is often popular with patients, because attachment to the dialysis machine doesn't require needles. However, the serious risks of catheter access noted above mean that such access should be contemplated only as a long-term solution in the most desperate access situation.|$|E

Analyses of these measurements revealed that: (i) extrapolation curvature increases linearly with the curvature of the inducing contour, although there is individual bias in the slope; (ii) the precision with which an extrapolated contour is represented is roughly constant, in angular terms, with increasing distance {{from the point of}} occlusion; (iii) there is a substantial cost of curvature, in that the overall precision of an extrapolated contour decreases systematically with curvature; (iv) {{the shapes of}} visually extrapolated contours are characterized by a nonlinear decrease in curvature, asymptoting to zero; and (v) this decaying pattern of curvature is explained by a Bayesian model in which, with increasing distance from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion,</b> the prior tendency to minimize curvature gradually dominates the likelihood tendency to minimize variation in curvature...|$|E

40|$|In {{theoretical}} {{analyses of}} visual form perception, {{it is often}} assumed that the 3 -dimensional structures of smoothly curved surfaces are perceptually represented as point-by-point mappings of metric depth and/or orientation relative to the observer. This article describes an alternative theory {{in which it is}} argued that our visual knowledge of smoothly curved surfaces can also be denned in terms of local, nonmetric order relations. A fundamental prediction of this analysis is that relative depth judgments between any two surface regions should be dramatically influenced by the monotonicity of depth change (or lack of it) along the intervening portions of the surface through which they are separated. This prediction is confirmed in a series of experiments using surfaces depicted with either shading or texture. Additional experiments are reported, moreover, that demonstrate that smooth occlusion contours are a primary source of information about the ordinal structure of a surface and that the depth extrema in between contours can be optically specified by differences in luminance at the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion.</b> For many higher organisms, including humans, a primary source of knowledge about objects and events in the surrounding environment is provided by vision.

Our method is based on the observation that matching static points must satisfy the epipolar geometry constraints, but computing exact matches is challenging.

Arcs of Euler spirals with positive or negative {{rate of change}} of curvature γ (hence linearly increasing or decreasing curvature) disappeared behind the straight-edge of a half-disk occluder. Observers adjusted the position and the orientation of a line probe around the curved portion of the occluder to optimize the percept of extrapolation. These paired measurements were obtained at multiple distances from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> in order to map out the extended shape of visually extrapolated contours. An Euler-spiral model was fit to the extrapolation data corresponding to each inducing contour. Maximum-likelihood estimates of extrapolation rate of change of curvature γˆ were consistently found to be negative, indicating that visually extrapolated contours are characterized by decaying curvature, irrespective of whether inducer curvature is increasing or decreasing as it approaches the occluder. Moreover, extrapolation γˆ was found to exhibit no systematic dependence on inducer γ. The {{results indicate that the}} visual system does not extrapolate rate of change of contour curvature. They support a Bayesian model of contour extrapolation, in which the decay in extrapolation curvature derives from an interaction between a likelihood bias to continue estimated contour curvature, and a prior bias to minimize contour curvature.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Measures {{capable of}} {{detecting}} early alterations of brain function during acute cerebral ischaemia {{have not been}} adequately defined. Internal carotid artery (ICA) test occlusions provide a well controlled environment to investigate the effects of reversible acute hemispheric hypoperfusion on brain function. A continuous time estimation task was developed that reliably demonstrated alterations in higher cerebral function before development of any deficits in elementary neurological function during ICA balloon catheter test occlusions. In the present study, we hypothesised that alterations in our behavioural task would correlate significantly with absolute level of ipsilateral CBF.  METHODS—Twenty five patients underwent awake ICA test occlusions during which sustained attention and ipsilateral CBF were measured simultaneously using our time estimation task and the intracarotid 133 Xe washout method. Alteration in sustained attention was correlated with CBF after occlusion using Fisher's exact test.  RESULTS—Deterioration in sustained attention {{was significantly associated with}} ipsilateral CBF below 30 ml/g/min (Fisher's exact test, p= 0. 047). Changes in individual patients' performance on the behavioural task correlated in real time with changes occurring either at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> or at a specific threshold of induced hypotension. Sensitivity for our behavioural test in predicting CBF was 75 %; specificity 70 %.  CONCLUSIONS—Monitoring sustained attention during carotid balloon test occlusions seems to be a sensitive means to detect decreases in CBF as measured by 133 Xe washout. Correlation between higher cerebral function and CBF can allow more detailed investigations of physiological relations between cerebral haemodynamics and brain function in human conditions of cerebral ischaemia. ...|$|E
40|$|T HROMBOTIC {{occlusion}} of the subela-vian artery in its intrathoracie portioln {{is common}} in atherosclerosis, but gangrene of the ipsilateral extremity is rare owing to the extensive collateral network connecting with {{the branches of the}} subelavian artery. The vertebral artery, which is the subelavian 's first and largest branch, is perhaps the most important channel directing collateral blood to the subelavian artery beyond the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion.</b> Such retrograde flow through the vertebral artery would siphon blood away from the basilar system and even from the cir-cle of Willis, hence the descriptive term "sub-elavian steal. " 1 Altogether, reports of 14 cases have appeared in the literature during the past 2 years. 2 - 5 In addition, a recent case published under the unrelated title "gusta-tory sweating" 6 was discovered in which oc-elusion of the left subelavian artery led to the flow of blood from the right to the left vertebral artery and from there to the left subelavian distal to the occlusion, as illus-trated clearly by the published angiogram. The syndrome represents a unique physio-logic phenomenon in which loss of blood sup-ply to one region brings about diversion of blood from a distant, unrelated region and causes symptoms not readily explicable {{in the light of the}} outward manifestations of ische-mia. All the cases reported heretofore have been in adults with demonstrable atherosclerotic disease of the major cerebral arteries and symptoms of cerebral ischemia resulting from diversion of blood from the basilar system or from the circle of Willis.

40|$|International audienceFirn air and ice {{have been}} sampled and {{analyzed}} for trace gases (CO 2, N 2 O, CH 4, and CO) and isotopes (14 C, 13 C, and 18 O of CO 2; 3 H of ice) at 3 m intervals {{from the surface}} to the depth of closure at 60 m on the Devon Island Ice Cap, a low-elevation permanent glacier in the Canadian Arctic Islands, to investigate firn diffusion {{and the effects of}} summer melting. The 14 CO 2 profile from the permeable firn includes the 1963 thermonuclear peak at a depth of 53. 9 ± 1. 5 m. The twofold increase and rapid decay that characterize the recent atmospheric history for 14 CO 2 provide a robust atmospheric scenario that is used with a firn air diffusion model to inversely construct the firn diffusivity profile. The results show a permeable but essentially nondiffusive zone from 50 to 60 m depth. A firn-ice age profile was produced from density measurements, and accumulation rates were calibrated with the depth of the 1963 thermonuclear 3 H peak. The average ages for CO 2 in the sampled firn air profile were determined by a new method based on the rate of 18 O exchange between CO 2 and the ice matrix. Calibrated with the 1963 peak for thermonuclear 14 CO 2, a 21. 2 -year reaction halftime is calculated for exchange taking place at the firn temperature of − 22. 8 °C on Devon. This gives an average age of 54. 9 (+ 6. 0 /− 12. 0) years for firn air at 60 m depth in 140 -year-old ice. Thus CO 2 has a mean age 85 years younger than associated ice at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>occlusion.</b> The measured δ 18 OCO 2 in firn air provides no indication of alteration by summer melting, which is attributed to a high degree of convective and diffusive flushing of the upper firn as shown by diffusion modeling.

First of all, appropriate angiographic evaluation is essential to provide clear imaging of the coronary arteries and their branches. Observe in detail the pattern, the length and {{the direction of the}} CTO, the condition of the side branches, the pattern of vessels distal to the occluded segment, and the extent of calcification. Evaluate each of the collateral pathways very carefully, and identify the course from the origin to the termination in the distal part of the occluded vessel. Secondly, selecting adequate devices for treatment is very important. The antegrade approach, using conventional guidewire and microcatheters is always the first choice. Progressively more rigid guidewires may be required, as well as special devices and techniques. The retrograde approach is indicated when the antegrade approach fails, in cases where the entry <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>occlusion</b> is not identified or in patients with extremely calcified lesions. The optimal collateral access for this technique is a wide and straight septal branch, but such ideal vessel is rarely found.

This study {{sought to}} {{elucidate}} the short-term efficacy and intermediate-term outcome of excimer laser recanalization of chronic coronary artery occlusions in patients in whom attempts at mechanical revascularization had failed. Background. Recanalization <b>of</b> chronic coronary <b>occlusions</b> {{with the use of}} a mechanical guide wire fails in 30 % to 50 % of cases, mostly because of inability to pass the wire through the lesion. The value of using excimer laser energy in this setting has not yet been determined. Methods. The study group comprised 66 consecutive patients with 68 chronic coronary occlusions. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if a previous attempt at mechanical revascularization had failed and if their angiographic status was such that 1) the vessel segment distal to the occlusion could be visualized by way of collateral vessels, 2) the entry <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>occlusion</b> was clearly outlined, and 3) not more than one anatomic bend was expected within the occlusion. Excimer laser energy was applied to the lesion through a 0. 018 -in. (0. 046 cm) fiber-optic guide wire. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty and stenting were performed in all successfully treated patients but one. Results. Thirty-four occlusions (50 %) in 32 patients (48 %) could be crossed with the laser wire. Location and age <b>of</b> the <b>occlusion</b> had no adverse influence on the outcome of laser wire recanalization, nor did the presence of bridging collateral vessels, a major side branch at the site of the lesion or a blunt stump <b>of</b> the <b>occlusion.</b> An inverse relation was found between the success rate and the length <b>of</b> the <b>occlusion,</b> such that a 19 % reduction of the success rate accompanied each 10 -mm increment <b>of</b> the mean <b>occlusion</b> length. Thus, the success rate was 68 % for lesions ≤ 10 mm but only 25 % for lesions > 30 to ≤ 40 mm. The presence of a bend in the lesion exceeding 60 ° was strongly related to procedural failure. During a median angiographic follow-up period of 18 weeks, restenosis > 50 % (n = 6) or reocclusion (n = 4) was found in 10 of the 32 successfully treated patients, for an intermediate-term success rate of 33 % (22 of 66). Clinical follow-up revealed improved anginal status in 21 patients (66 %) after a median of 24 weeks. Major complications (death, myocardial infarction, emergency operation) were not encountered. Conclusions. Successful recanalization of a chronic coronary occlusion by using currently available laser wires can be expected in 50 % of selected patients in whom attempts at mechanical revascularization fail.

This article is aimed at presenting attitudes and studies on application of cephalometric analysis in obtaining optimal vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion.</b> The review <b>of</b> literature presents the studies which analyse the possibilities of cephalometric analysis aimed at improving the clinical methods for vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> determination in treatment of edentulous patients. The research carried out so far can roughly be divided into: cephalometric vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> evaluation in dentulous patients performed to determine precise indicators of vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> and to establish cephalometric standards for practical application in prosthodontics; the method of producing pre-extraction cephalometric registries involves the production of cephalometric radiographs for potential prosthodontic patients in dental pre-extraction period which are kept for reference {{to be used in}} later therapy; the cephalometric method of registering the position of physiologic rest position of the mandible involves measuring cephalometric parameters in cephalometric radiographs made when the mandible is in physiologic rest position; cephalometric evaluation of vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> in complete denture therapy after clinical determination of intemaxillary relationship is recommended for timely detection of possible mistakes, with a possibility of correction in the process of complete denture production; and cephalometric analysis in edentulous patients with old complete dentures for a planned vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> extension.

40|$|A {{significant}} cue {{for visual}} perception is the occlusion pattern in 2 -D images projected onto biological or digital retinas, which allows humans or robots to successfully sense and navigate the 3 -D environments. There {{have been many}} works on modeling and studying the role <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> in image analysis and visual perception, mostly from analytical or statistical <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view. The current paper presents a new theory <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> based on simple topological definitions of preimages and a binary operation on them called "occlu. " We study many topological as well as algebraic structures of the resultant preimage monoids (a monoid is a semigroup with identity).

40|$|One of the {{existing}} methods for analysis of the vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> or occlusal face height is the cephalometric analysis of the distance from nasion to menton (N-Me). The vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> was measured in 30 lateral cephalometric radiographs of edentulous patients (experimental group), with models of complete dentures after clinical methods of determining the vertical and horizontal intermaxillary relation and 30 lateral cephalometric radiographs of participants with natural teeth (control group). The aims {{of the present study}} were: to analyse the vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> in participants with natural teeth skeletal class I, to cephalometrically evaluate the reconstructing vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> edentulous patients skeletal class I, to compare examined variables between individuals with natural teeth and edentulous patients. The results indicated a remarkable correlation in the vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> established initially for the edentulous patients when compared with the measurements made for dentulous patients. The results showed the vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> span a range between 106, 7 - 138 mm (X _ = 122, 24) in subjects with natural teeth. In edentulous patients the values of vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> span ranged between 109, 8 - 141, 6 mm (X _ = 122, 46). The vertical dimension <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> in male participans was increased in the group of persons with natural teeth as well as in edentulous patients. The results of t-test proved that there were no statistically significant differences in examined variables between persons with natural teeth and edentulous patients (p> 0, 01) ...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundBecause subintimal {{angioplasty}} (SA) is {{a technique}} that can achieve recanalization <b>of</b> long arterial <b>occlusions,</b> it is considered an alternative to lower limb bypass operations. The aim of this prospective {{study was to identify}} the risk factors that affect patency of SA in patients suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). Methods and results 51 consecutive infrainguinal SA were done in 46 patients suffered from CLI. The patients were followed-up with regular duplex scans up to 12 months post-intervention. Sex, atherosclerosis risk factors, and some technical details of the procedure (number of patent run-off vessels after the procedure, length and re-entry <b>point</b> <b>of</b> angioplasty) were examined as potential risk factors of patency, using survival analysis statistical techniques. The overall patency rate at 12 months post-intervention was 50 %. According to Cox-regression analysis, the factors that affect patency were the number of run-off vessels and the length <b>of</b> <b>occlusion.</b> Patients with two or three run-off vessels had a hazard <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> <b>of</b> 0. 30 (P=. 027) compared to those who had one run-off vessel. The 12 -months patency in patients with more than one run-off vessels was 81 % vs. 25 % in patients with one run-off vessel. Regarding the length of angioplasty, the hazard of reocclusion was 1. 02 for every centimeter <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> (P=. 049). ConclusionsThe number of patent run-off crural vessels after the angioplasty and the length <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> are significant risk factors for reocclusion of infrainguinal SA in patients with CLI. Trying to recanalize more than one run-off vessels could raise the SA patency...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetS), {{a compilation}} of associated risk factors, {{increases the risk of}} type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD, atherosclerosis), which can progress to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> artery <b>occlusion.</b> Stents are the primary interventional treatment for occlusive CAD, and patients with MetS and hyperinsulinemia have increased restenosis. Because of its thrifty genotype, the Ossabaw pig is a model of MetS. We tested the hypothesis that, when fed high-fat diet, Ossabaw swine develop more features of MetS, greater native CAD, and greater stent-induced CAD than do Yucatan swine. Animals of each breed were divided randomly into 2 groups and fed 2 different calorie-matched diets for 40 wk: control diet (C) and high-fat, high-cholesterol atherogenic diet (H). A bare metal stent was placed in the circumflex artery, and pigs were allowed to recover for 3 wk. Characteristics of MetS, macrovascular and microvascular CAD, in-stent stenosis, and Ca 2 + signaling in coronary smooth muscle cells were evaluated. MetS characteristics including, obesity, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated arterial pressure were elevated in Ossabaw swine compared to Yucatan swine. Ossabaw swine with MetS had more extensive and diffuse native CAD and in-stent stenosis and impaired coronary blood flow regulation compared with Yucatan. In-stent atherosclerotic lesions in Ossabaw coronary arteries were less fibrous and more cellular. Coronary smooth muscle cells from Ossabaw had impaired Ca 2 + efflux and intracellular sequestration versus cells from Yucatan swine. Therefore, Ossabaw swine are a superior model of MetS, subsequent CAD, and cellular Ca 2 + signaling defects, whereas Yucatan swine are leaner and relatively resistant to MetS and CAD...|$|R

We only consider these two types <b>of</b> <b>occlusions</b> for two reasons. The first {{is that we are}} working in a video surveillance context in which these two types <b>of</b> <b>occlusions</b> are often encountered. The second reason is that a public database with these two types <b>of</b> <b>occlusion</b> is available: the AR database.|$|R
