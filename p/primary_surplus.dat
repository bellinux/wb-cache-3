40|$|We {{formulate}} and estimate {{a simple}} fiscal policy reaction function for the euro area and individual euro area countries. Our reaction function allows for <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> to feature three components: an anti-cyclical response of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> to the output gap, {{a response to}} the debt-GDP ratio, and an exogenous fiscal policy shifter. In line with the cyclical adjustment literature and in contrast with much of the previous time-series literature, we find a consistently strong anti-cyclical response of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> to the output gap for the euro area. We also find a consistently strong positive response of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> to the debt-GDP ratio. Our estimates are robust to different output gap measures and to different assumptions regarding the order of integration of observables. In addition, we provide statistical evidence in favor of our specification of a fiscal policy reaction function which features persistent fiscal policy shocks as opposed to an alternative specification found in the literature which features fiscal policy smoothing. Altogether, our results help to reconcile widely differing estimates from the literature, and we argue that our results may therefore provide guidance to forecasters and policymakers...|$|R

The empirical results show the occurrence of a significantly positive reaction of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> to debt when the debt–GDP ratio exceeded the trigger value of 110 percent.

40|$|A {{new theory}} of price {{determination}} {{suggests that if}} <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> are independent {{of the level of}} debt, the price level has to ‘jump’ to assure fiscal solvency. In this regime (which we call fiscal dominant), monetary policy has to work through seignorage to control the price level. If, on the other hand, <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> are expected to respond to the level of debt in a way that assures fiscal solvency (a regime we call money dominant), then the price level is determined in more conventional ways. This paper develops testable restrictions that differentiate between the two regimes. Using post-war data, the paper presents what we think is overwhelming evidence that the United States is in a money dominant regime; even the post-Reagan data (1980 – 95) seem to support that contention.

40|$|Fiscal {{policy can}} affect {{monetary}} policy either through debt monetisation {{or through a}} direct effect on price dynamics. The former is the conventional classical view rooted in the quantity theory of money while the latter is the modern view of the Fiscal Theory of Price Determination. Based on the dynamic response of inflation to different shocks, we test the relationship between fiscal balances and monetary stability in 10 SADC countries. Results show that five out of 10 countries considered here were characterised throughout the period 1980 - 2006 by fiscally dominant regimes, with weak or no response of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> to public liabilities. The remaining five countries exhibit a monetary dominant regime. The study also finds that changes in <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> affect price variability via aggregate demand, suggesting that fiscal outcomes could be a direct source of inflation variability, hence, the need for policy coordination in the region. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{a fiscal}} reaction function (FRF) framework for euro area countries and derives {{a novel approach}} to measure fiscal fatigue. As in previous studies, we find evidence that euro area sovereigns abide, on average, by (weak) sustainability constraints. The primary balance improves by about 0. 03 - 0. 05 for every 1 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio after controlling for other relevant factors. The positive reaction of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> to higher debt strengthened over the crisis. Based on this framework, we propose a simple, practical measure of fiscal fatigue {{that can be used}} to assess the capacity of sovereigns to maintain <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> over extended periods of time. This measure can be derived by comparing simulated primary balance paths in the context of debt sustainability analyses with countries' track-record, adjusted for the change in debt with the estimated fiscal reaction coefficient. The evidence of fiscal fatigue in non-linear FRF specifications is weaker for our euro area sample...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fiscal theory of exchange rate crises. When the fiscal authority allows {{the present value}} of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> inclusive of seigniorage to differ from the current real value of government debt at the pegged exchange rate and a constant expected future interest rate, then the pegged rate is no longer viable. According to the fiscal theory of the price level, the current exchange rate (equivalently the price level) and the price of long-term government bonds, must equate the real value of government debt and {{the present value of}} <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses.</b> In the absence of long-term government bonds, the exchange rate must do the job, and collapse is instantaneous with the change in the present value of <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses.</b> In the presence of a sufficient quantity of long-term bonds, the price of long-term bonds can adjust the real value of government debt, and the collapse can be delayed. Whether collapse is instantaneous or delayed is at the discretion of the monetary authority. The paper shows that while fiscal policy is responsible for generating the crisis, monetary policy is responsible for its characteristics. These include the timing of the crisis and the magnitude of the collapse- period depreciation. This is a fundamentals theory of exchange rate crises. However, the theory shifts the focus for the cause of collapse away from monetary policy toward fiscal policy. And it demonstrates that fundamentals-generated collapse need not occur following a sustained period of policy misalignment and reserve loss. It can explain other types of exchange rate crises, including those, which surprise markets, as with the ERM crises in 1993, and crises caused by expectations of future fiscal expenditures with no sustained reserve loss, as in the Southeast Asian crises of 1997. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{announcement}} to intervene {{on the financial}} markets in case of {{need to keep the}} Eurozone intact, the ECB has attenuated the pressure of the markets on the endangered peripheral countries of the Eurozone. Critics argue that by eliminating the market's disciplining interest mechanism, governments in the crisis countries will not carry out reforms and consolidate their budgets. Based on data for the European Union, 2 SLS models are tested to investigate if governments react to rising interest rates or deteriorating borrowing conditions. The results are threefold: First, governments do react to rising bond yields on the secondary market by raising their <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Second, they also do so when they feel the rising interest rates in their budgets. Third, governments react to changing borrowing conditions but contrary to the expected direction.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} Þscal sustainability and the sustainability of a Þxedexchangerateregime. Atthemostgenerallevel,Þscal sustainability simply corresponds {{to the notion that}} a government’s intertemporal budget constraint holds without explicit default on its debt. This requires that the initial real value of a government’s debt be equal to the real present value of its future <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> plus the present value of inßationrelated revenues (e. g. seigniorage). In contrast, sustainability of a Þxed exchange rate regime requires that the government not raise any inßation-related revenues. 1 So under such aregime,Þscal sustainability reduces to the condition that the real value of a government’s initial debt must equal the real present value of its <b>primary</b> Þscal <b>surpluses.</b> The classic example of a Þxed exchange rate regime that is not sustainable is analyzed in the seminal papers of Krugman (1979) and Flood and Garber (1984). These authors consider a situation in which a government is running persistent primary deÞcits. A key implicit assumption of their analyses is that future <b>primary</b> <b>surpluses</b> will not be large enough to balance the government’s intertemporal budget constraint. Since it is unfeasible to indefinitely borrow and repay the resources needed to cover the ongoing deÞcits, the government will eventually have to print money to raise seigniorage revenues. This means that the Þxed exchange rate regime is not sustainable. As we will see below, the precise timing of the Þxed exchange rate collapse depends on various assumptions about government behavior and the demand for domestic money. But collapse it will. Precise timing aside, in this scenario an analyst would observe large ongoing deÞcits and rising debt levels prior to the collapse of the Þxed exchange rate regime...|$|R
