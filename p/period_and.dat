40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with networked estimation, where sensor data are transmitted over a network of limited transmission rate. The transmission rate depends on the sampling <b>periods</b> <b>and</b> the quantization bit lengths. To investigate how the sampling <b>periods</b> <b>and</b> the quantization bit lengths affect the estimation performance, an equation to compute the estimation performance is provided. An algorithm is proposed to find sampling <b>periods</b> <b>and</b> quantization bit lengths combination, which gives good estimation performance while satisfying the transmission rate constraint. Through the numerical example, the proposed algorithm is verified...|$|R
