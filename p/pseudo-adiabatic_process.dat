40|$|The {{behavior}} of cumulus convection in a prevailing wind with vertical shear is studied by integrating {{a set of}} dynamic equations numerically. The motion is considered under the solenoidal condition in a vertical two dimensional plane. Aside from the eddy exchange, the <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> <b>process</b> is assumed in which the motion is moist adiabatic in saturated ascending air and dry adiabatic in the remaining air. The comparison between both cases, with and without vertical shear, is made concern-ing the time dependent evolution of convections and their energy conversion. In a prevail-ing wind field with vertical shear, the axial symmetry of the convection is destroyed and the axis of the convection cell tilts downwind with height. This results in {{the interaction between the}} convective motion and the prevailing wind which transforms the kinetic energy of the convection into that of the prevailing wind. Therefore, vertical wind shear tends to suppress the development of the convection in the vertical plane parallel to the wind. Moreover, the discrepancy which develops between the central axes of updraft and the warm regions of the convection decreases the conversion of potential to kinetic energy-one which contributes {{to the development of the}} convection. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} {{conducted}} for the non-quasi-geostrophic baroclinic wave effects in a saturated atmosphere whose vertical motion is subject to <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> <b>processes.</b> With respect to the characteristics of energetics for the first-order solution, it is noted that, {{in the cases of}} both the dry mode and the first moist mode, the heat transport quantities due to the second-order eddy are small and opposite in sign to their respective transports. The non-quasi-geostrophic effects render the vertical motion field asymmetric in each of the regions involved and enter into the present treatment only as nonlinear terms. The moisture transport terms in the eddy-available potential energy equation is small by comparison to other individual terms in the cyclone scale motion's energetics calculation. This is consistent with the observational results of Smith (1980) ...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{pollutant}} dispersion in urban area is of crucial importance to assess {{quality of life}} of populations. At urban scales, local phenomena take place, governed by the building canopy, together with large scale motion driven by vertical stratification, air humidity and heat sources created in the canopy. This situation requires up-to-date tools able to reproduce the physics complexities. In the present work the large-eddy simulation technique is used to model the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer at urban scales. The model, LES-AIR, has been already developed and is able to take into account geometric complexities and thermal stratification. In the present work we show an improved version of the model where stratification and heat exchange associated to water moisture in air are considered. In particular will be considered the transport of the potential temperature Θ and of the humidity content of the air parcel. Both will be treated as active scalars and their influence on the flow will be taken into account via the Boussinesq approximation. Moreover the Lift Condensation Level (LCL) will be computed run-time in order to incorporate the effects of the change of phase of water in the limit of <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> <b>processes.</b> The model is tested against real scale data. The data from the meteorological station situated in Campoformido (UD), Italy, are included into the definition of the boundary condition at the surface. The Monin-Obukhov similarity theory is invoked in order to properly compute the momentum, heat and water vapor fluxes. In particular the gradient method is adopted to compute the values at the surface from the linear interpolation of the hourly available quantities. Different cases in different methodological situations are analyzed in order to enlighten the role of humidity in the atmospheric boundary layer. The results are discussed and compared to the vertical data available providing a good agreement...|$|R

A well {{documented}} shallow foehn and gap flow {{case in the}} Wipp valley in Austrian Alps from 20 Oct 1999 provided an excellent opportunity to examine {{the applicability of the}} Reduced Gravity Shallow Water (RGSW) model to such a flow. For that purpose a synthesized data set was constructed from ground-based Doppler lidar and the P 3 aircraft in situ measurements. The validity of the P 3 data was crucial for further analysis so a detailed comparison between the radial wind component observed by the Doppler lidar and the same component of the horizontal winds measured in situ by the P 3 was performed. It was found that the two data sets can be combined to give accurate composite analyses of the flow in the Wipp valley. Comparison of available radio soundings have shown a significant increase of potential temperature increase (approximately 3 K) inside the valley, in the lee of the Brenner pass, in a deep layer from the ground to above the elevated inversion. It was found that the warming cannot be explained by a <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> <b>process</b> of condensation and fallout of precipitation, but {{can be attributed to the}} net subsidence over the main Alpine crest. Examining the along-gap wind and potential temperature fields, some qualitative similarities but also discrepancies between the observations and the RGSW model were found. By far the most significant discrepancy is the failure of the elevated inversion to behave like a material surface. The evidence found in the P 3 data suggested that the strong inversion observed near the top of the gap flow in the valley was not transported over the Brenner pass, but was created in the lee by the combined effects of subsidence and turbulent mixing. Further evidence that the elevated inversion was not dominating the flow dynamics was obtained by comparing two semi-idealized numerical simulations. The first simulation, which included an elevated inversion in the initial conditions, resulted in a flow qualitatively similar to the observed. However, the second simulation, in which the elevated inversion was replaced by a uniform potential temperature profile, also produced a very similar flow pattern...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Adiabatic {{calorimetry}} is {{a technique}} that has been introduced as an important approach to hazard evaluation of exothermically reactive systems. In this paper the free radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) has been studied. One {{of the most important}} aspects of MMA polymerization is its exothermicity and autoaccelerating behaviour, these characteristics can generate the occurrence of a runaway reaction. In a runaway situation the reacting system is close to adiabatic behaviour because it is unable to eliminate the heat that is being generated. An even worse situation can be reproduced in the laboratory with the Phi-Tec <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> calorimeter. <b>Process</b> design parameters that are usually calculated from thermodynamic data or using semiempirical rules, such as adiabatic temperature rise or maximum attainable pressure, can be directly determined. The existence of the ceiling temperature has been experimentally demonstrated...|$|R
