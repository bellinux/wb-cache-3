One of the brain areas that receives <b>primary</b> <b>input</b> from the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relationship}} between light, primary production, and ecological energy budgets. Sunlight is the <b>primary</b> <b>input</b> of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths. Radiant energy from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts {{as a catalyst for}} genetic mutation. Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs. Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical enthalpic bonds.|$|E

40|$|In our {{previous}} work, we {{introduced a new}} class of sequential circuits with combinational test generation complexity called internally balanced structure. We reduced the test generation problem for an internally balanced sequential circuit S into the test generation problem for a combinational circuit C, where single stuck-at faults on all lines in S except for some <b>primary</b> <b>inputs,</b> called separable <b>primary</b> <b>inputs,</b> correspond to single stuck-at faults on C. In this paper, we first show that test sequences for single stuck-at faults on fanout branches of separable <b>primary</b> <b>inputs</b> do not always detect faults on the <b>primary</b> <b>inputs,</b> and then present how to generate test sequences for single stuck-at faults on the separable <b>primary</b> <b>inputs.</b> As a result, the test generation problem for all single stuck-at faults in internally balanced circuits is reduced into the test generation problem for single stuck-at faults in combinational circuits.

50|$|An FSM can {{be defined}} as a quintuplet that {{consists}} of a set of <b>primary</b> <b>inputs,</b> a set of primary outputs, a set of states, a next-state function and an output function. The next-state function maps the present-state and the <b>primary</b> <b>inputs</b> to a next-state; the output function maps the <b>primary</b> <b>inputs</b> and present-state onto the primary outputs. Any deterministic sequential function can be represented by the use of this model. A FSM can be separated into two parts viz., combinational circuit and memory.|$|R

The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch, and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet. On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary. On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012. In December 2014, B purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Guitar Hero {{was released}} on the PlayStation 2 in November 2005. Guitar Hero is notable because it comes packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black Gibson SG guitar. Rather than a typical gamepad, this guitar controller is the <b>primary</b> <b>input</b> for the game. Playing the game with the guitar controller simulates playing an actual guitar, except it uses five colored [...] "fret buttons" [...] and a [...] "strum bar" [...] instead of frets and strings. The development of Guitar Hero was inspired by Konami's Guitar Freaks video game, which at the time, had not seen much exposure in the North American market; RedOctane, already selling guitar-shaped controllers for imported copies of GuitarFreaks, approached Harmonix about creating a game to use an entirely new Guitar controller. The concept {{was to have the}} gameplay of Amplitude with the visuals of Karaoke Revolution, both of which had been developed by Harmonix. [...] The game was met with critical acclaim and received numerous awards for its innovative guitar peripheral and its soundtrack, which comprised 47 playable rock songs (most of which were cover versions of popular songs from artists and bands from the 1960s through modern rock). Guitar Hero has sold nearly 1.5 million copies to date.|$|E

COUT 1 /COUT 0. The 6 -input OR gate shown in dotted lines in Fig.  4 would confirm the complete arrival of all the spacer inputs. When valid data are applied and presuming only A 1 has transitioned to 1, org might attain 1 without waiting for the assertion of the remaining dual-rail <b>primary</b> <b>inputs.</b> Nevertheless, at this juncture, the arrival of the requisite <b>primary</b> <b>inputs</b> is necessary for a valid output production through the AND gate(s) present in the first logic level, and eventually the sum output would confirm the complete arrival of all the requisite <b>primary</b> <b>inputs.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Drain {{efficiency}} is {{the ratio of}} output RF power to input DC power when <b>primary</b> <b>input</b> DC power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding. [...] In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both {{above and below the}} rail during operation.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel {{technique}} based on Markov chains to accurately estimate power sensitivities to <b>primary</b> <b>inputs</b> in CMOS sequential circuits. A key {{application of power}} sensitivities is to construct a complicated power surface in the specification-space so as to easily obtain the power dissipation under any distribution of <b>primary</b> <b>inputs,</b> thereby offering an effective power macromodel for high-level power estimation. We demonstrate that such a power surface can be approximated by {{only a limited number}} of representative points. This benefit dramatically reduces the CPU and memory requirements. We have verified the feasibility and accuracy of the new technique to estimate power sensitivities on a large number of sequential benchmark circuits. Results on the power dissipation under different distributions of <b>primary</b> <b>inputs</b> demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our power macromodeling technique.

The number of clock cycles, k, for which each random input is held at a fixed value, before applying the next random vector, is determined by using testability analysis or a test pattern generator for {{a very small number of}} lines or faults in the circuit.
