5|$|The airline was {{wholly owned}} by the Bangladeshi {{government}} through the Bangladesh Biman Corporation since its inception. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation which afforded Biman limited autonomy, led by a government-appointed board of directors. The authorised share capital was increased to BDT2billion in 1987, and Biman {{was transformed into a}} <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company,</b> the largest in Bangladesh, in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Created in February 1972, Biman enjoyed an {{internal}} monopoly in the aviation industry of Bangladesh until 1996. In the decades following its founding, the airline expanded its fleet and destinations {{but it was}} adversely affected by corruption and mismanagement. At its peak, Biman operated flights to 29 international destinations, extending from New York City {{in the west to}} Tokyo in the east. The airline was wholly owned and managed by the government of Bangladesh until 23 July 2007, when it was transformed into the country's largest <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company</b> by the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh. Since becoming a <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company</b> in 2007, the airline has reduced staff and begun to modernise its fleet. The airline has made a deal with Boeing for ten new aircraft along with options for ten more. Biman Bangladesh Airlines is certified as safe to fly in Europe by the European Aviation Safety Agency and it also successfully passed the IATA Operational Safety Audit and since then, the airline has resumed flights to some of its previous destinations in Asia and Europe.|$|E

5|$|Sir Bert Millichip {{served as}} Albion {{chairman}} from 1974 to 1983, {{after which he}} chose to concentrate on his role {{as chairman of the}} Football Association. In 1996, the club became a <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company,</b> issuing shares to supporters at £500 and £3,000 each. The shares were quoted on the Alternative Investment Market, but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004. The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson to quit the club.|$|E
5|$|After Biman {{became a}} <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company,</b> renewed {{attempts}} were made to procure new-generation aircraft to replace its ageing fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman with four Boeing 777-200s (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2013 and four Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners (with options for two more) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft on lease for the interim period beginning in 2009. The average price of these aircraft was quoted as million. Airbus also made an offer to supply four Airbus A320 or Airbus A330 series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with options to purchase two used Airbus A310-300 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, {{operates}} as a non-quoted <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company,</b> whose ownership is considerably {{different from that of}} other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, which sets the club's market capitalisation value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at $2.0 billion (£1.4 billion) in 2016, ranked second in English football. Research by the Henley Business School also ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.|$|E

5|$|In , the {{caretaker}} government approved plans to turn Biman into a <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company</b> with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations. As {{a part of}} the restructuring, the government put in place a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft). The industry average at the time was 200:1, and other Asian airlines operated with MERs of about 150:1. The VRS provided compensation based on length of service, at a cost to the government of over BDT2.97billion borrowed from the World Bank. Biman management expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600, but 2,162applications were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance pay if the quota was not met. Biman accepted between 1,863 and 1877 applications, and affirmed that key personnel {{would not be allowed to}} leave the organisation via VRS.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle United {{was set up}} as {{a private}} company limited by shares on 6 September 1895. The club traded in this way {{for much of the}} 20th century, {{dominated}} by McKeag, Westwood and Seymour family ownership, until April 1997, when John Hall, who bought 72.9% of the club for £3million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company,</b> with less than half the shares sold to the Hall family and the majority holding going to his business partner Freddy Shepherd. Later that year, Hall stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Shepherd, with the Hall family represented on the board by John's son Douglas. In December 1998, after buying a 6.3% stake in the club for £10 million, the media group NTL had considered a full takeover of the club. This was later dropped after the April 1999 Competition Commission, brought in due to government concerns about football clubs being owned by media companies.|$|E

They then managed to secure the stake of the third-largest stakeholder, Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson, taking their share total to 62% of the club. By 13 May, the Glazers had bought a further 12.8% stake taking their total ownership to 74.81%, just shy of the 75% threshold {{that would allow them}} to end the club's <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company</b> (PLC) status and delist it from the London Stock Exchange. On 16 May, the Glazers took their shareholding in Manchester United to 75.7%, and a month later, on 22 June, they removed the club's shares from the stock exchange for the first time in 14 years.|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} tax aggressiveness in the top 100 Malaysian <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>companies</b> using a corporate governance mechanism. In this study, the tax aggressiveness was proxied by the effective tax rate (ETR). The effective tax rate indicates a company’s efforts in reducing its tax payments, thus resulting in lower effective tax rate (ETR). The corporate governance mechanism could influence tax strategies of the company through its control mechanism. This study attempts to determine the relationship between board characteristics and tax aggressiveness of the top 100 Malaysian <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>companies</b> {{during the period of}} 2008 until 2011. The data collection process involved an examination of the board characteristics, firm characteristics and tax information. The findings of this study revealed that board characteristics did not influence the tax aggressiveness. On the other hand, firm characteristics such as firm’s size and leverage had influenced the level of tax aggressiveness of top 100 Malaysian <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>companies.</b> The empirical results indicated that the corporate governance mechanism had not influenced the tax aggressiveness among top 100 Malaysian <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

5|$|During the 1982–83 Football League season, both Oxford United and Reading {{competed in}} the Football League Third Division, then the third tier of English football—equivalent to today's League One. Managed by Jim Smith, Oxford {{challenged}} for promotion throughout the season, while Maurice Evans' Reading team languished near the relegation zone {{for much of the}} year, despite possessing one of the division's top-scoring forwards in Kerry Dixon. The colourful media mogul and former MP Robert Maxwell owned and chaired Oxford, having prevented the club's bankruptcy by buying it in 1982. One of the world's oldest football teams (established in 1871), Reading were a <b>public</b> <b>limited</b> <b>company,</b> chaired by Frank Waller, a prominent local businessman; while owning Oxford, Maxwell also held 19% of Reading's shares. The two clubs share a local rivalry. At the time, both were in financial difficulties, particularly Reading. Maxwell sought to build a new stadium for Oxford United; he had negotiated with the council over potential locations since the time of his takeover, favouring a site in the northern suburb of Marston, but had yet to win council permission to buy the land.|$|E
