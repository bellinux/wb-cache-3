Cinecittà Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 {{on the outskirts of}} Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location. Zimbalist hired Wyler's long-term <b>production</b> <b>supervisor,</b> Henry Henigson, to oversee the film, and art directors William A. Horning and Edward Carfagno created the overall look of the film, relying on the more than five years of research which had already been completed for the production.

25|$|The {{antecedents of}} the case were posed when Lilly Ledbetter, a <b>production</b> <b>supervisor</b> at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, filed an equal-pay lawsuit {{regarding}} pay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, six months before her early retirement in 1998. The courts gave opposite verdicts, first supporting the complaint and later opposing; in conclusion the complaint brought {{the case to the}} attention of the Supreme Court. The latter ruled in 2007 by a 5-4 majority vote that Ledbetter's complaint was time-barred because the discriminatory decisions relating to pay had been made more than 180 days prior to the date she filed her charge, as explained by Justice Samuel Alito. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissenting opinion proposed an interpretation according to which the law runs from the date of any paycheck that contains an amount affected by a prior discriminatory pay decision.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{leadership}} {{is one of}} the most important factors that influence the performance of an organisation. Effective leadership together with supervision are similar in terms of their influence of others towards achieving the goals of the organisation. Therefore, effective leadership and supervision are principal activities through which organisational goals and objectives are achieved. The main objectives of this study are firstly to evaluate the leadership effectiveness of <b>production</b> <b>supervisors</b> at Lennon and Intramed. Secondly, to suggest recommendations to management to improve or eliminate shortcomings in the leadership effectiveness of the <b>production</b> <b>supervisors</b> at Lennon and Intramed. In this way, a contribution to the overall leadership effectiveness of the <b>production</b> <b>supervisors</b> at Lennon and Intramed is achieved. In order to achieve the said objectives, the following methodology was employed: Firstly, guidelines for effective leadership were identified by means of evaluating existing literature and theory. This was achieved by critically examining existing leadership theories and models. The major contributions, disadvantages, and advantages of each of these theories and models were evaluated which resulted in the list of guidelines for effective leadership. Secondly, the pharmaceutical industry and the theory surrounding supervision were critically examined and discussed. Attention was given to the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa, with special reference to Lennon and Intramed. The theory of supervision was examined with special focus on the skills, functions, power, and responsibilities of the supervisor. Thirdly, a postal questionnaire was used to gather the required empirical information. The response obtained from the questionnaire was critically evaluated against the guidelines for effective leadership and effective supervision, and the results were graphically represented in a company leadership profile. Lennon and Intramed were evaluated separately, and the major differences and similarities between the two organisations were critically evaluated. Lastly, the main findings and recommendations were formulated in order to remedy the shortcomings that were identified. The following recommendations may lead to more effective leadership among <b>production</b> <b>supervisors</b> at Lennon and Intramed: It is necessary that this study be made available to the supervisors at Lennon and Intramed, as it will give them insight into the theory of leadership and what effective {{leadership is}} about. It will furthermore give the supervisors an insight into the way that their subordinates view their leadership behaviour and effectiveness. It is further recommended that the information from this study be made available through sensitisation sessions where the necessary information is presented to a group or individual supervisors. Leadership training and development is required as it can make a meaningful contribution to equip supervisors with the necessary leadership skills to practise effective leadership. This leadership training and development can be done by means of short courses presented by a formal training institution, or by a suitably qualified in-house presenter. The last recommendation to leadership effectiveness involves the implementation of a performance management system and incentive scheme to further motivate and drive the supervisor’s leadership behaviour towards effective leadership...|$|R

Although ILM had provided the effects work for The Wrath of Khan, they had only been approached after effects storyboards had been completed.

500|$|An {{agreement}} {{signed by}} Disney and Stokowski on December 16, 1937, allowed the conductor to [...] "select and employ a complete symphony orchestra" [...] for the recording. Disney hired a {{stage at the}} Culver Studios in California for the session. It began at midnight on January 9, 1938, and lasted for three hours using eighty-five Hollywood musicians. As production costs of The Sorcerer's Apprentice climbed to $125,000, it became clearer to Disney and his brother Roy, who managed the studio's finances, that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own. Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum. He said, [...] "because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature... {{we have no idea}} what can be expected from such a production." [...] Ben Sharpsteen, a <b>production</b> <b>supervisor</b> on Fantasia, noted that its budget was three to four times greater than the usual Silly Symphony, but Disney [...] "saw this trouble in the form of an opportunity.

500|$|The most {{complicated}} effects involved the [...] "Driller", a giant snake-like creature with an eel-like body and spinning rotator blades, knives and teeth. In Revenge of the Fallen, it took 72 hours per frame to fully render Devastator for the IMAX format, which is approximately a frame amount of 4,000. For the Driller, which required the entire render farm, {{it was up}} to 122 hours per frame. The most complex scene involved the Driller destroying a computer-generated skyscraper, which took 288 hours per frame. For said sequence, ILM relied on its internal proprietary physics simulation engine to depict the destruction of the building, which included breaking concrete floors and walls, windows, columns and pieces of office furnishings. ILM digital <b>production</b> <b>supervisor</b> Nigel Sumner explained: [...] "We did a lot of tests early on {{to figure out how to}} break the building apart exploring a lot of the procedural options. A building that's 70 feet tall – to go in and hand-score the geometry so when it fractures or falls apart – would be a time consuming laborious process. The floor of a building may be made of concrete. How does concrete fracture when it tears apart? The pillars would be made of a similar material but made of rebar or other engineering components. We'd look at how a building would blow apart and then choose the best tool to help achieve the properties of that during a simulation." ...|$|E
