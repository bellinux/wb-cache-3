40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the soil has been subject to high {{consumption}} of land due to several reason such as residential purposes, production, infrastructure etc. This competition for the soil use s greater in urban than in rural areas due to the urban sprawling. However urban agriculture {{plays a key role}} in providing services in terms of local farming and management of urban areas. This paper aims at investigating the existing differences between rural and urban areas of Tuscany focusing on the socio-economic farm household characteristics and on the amount of <b>public</b> <b>payments</b> received. Two different source of data has been used, the 2010 agricultural census and the regional database of <b>public</b> <b>payments.</b> Results show statistically significant differences in terms of farm size, labour and land productivity and amount of RDP payments received...|$|R

Japan’s IC-Card (Felica: Sony) is a type of a multi–functional card system devised to resolve many payment problems, to improve <b>public</b> <b>payment</b> service, to build advanced transit information system, to encourage reasonable operation of the public transit company, and to obtain basic information for the formulation of public policy. Japan’s IC-Card is applied to various kinds of technologies and services in Japan. In this paper, we discuss the diffusion process and user behavior information regarding Japan’s IC-Card system.

5000|$|Dealing {{with the}} {{pressing}} matter of war reparations {{had been a}} priority for the Cuno government from the day it took office, as it had earlier been for the Wirth government. The new government continued to follow the policies of its predecessor on this issue. The goal was to convince the Allies to accept an extended <b>payment</b> <b>moratorium</b> {{for three to four}} years that would allow the Germans to stabilize their economy and currency first before resuming transfers. However, the French had budget problems of their own and refused to compromise on this, holding the German side to earlier agreements. The French government of prime minister/foreign minister Raymond Poincaré was convinced that Germany (and its industry) was unwilling rather than unable to make the reparations. A debt moratorium was considered possible only if France would be able to obtain [...] "productive collateral" [...] (such as direct Allied control over the coal mines of the Ruhr). On 26 December 1923, the reparations commission formally found that Germany had culpably failed to comply with its obligations concerning the delivery of wood, against the vote of the British commissioner. Similarly, it found on 9 January 1923 that the 1922 deliveries of coal to France had been deficient. Two days later French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr.|$|R

Central to {{the issue is the}} role of collateral both as a requirement for participation in central bank sponsored payments arrangements and as the backing for private intermediary arrangements. The presence of private systems serves as a check on the ability of a monetary authority to tighten monetary policy. Round-the-clock systems are an example of a collateral saving innovation that further pressures central bank pre-eminence in payments settlement. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{cost-effectiveness}} of payments to organic farms in Luxemburg from an agri-environmental perspective. For pursuing this aim, farm accountancy data, farm structure data and 7 environmental indicators were assessed for 12 organic and 12 conventional dairy and suckler-cow farms. Results show that organic farms cause substantially lower environmental impacts than their conventional counterparts. However, these additional environmental benefits do not go along with higher <b>public</b> <b>payments.</b> Therefore, we argue that agricultural policy in Luxemburg currently does not provide incentives for ecological friendly agricultural production in a sufficiently targeted way...|$|R

Our main result is that subjects´ WTP significantly exceeds WTD, by a factor of three. Regression analysis shows that our results remain robust when controlling for personal characteristics and attitudes.

These obligations reinforce incentives for the farmers to change their behaviour towards the environment. We apply quasi-experimental methods to measure the causal relationship between cross-compliance and farm environmental performance. We find that cross compliance reduced farm fertiliser and pesticide expenditure. This result also holds for farmers who participated in other voluntary agro-environmental schemes. However, the results do not support our expectations that farmers who relied on larger shares of <b>public</b> <b>payments</b> had a stronger motivation to improve their environmental performance. agriculture; Common Agriculture Policy; cross-compliance; environment; EU; farm...|$|R

The real economic cost of disability, namely, the lost production from individuals not at work, has been growing rapidly in recent years. Nominal, or budget, outlays have also been increasing as private and <b>public</b> <b>payments</b> for disability benefits have soared in the last 20 years. Using a nonrandom sample, a recent study estimated that employers were paying 8 percent of payroll for disability-related expenses, including both direct and indirect costs of disability (Che-lius, Galvin, and Owens 1992).

50|$|Rousseff {{was also}} accused of fiscal {{pedaling}} in her administration - an accounting maneuver {{to give the}} false impression that more money was received than was spent. The government allegedly failed to fund public and private banks that managed <b>public</b> <b>payments,</b> including social assistance programs like Bolsa Família, forcing the banks to finance the programs themselves without compensation. The Rousseff Administration's budgeting allegedly used this pedaling to improve its fiscal outcomes and make the surplus for the years 2012 to 2014 appear larger. The Tribunal de Contas da União (TCU), unanimously declared this maneuver a violation of fiscal responsibility.
