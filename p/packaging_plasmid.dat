Recent studies have attempted to replace the existing complex rev/RRE system with a more simplistic RNA export system from simple retroviruses to make these vectors in a rev-independent manner. Results Towards this end, lentiviral transfer plasmids were modified with various cis-acting DNA elements that co-ordinate RNA export during viral production to determine their ability to affect the efficiency of vector titer and transduction in different immortalized cell lines in vitro. It was found that multiple copies of the constitutive transport element (CTE) originating from different simian retroviruses, including simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV- 1) and type- 2 (SRV- 2) and Mason-Pfizer (MPV) {{could be used to}} eliminate the requirement for the rev responsive element (RRE) in the transfer and <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmids</b> with titers > 10 6 T. U. /mL (n = 4 – 8 preparations). The addition of multiple copies of the murine intracisternal type A particle, the woodchuck post-regulatory element (WPRE), or single and dual copies of the simian CTE had minimal effect on viral titer. Immortalized cell lines from different species were found to be readily transduced by VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors containing the multiple copies of the CTE similar to the findings in HeLa cells, although the simian-derived CTE were found to have a lower infectivity into murine cell lines compared to the other species. Conclusion These studies demonstrated that the rev-responsive element (RRE) could be replaced with other constitutive transport elements to produce equivalent titers using lentivectors containing the RRE sequence in vitro, but that concatemerization of the CTE or the close proximity of RNA export sequences was needed to enhance vector production. </p...|$|R

Heavy (1. 34 g/ml) and light (1. 30 g/ml) VLPs were produced, and each packaged {{some of the}} input plasmid. In light VLPs, truncated plasmids, which nevertheless incorporated the PV-derived DNA packaging sequence, were more common than full-length <b>plasmids.</b> <b>Packaging</b> efficiency of the plasmid was estimated at 1 plasmid per 104 VLPs in both Cos- 1 and Sf- 9 cells. In each cell type, expression of the BPV 1 early region protein E 2 in trans doubled the quantity of heavy but not light VLPs and also increased the packaging efficiency of full-length circular plasmids by threefold in heavy VLPs. The resultant pseudovirions incorporated significant amounts of E 2 protein.

Using this approach, we evaluated a series of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 packaging constructs that express one or more accessory proteins (Vif, Vpr, and Vpu), {{in addition to the}} Gag and Pol proteins, for particle formation and virus stock production for gene transfer. Constructs that also express Vpr or both Vpr and Vpu produced more particles, as measured by a p 24 assay, than did plasmids that did not contain these sequences.

In addition, AAV vectors are frequently applied tools in preclinical and basic research. Despite this success, manufacturing pure AAV vector preparations remains a difficult task.

Here, we report the development of minicircle (MC) constructs to replace AAV vector and helper plasmids for production of both, single-stranded (ss) and self-complementary (sc) AAV vectors.

We {{measured the}} distribution of lengths of plasmid concatemers found within cells supporting the lytic phase of the viral life cycle and found that this distribution differed from the distribution of lengths of concatemers found in mature virion particles. This finding indicates that the DNA packaged into mature virions represents a selected subset of those present in the cell during packaging. These observations together indicate that the length of DNA affects the efficiency with which that DNA is packaged by EBV.

40|$|BACKGROUND: HIV- 1 {{replication}} can be inhibited with RNA interference (RNAi) by {{expression of}} short hairpin RNA (shRNA) from a lentiviral vector. Because lentiviral vectors {{are based on}} HIV- 1, viral sequences in the vector system are potential targets for the antiviral shRNAs. Here, we investigated all possible routes by which shRNAs can target the lentiviral vector system. METHODS: Expression cassettes for validated shRNAs with targets within HIV- 1 Leader, Gag-Pol, Tat/Rev and Nef sequences were inserted in the lentiviral vector genome. Third-generation self-inactivating HIV- 1 -based lentiviral vectors were produced and lentiviral vector capsid production and transduction titer determined. RESULTS: RNAi against HIV- 1 sequences within the vector backbone results in a reduced transduction titer while capsid production was unaffected. The notable exception is self-targeting of the shRNA encoding sequence, which does not affect transduction titer. This is due to folding of the stable shRNA hairpin structure, which masks the target for the RNAi machinery. Targeting of Gag-Pol mRNA reduces both capsid production and transduction titer, which was improved with a human codon-optimized Gag-Pol construct. When Rev mRNA was targeted, no reduction in capsid production and transduction titer was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Lentiviral vector titers can be negatively affected when shRNAs against the vector backbone and the Gag-Pol mRNA are expressed during lentiviral vector production. Titer reductions due to targeting of the Gag-Pol mRNA can be avoided with a human codon-optimized Gag-Pol <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmid.</b> The remaining targets in the vector backbone may be modified by point mutations to resist RNAi-mediated degradation during vector productio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFoamy viruses {{have several}} {{inherent}} features {{for the opportunity}} to develop efficient and versatile vectors for gene therapy. We have constructed a series of vectors and helper plasmids based on simian foamy virus type 1 (SFV- 1) to establish the minimum vector genome required for efficient gene transduction. To characterize the efficiency of gene transduction by these vectors, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence is linked to the human cytomegalovirus immediate gene promoter. Several deletion analyses of SFV- 1 vectors revealed that the minimum genome with efficient GFP transduction contained the 5 ′ untranslated region extending to the first 637 nucleotides of the gag gene, a 596 nucleotides of pol sequence from position 3137 – 3733, the 3 ′ pol region at position 5200 – 5693, the 3 ′ end polypurine tract, and the 3 ′ LTR. An additional 1131 nucleotides can be removed from the 3 ′ end LTR without affecting the efficiency of vector transduction. SFV- 1 vector can therefore accommodate a minimum 8930 base-size heterologous DNA fragment. Furthermore, the efficiency of SFV- 1 vector transduction was analyzed using different packaging plasmids. GFP transduction with <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmid</b> that contained the 5 ′ R-U 5 region of the LTR was compared with helper plasmids that had deletions in this region except for 22 nucleotides (positions 21 – 41), the first 61, 77, or 140 nucleotides of the R of the LTR. Transduction efficiencies were significantly reduced with the deletion mutations implicating that for optimum SFV- 1 vector productions a packaging construct that includes the 5 ′ R-U 5 is required...|$|E

Immortalization of primary MEFs was performed by transformation with hTERT (the catalytic subunit of human telomerase) (Wood et al., 2001). PA 317 packaging cells stably producing pBABE-puro hTERT viral particles (a generous gift from Tej Pandita, Washington University) were grown to 80 % confluence, rinsed and the medium was then replaced with complete MEF medium. The cells were then incubated for 16 hrs and the medium was collected and filtered through a 0. 45 µm filter. The infecting media were stored at- 80 ˚C until use. Primary BID-/- and BID+/+ MEFs were grown for 3 passages and then infected at ~ 50 % confluence with 3 ml infecting media mixed with 3 ml MEF media and 4 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma). The cells were then incubated for 16 hrs, rinsed and incubated in fresh medium for an additional 8 hrs. The cells were infected again as described above, rinsed and incubated in fresh medium for an additional 48 hrs. The cells were then split 1 : 3 and grown for 4 days in a selection medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin. After selection, the cells were washed once and incubated with MEF medium (without puromycin). Stable clones were collected 14 to 18 days post-infection, and their propagation took 3 -to- 4 months.

40|$|Background: Lentiviral vectors (LV) offer several {{advantages}} over other gene delivery vectors. Their {{potential for the}} integration and long-term expression of therapeutic genes renders them an interesting tool for gene and cell therapy interventions. However, large-scale LV production remains an important challenge for the translation of LV-based therapeutic strategies to the clinic. The development of robust processes for mass production of LV is needed. Methods: A suspension-grown HEK 293 cell line was exploited {{for the production of}} green fluorescent protein-expressing LV by transient polyethylenimine (PEI) -based transfection with LV-encoding plasmid constructs. Using third-generation <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmids</b> (Gag/Pol, Rev), a vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope and a self-inactivating transfer vector, we employed strategies to increase volumetric and specific productivity. Functional LV titers were determined using a flow cytometry-based gene transfer assay. Results: A combination of the most promising conditions (increase in cell density, medium selection, reduction of PEI 2 ̆ 013 DNA complexes per cell, addition of sodium butyrate) resulted in significantly increased LV titers of more than 150 -fold compared to non-optimized small-scale conditions, reaching infectious titers of approximately 108 transducing units/ml. These conditions are readily scalable and were validated in 3 -liter scale perfusion cultures. Conclusions: Our process produces LV in suspension cultures and is consequently easily scalable, industrially viable and generated more than 1011 total functional LV particles in a single bioreactor run. This process will allow the production of LV by transient transfection in sufficiently large quantities for phase I clinical trials at the 102 ̆ 01320 -liter bioreactor scale.

40|$|Application of {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) vector in large animal studies and {{clinical}} trials often requires high-titer and high-potency vectors. A number of currently used vector production methods, based on either transient transfection or helper virus infection of cell lines, have their advantages and limitations. We previously developed a 293 -cell–based {{producer cell line}} method for high-titer and high-potency AAV 2 vectors. Similar to several other methods, however, it requires multiple cloning steps for the vector and <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmids</b> and a two-step transfection and selection for stable cell lines. Here we report a simplified method with several key improvements and advantages: (1) a one-step cloning of AAV vector cassette into the serotype-specific packaging plasmid; (2) a single plasmid transfection and selection for stable AAV vector producer cell lines; (3) high vector yields of different serotypes, e. g., AAV 2, 8, and 9, upon infection with an E 1 A/E 1 B-deleted helper adenovirus; (4) efficient packaging of both single-stranded and double-stranded (self-complementary) AAV vectors; and (5) efficient packaging of large AAV cassettes such as a mini-dystrophin vector (5. 0 [*]kb). All cell lines were stable with growth rates identical to the parental 293 cells. The vector yields were consistent among serotypes, with 5 [*]×[*] 1013 to 8 [*]×[*] 1013 vector genome particles per Nunc cell factory (equivalent to 40 15 -cm plates). The vectors showed high potency for in vitro and in vivo transduction. In conclusion, the simple and versatile AAV producer cell line method can be useful for large scale AAV vector production in preclinical and clinical studies...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{efficient}} and long-term in vivo gene transfer by recombinant adeno-associated virus type 2 (rAAV) vectors {{has been demonstrated}} {{in a variety of}} tissues. Further improvement in vector titer and purity will expedite this in vivo exploration and provide preclinical information required for use in human gene therapy. In an effort to obtain higher titers, we constructed a novel AAV helper plasmid which utilizes translational control of AAV Rep genes (J. Li et al., J. Virol. 71 : 5236 – 5243, 1997). To address the issue of purity, in this study we report the first rAAV production method which is completely free of adenovirus (Ad) helper virus. The new production system uses a plasmid construct which contains a mini-Ad genome capable of propagating rAAV in the presence of AAV Rep and Cap genes. This construct is missing some of the early and most of the late Ad genes and is incapable of producing infectious Ad. Transfection of 293 cells with the new mini-Ad helper and AAV <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmids</b> results in high-titer rAAV vectors with yields greater than 1, 000 transducing units, or 105 viral particles per cell. When rAAV vectors were produced by using this production scheme and compared to traditional heat-inactivated rAAV preparations in vitro and in vivo, we observed transduction equivalent to or better than normal levels. The complete removal of infectious Ad from AAV production should facilitate a better understanding of immune response to AAV vectors in vivo, eliminate the need for developing replication-competent Ad assays, and provide a more defined reagent for clinical use...|$|R
40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is a {{means of}} regulating gene expression by targeting mRNA in a sequence-specific manner for degradation or translational inhibition. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and siRNAs have been extensively employed for manipulating gene expression {{in a wide range of}} species. However, the great majority of this work has involved in vitro studies with cells grown in culture. Our goal for this project is to produce transgenic livestock in which myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, has been targeted for silencing by RNAi. In theory, livestock in which myostatin has been silenced should exhibit increased muscle growth and development. To that end, we designed shRNAs to target the bovine myostatin mRNA sequence. The shRNAs were cloned into a lentiviral vector that contains a cytomegalovirus promoter controlling green fluorescent protein and shRNA expression as well as neomycin resistance. Infective lentivirus was made in HEK 293 T cells through co-transfection of the lentiviral vector, a <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmid,</b> and a plasmid expressing the VSVG pseudotype. Bovine fetal fibroblasts were transduced, selected using Geneticin®, and nuclear transfer was utilized to produce cloned transgenic embryos. There were 186 fusion attempts resulting in 160 fused embryos (fusion rate = 86 %). Of these, 54 reached the blastocyst stage (34 %) and 10 embryos were transferred into 5 recipient females (2 embryos per recipient). At 40 days, ultrasound revealed 1 confirmed pregnancy. Current plans are to harvest this fetus at 90 days and analyze it for evidence of myostatin knockdown. The production of transgenic animals exhibiting myostatin knockdown through lentiviral-mediated RNAi will demonstrate the utility of RNAi in the study of gene function in large animal models without the need for homologous recombination techniques, which are currently inefficient in species other than mice...|$|E
40|$|Jembrana disease virus (JDV) is a newly {{isolated}} and characterised bovine lentivirus. It causes an acute disease in Bali cattle (Bos javanicus), {{which can be}} readily transmitted to susceptible cattle with 17 % mortality. There is as yet no treatment or preventive vaccine. We have developed a gene transfer vector system based on JDV that has three components. The first of the components is a bicistronic transfer vector plasmid that was constructed to contain cis-sequences from the JDV genome, including 5 ′- and 3 ′-long terminal repeats (LTRs), 0. 4 kb of truncated gag and 1. 1 kb of 3 ′-env, a multiple cloning site to accommodate the gene(s) of interest for transfer, and an internal ribosome entry site plus the neomycin phosphotransferase (Neo) gene cassette for antibiotic selection. The second element is a <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmid</b> that contains trans-sequences, including gag, pol, vif, tat and rev, but without the env and packaging signals. The third is a plasmid encoding the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) to supply the vector an envelope for pseudotyping. Cotransfection of 293 T cells with these three plasmid components produced VSV-G pseudotyped, disabled, replication defective, bicistronic JDV vectors encoding the green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the Neo resistance selection maker simultaneously with a titre range of (0. 4 - 1. 2) × 10 6 CFU/ml. Transduction of several replicating primary and transformed cells from cattle, primate and human sources and importantly growth-arrested cells with the JDV vectors showed high efficiency of EGFP gene transfer at 35 - 75 %, which was stable and the expression of EGFP was long term. Furthermore, these JDV vectors were designed to suit the inclusion and expression of genes corresponding to JDV specific proteins, such as gag or env, {{for the development of}} vaccines for Jembrana disease. This strategy should also be applicable to other bovine diseases as well. The design and construction of the JDV vector system should facilitate the study of the lentivirology and pathogenesis of the diseases associated with JDV or other bovine virus infections. To our knowledge, this is the first such vector system developed from a cattle virus...|$|E

Methods: The gene sequences were cloned into the pLenR-GPH-shRNA lentiviral vector, which was selected by Genebank searches. The pLenR-GPH-shRNA and lentiviral vector <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmid</b> mix were cotransfected into 293 T cells to package lentiviral particles. Culture virus supernatant was harvested, and then the virus titer was determined by serial dilution assay. A 549 cells were transduced with the constructed lentiviral vectors, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to evaluate p 66 Shc expression. This study is divided into a control group, a hyperoxia group, an A 549 -p 66 ShcshRNA hyperoxia group, and a negative lentivirus group. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry after 24 hours; the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and caspase- 9 were detected by immunohistochemistry assay. The production of reactive oxygen species and cellular mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm) were determined by fluorescence microscopy. Results: We successfully established the p 66 Shc gene interfering lentivirus vectors, A 549 -p 66 ShcshRNA. The A 549 -p 66 ShcshRNA was transfected into alveolar epithelial cells, and the inhibitive effects on the expression of p 66 Shc were observed. Both RT-PCR and Western blot demonstrated downregulation of p 66 Shc expression in A 549 cells. In the A 549 -p 66 ShcshRNA hyperoxia group, we found dampened oxidative stress. A 549 -p 66 ShcshRNA can cause p 66 Shc gene silencing, reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, reduce membrane potential decrease, reduce the apoptosis of A 549 cells, and reduce alveolar epithelial cell injury, while the lentiviral empty vector group had no such changes. Conclusion: p 66 Shc gene interfering lentivirus vector can affect the alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis induced by hyperoxia.

40|$|In {{response}} to the growing need for functional analysis of the human genome, we have developed a platform for high-throughput functional screening of genes overexpressed from lentiviral vectors. Protein-coding human open reading frames (ORFs) from the Mammalian Gene Collection were transferred into lentiviral expression vector using the highly efficient Gateway recombination cloning. Target ORFs were inserted into the vector downstream of a constitutive promoter and upstream of an IRES controlled GFP reporter, so that their transfection, transduction and expression could be monitored by fluorescence. The expression <b>plasmids</b> and viral <b>packaging</b> <b>plasmids</b> were combined and transfected into 293 T cells to produce virus, which was then used to transduce the screening cell line. We have optimised the transfection and transduction procedures {{so that they can}} be performed using robotic liquid handling systems in arrayed 96 -well microplate, one-gene-per-well format, without the need to concentrate the viral supernatant. Since lentiviruses can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, this system can be used to overexpress human ORFs in a broad spectrum of experimental contexts. We tested the platform in a 1990 gene pilot screen for genes that can increase proliferation of the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line MCF- 10 A after removal of growth factors. Transduced cells were labelled with the nucleoside analogue 5 -ethynyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (EdU) to detect cells progressing through S phase. Hits were identified using high-content imaging and statistical analysis and confirmed with vectors using two different promoters (CMV and EF 1 α). The screen demonstrates the reliability, versatility and utility of our screening platform, and identifies novel cell cycle/proliferative activities for a number of genes...|$|R
40|$|To gain {{further insight}} on the {{function}} of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) packaging signal (a sequence), we constructed a recombinant virus containing a unique a sequence, which was flanked by two loxP sites in parallel orientation. The phenotype of this recombinant, named HSV- 1 LaL, was studied in cell lines which either express or do not express Cre recombinase. Although LaL virus multiplication was only slightly reduced in standard cell lines, its growth was strongly inhibited in Cre-expressing cells. In these cells, a sequences were detected mostly in low-molecular-weight DNA circles, indicating that they had been excised from virus DNA by site-specific recombination. Deletion of the a sequences from the viral genome resulted in the accumulation of uncleaved replication intermediates, as observed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. B-type capsids also accumulated in these cells, as shown both by electron microscopy and by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Further examination of the status of a sequences in Cre-expressing cells indicated that high-level amplification of this sequence can occur {{in the absence of the}} cleavage-packaging process. Moreover, the amplified a signals in small circular DNA molecules remained uncleaved, indicating that these molecules were not able to efficiently interact with the cleavage-packaging machinery. The cleavage-packaging machinery and the structural proteins required to assemble virions were, however, functional in HSV- 1 LaL-infected Cre-expressing cells, since this system could be used to <b>package</b> <b>plasmid</b> DNA harboring an origin of virus replication and one normal a signal. This is the first study in which accumulation both of uncleaved replication intermediates and of B capsids has been obtained in the presence of the full set of proteins required to package virus DNA...|$|R
