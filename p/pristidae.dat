50|$|The {{international}} trade of sawfish was {{banned by the}} CITES convention in June 2007.At the 14th CITES Conference, the Australian delegation proposed an annotation to all species from the family <b>Pristidae</b> to Appendix I. The annotation {{was supported by the}} required two-thirds majority, and allowed P. microdon to be treated as Appendix II “for the exclusive purpose of allowing {{international trade}} in live animals to appropriate and acceptable aquaria for primarily conservation purposes.” The annotation was accepted on the basis that Australian populations of P. microdon are robust relative to other populations in the species' range; and that the capture of individuals for aquaria is likely to be detrimental to the population in any other country than Australia. All trade must be accompanied by an agreement between the exporter, importer, and the Australian CITES Management Authority ensuring that the receiving aquarium has the capacity to house and care for the animal and that display is accompanied by comprehensive educational material.

40|$|The {{description}} of a partial but well preserved head of the sclerorhynchid batoid Sclerorhynchus atavus Woodward 1889 gave the first clear indication {{of the presence of}} a puzzling group of extinct rostrum-bearing rays that resembled both the <b>Pristidae</b> (rays) and the Pristophoridae (sharks). Despite recognizing similarities and differences to these extant groups, Woodward (1889, 1892) suggested that Sclerorhynchus be assigned to the <b>Pristidae,</b> although the rostra are very different. Woodward did note similarities of Sclerorhynchus rostrum saw-teeth to those of the Pristiophoridae, including the location of these along the margin of the rostrum, rather than in deep sockets, as seen along the pristid rostrum. In addition, the type specimen of Sclerorhynchus has very distinct saw-tooth denticles not only along the rostrum, but modified denticles along the sides of the head, as in the Pristiophoridae. The enlarged rostral denticles of Sclerorhynchus also appear to rotate into position, another feature seen in the pristiophorids but not in the pristids, and in other sclerorhynchids such as Libanopristis. Although individual fossil rostral tooth-like denticles had been earlier described, Woodward’s {{description of}} a rostrum and associated rostral tooth-like denticles meant {{that for the first time}} a fossil rostrum could be compared to living forms, highlighting the extreme variation in rostrum saw-tooth morphology among sharks and rays...|$|E

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{characteristic of}} chondrichthyans (e. g. sharks, rays) is their covering of external skin denticles (placoid scales), but less well understood is the wide morphological diversity that these skin denticles can show. Some {{of the more}} unusual of these are the tooth-like structures associated with the elongate cartilaginous rostrum ‘saw’ in three chondrichthyan groups: Pristiophoridae (sawsharks; Selachii), <b>Pristidae</b> (sawfish; Batoidea) and the fossil Sclerorhynchoidea (Batoidea). Comparative topographic and developmental studies of the ‘saw-teeth’ were undertaken in adults and embryos of these groups, by means of three-dimensional-rendered volumes from X-ray computed tomography. This provided data on development and relative arrangement in embryos, with regenerative replacement in adults. Saw-teeth are morphologically similar on the rostra of the Pristiophoridae and the Sclerorhynchoidea, with the same replacement modes, {{despite the lack of}} a close phylogenetic relationship. In both, tooth-like structures develop under the skin of the embryos, aligned with the rostrum surface, before rotating into lateral position and then attaching through a pedicel to the rostrum cartilage. As well, saw-teeth are replaced and added to as space becomes available. By contrast, saw-teeth in <b>Pristidae</b> insert into sockets in the rostrum cartilage, growing continuously and are not replaced. Despite superficial similarity to oral tooth developmental organization, saw-tooth spatial initiation arrangement is associated with rostrum growth. Replacement is space-dependent and more comparable to that of dermal skin denticles. We suggest these saw-teeth represent modified dermal denticles and lack the ‘many-for-one’ replacement characteristic of elasmobranch oral dentitions...|$|E

40|$|Class Elasmobranchii {{represents}} {{a family of}} fishes which have developed {{a wide array of}} adaptations which have allowed the family to survive {{over the course of the}} last 400 million years. Within Class Elasmobranchii, the sawfish (Family <b>Pristidae)</b> represent a family of highly adapted, unique organisms. Family <b>Pristidae,</b> however, also {{represents a}} family of fishes placed in peril, when adaptations which allow for greater hunting capabilities and broader range of habitat place them at significant risk when faced with increased fishing pressure and anthropogenic effects within their natural habitat. Of the six to seven currently recognized extant species of sawfish, the smalltooth sawfish, P. pectinata, and the largetooth sawfish, P. perotteti, are the only two species of sawfish native to North American waters. Their historical ranges extended throughout North America, with areas of greatest abundance in parts of the United States and most of the Caribbean coast of Central America. However, both species have undergone dramatic transitions in population abundance and range over the course of the last century. Incidental capture as bycatch, overexploitation by directed fisheries, increased demand in local and international trade, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic influences have led to severe declines in population abundance and loss of critical nursery habitat, leading both species to be extirpated from the majority of their native habitat and facing the threat of extinction. While essential steps have been taken to protect P. pectinata in U. S. waters, critical protections are yet to be in place to prevent the possible extinction of P. perotteti, as well as further degradation and possible extinction of P. pectinata. This paper will serve as a comprehensive collection of known scientific literature to date for the smalltooth sawfish, Pristis pectinata, and largetooth sawfish, Pristis perotteti, in North American waters.

Biodiversitas 13 : 161 - 171. The pristid sawfishes (<b>Pristidae)</b> are notable {{because of their}} saw- like rostrum and large body size (up to seven meters). All pristids are listed as critically endangered by IUCN, since decreasing population; Nusantara is home for five pristid species, namely: Anoxypristis cuspidata Latham, 1794, Pristis clavata Garman, 1906, Pristis microdon Latham, 1794, Pristis zijsron Bleeker, 1851, and Pristis pectinata Latham, 1794. A. cuspidata differ from Pristid spp. {{by the presence of}} a very narrow rostral saw, with 16 to 29 pairs of teeth except for the part along the quarter of the rostral saw near the head. P. microdon has a highly defined groove that runs along the entire posterior edge of the tooth into and beyond its confluence with the rostrum. This groove is absent in juvenile of P. clavata and whilst it develops in larger individuals it rarely runs along the entire posterior edge of the tooth or reach its confluence with the rostrum. P. clavata possibly have been misidentified as P. pectinata, whose distribution in the Indo-West Pacific is uncertain. P. clavata can be distinguished from P. pectinata and P. zijsron by the possession of fewer rostral teeth (18 to 22 in P. clavata cf. 24 to 28 in P. zijsron and 24 to 34 in P. pectinata), and by its smaller body size (i. e. less than 250 cm TL in P. clavata).

40|$|Origins of the {{vertebrate}} dentition, as a patterned, {{functional unit}} {{associated with the}} jaws, remain contentious. Hypotheses suggest dentitions evolved from external placoid scales, or alternatively, from denticles within the oropharyngeal cavity, with no input from external dermal structures. The latter hypothesis suggests that oral dentitions and scales derive from separate developmental systems, while the former suggests they share a common developmental system. The latter hypothesis implies that oral dentitions are restricted to the oropharygeal cavity, while the former implies heterotopic migration of dermal structures into the mouth. To test these hypotheses, we examined the elongate rostrum (‘saw’) and associated oral dentitions in three chondrichthyan groups: Pristiophoridae (Selachii), <b>Pristidae</b> (Batoidea) and the fossil Sclerorhynchoidea (Batoidea). The rostrum saw of adult and embryonic individuals was investigated via 3 D-rendered, volume density models from x-ray computed tomography, revealing data on topographic position, series size differences, growth stages, progressive mineralization, timing and mode of replacement of the tooth-like structures, all co-located with mineralized embayments of prismatic rostral cartilage. We suggest these structures lack the patterning and replacement characteristic of oral dentitions and instead represent dermally-derived neomorphic structures on the rostrum modified from placoid scales, independent of oral teeth...|$|E

Western Australia has recently been identified as a global hotspot of sawfish diversity, with 4 of the world’s 5 species found here. Most pristids have declined globally, and although the susceptibility of the rostrum (or saw) to entanglement in fishing nets is a major reason that all five species have declined and are listed as either Critically Endangered or Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), other threatening processes have also contributed to their range contractions and rarity. Among these processes are loss of nursery habitats, barriers to migration and reduction in habitat quality as a function of river regulation, targeted fisheries including for cultural purposes and taking of rostra as curios. This project aimed to determine the impact of barriers to sawfish migration in Western Australia, and prioritise the barriers that are likely to have the highest impact in the region. It also summarises work in the Ashburton River and Fitzroy River, each of which offer globally significant habitat to sawfishes.

40|$|Sawfish (family <b>Pristidae)</b> {{are among}} the most {{critically}} endangered marine fish in the world, yet very little is known about how genetic bottlenecks, genetic drift, and inbreeding depression may be affecting these elasmobranchs. In the US Atlantic, the smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) has declined to 1 - 5 % of its abundance in the 1900 s, and its core distribution has contracted to southwest Florida. We used 8 polymorphic microsatellite markers to show that this remnant population still exhibits high genetic diversity in terms of average allelic richness (18. 23), average alleles per locus (18. 75, standard deviation [SD] 6. 6) and observed heterozygosity (0. 43 - 0. 98). Inbreeding is rare (mean individual internal relatedness = - 0. 02, SD 0. 14; FIS = - 0. 011, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 0. 039 to 0. 011), even though the estimated effective population size (Ne) is modest (250 - 350, 95 % CI = 142 - 955). Simulations suggest that the remnant smalltooth sawfish population will probably retain > 90 % of its current genetic diversity over the next century even at the lower estimate of Ne. There is no evidence of a genetic bottleneck accompanying last century's demographic bottleneck, and we discuss hypotheses that could explain this. We also discuss features of elasmobranch life history and population biology that could make them less vulnerable than other large marine vertebrates to genetic change associated with reduced population size.
