2500|$|In {{the days}} of the first British railways, [...] "policemen" [...] were {{employed}} by every railway company. Their jobs were many and varied, but one of their key roles was the giving of hand signals to inform engine drivers as to the state of the line ahead. They had no means of communication with their colleagues along the line, and trains were only protected by a time interval; after a train had passed him, a policeman would stop any following train if it arrived within (say) 5 minutes; for any between 5 and 10 minutes after, he would show a caution signal, and after 10 minutes, the line was assumed to be clear. Therefore, if a train failed midsection (as was very common in the early days), the policeman controlling entry to the section would not know, and could easily give a 'clear' signal to a following train when the section was not in fact clear. The number of collisions which resulted from this led to the gradual introduction of the absolute block principle; all systems of working other than this (including time-interval and <b>permissive</b> <b>block)</b> were outlawed on passenger lines in 1889, and all passenger lines were suitably equipped by 1895.|$|E
50|$|The line at Orgreaves Colliery was quadruple track, {{the centre}} tracks being the Main Lines {{operated}} under Absolute Block regulations, {{and the outer}} lines were designated Goods Lines, and they were worked under <b>Permissive</b> <b>Block</b> regulations. Whereas the Absolute Block System maintains a space interval between trains to prevent collision, the <b>Permissive</b> <b>Block</b> System permits trains to follow one another into a block section without special protection other than a speed restriction, usually of 4 mph.|$|E

50|$|The Absolute Block System was {{implemented}} to prevent train collisions {{by ensuring that}} only one train could be in any railway route section at one time. The <b>Permissive</b> <b>Block</b> System was used in situations where goods and mineral trains needed to close up to previous trains in congested areas, {{but it was in}} general restricted to goods and mineral trains only, and restricted to a speed of 4 mph, and prohibited in foggy conditions. It seems likely that <b>Permissive</b> <b>Block</b> working should not have been in operation {{at the time of the}} Orgreaves collision; and that the Nottingham train should have run sufficiently slowly that it did not collide with the stationary train in front.|$|E

40|$|In a thermoconditional mutant of {{mutagenic}} DNA repair (rev 2 ts = rad 5 - 8) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{recovery of}} survival and mutation frequencies can be monitored by incubating UV-irradiated cells in growth medium at a permissive temperature (23 degrees C) before plating and {{a shift to}} restrictive temperature (36 degrees C). Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide during incubation at <b>permissive</b> conditions <b>blocks</b> this REV 2 dependent recovery process in stationary phase rev 2 ts cells, whereas it can be reduced but not totally abolished in exponentially growing cells. These results indicate a strict dependence on post-irradiation protein synthesis in stationary phase cells and argue for a considerable constitutive level and only limited inducibility in logarithmic phase cells. The UV inducibility of the REV 2 coded function in stationary phase cells could be confirmed by analysis of the dose-response pattern of the his 5 - 2 reversion: in stationary phase rev 2 ts cells, the quadratic component of the biphasic linear-quadratic induction kinetics found at 23 degrees C, which is interpreted as the consequence of induction of mutagenic repair, is eliminated at 36 degrees C...|$|R

40|$|Since 1995 the United States Marine Corps {{has focused}} its {{attention}} on urban warfare. The Marine Corps conceptualizes a Three-Block War. Block One is humanitarian operations in a <b>permissive</b> environment. <b>Block</b> Two is security operations in a questionable environment. Block Three is high intensity combat. The Marine Corps' focus on urban operations is justifiable for two reasons. First, urbanization is increasing at an accelerating rate. Second, urban environments have traditionally acted as an equalizing effect between disparate military forces. The recent battles {{for the city}} of Grozny are the most recent examples. The Marine Corps is presently capable of winning on the first two blocks. Current training methods and tactics, combined with living institutional knowledge, and the frequency of such operations has kept the Marine Corps primed. This is not the case for the third block. The infrequency of such battles, and lack of institutional knowledge, coupled with current training practices, has rendered the Marine Corps woefully deficient in this area. Utilizing the battle for Grozny as a case study, this thesis will prove that current Marine Corps training policies and practices for urban warfare are actually degrading the Marines' capabilities to successfully prosecute high intensity urban combat, and recommend possible solutions[URL] Marine Corps (U.

40|$|Chick muscle {{cultures}} {{infected with}} wild-type Rous sarcoma virus form myotubes, but these myotubes vacuolate and by day 6 most have degenerated, leaving only {{large numbers of}} transformed mononucleated, replicating cells. Muscle cultures infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant (TS) at permissive temperatures behave as cells infected with wild-type Rous sarcoma virus. TS-infected cells reared for 8 days at nonpermissive temperature form contracting myotubes, plus large numbers of fibroblastic cells. If these cultures are lowered to permissive temperature, within 72 hr the myotubes vacuolate and degenerate, whereas the mononucleated cells transform. If replicating TS-transformed cells after 8 days at permissive temperature are shifted to nonpermissive temperature, within 72 hr many cells fuse and form contracting, post-mitotic myotubes. Creatine kinase (ATP:creatine N-phosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 3. 2) levels parallel the formation and degeneration of myotubes during these temperature shifts. If the viral transforming gene is expressed in the post-mitotic myotubes it is lethal, whereas it is not lethal if expressed in replicating percursor myogenic cells. The viral gene expression at <b>permissive</b> temperature <b>blocks</b> further myogenesis depending on {{the position of the}} cells in the myogenic program. The virus does not cancel the replicating, transformed myogenic cells' commitment to, or position in, the myogenic lineage. When the transforming action of the virus is suppressed, the normal myogenic program resumes...|$|R
40|$|The Cln 3 cyclin homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{functions}} to promote cell cycle START {{for only a}} short time following its synthesis. Cln 3 protein is highly unstable and is stabilized by C-terminal truncation. Cln 3 binds to Cdc 28, a protein kinase catalytic subunit essential for cell cycle START, and Cln 3 instability requires Cdc 28 activity. The long functional lifetime and the hyperactivity of C-terminally truncated Cln 3 (Cln 3 - 2) relative to those of full-length Cln 3 are affected by mutations in CDC 28 : the functional lifetime of Cln 3 - 2 is drastically reduced by the cdc 28 - 13 mutation at the permissive temperature, and the cdc 28 - 4 mutation at the <b>permissive</b> temperature completely <b>blocks</b> the function of Cln 3 - 2 while only partially reducing the function of full-length Cln 3. Thus, sequences in the C-terminal third of Cln 3 might help stabilize functional Cdc 28 -Cln 3 association, as well as decreasing the lifetime of the Cln 3 protein. These and other results strongly support the idea that Cln proteins function to activate Cdc 28 at START...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} {{and duration of}} host responses are determined by protective mechanisms that control tissue injury by dampening down inflammation. Adenosine generation and consequent effects, mediated via A 2 A adenosine receptors (A 2 AR) on effector cells, {{play a critical role}} in the pathophysiological modulation of these responses in vivo. Adenosine is both released by hypoxic cells/tissues and is also generated from extracellular nucleotides by ecto-enzymes e. g. CD 39 (ENTPD 1) and CD 73 that are expressed by the vasculature and immune cells, in particular by T regulatory cell. In general, these adenosinergic mechanisms minimize the extent of collateral damage to host tissues during the course of inflammatory reactions. However, induction of suppressive pathways might also cause escape of pathogens and permit dissemination. In addition, adenosinergic responses may inhibit immune responses while enhancing vascular angiogenic responses to malignant cells that promote tumor growth. Novel drugs that block A 2 AR-adenosinergic effects and/or adenosine generation have the potential to boost pathogen destruction and to selectively destroy malignant tissues. In the latter instance, future treatment modalities might include novel ‘anti-adenosinergic' approaches that augment immune clearance of malignant cells and <b>block</b> <b>permissive</b> angiogenesis. This review addresses several possible pharmacological modalities to block adenosinergic pathways and speculates on their future application together with impacts on human disease...|$|R

50|$|At about 5 a.m. on 13 December 1926 the Orgreaves Colliery {{signalman}} had the 2.50 a.m. Mexborough to Woodford goods train, {{consisting of}} around 40 wagons, mostly empty, {{standing on the}} Up Goods Line at his home signal, waiting for clearance forward. He accepted the 1.15 a.m. Dewsnap to Nottingham goods train from Darnall West on the Up Goods Line under the <b>Permissive</b> <b>Block</b> regulations.

40|$|Blockade of large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) {{channels}} by {{the bulky}} quaternary ammonium compound, N-(4 -[benzoyl]benzyl) -N,N,N-tributylammonium (bbTBA), exhibits features consistent with blockade of both closed and open states. Here, we examine block of closed BK channels by bbTBA {{and how it}} may differ from block of open channels. Although our observations generally confirm earlier results, we describe three observations that are inconsistent with a model in which closed and open channels are equally accessible to blockade by bbTBA. First, block by bbTBA exhibits Ca 2 +-dependent features that are inconsistent with strictly state-independent block. Second, the steady-state voltage dependence of bbTBA block at negative potentials shows that any block of completely closed states either does not occur or is completely voltage independent. Third, determination of the fractional unblock by bbTBA at either low or high Ca 2 + reveals deviations from a model in which open- and closed-state block is identical. The results {{support the view that}} bbTBA blockade of fully closed channels does not occur. We imagine two general types of explanation. First, a stronger voltage dependence of closed-channel block may minimize the contribution of closed-channel block at negative potentials. Second, voltage-dependent conformational changes among closed-channel states may permit block by bbTBA. The analysis supports the latter view, suggesting that bbTBA blockade of fully closed channels does not occur, but the ability of bbTBA to block a closed channel requires movement of one or more voltage sensors. Models in which block is coupled to voltage sensor movement can qualitatively account for (1) the ability of open-channel block to better fit block of conductance–voltage curves at high Ca 2 +; (2) the voltage dependence of fractional availability; and (3) the fractional unblock at different open probabilities. BK channels appear to undergo voltage-dependent conformational changes among closed states that are <b>permissive</b> for bbTBA <b>block...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Permissive</b> <b>block</b> working {{may also}} be used in an emergency, either when a driver is unable to contact a {{signalman}} after being held at a danger signal for a specific time, although this is only permitted when the signal does not protect any conflicting moves, and also when the signalman is unable to contact the next signal box {{to make sure the}} previous train has passed, for example if the telegraph wires are down. In these cases, trains must proceed at very low speed (typically 20 mph or less) so that they are able to stop short of any obstruction. In most cases this is not allowed during times of poor visibility (e.g., fog or falling snow).|$|E
50|$|Several {{systems were}} {{implemented}} as {{a hybrid of}} bi-directional ABS and signaling systems with traffic control functions. Most of these fell along the general heading of absolute <b>permissive</b> <b>block,</b> where a typical bi-directional ABS would be outfitted with signaled passing points, with absolute signals protecting the next segment of single track. Trains wishing to enter the single track segment would be automatically detected at the passing point and if the segment was free from opposing movements, signaled to proceed. Trains wishing to enter {{in the opposite direction}} would be held until the entire segment was again clear of opposing traffic. Trains working under such a system would tend to still follow the bi-directional ABS rules although without the risk of trains meeting head-on.|$|E
5000|$|Petone {{had one of}} {{the last}} {{operational}} standalone signal boxes in New Zealand. The electric relay-based signal box on the south of the station was built in 1952 to replace the old 1905 mechanical signal box north of the station. It controlled the Melling Branch and its junction north of the station, and was usually only manned while Melling Line trains is in operation (i.e. between 6:00 am and 7:00 pm, Monday to Friday). It was occasionally manned in the evenings and at weekends when a block of line existed beyond the station, operating the crossovers to switch trains for their return journey. At other times when the Melling Line was closed, the box was switched out and the absolute interlocking (manual) signals between south of Petone and Ava protecting the junction became <b>permissive</b> <b>block</b> (automatic) signals by the presence of an [...] "A" [...] light on each signal.|$|E

50|$|The {{line from}} Fort Wayne east to Alliance {{was not as}} favored in the Conrail system as the {{duplicate}} New York Central lines, and during rationalization efforts {{that took place in}} the early 1980s, this section of the Fort Wayne line changed in importance. Traffic heading from Pittsburgh to Chicago was routed onto the Cleveland Line at Alliance, while traffic towards Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis and St. Louis was routed onto the former New York Central Big Four line at Crestline. The remainder of the line west of Crestline was reduced to a single track with passing sidings. The route's automatic block signals were downgraded to an absolute <b>permissive</b> <b>block</b> system with home signals at passing sidings and diamonds. This route was used by Amtrak's Capitol Limited until the early 1990s, when the train was rerouted via the CSX Chicago line and then eventually rerouted again onto the eastern half of the Fort Wayne line to Alliance. After the end of Amtrak service on the western end of the Fort Wayne line, all intermediate signals west of Crestline were taken out of service, and the route transitioned into being run by track warrant control. Conrail built a RoadRailer facility just west of Crestline, taking advantage of the light traffic on the Fort Wayne line, and Crestline's proximity to U.S. Routes 23 and 30. This facility was closed during the Conrail split.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of CTC {{there were a number}} of {{solutions}} to this problem that did not require the construction of multiple single direction tracks. Many western railroads used an automatic system called absolute <b>permissive</b> <b>block</b> (APB), where trains entering a stretch of single track would cause all of the opposing signals between there and the next passing point to [...] "tumble down" [...] to a Stop position thus preventing opposing trains from entering. In areas of higher traffic density, sometimes bi-directional operation would be established between manned interlocking towers. Each section of bi-directional track would have a traffic control lever associated with it to establish the direction of traffic on that track. Often, both towers would need to set their traffic levers in the same way before a direction of travel could be established. Block signals in the direction of travel would display according to track conditions and signals against the flow of traffic would always be set to their most restrictive aspect. Furthermore, no train could be routed into a section of track against its flow of traffic and the traffic levers would not be able to be changed until the track section was clear of trains. Both APB and manual traffic control would still require train orders in certain situations, and both required trade-offs between human operators and granularity of routing control.|$|E
50|$|New South Wales {{signalling}} systems generally follow British precepts, however American {{influence has}} increased somewhat since the 1990s. Originally trains {{ran on the}} time-interval system and authority of the timetable. From the early 1870s, several near-misses and minor derailments led to serious discussion of improved safe-working arrangements and the implementation of interlocking. Despite this, very little action was taken until 1877, when a new rule book including the Staff & Ticket and Block Telegraph systems was finally printed. The ink was barely dry on 30 January 1878 when two trains collided head-on at Emu Plains, killing three. This {{put an end to}} timetable working on single lines. Absolute Block Telegraph for double lines came in 1879, Saxby & Farmer's mechanical interlocking in 1881, Tyer's Electric Tablet in 1888 (lasting until 1959) and the Electric Staff system in 1891. Tyer's One-Wire Block began to replace the original Preece's Patent instruments from 1891. Sykes' Lock & Block was used on a few suburban sections from 1900. Tyer's Three-Wire Block was used for <b>permissive</b> <b>block</b> working on the Up Relief line from Concord West to North Strathfield Junction from 1911 until 1983. In 1913, the two-wire New South Wales Standard Block, which was similar in principle to Lock & Block, became the standard for new installations. It was unique in having a fourth position, known as Train Arrived, and a different sequence of operation to standard British arrangements. The last of these instruments were removed from Exeter, Bundanoon and Wingello on the Main South line in 2007. By 1907, the majority of signalling equipment, including signals and mechanical lever frames, were being manufactured in-house {{under the direction of the}} English-born signal engineer, Mr C.L.N.F. Wilkin. The NSWR Signal Engineer's Branch supplanted McKenzie & Holland as the principal supplier in most installations.|$|E
