40|$|A {{measurement}} method {{for determining the}} temperature profile over the thickness of a semi-transparent plate has been investigated. The method has been analysed for <b>polycarbonate</b> (<b>CD),</b> Philips 382 cone glass and Philips 441 screen glass. The method uses a non-contacting detector which measures the infrared radiation emitted by the plate at few wavelengths. In thermal processing, a parabolic temperature profile occurs typically during stationnary cooling and heating. The programs I've built optimize 3 wavelengths to determine such a parabolic temperature profile and calculate the most likely temperature parabola and its variance from future radiance measurements at those optimized 3 wavelengths...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{lifetime}} and gravimetric measurements of iodine sorption and diffusion behaviour in electron-irradiated polycarbonate and un-irradiated polycarbonate are investigated. The increase in ortho-positronium lifetime on electron-irradiation shows that scission of carbonate {{groups in the}} main-chain and formation of free radicals is the predominant process. The UV absorption measurement supports this. The free volume in polycarbonate after electron-irradiation seems to be not composed of independent pores but of interconnected channels. The positron results on iodine diffusion in un-irradiated polycarbonate shows a slower diffusion rate, whereas in electron-irradiated polycarbonate faster diffusion is observed. The gravimetric measurement of iodine diffusion attains an early saturation in electron-irradiated polycarbonate as compared to un-irradiated polycarbonate although {{in both cases the}} diffusion is nearly Fickian. An exponential type of correlation has been observed between fractional free volume and diffusion coefficient validating Fujita's free volume theory for un-irradiated and electron-irradiated <b>polycarbonate.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

A resistive phase-slip center appears {{as a response to}} a pulse of supercritical current. Measuring its resistance, and its time of nucleation, gives access to the electron inelastic lifetime, and to the gap relaxation time, respectively, both in the nanosecond range. Finally, the threshold current for passage into the fully normal state indicates a good thermal contact with the <b>polycarbonate</b> matrix. (<b>C)</b> 2004 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|He {{put away}} the soma bottle, and taking out a packet of sex-hormone chewing-gum, stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away ” (Brave New World, Aldous Huxley, 1932, p. 60). Canada has just {{declared}} bisphenol A to be a toxic substance (Government of Canada, 2008). Which is odd considering that, as I write, all the baby bottles for sale in this town are made from bisphenol A. Well, maybe there is a glass baby bottle for sale, but if there is, I didn’t nd it. Canada has responded to the accumulating evidence that bisphenol A, (also known as BPA), leaches from polycarbonate baby bottles and behaves like an estrogen. And an extra dose of female sex hormones {{is not necessarily the}} best of dietary supplements for babies, either male or female; or for teenagers, or even adults. Canada is the rst country in the world to act to banish bisphenol A from the nursery (Nature, 2008). The regulations to implement the ban are currently being drafted and it is expected they will be in place in 2009 (Health Canada, 2008). Canada leads the world in announcing its new regulations: “to prohibit the importation, sale and advertising of polycarbonate baby bottles that contain bisphenol A (BPA). The Canadian Government will also take action to limit the amount of bisphenol A that is being released into the environment ” (Health Canada, 2008). Those cute baby bottles in the pharmacy printed with nursery cartoon characters are made of polycarbonate. “Polycarbonate plastic has been the material of choice for baby bottles and reusable water bottles for decades because it’s lightweight, highly shatter resistant, and transparent ” (Clement, 2008). Yes, these bottles are light, strong, clear, rigid, nearly unbreakable; and that’s all good. Bisphenol A is the monomer- the chemical building block- that goes to build the polymer, polycarbonate, of which these bottles are made, (mono = one; poly = many). <b>Polycarbonate,</b> (<b>C</b> 16 H 14 O 3) n, is a polymer of bisphenol A, (C 15 H 16 O 2).

40|$|The {{suitability}} of various building types and roof cover materials for growth of export tomatoes was tested at the Besor Experiment Station {{in the western}} Negev of Israel. The buildings studied were of the Dutch Venlo and Israeli Sharsheret types. The roof-cover materials tested were glass, polyethylene (P. E.), fiberglass (E. G.) and <b>polycarbonate</b> (P. <b>C.).</b> The climatic conditions created in the P. E. -covered building caused fruit deformation {{and a decrease in}} quality, probably because of the low night temperatures compared with the other buildings. The conditions in the P. C. -covered building caused a decrease in fruit yield and quality, especially when production was at its highest rate in the other buildings. The low yields were probably due to the lower radiation levels under this cover. The Sharsheret greenhouse with a glass-covered roof seemed to be the most suitable for tomatoes, although the other constructions tested may be used as well. The type of building and the roof cover materials should be selected according to economic considerations...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, silicon, glass, silicon dioxide, {{silicon nitride}} and so on, {{employed}} as bulk materials or thin films, represent {{the most commonly}} used materials for MEMS applications within the automotive, biomedicine, spatial industries and so forth. This work is a study regarding the influence of substrate nature on the mechanical properties of silver thin films elaborated for MEMS devices. The silver thin films were obtained by thermal evaporation method under vacuum protection on three different substrates. Glass, plastic (<b>polycarbonate)</b> and steel (<b>C</b> 45) respectively are the materials used for the substrates. Further, atomic force microscopy investigations were performed on the elaborated samples in order to characterize them at a nanoscale and establish substrates influence. The Young’s modulus, nanohardness and roughness of the researched samples are the characteristics that were determined. A significant influence of substrate nature on the properties mentioned above for the studied silver thin films was marked out...|$|R
40|$|Background: Guidelines advise weekly {{cleansing}} of spacers, {{with one}} of the reasons being to prevent the spacers from becoming colonized with respiratory pathogens. Earlier work in clinical settings showed conflicting results. Methods: Common respiratory pathogens and Candida albicans were applied on Petri dishes with and without inhaled corticosteroids and in 3 brands of spacer devices, with and without inhaled corticosteroids. Growth was measured. Results: After 24 hours, Staphylococcus aureus grew in 7 of 18 spacers (39 %); Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew in 12 out of 18 spacers (67 %); and C albicans survived in 5 of 18 spacers (28 %). Microorganisms survived on Petri dishes with fluticasone and beclomethasone but not when budesonide was applied. One out of 30 metal Nebuhalers (3 %) was colonized after 24 hours, whereas of 30 Volumatics 3 (27 %) and Aerochambers, 17 (57 %) still had viable microorganisms. Application of inhaled steroids did not affect growth in the spacers. Conclusion: The colonization of metal spacers is lower than of spacers made of <b>polycarbonate</b> or polyethylene. <b>C</b> albicans cart survive in spacers. The survival of microorganisms in spacers is not influenced by inhaled corticosteroids. Copyright (c) 2009 by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Six-membered cyclic carbonates are {{potential}} monomers for aliphatic polycarbonates and polyurethanes {{in a process}} without using toxic phosgene and isocyanate. Lipase catalyzed transesterification of the polyol, trimethylolpropane (TMP) with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) or diethyl carbonate (DEC) followed by thermal cyclization was used for synthesis of six-membered cyclic carbonates with pendant hydroxyl and alkoxycarbonyloxyl groups. Immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozym (R) 435) {{was used as the}} catalyst. Mixture of a hydrophilic solvent such as THF for high solubility of TMP, and a hydrophobic solvent such as toluene, were selected as the best solvent system for achieving high substrate conversion and selectivity. A relationship between polyol conversion and solvent hydrophobicity (log P) and solvent type, respectively, was established. THF:toluene system at a ratio of 0. 5 : 1. 0 (v/v) provided high degree of TMP conversion to product with high proportion of cyclic carbonates (> 80 %). The cyclic carbonate with pendant hydroxyl group was obtained with almost 85 % selectivity at TMP conversion of 68. 6 % using 10 % (w/w) Novozym (R) 435 at TMP:DMC ratio of 1 : 1. However, at TMP:DMC ratio of 1 : 5 and the same biocatalyst concentration, the TMP conversion was 100 % with 72 % selectivity for the cyclic carbonate with pendant alkoxycarbonyloxyl group. The product formed was without or with less content of linear carbonates, bis and tris(methoxycarbonyloxy) -TMP, as compared to that in a solvent-free system. The reactivity of DEC was lower than that of DMC. The reaction pathway leading to the formation of cyclic carbonate in this process comprised enzymatic carbonation of TMP with alkylcarbonates and thermal cyclization of linear carbonates. The process affords high degree of conversion of polyol to cyclic carbonates and provides a potentially attractive synthetic route for monomers of <b>polycarbonates</b> and polyurethanes.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} heterodinuclear and homodinuclear catalysts and the in depth investigations carried out when using these catalysts for the ring opening copolymerisation of epoxide/CO 2 or epoxide/anhydride to generate polycarbonates or polyesters, respectively. Chapter 2 reports the kinetic and mechanistic studies carried out for cyclohexene oxide/CO 2 copolymerisation reactions. Several di-magnesium catalysts bearing a symmetrical N 4 O 2 macrocyclic ligand and different co-ligands (acetate, trifluoroacetate, benzoate, aryl oxide and bromide) were explored. These investigations revealed that both metal centres of the catalyst {{are involved in the}} copolymerisation reaction and that the rate determining step {{is likely to be the}} carbonate attack on the metal bound epoxide. CO 2 insertion is relatively fast. Additionally, there seems to be a co-ligand effect on the rate of copolymerisation, with an optimum activity observed with the acetate co-ligand. These findings support the hypothesis that one co-ligand remains bound to the catalyst during copolymerisation reactions. Chapter 3 {{describes the}} synthesis of a Zn-Mg heterodinuclear catalyst, albeit as a mixture with di-zinc and di-magnesium catalysts. However, this mixed catalyst system has an improved activity in cyclohexene oxide or propylene oxide/CO 2 copolymerisation reactions, compared to the di-zinc and di-magnesium counterparts alone or in combination. This suggests that the heterodinuclear catalyst promotes the enhanced activity observed with the mixed catalyst system. Furthermore, this mixed catalyst system has enabled the selective formation of ??,??-di-hydroxyl end-capped polycarbonate chains, which can be used in polyurethane synthesis. Additionally, two asymmetrical di-zinc complexes and an asymmetrical Zn-Mg complex have been synthesised and fully characterised. Chapter 4 shows that the di-magnesium and di-zinc catalysts previously reported by our group, for epoxide/CO 2 copolymerisations, are also active in cyclohexene oxide/phthalic anhydride copolymerisation reactions. The di-magnesium catalyst is four times faster than the di-zinc derivative. These homodinuclear catalysts were used in terpolymerisation reactions of epoxide/anhydride/CO 2, to form block copoly(ester-carbonates), which have significantly higher Tg values (?? 90 ??C) compared to polyester and <b>polycarbonate</b> chains (?? 85 ??<b>C).</b> Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Our data, {{as part of}} the OISO (Ocean Indien Service d'Observation) campaign, {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding of}} the physical and biological factors controlling N 2 fixation in the Southern Indian Ocean and the French Southern and Antarctic lands during Austral summer January and February 2017. We measured N 2 and C fixation as well as NH 4 + and NO 3 - assimilation in 3 - 6 replicates per station. Additionally, we measured diagnostic pigment concentrations to evaluate phtosynthetic community composition. For pigment analysis 4 L water was filtered through 25 mm Whatman GF/F filters (pressure drop < 10 kPa). Samples were stored at - 80 °C until analysis. Pigments were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Pigment concentration were calculated according to Kilias et al (2013, doi: 10. 1111 /jpy. 12109). N 2 fixation experiments were carried out in three to six replicates for each station. Incubations were done in pre-acid washed polycarbonate bottles on deck with ambient light conditions. All polycarbonate incubation bottles were rinsed with deionized water, and seawater prior to incubation. We used the combination of the bubble approach (Montoya et al., 1996) and the dissolution method (Mohr et al., 2010, doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0012583) proposed by Klawonn et al. (2015, doi: 10. 3389 /fmicb. 2015. 00769). Bottles were filled up to capacity to avoid air contamination. Incubations were initialized by adding a 10 ml 15 - 15 N gas bubble. Bottles were gently rocked for 15 minutes. Finally, the remaining bubble was removed to avoid equilibration between gas and aqueous phase. after 24 hours a water subsample was taken to a 12 ml exetainer and preserved with 100 µl HgCl 2 solution for later determination of exact 15 N- 15 N concentration. Natural 15 N 2 was determined using Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MIMS; GAM 200, IPI) for each station. Analysis of 15 N 2 incorporated was carried out by the Isotopic Laboratory at the UC Davis, California campus. We used stable isotope tracers (15 N) to measure dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) assimilation rates. Experiments were initiated by adding a known concentration of 0. 05 of K 15 NO 3 and 15 NH 4 Cl for oligotrophic waters of the IO and 0. 625 µmol L- 1 for HNLC regions in the ACC and PF (Knap et al., 1994, Waite et al., 2007, doi: 10. 1016 /j. dsr 2. 2006. 12. 010) to one litre <b>polycarbonate</b> bottles. For <b>C</b> assimilation experiments, we added 20 µmol L- 1 of NaH 13 CO 3 to one of each of N 2 fixation, NH 4 + and NO 3 - assimilation experiment bottles. For incubation, we followed the same procedure as for N 2 fixation experiments. Findings reveal that N 2 fixation occurs throughout the whole sampling area up to 55 °S latitude. In addition, variations of N 2 fiaxation rates between replicates were relatively high indicating a great heterogeneity of the French Southern and Antarctic waters.
