During {{the filming of}} the Beatles' first feature film, A Hard Day's Night, Evans {{appeared in}} a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else. In Help!, Evans played a confused channel swimmer who <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> through an ice-hole in Austria, and {{on a beach in}} the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in the Magical Mystery Tour film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which they were told to paint the Magical Mystery Tour logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.|$|E

40|$|Purpose -This {{commentary}} paper {{outlines the}} origins {{and nature of the}} <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality phenomenon, provides a range of illustrative examples of the variety and characteristics of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality ventures within the UK and offers some reflections on the impact of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality outlets and on the future of such ventures within the hospitality industry. Design/Methodology/Approach -The paper begins with a brief review of the <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality phenomenon and of experiential marketing and this is followed by an illustrative review of the range of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> restaurants, bars and hotels within the UK. The information on for the paper is drawn from the corporate websites of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality operators and agencies and on face-to-face discussions with hospitality <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> operators. Findings – The paper reveals that <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality ventures have been developed in a variety of formats and locations within the UK. A number of factors have driven the development of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality ventures including providing entrepreneurs with relatively low cost opportunities to market test their ideas, skills and expertise and potentially to build their brand and provision of opportunities for customers to develop relationships with these entrepreneurs, with the food and drink they offer and with other customers often in an innovative environment. Many <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> ventures have actively embraced experiential marketing and as such, they can be seen to offer new approaches to marketing within the hospitality industry. Originality/Value – The paper provides an accessible review of the variety of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> hospitality ventures within the UK and as such will interest professionals in the hospitality industry as well as academics and students interested in contemporary hospitality management...|$|R

25|$|Unlike the American {{version of}} The Thing {{released}} on Blu-ray, the European version features {{most of the}} extras from the 1998 and 2005 DVD releases. These extras include the documentary The Thing: Terror Takes Shape although several extras, most notably the alternate ending, were not included. The Blu-ray version also includes various Blu-ray-only features, such as a HD version of the film (although the extras are still presented in 480i/p, depending on the extra) {{as well as a}} picture-in-picture mode that <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> at various points of the film.

25|$|The setting {{has been}} heavily updated from its last event book series, Firestorm, which covered {{the opening of}} the Fourth Corporate War.

An example that <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> in Pondsmith's demos at conventions, releases on the Internet, and in the finished game is that history has become so corrupted that many people in the world now believe Richard Nixon, instead of resigning over Watergate, committed suicide on camera and that memes such as the moon landing being hoaxed become prevalent.|$|E
40|$|Purpose -This {{commentary}} paper {{outlines the}} origins {{and nature of the}} <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> retail phenomenon, examines the development and characteristics of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shops within the UK and offers some reflections on the impact of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shops within the UK’s town and city centres and on the role of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shops within the wider retail economy. Design/Methodology/Approach -The paper begins with a brief review of the <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> retail phenomenon and this is followed by an examination of the development and characteristics of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shops in the UK. The information on which the paper is based is drawn from the corporate websites of <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shop operators and property management companies and agencies. Findings – The paper reveals that <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shops have been developed in a variety of formats and locations within the UK and a number of factors driving <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shop development are identified including high retail vacancy rates in shopping centres, relaxations in planning regulations, the opportunity for retailers and entrepreneurs to market test products and brands and changes in customer behaviour and consumer culture. Looking to the future <b>pop</b> <b>up</b> shops may make but a small physical contribution to increasing the number of retail units on the High Street but by enhancing the experiential environment for consumers they may make an important contribution to the quality of shopping.

25|$|Windows {{specific}} compiler {{support is}} also needed for Structured Exception Handling (SEH). This system serves two purposes: {{it provides a}} substrate on which language-specific exception handling can be implemented, and it is how the kernel notifies applications of exceptional conditions such as dereferencing an invalid pointer or stack overflow. The Microsoft/Borland C++ compilers {{had the ability to}} use this system {{as soon as it was}} introduced in Windows 95 and NT, however the actual implementation was undocumented and had to be reverse engineered for the Wine project and free compilers. SEH is based on pushing exception handler frames onto the stack, then adding them to a linked list stored in thread local storage (the first field of the thread environment block). When an exception is thrown, the kernel and base libraries unwind the stack running handlers and filters as they are encountered. Eventually, every exception unhandled by the application will be dealt with by the default backstop handler, which <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> the Windows common crash dialog.|$|E
500|$|During the film's end credits, a {{diaporama}} <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> {{on screen}} suggesting to viewers things at home {{they can do}} to combat global warming, including [...] "recycle", [...] "speak up in your community", [...] "try to buy a hybrid vehicle" [...] and [...] "encourage everyone you know to watch this movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} black {{employee}} Martin Nash (Wayne Wilderson) {{is a former}} criminal, and tells the entire office. During this time, in a misguided effort to avoid issues of stereotyping and racism Michael asks the employees to name a white person that they trust and he will name a black person he trusts even more. The name Jesus <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> and Michael replies with Apollo Creed. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) encourages Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to pursue Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes. Later, Andy strums [...] "The Rainbow Connection" [...] on his banjo while singing falsetto. Pam smiles politely and silently shares the joke with Jim.|$|E
500|$|The Greek Magical Papyri (PGM) reflect Greco-Egyptian syncretism, {{incorporating}} {{not only}} Egyptian and Hellenistic religion, but Near Eastern elements, including Jewish magic and dashes of Christian magic. Egyptian and Greek deities, the God of the Jews and Judaic angels, and Jesus are named. The PGM are written primarily in Greek with substantial passages in Demotic Egyptian and inserted strings of syllables that are [...] "pronounceable, though unintelligible". These voces magicae ("magic words") occur throughout magic texts and inscriptions, and often suggest corrupt Coptic or Egyptian, Hebrew, Aramaic or other Semitic languages, and Celtic. [...] Hebrew and Greek appear in Demotic magical texts; Coptic magic incorporates Hebrew; Egyptian <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> in Latin spells. While many voces magicae may be deliberate neologisms or obscurantism, scholars have theorized {{that the more}} recognizable passages may be the products of garbled or misunderstood transmission, either in copying a source text or transcribing oral material.|$|E
500|$|Cody Miller of PopMatters was {{positive}} regarding the song, writing: [...] "When a real hook <b>pops</b> <b>up,</b> as on 'Remember December', Lovato really bites into it, belting and howling with enough melodrama and bravado to actually make one believe [...] lines." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy named the track the fifth best song of 2009, calling it [...] "the strongest and best" [...] on Here We Go Again. Anitai wrote, [...] "'Remember December' {{is a serious}} standout that quickly makes it point with Demi behind the wheel – seriously speeding – the whole time. It's the perfect showcase for Demi's way-beyond-her-years vocals and ability to sell a song without sugar-coating it." [...] In a more mixed review, Nick Levine of Digital Spy awarded it three out of five stars and said that it lacked [...] "original ideas", but said that it [...] "does {{at least have a}} decent chorus". Levine called it a [...] "Veronicas-lite pop-rock stomper" [...] and praised Lovato's vocals.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone {{appreciated}} André 3000's {{performance and}} the song itself, writing: [...] "André 3000 is sharp and effortlessly charismatic on his rapped verse, but the real attraction here is the track itself." [...] Similarly, David Amidon of PopMatters commented that the song features [...] "one of those rare 'look how effortless rapping is for me'." [...] This was echoed by Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media, who wrote that [...] " [...] carefree retro sensibility <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> on three more highlights, including 'Party', which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, [...] while its bounce provides prime summer barbecue background." [...] Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was also positive: [...] "'Party' sounds right out of The SOS Band's catalog (its plodding tempo {{is the only thing}} that lets you know she isn't quoting a particularly poetic, desperately meth-seeking craigslist m4m ad [...] )". Jon Caramainca of The New York Times wrote that Beyoncé sings the song [...] "in her best impression of naughtiness." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the minimal production and simplistic lyrics of [...] "Party" [...] further describing the song as being as [...] "simple as a Beyoncé song gets: a low-key, synth-y beat paired with inspired vocals by Beyoncé and a killer, fluid verse by Mr. Benjamin [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{dismissal}} raises tension at the Simpson household, with Homer and Marge {{siding with}} Lisa and Bart, respectively. Homer believes that Lisa {{needs to do}} what is good to the team, while Marge thinks she should reconsider, since the family comes first. Under Lisa's leadership, the team advances to the championship against Capital City. On the day of the game, Marge takes Bart to an amusement park; while they ride the roller coaster, Lisa calls Bart to beg for his help, but he brushes her off. Mike Scioscia, manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, <b>pops</b> <b>up</b> in the seats behind Marge and Bart and tells him that the best players listen to their managers, pointing out his three World Series wins [...] two as player, one as manager. Marge takes Bart to the game, which is now in its last inning with the Isotots down 11-10. Bart puts aside his differences with Lisa and offers to pinch-run from first base, then ignores her signs and steals both second and third. As he begins to steal home, Lisa realizes the odds are vastly against him, then decides to ignore the numbers and cheer him on anyway. He is tagged out at the plate, costing the Isotots their championship bid, but Lisa thanks him for helping her learn to love baseball as a game, and the team cheers them for resolving their differences.|$|E
