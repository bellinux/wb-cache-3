40|$|In {{the past}} 80  years, the Grønfjord Glacier front retreated for a {{distance}} longer than 2. 5  km, and thus, {{a big part}} of the proglacial zone became free of ice. The detailed geomorphological survey of this zone made pos‑ sible to identify the following landforms: exaration-glacial, glacial-accumulative, exaration-extrusive, pushmoraine (thrusting), fluvioglacial and limnoglacial ones. Geomorphological analysis of the forms indicat‑ ing the Grønfjord Glacier movement and degradation allowed establishing its dynamics over the last glacial cycle. The river running from the moraine-dammed lake erodes a great thickness of a <b>push-moraine</b> (up to 20 ‑ 25   m) which is composed by marine sediments, accumulated on the site of the present-day proglacial zone under a relatively higher sea level than now. Careful investigation of lithology and stratigraphy of the <b>push-moraine</b> together with radiocarbon dating of marine shells resulted in determination of chronology of the main sedimentation stages during the Holocene within area of the present-day proglacial zone. During the reconstruction evidences of only two stages of the significant Grønfjord Glacier advance were revealed: in the early Holocene (9. 5 ‑ 10  thousand years ago) and in the little ice age (before beginning of XX century), with the maximum advance at the last stage. Basing on the results of the reconstruction the suggestion had been made that during the little ice age the Grønfjord Glacier was a surging one...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} structural glaciological study {{carried out}} on Kvíárjökull in SE Iceland reveals that recent flow within this maritime glacier is concentrated within a narrow corridor located along its central axis. This active corridor is responsible for feeding ice from the accumulation zone on the south-eastern side of Öræfajökull to the lower reaches of the glacier and resulted in a c. 200 m advance during the winter of 2013 – 2014 and the formation of a <b>push-moraine.</b> The corridor comprises a series of lobes linked by a laterally continuous zone of highly fractured ice characterised by prominent flow-parallel crevasses, separated by shear zones. The lobes form highly crevassed topographic highs on the glacier surface and occur immediately down-ice of marked constrictions caused by prominent bedrock outcrops located on the northern side of the glacier. Close to the frontal margin of Kvíárjökull, the southern side of the glacier is relatively smooth and pock-marked by a number of large moulins. The boundary between this slow moving ice and the active corridor is marked by a number of ice flow-parallel strike-slip faults and a prominent dextral shear zone which resulted in the clockwise rotation and dissection of an ice-cored esker exposed on the glacier surface. It is suggested that this concentrated style of glacier flow identified within Kvíárjökull has affinities with the individual flow units which operate within pulsing or surging glacier...|$|E
40|$|There {{is ample}} field {{evidence}} that the deformation of glacial sediment {{in the front of}} advancing glaciers produces distinct compressional features that are comparable to those in tectonic foldbelts. Like the deformation that occurs in thin-skinned contractional belts, glaciotectonic push moraines often possess an arcuate shape. In order to understand how glaciotectonic ridges are formed, and to provide a basis for comparison with field observations, it is essential to model this environment in the laboratory. By appropriately scaling the mechanics and composition of the push moraine, a laboratory model can encompass the basic physics that control the formation of glacial ridges and also allow the calculation of strain orientations resulting from their formation. Figure 1 Map of the Stony Brook area Harbor Hill Moraine. The hills are anticlines and the <b>push-moraine</b> has a non-linear, but rather arcuate shape. Push moraines (and foldbelts) are commonly found to have a lobate, arcuate shape: Figure 1 shows such a lobe in the Stony Brook area of the Harbor Hill moraine. It is reasonable to assume that the style of deformation associated with building such a push moraine will depend upon the conditions within and in front of the glacier. A relatively rigid, high yield-strength glacier/sediment mass can be assumed to advance with relatively little gravitational spreading in the direction of its lateral flanks, with finite strai...|$|E
40|$|Examination of bore-holes, test pitting and {{surficial}} {{mapping of}} one hiII {{belonging to the}} group of smooth, elongated hills by Schonhorst, Schleswig-Holstein reveals three geological units: the lower, fine-grained, massive and compact till; the glaciofluvial sand; and the upper, coarse-grained, compact tiII with minute stringers and lenses of sand and silt. The sequence is strongly glaciotectonically disturbed. A detailed analysis of thin sections of the till micro-fabric, and of radiographs from undisturbed, onented cores shows a relatively strong NE-SW and NW-SE particle orientation in the lower till and a weakly clustered to random orientation in the upper till. It is suggested that the field represents either drumlins (the more favourable hypothesis) or terminal <b>push-moraines,</b> formed dunng the first three ice advances of the Weichselian Glaciation...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [210]- 218) Seismic facies {{analysis was}} applied to high resolution, single channel, analog reflection profiles of the sediment fill within Muir Inlet, Glacier Bay, Alaska. Sedimentary facies have been interpreted from seismic facies identified on the profiles. The interpretations are based on relection characteristics and structural features of the seismic facies. The following reflection characteristics and structural features are used: reflector spacing, amplitude and continuity of reflections, internal reflection configurations, attitude of reflector terminations at a facies boundary, body geometry of a facies, and the architectural associations of seismic facies within each basin. The depositional systems are reconstructed by determining the paleotopography, bedding patterns, sedimentary facies, and modes of deposition within the basin. Muir Inlet is a recently deglaciated fjord for which successive glacier terminus positions and consequent rates of glacial retreat are known. In this environment the depositional processes and sediment characteristics vary with distance from a glacier terminus, such that during a retreat, a record of these variations is preserved in the aggrading sediment fill. Sedimentary facies within the basins of lower Muir Inlet are correlated with observed depositional processes near the present glacier terminus in the upper inlet. The occurrence of outwash deposits and submarine moraines (stratified and <b>push-moraines)</b> is described and the style of basin sedimentation is discussed. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years masses of ice, about 5 km long, have been {{protruding}} from the lowest part of an advancing glacier margin of the Kötlujökull in Southern Iceland. In the summer of 1983, they appeared as sediment-covered lobes, 10 - 60 m long, bordering the glacier rnargin like agarland. 1 to 3 push-rnoraines without ice core, rnostly sickle-shaped, occured first in the frontal parts of the lobes: behind thern came several ice-cored moraines with heights of up to several metres. The active ice {{in front of the}} precipice of the glacier is called the "glacier-foot" in this paper. The digging out of 9 lobes and the measuring of the advance of 19 lobes showed that in most cases this glacierfoot had split up at its distal end into several plate- or stem-shaped pieces of ice which were situated one upon the other, separated by moraine deposits and proceeding irregularly into the foreland at the rate of several mm/h, The sometimes different rate of advance in the same lobe and different rates of advanee in adjoining lobes (some being entirely inactive) point to a type of rnovement which is independent of the general advance of the glacier. Research in the winter of 1983 / 84 showed less activity in 3 examined lobes, but the activity had not ceased. The advancement of the lower parts of the glacier-foot into and across the sands of the foreland implies the following genesis of pushmoraines: Shoving off a plate of sand, folding it and pushing it over the foreland at average rates of up to 7, 2 mm/h, according to the investigations in thc summer of 1983. At a certain stage of the folding process, new folds begin to develop in front of the old, and the old folds are shifted onto the backslope of thc folds in front of them until they are completely unired. In this way, "püe-moraines" arise, which become higher and higher. They include two or more folds declining towards the glacier. Systems of small moraines presumably of the same genesis occur on old moraine areas in front of the Kötlujökull. The possible cause of formation of a glacier-foot is discussed, and the moraines of the Kötlujökull are compared with certain pleistocene <b>push-moraines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Iceland's glaciers are {{particularly}} sensitive to climate change, and their margins respond to trends in air temperature. Most Icelandic glaciers {{have been in}} retreat since c. 1990, and almost all since 1995. Using ice-front measurements, photographic and geomorphological evidence, we examined the record of ice-front fluctuations of Virkisjökull–Falljökull, a steep high-mass-turnover outlet glacier in maritime SE Iceland, in order to place recent changes in a longer-term (80 -year) context. Detailed geomorphological mapping identifies two suites of annual push moraines: one suite formed between c. 1935 and 1945, supported by lichenometric dating; the other between 1990 and 2004. Using moraine spacing {{as a proxy for}} ice-front retreat rates, we show that average retreat rates during the 1930 s and 1940 s (28 [*]m a− 1) were twice as high as during the period from 1990 to 2004 (14 [*]m a− 1). Furthermore, we show that both suites of annual moraines are associated with above-average summer temperatures. Since 2005, however, retreat rates have increased considerably – averaging 35 [*]m a− 1 – with the last 5 years representing the greatest amount of ice-front retreat (∼ 190 [*]m) in any 5 -year period since measurements began in 1932. We propose that this recent, rapid, ice-front retreat and thinning in a decade of unusually warm summers has resulted in a glaciological threshold being breached, with subsequent large-scale stagnation of the glacier terminus (i. e. no forward movement) and the cessation of annual <b>push-moraine</b> formation. Breaching this threshold has, we suggest, caused further very rapid non-uniform retreat and downwasting since 2005 via a system feedback between surface melting, glacier thinning, decreased driving stress and decreased forward motion. ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} herein {{seeks to}} determine the fate of sediment and carbon supplied into the nearshore zone by coastal erosion and thermokarst in permafrost landscapes. To accomplish this, the sediment and carbon sources and sinks will be identified and quantified using remotely sensed imagery, bathymetric and sidescan surveys, shallow seismic profiles, and the interpretation of sediment cores. Coastal dynamics on arctic coasts are characterized by a seasonal dichotomy. Sea ice and landfast ice limit {{the length of the}} open-water season, armoring the coast against wave-induced erosion; while in the absence of ice the coast is susceptible to the combined effects of mechanical and thermal erosion processes. This results in high erosion rates along coasts characterized by ice-rich permafrost, like the western Canadian Arctic. Current estimates show that there is about twice as much carbon stored in permafrost as compared to the atmosphere. Of special interest is the potential climate feedback triggered by carbon release into the nearshore zone by coastal erosion, in a region that according to many climate change models will experience disproportionate warming. Herschel Island, the focus of the current study, is a <b>push-moraine</b> that formed at the northwestern limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. This part of the Canadian Yukon coast is characterized by high cliffs and numerous retrogressive thaw slumps, indicating the presence of large massive ice bodies susceptible to permafrost degradation. This study aims to elucidate the erosion, transport, and deposition dynamics of sediments and carbon that enter the nearshore zone. We focus on the marine realm, directly accompanying studies that aim at quantifying and characterizing the terrestrial aspects of coastal erosion in the area. A combination of methods is used to identify sediment sources, their characteristics, pathways, and sinks. An interferometric sidescan sonar system is used in conjunction with Van-Veen grab-samples to create bathymetric and sidescan mosaics that allow for an areal view of sediment pathways, sources, and possible sinks. Surface sediments are analyzed for grain-size, nutrients, and carbon content. Using time series data acquired over multiple field seasons and satellite imagery will enable ascertaining the importance of cliff- vs. thaw slump erosion in supplying sediments. Sedimentation rates are obtained from sediment cores using 137 Cs, 210 Pb, and 14 C dating methods. Simultaneous analyses of the carbon content in the cores provide the necessary data for a regional sediment and carbon budget. A seismic sub bottom profiler is used to gain insights into the depositional history and submarine permafrost evolution of the region. ...|$|E
