5|$|Lazard {{turns to}} Fox Mulder and Dana Scully for help. She tells them of Michelle's claims {{that a man}} had {{attacked}} Barbala, {{even though she was}} the only <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> when the detective was killed. The agents have Michelle describe the alleged attacker for a computerized facial composite; the computer seemingly glitches, displaying a face that Michelle identifies as the killer. The composite matches that of a Detective Charlie Morris — who died nine years previously in an apparent gangland hit. Mulder speaks to Michelle's psychiatrist, Dr. Braun, who tells him that she habitually mutilated dolls in a uniform manner during their sessions together, removing the same eye and arm each time; Mulder realizes that these mutilations match the circumstances of Morris' death.|$|E
25|$|People {{believed}} {{that women who}} were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman {{would have to tell}} every <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before {{she would be able to}} give birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E
500|$|Advertisements for {{the show}} ahead of the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con {{featuring}} a flaming chain led to speculation that the character Ghost Rider would be joining the series during the season, though {{it was noted that}} the image could just indicate an increased role for Whitehead after he was introduced as James in the third season, and also wields a flaming chain. When casting for two Latino brothers, [...] "one of whom is always the most dangerous <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> the other paralyzed in a wheelchair", was revealed to be underway for the series in June, further speculation pointed to the inclusion of Ghost Rider, with those character descriptions resembling those for Marvel Comics' All-New Ghost Rider Robbie Reyes and his brother Gabe, respectively. At the series' Comic-Con panel, the speculation was confirmed—Gabriel Luna was announced to be cast as Robbie Reyes, and Lorenzo James Henrie was later revealed to be cast as Gabe.|$|E

6000|$|In {{a frenzy}} of rage and despair, he looked round at <b>the</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "I take you all to witness," [...] he cried; [...] "this {{is an act of}} madness!" ...|$|R
500|$|Though {{previous}} albums {{were produced}} by David Kosten, they enlisted {{the support of}} producer Stuart Price after he impressed them with his work on a demo version of the eventual single, [...] "Regret". As Price was based in Los Angeles, the band emailed him samples of their work for him to critique and receive his suggested mixes in return. They had mixed reactions to his suggestions; {{at one point during}} production of [...] "Hapsburg Lippp" [...] – a track which did not make the final track listing – Price returned them a reggae-inspired mix as a joke. Higgs explained to Andy Morris of Gigwise that Price had an [...] "ability to become one of us very quickly". Price joined them in person for the last nine days of recording. Guitarist Alex Robertshaw said to Digital Spy that his positivity made an impression on them: [...] "Just [...] another seriously creative <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with you is fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|Betty, however {{difficult}} to believe as her character is established, shows an astonishing depth of dimension in her audition. Previously rehearsed with Rita in the apartment, where Rita feeds her lines woodenly, the scene is [...] "dreck" [...] and [...] "hollow; every line unworthy of a genuine actress's commitment", and Betty plays it in rehearsal as poorly as it is written. Nervous but plucky as ever at the audition, Betty enters the cramped room, but when pitted inches from her audition partner (Chad Everett), she turns it into a scene of powerful sexual tension that she fully controls and draws in every <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty's previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynch's use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters. Betty's acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film that ultimately turns against her.|$|E
2500|$|As {{far as the}} <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is concerned, {{the symbols}} are just {{meaningless}} [...] "squiggles." [...] But if the Chinese room really [...] "understands" [...] what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about intentionality, symbol grounding and syntax vs. semantics.|$|E
6000|$|... "That, monsieur," [...] said he, [...] "is one of <b>the</b> most {{important}} <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> He is <b>the</b> man whom {{they call the}} uncrowned king. He was a saddler once by profession. Look at him now." ...|$|R

2500|$|Searle's reply is {{to suppose}} that, unbeknownst to the {{individual}} in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, {{and some of the}} outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is still just following the rules, and does not know what the symbols mean. Searle writes [...] "he doesn't see what comes into the robot's eyes." [...] (See Mary's room for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} Trump won the election, Fox wrote an {{editorial}} on the International Business Times website where he lamented Trump's victory and explored what Mexico {{could do in}} response. [...] "Even though Trump is not the prettiest <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{we still have to}} dance with him. Now, we ought to look out for ourselves {{and find a way to}} work with the most powerful economy in the world, which is now led by an authoritarian racistDonald Trump's promises have an expiration date. When the time comes to truly deliver to the American people, his [...] "billion dollar show" [...] will finally crumble beneath his feet," [...] Fox wrote, concluding his editorial with, [...] "I find quite sad that America, formerly the most open and cutting edge nation, has chosen to lock itself down inside concrete walls. It's tragic that fear, anger and wrath took over and pierced the hearts of their people. It will be hard to recover from this wound; but we better start working to heal as quickly as possible – and bring down the walls that blinded us in the beginning." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{open letter}} {{published}} in The New York Sun, Kenneth W. Stein, Director of the Institute for the Study of Modern Israel of Emory University, who was {{the founder of the}} Middle East program at the Carter Center and the Center's first director (February 1984 – 1986), presents criticisms of the book as follows: [...] "President Carter's book on the Middle East, a title too inflammatory to even print, is not based on unvarnished analysis; it is replete with factual errors, copied materials not cited, superficialities, glaring omissions, and simply invented segments." [...] In his letter sent to President Carter and others, Stein also observes: [...] "Aside from the one-sided nature of the book, meant to provoke, there are recollections cited from meetings where I was the third <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and my notes of those meetings show little similarity to points claimed in the book." [...] He adds: [...] "Being a former President does not give one a unique privilege to invent information or to unpack it with cuts, deftly slanted to provide a particular outlook. Having little access to Arabic and Hebrew sources, I believe, clearly handicapped his understanding and analyses of how history has unfolded over the last decade." [...] At {{the end of the first}} week of December, Karen DeYoung reported that Stein had not yet provided a full outline of such alleged factual errors in the book.|$|E
6000|$|Hilary and Bianca made no sound, nor {{did they}} look at one another; and in this silence, so much more full of meaning than any talk, the {{scratching}} of the quill went on. Mr. Stone put it down at last, and, seeing two <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> read: ...|$|R
60|$|Heedless of {{his action}} and his language, Mr. Rayburn {{could look at}} nothing, could think of nothing, but Mrs. Zant.

60|$|It was an {{hour before}} he returned, and Leigh and Patsey had just {{finished}} supper. As there were two or three other <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> he said nothing, but signified by a little nod that he had succeeded. A {{quarter of an hour}} later the other customers, having finished their meal, went out.|$|R
60|$|When I {{returned}} to <b>the</b> other <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Oscar and Lucilla were still occupying the same positions. Mr. Finch had presented himself (at full length) to Herr Grosse. And Jicks was established {{on a stool}} in a corner: devouring a rampant horse, carved in bilious-yellow German gingerbread, with a voracious relish wonderful and terrible to see.|$|R
6000|$|... 71. Let me notice, <b>in</b> passing, <b>the</b> {{infinite}} {{absurdity of}} ever hanging Venetian pictures {{above the line}} of sight. There are very few <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> who {{will be able to}} see the drawing of this bird's beak without a magnifying-glass; yet it is ten to one that in any modern gallery such a picture would be hung thirty feet from the ground.|$|R
60|$|Benjamin's rebuke passed, like Benjamin's retort, unheeded and unheard. To all appearance, Miserrimus Dexter had {{completely}} forgotten {{that there was}} such a <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

60|$|Lady Janet and Horace came in. She was faintly {{conscious}} of <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> After an interval {{she opened her}} eyes, and half rose to speak to them. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> was empty again. They had stolen out softly and left her to repose. Her eyes closed once more. She dropped back into slumber, and from slumber, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> favoring warmth and quiet of the place, into deep and dreamless sleep.|$|R

60|$|The parish church {{stood back}} from the street, {{protected}} by gates and railings, and surrounded by a space of open ground. Shaking off his father's hold, Bashwood the younger made straight for the vestry. The clerk, putting away the books, and the clerk's assistant, hanging up a surplice, were <b>the</b> only <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> when he entered it and asked leave {{to look at the}} marriage register for the day.|$|R
60|$|In a pause of breathless silence--with {{the eyes}} of every <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> eagerly {{fastened}} on him--the surgeon lifted his hand and pointed to Geoffrey Delamayn.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} is the {{wonderful}} news?" [...] said Mrs. Meyrick, who {{was the only other}} <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Anything about Italy--anything about the Austrians giving up Venice?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lubbers asked Max van der Stoel, former High Commissioner on National Minorities, {{to comment}} on the {{confidential}} report. He concluded that [...] "the OIOS report is deficient in objectivity and impartiality." [...] He added [...] "that the only two other <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> did not provide evidence confirming the version given by the complainant." [...] Furthermore, he accused UN officials of leaking information to the press and recommended that an investigation of the leaks be undertaken.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} back on him; and, bowing to <b>the</b> other <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with <b>the</b> old formal {{courtesy}} of by-gone times, walked slowly and steadily to the door. Stopping there, she looked back; and then the artificial courage of the moment failed her. With a faint, suppressed cry she clutched at the hand of the old servant, who still kept faithfully at her side; he caught her in his arms, and her head sank on his shoulder.|$|R
