5|$|Convicted serial rapist Jonathan Haynes {{forced his}} victims to destroy {{forensic}} evidence. He was only caught {{after one of}} his victims deliberately <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> own hair which was later discovered in his car, tying him to the attacks. She was inspired by watching the CSI television series.|$|E
25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a few moments to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Fahs {{records that}} Solanas then {{traveled}} to producer Margo Feiden's (then Margo Eden) residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Solanas believed that Feiden {{would be willing}} to produce her play. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas's play. According to Feiden, Solanas then <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, Solanas responded, [...] "Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it." [...] As she was leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a copy of her play and other personal papers.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] Björk {{was forced}} to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> {{performance}} at the Sydney Big Day Out under doctor's orders following swelling on her vocal cords.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Mrs. Munger. [...] "And now we {{must really}} be going," [...] she added, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> watch by its leathern guard.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Denman started, {{as if her}} own remark had {{recalled}} something, and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> watch.|$|E
6000|$|... '"She is {{waving her}} {{handkerchief}} to us," [...] said Stephen's wife, who thereupon <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> own, and waved it as a return signal.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor old}} lady grew pale. Without a word she tremblingly, yet quickly, <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> purse, took {{therefrom}} a shilling, and {{offered it to}} the boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "The money, ma!" [...] says Mary. [...] "Why here!" [...] And <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> puss, {{she showed}} a sovrin, a good heap of silver, and an odd-looking little coin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Amy, [...] "I'll {{enable you}} to lose that £20 immediately;" [...] and so {{she put her hand}} in <b>her</b> pocket and <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> purse.|$|R
6000|$|Trick. Well, {{to satisfy}} you, I will feel.--They are not here--nor here neither. [...] [She <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief, and the keys [...] drop after it: LIMBERHAM takes them up.|$|R
6000|$|Daisy sighed, {{and took}} a few more steps, then smiled, <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> purse, and taking the ten-cent piece tossed it up, saying, [...] "Heads, Mary; tails, myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Margaret <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> wallet. [...] "I {{can give}} you ten dollars, Bob; but I can shout to {{the people at the}} hotel. You know Mr. Leyland did not shoot Douglas." ...|$|E
60|$|Together {{with the}} little book, {{in which she was}} writing furiously, she had <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}}, and the sight of this handkerchief reposing on the floor gave Thyme a queer satisfaction, such as comes when one remarks in superior people the absence of a virtue existing in oneself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! you men {{are such}} vain creatures!' cried Miss Snevellicci. Whereupon, she became charmingly confused, and, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> pocket-handkerchief from a faded pink silk {{reticule}} with a gilt clasp, called to Miss Ledrook-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Yankumi {{switches}} {{from her}} teacher mode to her Yakuza mode by <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> ponytails and taking off her glasses before every fight. In season 2 she added a slight head toss as well.|$|R
5000|$|One error {{can be seen}} in the Bateson's Belfry sequence. When the lid is {{wrenched}} off {{the casket}} and Lesley-Anne Down bends in to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> [...] "brother," [...] Donald Sutherland's eyes twitch from left to right.|$|R
6000|$|She came to {{a sudden}} stop and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> purse. Her fingers trembled so that the penny fell on to the pavement. The boy picked it up willingly enough, however, and she passed on with the paper in her hand. There {{it was on the}} front page--staring her in the face: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. George had {{a genius}} for being late. She was later than usual to-day, {{and she looked}} excited. Every woman around the [...] "Rising Star" [...] felt that Mrs. George had some news worth {{listening}} to, {{and there was an}} expectant silence while she <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> chair and settled herself at the quilt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you?" [...] {{she cried}} delightedly. [...] "Here! {{take one of}} my cards," [...] and she <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> card-case. [...] "The {{carpenter}} writes on a three-cornered block and puts it into his pocket, and it's so uncomfortable he can't help remembering it. Pen says she's going to adopt the three-cornered-block plan with papa." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Pour It Up" [...] is a club song, with {{a minimal}} hip hop beat. Lyrically, it finds Rihanna turning a strip-club anthem into a {{declaration}} of independence, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> dollar bills at the strip club, getting drunk, and bragging loudly.|$|R
60|$|After tea {{they all}} {{set out on}} a grand beetle-hunting expedition, and so intent were they upon this {{fascinating}} pursuit that they did not note the flight of time, till suddenly Mildred, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> watch, gave a pretty cry of alarm.|$|R
50|$|Slowly, {{he becomes}} the most {{important}} member of the gang. Once, a secretary from a film-actress gives him the contract of <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> of a trouble of being harassed by a male colleague. The actress, impressed by Deshu's attitude, later becomes his girlfriend.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ophelia sat down, and <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> knitting-work, and {{sat there}} grim with indignation. She knit and knit, but while she mused the fire burned; at last she broke out--"I tell you, Augustine, I can't get over things so, if you can. It's a perfect abomination for you to defend such a system,--that's my mind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The musical chime of {{a distant}} clock {{reminded}} her that supper time was near, and she sprang up as if much refreshed by this pleasant rest by the way-side. As she <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief, a little roll of pale blue ribbon fell from her pocket, and Emily caught it up, exclaiming mischievously, [...] "Are {{you going to make}} yourself fine next Sunday, when Moses Pennel calls, Becky?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then she <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> money, {{and paid}} him down {{a hundred and}} twenty pounds, which, she said, she paid him {{that he might be}} sure he should be no loser by taking him home again, and that she would come and see him again, and talk farther about things with him, so that all might be settled for him, in such a manner as accidents, such as mortality, or {{anything}} else, should make no alteration to the child's prejudice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{give him}} something, poor little fellow,' said Elfride, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> purse and hastily opening it. From the {{interior}} of her purse a host of bits of paper, like a flock of white birds, floated into the air, and were blown about in all directions.|$|R
60|$|All three now {{looked through}} the hole to test {{the truth of the}} prognostication. The hour of five {{completed}} itself on their watches; the girl again came forward. And then the three in ambuscade could see <b>her</b> <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief and place it to her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There--if I didn't think so!' exclaimed Matilda, {{opening her}} eyes, {{starting}} up, and promptly <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> own handkerchief, {{with which she}} wiped away the drops, and an unimportant trifle of her complexion, assisted by Anne, who, {{in spite of her}} background of antagonistic emotions, could not help being interested.|$|R
60|$|It being now sermon-time the {{youthful}} blower {{had fallen asleep}} over the handle of his bellows, and Tabitha <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> handkerchief intending to flap him awake with it. With the handkerchief tumbled out a whole family of unexpected articles: a silver thimble; a photograph; a little purse; a scent-bottle; some loose halfpence; nine green gooseberries; a key. They rolled to Swithin's feet, and, passively obeying his first instinct, he picked up {{as many of the}} articles as he could find, and handed them to her amid the smiles of the neighbours.|$|E
60|$|He laughed again. He {{had taken}} his at a swallow, but almost nullifying its effect was this confirmation--if indeed he had needed it--of the extent of her inexperience. She was, in truth, {{untouched}} by the world--the world {{in which he had}} lived. He <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> chair for her and she sat down, confronted by a series of knives, forks, and spoons on either side of a plate of oysters. Oysters served in this fashion, needless to say, had never formed part of the menu in Fillmore Street, or in any Hampton restaurant where she had lunched. But she saw that Ditmar had chosen a little fork with three prongs, and she followed his example.|$|E
60|$|Pursuant to some {{altogether}} private calculations {{she did not}} {{go up to the}} Imperial College {{until after}} mid-day, and she found the laboratory deserted, even as she desired. She went to the table under the end window at which she had been accustomed to work, and found it swept and garnished with full bottles of re-agents. Everything was very neat; it had evidently been straightened up and kept for her. She put down the sketch-books and apparatus she had brought with her, <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> stool, and sat down. As she did so the preparation-room door opened behind her. She heard it open, but as she felt unable to look round in a careless manner she pretended not to hear it. Then Capes' footsteps approached. She turned with an effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "L. N. Saltonstall" [...] was {{the name}} on the door, and L. N. Saltonstall's servant was so leisurely about {{answering}} Christie's meek solo on the bell, that she had time to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> bonnet-strings half-a-dozen times before a very black man in a very white jacket condescended to conduct her to his mistress.|$|R
5000|$|... 7 October - Israeli woman {{injured and}} <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> of <b>her</b> {{car in a}} rock-throwing {{incident}} and attempted lynching near Jerusalem.|$|R
60|$|The lovely Sarah, {{now with}} her arms folded, and now with her hands clasped behind her, paced the room with manly strides while her brother was thus employed, and {{sometimes}} stopped to <b>pull</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> snuff-box and bite the lid. She continued to pace up and down until she was quite tired, and then fell asleep on a chair near the door.|$|R
