A mechanical winder is used and the rubber is stretched up to fives times original length to pack in maximum winds on the motor. In flight, these models look just like the real thing. All that is missing is the noise of the engine in the original airplane.

50|$|In newer {{models of}} constant-speed {{propeller}}s, oil is pumped through the propeller shaft to push on a piston {{that drives the}} mechanism to change pitch. The flow of oil and the pitch are controlled by a governor, consisting of a speeder spring, flyweights, and a pilot valve. The tension of the speeder spring is set by the propeller control lever, which sets the RPMs. The governor will maintain that RPM setting until an engine overspeed or underspeed condition exists. When an overspeed condition occurs, the propeller begins to rotate faster than the desired RPM setting. This would occur as the plane descends and airspeed increases. The flyweights begin to pull outward due to centrifugal force which further compresses the speeder spring. As that happens, the piston moves forward, allowing the pilot valve to open and oil to flow from the oil sump into the hub. This increase in oil pressure will increase the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> angle causing it to slow {{back down to the}} desired RPM setting. When an underspeed condition occurs, as in a climb with loss of airspeed, just the opposite takes place. The airspeed decreases, causing the propeller to slow down. This will cause the flyweights to move inward due to a lack in centrifugal force and tension will be released from the speeder spring. As this happens, the piston will move in the opposite direction causing the pilot valve to allow oil to flow from the hub back to the oil sump. The propeller blade angle will now decrease to a lower pitch allowing the propeller to speed back up to the desired RPM setting. This process usually takes place frequently throughout flight.|$|E

50|$|Aside from {{landing gear}} brakes, most large {{aircraft}} have {{other ways of}} decelerating. In aircraft, air brakes are aerodynamic surfaces that create friction, with the air flow causing the vehicle to slow. These are usually implemented as flaps that oppose air flow when extended and are flush with aircraft when retracted. Reverse thrust is also used in many aeroplane engines. Propeller aircraft achieve reverse thrust by reversing <b>the</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propellers,</b> while jet aircraft do so by redirecting their engine exhaust forwards. On aircraft carriers, arresting gears are used to stop an aircraft. Pilots may even apply full forward throttle on touchdown, in case the arresting gear does not catch and a go around is needed.|$|R

40|$|Traditional marine {{propellers}} {{that are}} manufactured using alloys have a fixed shape. These propellers {{are designed to}} achieve the highest propulsion efficiency at the cruise condition of the vessel. However, if the flow conditions change from the vessel’s cruise condition, the propulsion efficiency reduces significantly. The objective of this thesis is to develop flexible shape-adaptive (self-morphing) blades using high performance composite materials, with particular focus on Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). By careful tailoring of fibre angle of composite layers, composite laminates can be catered to optimally change its twist under various lateral loading conditions. This special characteristic is proposed {{to be used for}} optimal change of <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> blade based on incoming flow conditions. An in-house optimisation algorithm has been developed to search for the optimum fibre angle of each carbon fibre layer that can enable the required shape change. The optimisation algorithm uses the Genetic Algorithm (GA) coupled with the state-of-the-art Finite Element techniques such as Cell-Based Smoothed Finite Element Method (CS-FEM) and Iso-Geometric FEM. The CS-FEM uses a stable triangular element scheme, while the NURBS based iso-geometric FEM has the capability of representing the complex geometry without any mesh based approximations. The finite element techniques also take into account ply terminations of the blade and hygrothermal effects that may be present in the composite. An iterative procedure to search for the initial shape of the blades was also developed. The developed techniques were used to optimise a hydrofoil using experimental data from cavitation tunnel tests of a non-optimised hydrofoil. The optimised hydrofoil was then manufactured and was subjected to rigorous structural testing in order to ensure the strength and safety of the hydrofoil and to validate the reliability of the manufacturing technique. Additionally, hydrodynamic tests were conducted at the cavitation tunnel facility to characterise the performance of the optimised hydrofoil and compare against previously tested identical non-optimised hydrofoils. The optimised hydrofoil indeed showed more favourable results in terms of lift to drag (L/D) ratio of the hydrofoil and hydrodynamic fluctuations and uncertainties due to turbulence. The cavitation tunnel results were then validated against Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations and were found to be in good agreement with the predictions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel technique of active roll damping in marine vessels by <b>the</b> sole use <b>of</b> conventional thrusters. Many marine operations, such as crane operation and helicopter landings, should {{be carried out}} in small and steady roll motions. However, active roll damping devices such as fins and rudders lose their efficiency in low-speed conditions. This thesis provides a new methodology for roll reduction by adjusting the shaft speed and <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propellers,</b> by use <b>of</b> already installed thrusters. In order to develop a simulation environment suitable for representing realistic roll damping scenarios and validate the damping contribution from the thrusters, systematic experimental trials were {{carried out in the}} large towing tank at MARINTEK. The simulation model is based on the MSS Toolbox, with additional modifications added to represent roll motions more realistically, i. e. 4 -quadrant open water results and non-linear sway and roll damping. The numerical simulations and experimental trials, presented in the thesis, are compared with ship operations that require low roll motions, and shows promising results with significant roll reduction. Seakeeping trials related to roll motions are carried out to quantify the damping contribution. Decay tests showed average damping ratio 250 % higher using the proposed anti-roll system compared to the undamped case. Furthermore, regular waves showed 40 % damping in the area around resonance. Additionally, statistical values from irregular wave trials showed damping in the regime 30 - 64 %. Lastly, operability diagrams were created using numerical simulations and was compared with helicopter landing criteria. It was shown that helicopter landings could take place 34 % more often using the active roll damping system for oblique waves and 20 % more often for beam waves. Based on the results, it is concluded that the system works very well for moderate sea states, and that the damping contributions, that is to say in moderate sea state conditions, is comparable to that of currently available anti-roll system...|$|R

Besides, working in corrosive medium, cracks and, finally, fractures could be developed in different regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller.</b> Because <b>the</b> zones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> don't work in similar conditions, the damage {{is not the same}} in all regions. The paper presents considerations about alloys for naval propellers, working conditions, wear and failure, reconditioning and testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naval <b>propellers...</b>|$|R
50|$|When an {{aircraft}} is stationary with <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> spinning (in calm air), air flows past the narrow leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller.</b> This is <b>the</b> most efficient configuration, as the drag forces on <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> are <b>the</b> lowest. As the airplane starts moving forward, the airflow begins to push against the front, wider cross section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller,</b> creating greater drag.|$|R
50|$|In a Kort nozzle, the inflow {{velocity}} is increased, reducing pressure. This lowers thrust and torque <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, {{a circulation}} occurs, {{resulting in an}} inward aimed force, that has a forward component. The duct therefore has a positive thrust. This is normally larger than <b>the</b> thrust reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller.</b> <b>The</b> small clearance between <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> and duct reduces tip vortex, increasing efficiency.|$|R
