2500|$|An {{example of}} how package design is {{affected}} by other factors is its relationship to logistics. [...] When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier,</b> the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized unit loads, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame. [...] A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: LTL {{operations}} versus <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> operations ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Zone skipping" [...] {{is the use}} of LTL {{carriers}} to transport parcels to a parcel carrier's hub near the load's final destination instead of relying on the <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> for end-to-end delivery. The term [...] "zone skipping" [...] refers to the LTL carrier bypassing the parcel carrier's traditional [...] "zones", which allows the shipper to avoid charges incurred by the parcels crossing multiple zones en route from the shipper to the final destination. For example, if a shipper in North Carolina has 500 parcels bound for California, 250 bound for New York, and 250 bound for Indiana, the shipper will segregate the parcels by their destination, combine the segregated parcels into loads, and use LTL {{carriers to}} transport the loads to the parcel carrier's hubs in that state or region; the <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> will then unpack the load that was delivered and transport the individual parcels to their final destinations. This method can allow for substantial savings, particularly if the parcels would have to cross multiple <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> zones if transported by the <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> from end-to-end, and also reduces the possibility of loss on the parcel carrier's part (since all parcels for a destination will arrive at the hub at the same time).|$|E
50|$|Small <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> {{often have}} their own formats. For example, United Parcel Service has a MaxiCode 2-D code for parcel tracking.|$|R
50|$|Less than {{truckload}} shipping or {{less than}} load (LTL) is the transportation of relatively small freight. The alternatives to LTL <b>carriers</b> are <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> or full truckload <b>carriers.</b> <b>Parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> usually handle small packages and freight that {{can be broken down}} into units less than 150 lb. Full truckload carriers move freight that is loaded into a semi-trailer. Semi trailers are typically between 26 and 53 ft and require a substantial amount of freight to make such transportation economical.|$|R
50|$|Both major {{commercial}} <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> (UPS Airlines and FedEx Express) {{fly into}} BTV, providing service {{for much of}} northern Vermont. UPS uses Wiggins Airways to ferry packages between Burlington and larger cargo hubs.|$|R

50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1987 by Roger and Elaine Baines who grew the {{business}} from a small outfit based in the West Midlands into a nationwide <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier,</b> with around 1,000 vehicles operating out of around 100 distribution centres.|$|E
50|$|Unusually for a <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier,</b> Amtrak also transported small {{livestock}} such as valuable reptiles and birds. After finding that delivering snakes and pigeons {{in the same}} vehicle had its drawbacks, the service was withdrawn for reptiles and focused on pigeon deliveries.|$|E
50|$|In 1985 he was {{appointed}} to the board of British <b>parcels</b> <b>carrier</b> City Link Ltd playing a leading role in updating and modernising the company’s activities and facilities. In 1988 he {{was appointed}} to the board of government owned Belfast International Airport serving two terms of three years until privatisation in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} sorting {{and handling}} systems of small <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> can put severe {{stress on the}} packages and contents. Packaging needs to be designed for the potential hazards which may be encountered in parcel delivery systems. The major carriers have a packaging engineering staff which provides packaging guidelines and sometimes package design and package testing services.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the station}} handled {{large amounts of}} parcel and {{newspaper}} traffic, an overhead <b>parcels</b> <b>carrier</b> system was constructed in 1895. It consisted of an electrically powered trolley suspended from an overhead track operated by an airborne attendant. A large basket could be raised and lowered from the trolley to distribute parcels and newspapers across the station. The system operated until 1940.|$|R
50|$|Many shippers {{prefer to}} not use such methods as {{they prefer to}} only {{contract}} with one service provider, because using a LTL carrier and a <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> adds another point of failure for the shipper's operations (that is, something can go wrong during the grouping of all parcels into one load at the LTL carrier entry point).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> {{traditionally}} only handles pieces weighing {{less than}} approximately 150 lb. Parcel carriers typically still compete with LTL carriers by convincing shippers to break larger shipments down to smaller packages. Parcel carriers typically refer to multipiece shipments as [...] "Hundredweight" [...] shipments as the rating {{is based on}} 100 lb. The Hundredweight rate is multiplied by the shipment's weight and then divided by 100 and then rounded up to the nearest hundred.|$|E
50|$|Parcel audit (also {{referred}} to as small package auditing or small parcel auditing) {{is the process of}} reviewing shipping invoices for invalid charges and other billing inaccuracies. Each shipment tendered to a major <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> like UPS and FedEx come with service guarantees outlined within each carrier's tariff or service guide. An increasing number of businesses contract third-party companies to perform these services because they have the technology necessary to automate the otherwise time consuming process.|$|E
50|$|Cargo {{emerged as}} a solid pillar of the {{industry}} in 1990s. The catalysts for the renewed growth in the sector were the express <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers,</b> typified by FedEx, DHL, TNT and UPS, and changes in practices in the manufacturing sector. In 1992, FedEx sent software on computer disks to thousands of customers, allowing them to track shipments from their own workstations.|$|R
50|$|In September 2005, LYNX Express was {{acquired}} by Atlanta, Georgia based UPS for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million). At the time, LYNX Express {{was one of the}} largest independent <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> in the United Kingdom, with sales of $295 million (£170 million) for the financial year ended 2 October 2004. The company was subsequently integrated into UPS, and the LYNX brand disappeared.|$|R
5000|$|LTL {{carriers}} {{prefer to}} handle shipments {{with the least}} amount of handling units possible. LTL carriers prefer a shipment of 1 pallet containing many boxes shrink wrapped to form one piece rather than many individual pieces. This reduces handling costs and the risk of damage during transit. Typically, the per pound rates of LTL carriers are less than the per pound rates of <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The D3 Major {{represented}} {{the first step}} in development of the Bantam, although the D1 would be produced for many years to come. First produced in late (most likely October was the first released) 1953 with a 150cc engine, the D3 continued in production until 1957. A modern-style foam-filled pillion seat was fitted as standard, an economy and comfort breakthrough that had become popular as an option on the D1. It replaced the original standard fitting of a <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> behind an individual sprung rubber seat.|$|E
50|$|Both LTL {{carriers}} and XL parcel carriers {{are similar in}} the fact that they both use a network of hubs and terminals to deliver freight. Delivery times by both types of service providers are not directly dependent upon the distance between shipper and consignee. Also, using an LTL carrier is very similar to that of using a <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier.</b> The shipper often has a regular, if not daily, pickup schedule and can log onto the carriers homepage to schedule pickups, track shipments, print paperwork, and manage billing information.|$|E

50|$|<b>Parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> like UPS, FedEx, and DHL {{often have}} large, long, and {{complicated}} invoices. A customer shipping a high volume of parcel boxes via {{one of these}} carriers sees invoices hundreds of pages long. The invoices show a high amount of visibility to how a package was carried and delivered. This finite data is collected by UPS and FedEx for tracking purposes and to automate the process of charging the appropriate amount to their clients.|$|R
50|$|Eyetech Group Ltd {{was founded}} as a {{subsidiary}} of an international UK plc, before trading as its own, standalone plc following a management buyout in 1985. The company has mostly been involved in producing bespoke software systems for commercial use in the transport and distribution sector under Unix/AIX, track and trace systems involving the use of barcodes, which {{have been used by}} the majority of UK <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> and bar code decoders and industrial (networked) shop floor data capture and access control systems.|$|R

5000|$|A {{mail order}} or online {{pharmacy}} usually ships orders by mail services or by small <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier.</b> The shipment is not temperature-controlled {{and it may}} sit in a mail box upon delivery. Conditions can include high or low temperatures outside of the recommended storage conditions for certain products. For example, the USFDA found that the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136 °F (58 °C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101 °F (38 °C). [...] Insulated mailing envelopes are sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|Between the 19th {{and late}} 20th centuries, Earl Shilton was a busy {{industrial}} village with numerous shoe, hosiery and knitwear factories. The boot and shoe factories included Orton's, Eatough's and Pinchess's, and other, smaller, operations. At one point Earl Shilton produced boots for the Russian army. Many of these businesses have now closed due to competition, {{but a few}} continue into the 21st century. Nevertheless, the Earl Shilton boot and shoe heritage provided the opportunity for other businesses to thrive alongside them, namely local carriers such as Woodwards (now the bakery distribution business) and Crowfoots, (still operating as a <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier).</b> Both these businesses are now located nearby {{in the village of}} Barwell.|$|E
50|$|Roth {{remained}} single until 1990, {{when he met}} Cynthia Loucks Baumgartner {{at one of his}} son's Little League games. Born in 1957, she was {{the child}} of an older couple who had a teenage son and had been trying unsuccessfully for years to have another baby. Raised in a deeply religious family, she married Tom Baumgartner at the age of 21, and their sons Tyson and Rylie were born in 1979 and 1981. Tom worked hard as a <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> for the USPS to provide for his family, but in 1985 he suddenly came down with Hodgkin's Disease and {{died at the age of}} 29. Cynthia was well-provided for with various survivors' benefits and the support of her family and close friend Lori Baker, and so she didn't need to work. Since she refused to marry a divorced man due to her religious beliefs, Randy Roth told her nothing about his marriages except that Janis Miranda had accidentally fallen to her death. That August, the two abruptly ran off to Las Vegas to get married, something that shocked Cynthia's family. Randy Roth quickly put up his house up for sale and purchased a big new home in Woodinville where he moved with his new enlarged family. Cynthia gradually became aware that Roth felt a need to control every aspect of her life, and did not want her doing anything on her own. Friends noticed her appearance and her housekeeping, which had always been beyond reproach in the past, were given less and less attention, and that Cynthia seemed to regret her marriage to Roth. Roth was also physically and mentally abusive to all three boys.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{a number}} of {{regional}} parcel delivery companies have sprung up since the 1990s. They combine the track and trace capability of the national carriers {{with the ability to}} guarantee next day delivery at ground rates over a larger delivery footprint. Because they are regionally based, they are able to improve shipment time in transit and increase shippers productivity with later pick up times. The regional <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers</b> can be a cost effective enhancement to UPS and FedEx because they do not charge the full array of accessorial charges mentioned in the section above.|$|R

40|$|Various {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to determine the dynamics that single packages undergo during distribution between destinations as a function of package size and weight and carrier. Previous studies have normally focused on regional and domestic measurements of these environments in Europe and North America. However, no information is available to determine the international handling and shipping environment of single parcels between the two continents. This study used instrumented packages containing triaxial accelerometers. The measured shocks were analysed to determine the velocity change levels {{as a function of the}} events measured in the distribution environment and to develop data for drop heights that can be used for package testing. This study provides a comparison of DHL and FedEx, the two largest international <b>parcel</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{organization}} of urban freight through the analysis of time deliveries. The time delivery is an important dimension in the organization the transport, because it shapes the choice of transport and the possibilities of consolidation {{in case of a}} small shipment. The demand of customers is heterogeneous, so shippers have to choice the transport between a range of solutions according their own constraints: own fleet, <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier,</b> express <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> [...] . In a context of congestion in urban freight and reduction of emissions of CO 2, what are the possibilities for carriers and shippers to reduce the impacts of their transports while keeping good deliveries deadlines for the customers ? The constraints of productive systems, the demand of the customers and in particular, short time deliveries induced specific organization. This analysis based on French case highlights who are the customers who require very short time deliveries and how time delivery deadline influences the choice of organization of transport...|$|E
30|$|This rather {{complicated}} institutional situation {{does not}} prevent the Ile-de-France Region from being a thriving place for logistics activities, making up {{more than a quarter}} of France’s total square metres of warehouses and logistics centres [15]. This illustrates a fundamental fact about goods movements in cities: it is the economic structure of a city that determines freight movements, much more than the institutional patterns or local policies [8]. Each of the (very numerous) economic sectors present in a large metropolitan area such as the Ile de France Region has its own logistics characteristics [23]. These characteristics in turn determine the types of vehicles and delivery frequencies that each sector needs. Before being delivered to (or sent out of) an urban area, a product will very likely pass through a warehouse, a <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> terminal, or an intermodal yard, in short, a network node where goods will be transferred from one vehicle to another and are often stored, processed, or repackaged. 3 Thus, a vast band of logistics facilities surrounds cities, especially the largest ones.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study how cost {{efficiency}} and the reliability of a physical distribution network are affected by changes in online shopping demand and to suggest how logistics service providers can respond to such changes. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a discrete event simulation approach, possible adaptive measures to online shopping demand increase are tested at three levels of decision making in parcel distribution network: priority assignment in the main hub (operational), introduction of sub-hubs (tactical), and increase in the hub-terminal capacity (strategic). The feasibility of the simulation is tested with parameters adopted from the logistics service data of an existing major <b>parcel</b> <b>carrier</b> in South Korea. Findings – Findings from the simulation model suggest that the existing physical distribution network can improve its cost efficiency and service reliability by evolving into a more centralized network structure with increased capacity of transshipment facilities if the online shopping demand is expected to increase consistently over the long run. Practical implications – This research will help logistics service providers to have good insights into performances of their distribution networks at different levels of demand and to devise a plan for adaptation to meet future demand. Originality/value – This paper provides a framework to understand the complex relationship between network configurations, service levels, costs, and other decision-making processes with respect to changes in online shopping demand based on a simulation approach...|$|E
