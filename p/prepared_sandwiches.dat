Case-control studies revealed that illness was signi®cantly associated with eating foods from the university's main cafeteria deli bar on 9 and 10 March. Stool specimens from 9 (50 %) of 18 ill students and samples of deli ham showed evidence of Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) by reverse-transcriptase (RT) poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A food handler who <b>prepared</b> <b>sandwiches</b> for lunch on 9 March reported that her infant had been sick with watery diarrhea since just before the outbreak. A stool sample from the infant was positive for NLV by RT-PCR, and the sequence of the ampli®ed product was identical to that of ampli®ed product from deli ham and students' stool specimens. This is the ®rst time RT-PCR and sequence analysis have successfully con-®rmed viral contamination of a food item {{likely to have been}} contaminated by a food handler. Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide [1].

50|$|Horse meat has a {{slightly}} sweet taste reminiscent {{of a combination of}} beef and venison.

Those <b>preparing</b> <b>sandwiches</b> or cold meals with horse meat usually use it smoked and salted. It forms an ingredient in several traditional recipes of salami.|$|R
