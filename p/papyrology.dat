25|$|Many {{of the new}} {{religions}} {{relied on}} {{the emergence of the}} parchment codex (bound book) over the papyrus volumen (scroll), the former allowing for quicker access to key materials and easier portability than the fragile scroll, thus fueling the rise of synoptic exegesis, <b>papyrology.</b> Notable in this regard is the topic of the Fifty Bibles of Constantine.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} the project is now mainly on the {{publication}} of this vast archive of material: by 2003 4,700 items had been translated, edited and published. Publication continues {{at the rate of}} about one new volume each year. Each volume contains a selection of material, covering a wide range of subjects. The editors include senior professionals but also students studying <b>papyrology</b> at the doctoral or undergraduate level. Thus recent volumes offer early fragments of the Gospels and of the Book of Revelation, early witnesses to the texts of Apollonius Rhodius, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, and Euripides, previously unknown texts of Simonides and Menander and of the epigrammatist Nicarchus. Other subjects covered include specimens of Greek music and documents relating to magic and astrology.|$|E

2500|$|Commander Alastair Denniston was {{operational}} head of GC from 1919 to 1942, {{beginning with}} its formation from the Admiralty's Room 40 (NID25) and the War Office's MI1b.

2500|$|Flavius Dioscorus ( [...] Flauios Dioskoros) lived {{during the}} 6th century A.D. {{in the village}} of Aphrodito, Egypt, and {{therefore}} is called by modern scholars Dioscorus of Aphrodito. Although he was an Egyptian, he composed poetry in Greek, the cultural language of the Byzantine Era. His poems are the oldest surviving poems written by the hand of a known poet. The manuscripts, which contain his corrections and revisions, were discovered on papyrus in 1905, and are now held in museums and libraries around the world. Dioscorus was also occupied in legal work, and legal documents and drafts involving him, his family, Aphroditans, and others were discovered along with his poetry. As an administrator of the village of Aphrodito, he composed petitions on behalf of its citizens, which are unique for their poetic and religious qualities. Dioscorus was a Christian (a Copt) and lived in a religiously active environment. The collection of Greek and Coptic papyri associated with Dioscorus and Aphrodito {{is one of the most}} important finds in the history of <b>papyrology</b> and has shed considerable light on the law and society of Byzantine Egypt.|$|E
