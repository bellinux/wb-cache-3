25|$|Named after Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory {{where their}} type {{location}} occurs, the Ainslie Volcanics {{are composed of}} Dacitic ignimbrite and minor volcaniclastic and argillaceous sediments. The lithology is bluish grey dacitic tuff, which can be massive or foliated, also dacitic agglomerate and shale. These volcanics contain chloritised cordierite and some have red almandine garnet. Jasper is found on low hills {{on the north side}} of the Molonglo River. The thickness is at least 700 metres. The magma was formed by melting an aluminiumrich <b>pelitic</b> sediment. The eruption came from a volcano into shallow sea water. The deposits built above sea level as they progressed. The underlying sediments now make up the Canberra Formation. Between Hall and Namina Hill on Spring Range, the Mount Painter Volcanics lie unconformably on top.|$|E
2500|$|Partially molten basalt in {{the mantle}} wedge moves upwards {{until it reaches}} {{the base of the}} {{overriding}} crust. Once there, the basaltic melt can either underplate the crust, creating a layer of molten material at its base, or it can move into the overriding plate in the form of dykes. If it underplates the crust, the basalt can (in theory) cause partial melting of the lower crust due to the transfer of heat and volatiles. Models of heat transfer, however, show that arc basalts emplaced at temperatures 1100–1240°C cannot provide enough heat to melt lower crustal amphibolite. [...] Basalt can, however, melt <b>pelitic</b> upper crustal material. [...] Andesitic magmas generated in island arcs, therefore, are probably the result of partial melting of the crust.|$|E

50|$|Cordierite {{typically}} {{occurs in}} contact or regional metamorphism of <b>pelitic</b> rocks. It is especially common in hornfels produced by contact metamorphism of <b>pelitic</b> rocks. Two common metamorphic mineral assemblages include sillimanite-cordierite-spinel and cordierite-spinel-plagioclase-orthopyroxene. Other associated minerals include garnet (cordierite-garnet-sillimanite gneisses) and anthophyllite. Cordierite also occurs in some granites, pegmatites, and norites in gabbroic magmas. Alteration products include mica, chlorite, and talc. Cordierite occurs, for example, in the granite contact zone at Geevor Tin Mine in Cornwall.|$|E

5000|$|Argillite (...) is a {{fine-grained}} {{sedimentary rock}} composed predominantly of indurated clay particles. Argillaceous rocks are basically lithified muds and oozes. They contain variable amounts of silt-sized particles. The argillites grade into shale when the fissile layering typical of shale is developed. Another name for poorly lithified argillites is mudstone. These rocks, although variable in composition, are typically high in aluminium and silica with variable alkali and alkaline earth cations. The term <b>pelitic</b> or pelite is often applied to these sediments and rocks. Metamorphism of argillites produces slate, phyllite, and <b>pelitic</b> schist.|$|E

50|$|The Morrissey Metamorphics are a {{group of}} {{metamorphic}} rocks dominated by <b>pelitic</b> and psammitic schists derived from the metamorphism of shales and sandstones. This unit also includes some metamorphosed mafic igneous rocks and carbonate rocks. The sedimentary precursors to the Morrissey Metamorphics were deposited after about 1840 Ma, and were deformed and metamorphosed at amphibolite facies during the 1830-1780 Ma Capricorn Orogeny, before being intruded by granites of the Moorarie Supersuite at 1810-1780 Ma.|$|E

The iron formation consists of laminated dark gray to black, fine-grained, hard, dense alternating 0.1 to 2 in layers of magnetite and metachert and varying amounts of amphibole. The average iron {{content in the}} Atlantic City area is about 33.5% and ranges as high as 56.23%.|$|E
50|$|The pluton ranges in {{composition}} from granite to tonolite (s-type) {{and is likely}} derived from crustal melting of <b>pelitic</b> rocks. The rocks show foliation indicating they were implaced early in the Acadian Orogeny and subsequently overprinted by later metamorphic events. Minerals in the Cardigan Pluton include large K-feldspar megacrysts and quartz, plagioclase, muscovite, garnet, biotite, and less abundant minerals including sillimanite, cordierite, ilmenite, graphite, apatite, monazite, zircon, and allanite. The pluton is dated at 411 +/- 19 Ma by the Rb/Sr method.|$|E
5000|$|The mineral {{enrichment}} is {{a result}} of the fluids expelled from peraluminous magmas. Peraluminous magmas results from the partial melting (anatexis) of metasedimentary rock and gneiss in the continental crust. Analysis of trace elements in the igneous rocks formed by this magma suggests that some of its material derives from melting of a <b>pelitic</b> rock of Lower Paleozoic age. Besides crustal components magmas did also involved sources in the mantle. The formation of these magmas is thus a form of crustal recycling.|$|E
5000|$|The Kyzyl Kum area {{basement}} {{is strongly}} folded and <b>pelitic</b> rocks have a well-developed axial planar cleavage. Isoclinal folds with east-striking axial planes become overturned to the north. Such isoclinal folding is interpreted {{to have occurred}} prior to deposition of the basement, which exhibits open folds with vertical axial planes. Metamorphic grade of the basement does not exceed greenschist facies {{over much of the}} region. [...] Rubidium - Strontium dating of metamorphic micas has indicated a Caledonian (Early Devonian) cooling age of 401 ± 11 million years.|$|E
50|$|On {{top of the}} Archean basement, the Aravalli Supergroup overlies {{with clear}} unconformities {{separating}} the two strata. The Aravalli Supergroup {{is divided into three}} groups: lower Delwara Group, middle Debari Group, and Upper Jharol Group. The lower and middle groups shared similar lithology, where both groups are dominated by carbonates, quartzite, and <b>pelitic</b> rocks, thus suggesting a shelf depositional environment. Turbidite facies and argillaceous rocks are prominent in the upper Jharol group, thus suggesting a deep marine depositional environment. The depositional age of these sequences ranges approximately from 2.1 to 1.9 Ga.|$|E
5000|$|Leucogranites {{have been}} {{reported}} {{from a variety of}} orogenies involving continental collisions. Examples include the Black Hills (Trans-Hudson orogeny of Proterozoic age), the Blue Ridge basement complex (Grenville orogeny of Proterozoic age), the Paleozoic Appalachian orogeny in Maine, and the currently active Himalayan orogeny. The leucogranite magmas are interpreted to have been derived by melting of <b>pelitic</b> rocks in the upper portions of thickened crust. These melts result following deformation and metamorphism, but the heat source is uncertain. [...] Shear-heating associated with large shear zones in the crust has been proposed as the mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Whether {{a certain}} index mineral occurs is also {{dependent}} on {{the composition of the}} rock itself. Many index minerals have complicated chemical compositions. If not all necessary elements are abundant, the mineral will not grow. When mapping the metamorphic grade of a terrane, a geologist has to take the lithology of the rock in account. Lithologies are mainly {{dependent on the}} protolith, the original rock before metamorphism. The main lithologies are ultramafic, mafic, felsic (or quartzo-feldspatic), <b>pelitic</b> and calcareous. In all of these (and other) lithologies, different combinations of minerals occur at a certain grade. The metamorphic zones in these lithologies can also be different.|$|E
5000|$|The type of {{metamorphic}} {{zones in}} a terrane are also {{determined by the}} form of metamorphism. This {{is dependent on the}} geodynamic (tectonic and magmatic) setting in which metamorphism took place. The sequence of metamorphic zones is called a metamorphic facies series, and the most common of these is Barrovian (called after George Barrow who first mentioned it in 1912). In this series of zones, both pressure and temperature increase gradually along the metamorphic gradient. Barrovian metamorphism takes place during regional metamorphism, caused by crustal thickening in the roots of an orogenic belt (under mountain chains). Barrovian zones are especially easy to recognize in <b>pelitic</b> rocks. The prograde sequence of Barrovian zones is: ...|$|E

50|$|Chlorite is {{commonly}} found in igneous rocks as an alteration product of mafic minerals such as pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. In this environment chlorite may be a retrograde metamorphic alteration mineral of existing ferromagnesian minerals, {{or it may be}} present as a metasomatism product via addition of Fe, Mg, or other compounds into the rock mass. Chlorite is a common mineral associated with hydrothermal ore deposits and commonly occurs with epidote, sericite, adularia and sulfide minerals. Chlorite is also a common metamorphic mineral, usually indicative of low-grade metamorphism. It is the diagnostic species of the zeolite facies and of lower greenschist facies. It occurs in the quartz, albite, sericite, chlorite, garnet assemblage of <b>pelitic</b> schist. Within ultramafic rocks, metamorphism can also produce predominantly clinochlore chlorite in association with talc.|$|E
5000|$|Illite {{crystallinity}} is {{a technique}} used to classify low-grade metamorphic activity in <b>pelitic</b> rocks. Determining the [...] "illite crystallinity index" [...] allows geologists to designate what metamorphic facies and metamorphic zone the rock was formed in and to infer what temperature the rock was formed. Several crystallinity indices have been proposed in recent years, but currently the Kübler index is being used due to its reproducibility and simplicity. The Kübler index is experimentally determined by measuring the full width at half maximum for the X-ray diffraction reflection peak along the (001) crystallographic axis of the rock sample. This value is an indirect measurement of the thickness of illite/muscovite packets which denote a change in metamorphic grade. The method can be used throughout the field of geology {{in areas such as}} the petroleum industry, plate tectonics.|$|E
