Placing the investigations of <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> in relation to sociality and spatiality, the paper advocates for departuring from spatiality that is the common ground between <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> and pattern conceptions. Hence, dis-missing both deterministic and free-will approaches to environmental design and addressing the <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> as a complex city problem, the study argues that adopting a kind of spatial knowledge and possibilistic approach is critical for both understanding and transforming the city in order to investigate the issue of <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> in relation to spatial patterns...|$|R

40|$|Crime is not random. Criminologists contend {{there is}} {{predictable}} rationality and definite patterning behind <b>urban</b> <b>crime.</b> Conventional research for crime analysis is statistical and empirical in nature. However, with increasing {{complexity of the}} involved sociological system, empirical deduction is not sufficient; mathematical and computational models are needed for reasoning about system dynamics. In this thesis, we posit a novel approach of computational modeling of <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> patterns. By combining the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formalism with the Multi Agent System (MAS) modeling paradigm, we obtain an abstract formal framework for semantic modeling and integration of established theories of crime analysis. Such a firm mathematical foundation also provides a quintessential platform for constructing discrete event simulation models. The framework can be applied for predictive and explanatory modeling of crime patterns. The virtue of this work is in its pioneering nature. It introduces an unprecedented, interdisciplinary research field of Computational Criminology...|$|R

40|$|Communicated by the {{associate}} editor name) Abstract. Hotspots of crime localized {{in space and}} time are well documented. Previous mathematical models of <b>urban</b> <b>crime</b> have exhibited these hotspots but considered a static or otherwise suboptimal police response to them. We introduce a program of police response to hotspots of crime in which the police adapt dynamically to changing crime patterns. In particular, they choose their deployment to solve an optimal control problem at every time. This gives rise to a free boundary problem for the police deployment’s spatial support. We present an efficient algorithm for solving this problem numerically and show that police presence can prompt surprising interactions among adjacent hotspots. 1. Introduction. 1. 1. <b>Crime</b> patterns. <b>Urban</b> <b>crime</b> is ubiquitous and heterogeneous: while it can certainly affect a whole city, clusters of crimes are often localized in time and space, forming “hot spots ” of increased criminal activity [5, 8].
