He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E
5|$|Typical to {{variations}} of the Irenaean theodicy {{is the notion that}} the present world is the greatest possible world, or the best of all <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.|$|E

50|$|A <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> is {{used here}} as an {{informal}} term. Formally a <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> {{is defined by}} a Boolean condition. A <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> may be considered the set of possibilities for the world that match the condition.|$|R

5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the best of all <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E
25|$|Plenitude. Leibniz {{believed}} that {{the best of all}} <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> would actualize every genuine possibility, and argued in Théodicée that this best of all <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> will contain all possibilities, with our finite experience of eternity giving no reason to dispute nature's perfection.|$|E

50|$|The idea is {{that there}} is a <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> with finitely many things. One can thus get another <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> by taking a single thing away, and one does not need to add any other thing as its replacement. Then one can take another thing away, and another, until one is left with a <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> that is empty.|$|R
25|$|David Kellogg Lewis, {{another student}} of Quine at Harvard, was ranked {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} philosophers of the 20th century in a poll conducted by Brian Leiter (open access poll). He is well known for his controversial advocacy of modal realism, the position which holds that there is an infinite number of concrete and causally isolated <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> of which ours is one. These <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> arise in the field of modal logic.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} (and {{the somewhat}} related concept of <b>possible</b> <b>worlds)</b> {{has been associated}} to numerous themes in literature, art and science fiction.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{has some}} similarity to modal realism in philosophy, {{which is the}} view that the <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> used to interpret modal claims exist and are of a kind with the actual world. Unlike the <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> of philosophy, however, in quantum mechanics counterfactual alternatives can influence the results of experiments, as in the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing problem or the Quantum Zeno effect. Also, while the worlds of the many-worlds interpretation all share the same physical laws, modal realism postulates a world for every way things could conceivably have been.|$|E
5000|$|Lewis {{begins his}} attack on [...] "ersatzism" [...] in this chapter, rejecting Quine's {{suggestion}} that a <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> {{might be taken}} as a mathematical representation giving the coordinates of the spacetime points that are occupied by matter. No <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> is identical with any Quinean ersatz world, but for every such ersatz world there is a genuine <b>possible</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thus, if {{physical}}ism is true, a metaphysically <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> {{in which}} all physical facts {{are the same as}} those of the actual world must contain everything that exists in our actual world. In particular, conscious experience must exist in such a <b>possible</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R
50|$|How {{can you be}} {{one year}} older than you are? One way {{is to say that}} there is a <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> where you exist. Another way is for you to have a {{counterpart}} in that <b>possible</b> <b>world,</b> who has the property of being one year older than you.|$|R
25|$|For any {{consistent}} theory {{this usually}} {{does not give}} just one world of objects, but an infinity of <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> that the theory might equally describe, with a possible diversity of truths between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy {{emerges from the}} modal notion of logical possibility. A traditional Wittgensteinian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence {{was associated with a}} region in the space of <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true.|$|E
50|$|David Lewis defended Modal realism. This is {{the view}} that a <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> is a concrete, maximal {{connected}} spatio-temporal region. The actual world {{is one of the}} possible worlds; it is also concrete. Because a single concrete object demands spatio-temporal connectedness, a possible concrete object can only exist in one <b>possible</b> <b>world.</b> Still, we say true things like: It is possible that Hubert Humphrey won the 1968 US presidential election. How is it true? Humphrey has a counterpart in another <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> that wins the 1968 election in that world.|$|R
50|$|A {{conceptual}} {{model is a}} formal structure representing a <b>possible</b> <b>world,</b> comprising a conceptual schema {{and a set of}} facts that instantiate the conceptual schema. The conceptual schema is a combination of concepts and facts of what is possible, necessary, permissible, and obligatory in each <b>possible</b> <b>world.</b> The set of facts instantiates the conceptual schema by assertion to describe one <b>possible</b> <b>world.</b> A rule is a fact that asserts either a logical necessity or an obligation. Obligations are not necessarily satisfied by the facts; necessities are always satisfied.|$|R

25|$|To {{avoid the}} {{unhappiness}} of aimless desire, the Will realizes the ideas already potentially {{present and the}} Unconscious becomes actual. The existence {{of the universe is}} the result, then, of the illogical Will, but its characteristics and laws are all due to the Idea or Reason and are, therefore, logical. It is the best of all <b>possible</b> <b>worlds,</b> which contains the promise of the redemption of the Unconscious from actual existence by the exercise of Reason in partnership with the Will in the consciousness of the enlightened pessimist.|$|E
25|$|The Theodicy {{tries to}} justify the {{apparent}} imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.|$|E
25|$|Science {{fiction is}} {{largely based on}} writing rationally about {{alternative}} <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> or futures. It is related to, but different from fantasy in that, {{within the context of}} the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically established or scientifically postulated physical laws (though some elements in a story might still be pure imaginative speculation). The settings of science fiction are often contrary to those of consensus reality, but most science fiction relies on a considerable degree of suspension of disbelief, which is facilitated in the reader's mind by potential scientific explanations or solutions to various fictional elements.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I outline a {{comprehensive}} theory of legal interpretation {{based on an}} assumption that legal text, understood as the aggregate of texts of all legal acts in force {{at a particular time}} and place, describes one rational and coherent <b>possible</b> <b>world.</b> The picture of this <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> is decoded from the text by interpreters and serves as a holistic model to which the real world is adjusted when the law is applied. From the above premise I will limit myself to drawing two conclusions for how legal interpretation should be carried out. First, I argue that the <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> described by the legal text has to be ‘accessible’ from the real world, i. e. it has to be feasible to transform the actual world into the described one. Were it otherwise, the <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> could not {{serve as a model for}} adjustment. The accessibility requirement imposes obligations on the interpreters to secure the rationality of the <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> decoded from the text, amongst other to secure that the description of this world is not contradictory and – as a consequence – the law of excluded middle is obeyed in the <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> described by the legal text. Secondly, I argue for the inevitability of interpretative discretion arising from the requirement to decode a sufficiently ‘saturated’ picture of the <b>possible</b> <b>world.,</b> i. e. possessing enough properties to resemble the actual world. As texts have a limited number of sentences and worlds have an unlimited number of properties, interpreters have to supplement the picture of a <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> to achieve its coherence. This involves the inclusion of some additional, non-predetermined features that integrate with the properties of the world predefined by the legal text. This process of saturation consists of filling in so-called ‘places of indeterminacy’ (Roman Ingarden) with content implicated by other features of the <b>possible</b> <b>world.</b> I also argue that the discretion resulting from the necessity of filling in the places of indeterminacy is justified by the requirement of fulfilling the intention of the lawmaker to make the <b>possible</b> <b>world</b> described by the legal text real. The theory presented here is based on contemporary theories of discourse representation and so-called ‘text-world theory’ by J. Gavins. Phenomenalism and causal (historical) theories of reference provide its philosophical background...|$|R

25|$|Semantics is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that examines the meaning of natural language, the notion of reference and denotation, {{and the concept of}} <b>possible</b> <b>worlds.</b> One concept used in the study of semantics is predicate logic, which is a system that uses symbols and alphabet letters to represent the overall meaning of a sentence. Quantifiers in semantics – such as the quantifier in the antecedent of a bound variable pronoun – can be expressed in two ways. There is an existential quantifier, ∃, meaning some. There is also a universal quantifier, ∀, meaning every, each, or all. Ambiguity arises when there are multiple quantifiers in one sentence.|$|E
500|$|The way Magic storylines are {{conceived}} and deployed has changed considerably over the years. The main premise of Magic is that countless <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> (planes) {{exist in the}} , and only unique and rare beings called Planeswalkers are capable of traversing the Multiverse. This allows the game to frequently change worlds so as to renew its mechanical inspiration, while maintaining planeswalkers as recurrent, common elements across worlds. An intricate storyline underlies the cards released in each expansion and {{is shown in the}} art and flavor text of the cards, as well as in novels and anthologies published by Wizards of the Coast (and formerly by Harper Prism). Important storyline characters, objects and locations often appear as cards in Magic sets, usually as [...] "Legendary" [...] creatures, artifacts, and lands, or as [...] "Planeswalker" [...] cards.|$|E
500|$|Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a {{world can}} be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures {{complete}} the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist <b>possible</b> <b>worlds</b> where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a world segment, meaning everything about that world up {{to the point where the}} person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world.
