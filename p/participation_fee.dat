25|$|In June 2010, American {{philosopher and}} theorist Judith Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony, arguing and lamenting {{in a speech}} that the parade had become too commercial, and was {{ignoring}} the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants. According to Butler, even the organizers themselves promote racism. The {{general manager of the}} CSD committee, Robert Kastl, countered Butler's allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counselling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in 2006. Regarding the allegations of commercialism Kastl explained further that the CSD organizers don't require small groups to pay a <b>participation</b> <b>fee</b> which starts at 50 € and goes up to 1500 €.

40|$|Due to cuts in {{educational}} funding in the United States, interscholastic athletic administrators {{have turned to}} corporate sponsorship to fund athletic departments. While the academic literature in sport management has extensively covered corporate sponsorship at the intercollegiate and professional level, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to examine the prevalence, nature, and importance of sponsorship to high school athletics in the United States. This paper identified factors that predicted the use of sponsorship, the amount of revenue generated from sponsorship, who is responsible for selling sponsorship, motivators behind not soliciting sponsorship, and the extent to which fundraising and <b>participation</b> <b>fees</b> are utilized to supplement athletic department budgets. The most common form of alternative revenue generation is fund raising (87 % of schools followed by), sponsorship (57 %) and <b>participation</b> <b>fees</b> (34 %). One-third of schools reported using sponsorship in response to budget cuts, and over one-fourth solicited sponsorship to prevent charging <b>participation</b> <b>fees.</b> Results also indicated that while the majority of high school athletic departments solicited corporate sponsorship, administrators were cautious in the so-licitation of sponsorship as evidenced by the small dollar amounts involved and overall impact on the budget, reliance on game program advertisements and facility signage to activate sponsorships, and a lack of outsourcing to sport marketing firms to sell the sponsorships. There is clearly room for growth in the interscholastic sport sponsorship market...|$|R
