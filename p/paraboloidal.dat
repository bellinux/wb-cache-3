5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a <b>paraboloidal</b> dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping it some degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to use two parabolic troughs, curved in perpendicular directions, to bring sunlight to a point focus as does a <b>paraboloidal</b> reflector.The incoming light strikes one of the troughs, which sends it toward a line focus. The second trough intercepts the converging light and focuses it to a point.|$|E
25|$|A Scheffler cooker (named {{after its}} inventor, Wolfgang Scheffler) uses a large ideally <b>paraboloidal</b> {{reflector}} which is rotated around an axis that is {{parallel with the}} earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour {{to compensate for the}} earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day. The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's declination. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains <b>paraboloidal,</b> but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up {{of a large number of}} small plane sections, such as glass mirrors, joined together by flexible plastic. A framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly <b>paraboloidal,</b> but it is always close enough for cooking purposes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paraboloidal</b> reflectors {{that have}} their centres of mass {{coincident}} with their focal points are useful. They {{can be easily}} turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky, rotating about any axis that passes through the focus. Two perpendicular axes can be used, intersecting at the focus, to allow the paraboloid to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one. The cooking pot stays stationary at the focus. If the <b>paraboloidal</b> reflector is axially symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness, its centre of mass coincides with its focus if {{the depth of the}} reflector, measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim, is 1.8478 times its focal length. The radius of the rim of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length. The angular radius of the rim, as seen from the focal point, is 72.68 degrees.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} principle of a parabolic antenna {{is that a}} point source of radio waves at the focal point {{in front of a}} <b>paraboloidal</b> reflector of conductive material will be reflected into a collimated plane wave beam along the axis of the reflector. Conversely, an incoming plane wave parallel to the axis will be focused to a point at the focal point.|$|E
25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the <b>paraboloidal</b> shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make <b>paraboloidal</b> mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Since the Newtonian {{reflector}} is {{the most}} common telescope built by amateur telescope makers, large sections of the literature on the subject are devoted to fabrication of the primary mirror. The mirror has to be carefully ground, polished and figured to an extremely accurate shape, usually a paraboloid. Telescopes with high focal ratios may use spherical mirrors since the difference in the two shapes is insignificant at those ratios. The tools used to achieve this shape are surprisingly simple, consisting of a similarly sized glass tool, a series of finer abrasives, and a polishing pitch lap made from a type of tree sap. Through a whole series of random strokes the mirror naturally tends to become spherical in shape. At that point, a variation in polishing strokes is typically used to create and perfect the desired <b>paraboloidal</b> shape.|$|E

2500|$|Important {{developments}} in reflecting telescopes were John Hadley's production of larger <b>paraboloidal</b> mirrors in 1721; {{the process of}} silvering glass mirrors introduced by Léon Foucault in 1857; [...] and the adoption of long-lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932. The Ritchey-Chretien variant of Cassegrain reflector was invented around 1910, but not widely adopted until after 1950; many modern telescopes including the Hubble Space Telescope use this design, which gives a wider field of view than a classic Cassegrain.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the mirror}} is {{polished}} out it is placed vertically in a stand. The Foucault tester {{is set up}} at a distance close to the mirror's radius of curvature. The tester is adjusted so that the returning beam from the pinhole light source is interrupted by the knife edge. Viewing the mirror from behind the knife edge shows a pattern on the mirror surface. If the mirror surface {{is part of a}} perfect sphere, the mirror appears evenly lighted across the entire surface. If the mirror is spherical but with defects such as bumps or depressions, the defects appear greatly magnified in height. [...] If the surface is <b>paraboloidal,</b> the mirror looks like a doughnut or lozenge. It is possible to calculate how closely the mirror surface resembles a perfect paraboloid by placing a special mask over the mirror and taking a series of measurements with the tester.

50|$|One {{design of}} {{telescope}} uses a rotating mirror {{consisting of a}} liquid metal in a tray which is spun at constant speed. As the tray spins the liquid forms a <b>paraboloidal</b> surface of essentially unlimited size. This allows for very big telescope mirrors (over 6 metres), but unfortunately they cannot be steered, as they always point vertically.|$|E
50|$|Liquid mirror telescopes are telescopes with mirrors {{made with}} a {{reflective}} liquid. The most common liquid used is mercury, but other liquids will work as well (for example, low melting alloys of gallium). The liquid and its container are rotated at a constant speed around a vertical axis, which causes {{the surface of the}} liquid to assume a <b>paraboloidal</b> shape, suitable for use as the primary mirror of a reflecting telescope. The rotating liquid assumes the <b>paraboloidal</b> shape regardless of the container's shape. To reduce the amount of liquid metal needed, and thus weight, a rotating mercury mirror uses a container that is as close to the necessary parabolic shape as possible. Liquid mirrors can be a low cost alternative to conventional large telescopes. Compared to a solid glass mirror that must be cast, ground, and polished, a rotating liquid metal mirror is much less expensive to manufacture.|$|E
