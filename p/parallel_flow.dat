For 2 -dimensional perturbations {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the flow, a Lyapunov functional is constructed explicitly by two slightly different methods.

40|$|The general {{stability}} {{criteria of}} inviscid Taylor-Couette flows with angular velocity Ω(r) are obtained analytically. First, a necessary instability criterion for centrifugal flows is derived as ξ'(Ω-Ω_s) < 0 (or ξ'/(Ω-Ω_s) < 0) {{somewhere in the}} flow field, where ξ is the vorticitiy of profile and Ω_s is the angular velocity at the inflection point ξ'= 0. Second, a criterion for stability is found as -(μ_ 1 + 1 /r_ 2) <f(r) =ξ'/Ω-Ω_s< 0, where μ_ 1 is the smallest eigenvalue. The new criteria are the analogues of the criteria for <b>parallel</b> <b>flows,</b> which are special cases of Arnol'd's nonlinear criteria.

40|$|Research on lateral {{exchange}} of streamwise momentum between <b>parallel</b> <b>flows</b> in open channels has mainly {{been focused on}} compound channels composed of a main channel and a floodplain, on mixing layer development downstream of river confluences, and on partially vegetated channels. This study aims to establish the mechanisms responsible for streamwise momentum exchange between concurrent <b>parallel</b> <b>flows</b> subject to different bed roughnesses. The contribution of momentum {{exchange of}} each mechanism is determined {{on the basis of}} flume experiments. For an initially uniform flow that experiences a bed with two parallel lanes of different roughnesses, three mechanisms for exchange of streamwise momentum can be distinguished: cross?channel secondary circulations, turbulent mixing resulting from vortices acting in the horizontal plane, and mass transfer from the decelerating flow over the rough?bottomed lane to the accelerating <b>flow</b> in the <b>parallel</b> smooth?bottomed lane. The mass transfer and associated momentum transfer across the channel cause a gain in longitudinal momentum. The secondary circulations are driven by turbulence anisotropy and feature a main cell that extends over the full water depth, which is centered at the smooth side of the smooth?to?rough transition. The gain of momentum corresponding to the mass transfer in the developing reach is on the same order of magnitude as the momentum exchange by turbulent mixing and of that by secondary circulations in the most downstream position, where the flow is nearly developed. The contribution of the secondary circulations to the exchange of streamwise momentum between the <b>parallel</b> <b>flows</b> gradually becomes dominant over the contribution of turbulent mixing when depth increases.

40|$|In this work, {{we focus}} on {{congestion}} control mechanisms in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for emerging very-high bandwidth-delay product networks and suggest several congestion control schemes for parallel and single-flow TCP. Recently, several high-speed TCP proposals have been suggested to overcome the limited throughput achievable by single-flow TCP by modifying its congestion control mechanisms. In the meantime, users overcome the throughput limitations in high bandwidth-delay product networks by using multiple <b>parallel</b> TCP <b>flows,</b> without modifying TCP itself. However, the evident lack of fairness between the high-speed TCP proposals (or parallel TCP) and existing standard TCP has increasingly become an issue. In many scenarios where flows require high throughput, such as grid computing or content distribution networks, often multiple connections {{go to the same}} or nearby destinations and tend to share long portions of paths (and bottlenecks). In such cases benefits can be gained by sharing congestion information. To take advantage of this additional information, we first propose a collaborative congestion control scheme for <b>parallel</b> TCP <b>flows.</b> Although the use of <b>parallel</b> TCP <b>flows</b> is an easy and effective way for reliable high-speed data transfer, <b>parallel</b> TCP <b>flows</b> are inherently unfair with respect to single TCP flows. In this thesis we propose, implement, and evaluate a natural extension for aggregated aggressiveness control in <b>parallel</b> TCP <b>flows.</b> To improve the effectiveness of single TCP flows over high bandwidth-delay product networks without causing fairness problems, we suggest a new TCP congestion control scheme that effectively and fairly utilizes high bandwidth-delay product networks by adaptively controlling the flow??s aggressiveness according to network situations using a competition detection mechanism. We argue that competition detection is more appropriate than congestion detection or bandwidth estimation. We further extend the adaptive aggressiveness control mechanism and the competition detection mechanism from single <b>flows</b> to <b>parallel</b> <b>flows.</b> In this way we achieve adaptive aggregated aggressiveness control. Our evaluations show that the resulting implementation is effective and fair. As a result, we show that single or <b>parallel</b> TCP <b>flows</b> in end-hosts can achieve high performance over emerging high bandwidth-delay product networks without requiring special support from networks or modifications to receivers...|$|R
