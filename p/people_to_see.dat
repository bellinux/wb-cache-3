5|$|Written by Dennis Spooner, {{this story}} was to be {{concerned}} with a planet where drugs in the food and water are used to control the populace. Punishment would be meted out by temporary withdrawal from the drugs which would cause <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> monsters all around them. The storyline for the four-part story was commissioned on 31 January 1975 and the full scripts on 4 February 1975.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{developments}} in electronic media made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> hear and participate in all the familiar forms stories, theatre, music, dance wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing miniaturisation. Computerisation and the development of barcodes also made ticketing easier, faster and global.|$|E
5|$|When {{he was a}} young adult, Samson {{left the}} hills of his <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the cities of Philistia. He {{fell in love with a}} Philistine woman from Timnah, whom he decided to marry, {{ignoring}} the objections of his parents, who were concerned because the Israelites were forbidden to marry Gentiles. In the development of the narrative, the intended marriage was shown to be part of God's plan to strike at the Philistines.|$|E
5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{in the dark}} unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology {{and the use of}} red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

5|$|Mohamed was the {{youngest}} person to represent Somalia at the London Games {{at the age of}} 18. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. In an interview with The Guardian before the Games, Mohamed said he wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a Somali athlete competing at the Olympics and wanted to influlence the international community's view of his country away from being a nation afflicted by war and without any development. He wanted to win a medal because of his long training routine. Mohamed was drawn in the men's 1500 metres second heat on 3 August, finishing 13th out of 14 athletes, with a time of three minutes and 46.16 seconds. He finished ahead of Yemen's Nabil Al-Garbi (three minutes and 55.46 seconds) but behind Jamale Aarrass of France (three minutes and 45.13 seconds) in a heat led by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Shaween (three minutes and 39.42 seconds).

The group {{may have been the}} first non-indigenous <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Yosemite Valley. The Walker party probably visited either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of Giant Sequoia, becoming the first non-indigenous <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the giant trees, but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839, in a print shop fire in Philadelphia.|$|E

A crew turned up at the Belgian port of Antwerp in early September 1940 and, for two days, they filmed tanks and troops landing from barges on a nearby beach under simulated fire.

25|$|Convex mirrors {{provide a}} wider {{field of view}} than flat mirrors, and are often used on vehicles, {{especially}} large trucks, to minimize blind spots. They are sometimes placed at road junctions, and corners of sites such as parking lots to allow <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> around corners to avoid crashing into other vehicles or shopping carts. They are also sometimes used as part of security systems, so that a single video camera can show more than one angle at a time.|$|E
