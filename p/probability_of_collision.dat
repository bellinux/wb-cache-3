40|$|BACKGROUND: Free-flying insectivorous bats {{occasionally}} {{collide with}} stationary objects they should easily detect by echolocation and avoid. Collisions often occur with lighted objects, suggesting ambient light may deleteriously affect obstacle avoidance capabilities. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} free-flying bats may orient by vision when they collide with some obstacles. We additionally tested whether acoustic distractions, such as "distress calls" of other bats, contributed to <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate the role of visual cues in the <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> free-flying little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) with stationary objects, we set up obstacles {{in an area of}} high bat traffic during swarming. We used combinations of light intensities and visually dissimilar obstacles to verify that bats orient by vision. In early August, bats collided more often in the light than the dark, and <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision</b> varied with the visibility of obstacles. However, the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>collisions</b> altered in mid to late August, coincident with the start of behavioural, hormonal, and physiological changes occurring during swarming and mating. Distress calls did not distract bats and increase the incidence <b>of</b> <b>collisions.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate that visual cues are more important for free-flying bats than previously recognized, suggesting integration of multi-sensory modalities during orientation. Furthermore, our study highlights differences between responses of captive and wild bats, indicating a need for more field experiments...|$|R
