25|$|Synonyms for ORS, many historical, include bromidrosiphobia, {{olfactory}} <b>phobic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> chronic olfactory paranoid syndrome, autodysomophobia, {{delusions of}} bromosis, hallucinations of smell and olfactory delusional syndrome. By definition, the many terms {{which have been}} suggested in the dental literature to refer to subjective halitosis complaints (i.e. where a person complains of halitosis yet no odor is detectable clinically) {{can also be considered}} under the umbrella of ORS. Examples include halitophobia, non-genuine halitosis, delusional halitosis, pseudo-halitosis, imaginary halitosis, psychosomatic halitosis, and self halitosis.|$|E
40|$|Bowel and bladder {{obsession}} (bowel/bladder-control anxiety; BBCA) is a viscerally-centred <b>phobic</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{involving a}} specific concern about {{losing control of}} bowel or bladder functioning in a public place. Like other anxiety disorders, BBCA is characterised by intrusive imagery. We have previously described the nature of intrusive mental imagery in bowel/bladder-control anxiety and found imagery themes {{to be linked to}} actual experiences of loss of control or to ‘near misses’. A causal role for imagery in symptom maintenance can be inferred by examining the effects of imagery rescripting. Moreover, successful rescripting may point to a potentially efficacious avenue for treatment development. Three cases of imagery rescripting are described here with pre-, post- and follow-up (one week) data reported. After rescripting,two participants experienced pronounced reductions in imagery vividness, distress, shame, disgust and belief conviction. Most importantly, all three participants experienced a reduction in fear-associated bladder and/or bowel sensations. The results support a causal role for mental imagery in bowel-bladder-control anxiety and suggest that rescripting of distressing intrusive memories linked to recurrent images may be a useful avenue for development of cognitive-behavioral treatments of bladder/bowel-control anxiety...|$|E
50|$|Davutoğlu {{identifies}} {{two conditions}} for Turkey {{to succeed in}} its global strategic ambitions. The first refers to its domestic politics, while the second to its relations with neighbours. On the domestic front, Turkey needs to resolve its own Kurdish question, as well as bridge the growing rift between the Islamist and secularist elements of Turkish society. Davutoğlu advocates the resolution of both conflicts {{on the basis of}} liberal principles: Turkey’s strategic potential will be released if a fair and lasting solution for the Kurdish issue is reached, which will guarantee Kurdish minority rights within Turkey and a liberal consensus is achieved on the question of secularism between different segments of Turkish society. On the international front, Davutoğlu argues that Turkey needs to resolve all the bilateral disputes which have hampered its relations with its neighbours. In what was coined as “zero problem policy with neighbours,” he states that in recent decades Turkey has wasted crucial efforts and time in conflicts with its neighbours. For Turkey to become a regional leader and play a global strategic role, it needs to overcome <b>phobic</b> <b>syndromes</b> and establish cordial relations with all its neighbours. Its foreign policy should aim to resolve all the pending disputes which Turkey’s diplomatic inertia had accumulated in the past, so it can seek its own global strategic role. Developing close relations with all rising global powers, China, India, Russia and Brazil, would be a key in that process. Seeking a leading role in intercivilisational and interreligious dialogue would become one of Turkey’s leading priorities, as Turkey could capitalise on his historical and cultural legacy.|$|R
40|$|Background: The project Ã¢â‚¬Å“Homeopathy for LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢AquilaÃ¢â‚¬Â was {{developed}} {{in order to provide}} humanitarian and professional assistance to the people of LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aquila, who were the victims of a devastating earthquake during the night of April 6 th, 2009. This project was promoted by the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Medici Omeopati (FIAMO) and supported by the governmental organization for Emergencies (Protezione Civile). &# 13; &# 13; Aim: This paper is the report of that experience in the state of absolute emergency, which lasted 17 months. It aims to be a feasibility study as well as a model for further emergencies. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: A medical office was located in a container of 60 square meters which was open from Monday to Friday, beginning in August 2009 and lasting until December 2010. This was provided by Protezione Civile with all the basic equipment, including a reception with a secretary. There were 16 homeopathic physicians and 2 acupuncturists, coming from all over Italy. Every month they rotated to offer free consultations of Classical Homeopathy, as well as Acupuncture and Neuraltherapy. Only people coming from the earthquake area were admitted: all of them signed an informed consent. An operational protocol was defined for the data collection. Each consultation was reported in a special register. The follow-up period lasted 17 months. The protocol consisted of the first consultation and at least 3 control visits, when possible at 30, 60 and 120 day intervals. As a primary outcome the main complaint of the patient was considered in its relation to the quality of life. This evaluation followed a slightly modified criterion of a qualitative scale: Outcome in Relation to Impact on Daily Living (ORIDL). A statistical analysis with some non parametric tests was carried out (Kolmogorof,). Even the most frequently prescribed homeopathic medicines were taken into consideration. &# 13; &# 13; Results: 674 patients were visited from August 2009 to December 2010. In total 1, 542 medical visits and treatments were carried out (1, 070 as Homeopathy; 280 as Neuraltherapy; 192 as Acupuncture). 366 patients received Classical Homeopathy. The most frequently treated syndromes were of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“psychiatricÃ¢â‚¬Â type (162 cases= 44 %), prevalently due to the consequences of the earthquake, such as sleeping disturbances, <b>phobic</b> states, anxious-depressive <b>syndromes,</b> etc. The drop-outs were 235 out of 366 (= 64 %). 107 patients presented for a minimum 3 follow-ups. Here are the results: cured (52 %), major improvement (33 %), moderate and slight improvement (12 %), no change (3 %), deterioration (0 %). The statistical analysis (D = 51 > 1, 949; = 48, 039 > 10, 83) showed a significance higher than 1 Ã¢â‚¬Â°. Within this group, 68 patients suffering from psychiatric syndromes, who came for a 3 rd follow up, showed a similar trend: cured (50 %), major improvement (24 %), moderate and slight improvement (19 %), no change (7 %), deterioration (0 %). Also in this case the statistical analysis indicated a significance higher than 1 Ã¢â‚¬Â° (D = 30 > 1, 949). The most frequently prescribed medicines were Pulsatilla, Sepia, Arsenicum Album, Argentum Nitricum and Lycopodium. &# 13; &# 13; Discussion: The numerous inconveniences due to the emergency certainly did not permit the usual control visits. Moreover a strict observance of the protocol was not always possible, which could explain such a high number of drop-outs. Those patients who completed the therapy had an incremental improvement in their health between the 1 st and the 3 rd follow-up visit. In the final analysis a series of Ã¢â‚¬Å“strengthsÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“weaknessesÃ¢â‚¬Â in the project were noted. This knowledge could be helpful for future emergencies. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusions: The project Ã¢â‚¬Å“Homeopathy for LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢AquilaÃ¢â‚¬Â allowed, {{for the first time in}} Italy, an official implementation of Homeopathy in an emergency plan of great impact, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, made a precious human and professional experience possible. Moreover the results obtained have demonstrated that Homeopathy can play an important role socially as well as therapeutically. To the present date there have neither been internationally recognized guidelines nor publications with similar data concerning emergencies. Therefore this project could represent an important reference point for similar events...|$|R
