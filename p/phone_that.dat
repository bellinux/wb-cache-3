5|$|The game {{features}} nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple {{different ways}} to achieve objectives. This includes travelling between different areas in an open world and making choices that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternative endings depending on who the player identifies as the culprit. However, {{only one of the}} characters is the true culprit, while the others are red herrings; if the player closes the case with the wrong culprit, then the player will face criticism from the police chief and need to re-open the case. The game includes a <b>phone</b> <b>that</b> could be used to manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features an inventory system requiring the examination and collection of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game.|$|E

5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the <b>phone</b> <b>that</b> his brother and the entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported by a packet-based multiplexing node, we study the MMBP/D/ 1 queuing model. Similar as in the circuit-switched case, where the Engset formula is used to {{determine the}} number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported by a switch, the fact <b>that</b> not all <b>phones</b> are active and talking all of the time can be exploited in the packet-based case. We investigate the impact of the link rate, the activity grade, the codec bit rate and the silence suppression factor on the number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported. We also compare the number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported by the node according to the MMBP/D/ 1 model with the number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported according to the M/D/ 1 model. If the activity grade of the phones is low, the M/D/ 1 model overestimates the number of <b>phones</b> <b>that</b> can be supported, even for high link rates. Only in the case where the phones are active all the time, the M/D/ 1 model gives accurate results. Reducing the codec bit rate yields a larger gain than expected because aggregating more sources of lower bit rate decreases the burstiness. Activating silence suppression on each phone normally results in the expected gain, because the additional burstiness introduced by silence suppression is negligible, if the activity grade of the phones is not too high. 1...|$|R

Payne refused to believe it, since they had been so helpful in championing Sarah's Law. She even wrote an editorial in the newspaper's final edition. Investigators initially thought she was not hacked because her name did not come up in records. However, personal details relating to her were found that were attributed to another suspected victim.

The police believe that she and two other victims were killed between this time and 8:00AM, which was the moment at which Mrs Haroková's wristwatch stopped. A post woman arrived at the door shortly before nine. The doorbell was answered by Dahlgren, who accepted the mail. Two hours later, a cleaner came to the house, but was sent away by Dahlgren immediately after entering the hallway. Meanwhile, the fourth victim, David, who was at school, received text messages from Dahlgren's <b>phone</b> <b>that</b> they would go running after his return.

25|$|When the Lumia 920 was {{announced}} in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows <b>Phone</b> <b>that</b> could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly. Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation: the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft. The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, {{as well as for}} Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware {{and turn it into a}} devices and services company.
