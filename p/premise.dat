This allows to distinguish consequences {{based on the number}} of <b>premises</b> that support them, and also to reduce the set of <b>premises</b> while maintaining the same consequences. Since the relation between <b>premises</b> and hypotheses is, in some sense, similar to the relation between consequences and <b>premises,</b> analogous ratios are defined for hypotheses and <b>premises...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made that}} calculated the risk of disease for <b>premises</b> in the most heavily affected parts of the county of Cumbria during the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in the UK in 2001. In over half the cases the occurrence of the disease was not directly attributable to a recently infected <b>premises</b> being located within 1. 5 km. <b>Premises</b> more than 1. 5 km from recently infected <b>premises</b> faced sufficiently high infection risks that culling within a 1. 5 km radius of the infected <b>premises</b> alone could not have prevented {{the progress of the}} epidemic. A comparison of the final outcome in two areas of the county, south Penrith and north Cumbria, indicated that focusing on controlling the potential spread of the disease over short distances by culling <b>premises</b> contiguous to infected <b>premises,</b> while the disease continued to spread over longer distances, may have resulted in excessive numbers of <b>premises</b> being culled. Even though the contiguous cull in south Penrith appeared to have resulted in a smaller proportion of <b>premises</b> becoming infected, the overall proportion of <b>premises</b> culled was considerably greater than in north Cumbria, where, because of staff and resource limitations, a smaller proportion of <b>premises</b> contiguous to infected <b>premises</b> was culle...|$|R

The allotment of the <b>premises</b> in Amakusa-machi changed twice greatly during Syoho 4 years from Jyokyo 2 years, and Manji 2 years from Keicho 18 years.

50|$|Throughout the United Kingdom, {{the sale}} of alcohol is restricted—pubs, restaurants, shops and other <b>premises</b> must be {{licensed}} by the local authority. In England, Wales and Scotland the authority to sell alcohol {{is divided into two}} parts - the <b>Premises</b> Licence, which prescribes the times and conditions under which alcohol can be sold, and a Personal Licence which allows individuals to sell alcohol or authorise its sale by others. Every <b>Premises</b> Licence which authorises {{the sale of}} alcohol must also name a Designated <b>Premises</b> Supervisor (Designated <b>Premises</b> Manager in Scotland) (“DPS” or “DPM” for short) who must hold a valid Personal Licence - otherwise alcohol cannot be sold at that <b>premises.</b> The DPS has day-to-day responsibility for the sale of alcohol at licensed <b>premises.</b> <b>Premises</b> licences, in as far as they concern the sale of alcohol, can be categorised to include on-licences (allowing consumption of alcohol on the <b>premises)</b> and off-licences. However, these distinctions are not explicitly made in the Licensing Act 2003, and the position in Scotland and Northern Ireland is more complex. Many on-licensed <b>premises</b> also permit off-sales.|$|R

The thesis is focused on the lease and sublease of non-residential <b>premises.</b> Of the whole scope of rights of disposition I have focused on the right to grant leases, because its legal relations are very common in our daily life. Main goal of the thesis is to analyse the application of relevant Czech legislation and current Czech case law in case of the lease of non-residential <b>premises.</b> The thesis is divided into three chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of disposition of non-residential <b>premises.</b> Chapter One is introductory and defines the term non-residential <b>premises</b> and the basic terminology.
