5|$|The Circles of Sustainability {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological sustainability of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E
25|$|Palmer {{was one of}} {{many new}} Labour MPs elected in what was a {{landslide}} election for Labour in 1997. He held the seat comfortably with an increased majority at the 2001 election, and again with a reduced majority in 2005 election. An opinion piece suggested that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Palmer had held his seat was due to his high constituency work rate. In the 2010 election, the seat was lost to the Conservative candidate Anna Soubry, reflecting a national swing.|$|E

25|$|In November 1917, the Scots Greys saw {{a glimpse}} of their future when they moved to support the {{armoured}} attack at the Battle of Cambrai. Initially intended {{to be part of}} the exploitation force, as at the Battle of the Somme, the plan failed to develop the type of break through which could be exploited by the cavalry. As the fighting bogged down, the Scots Greys once again found themselves fighting on foot in an infantry role. Interestingly, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the Scots Greys were unable to advance as cavalry was because the bridge that was crucial to the advance was accidentally destroyed when the tank crossing it proved to be too heavy. Unable to advance mounted, the Scots Greys were committed as infantry to the battle.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{changes were}} at NBC and ESPN. Michael Irvin's {{contract}} with ESPN was not renewed, and former coach Bill Parcells {{returned to the}} network after four years as Cowboys head coach. Parcells left before the season ended to become the Miami Dolphins VP of Player Personnel. Another pair of former Cowboys, Emmitt Smith and Keyshawn Johnson also provided roles in the studio for Sunday NFL Countdown and Monday Night Countdown. At Monday Night Football, Joe Theismann was dropped (and would later resign from the network) after seventeen years in the booth between the Sunday and Monday Night packages, and former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback and current Philadelphia Soul (AFL) president Ron Jaworski took his place alongside Mike Tirico and Tony Kornheiser. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Jaworski replaced Theismann was because of his chemistry with Kornheiser on Pardon the Interruption, where Jaworski was a frequent guest during the football season.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} new {{journals}} specializing in machine learning (e.g., Journal of Machine Learning) and many older journals {{that are now}} routinely sprinkled with machine learning papers (e.g., Journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Statistical Association). So far, however, applications in criminology are hard to find. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is time; {{it takes a while}} for new technology to diffuse. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is software; <b>the</b> popular statistical packages can be at least five years behind recent developments. Yet another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>the</b> need for a dramatic attitude adjustment among criminologists. Empirical research in criminology is thoroughly dominated by a culture of causal modeling in which the intent is to explain in detail the mechanisms by which nature generated <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> a response variable as a particular function of designated predictors and stochastic disturbances.a Machine learning comes from a different culture characterized by an “algorithmic” perspective.|$|R

500|$|Though classicists {{were excited}} by the {{discovery}} of the poem, considering it the [...] "most spectacular" [...] of the 2014 finds, it was not considered one of Sappho's best works. [...] Martin West originally considered the work to be [...] "very poor stuff" [...] and [...] "frigid juvenilia", though he later toned down his criticism of the poem. [...] Liberman wrote that the poem is clumsy, displaying signs of hasty composition. [...] Richard Rawles suggested that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the poem was initially considered disappointing was because it was not about sexuality or eroticism – a factor which he predicted would make the fragment of greater interest in the future. Some commentators have been more positive. [...] Though Loukas Papadimitropoulos said that his initial impression of the poem was that it was simplistic, he concluded that the meaning of the poem was [...] "perhaps the most profound in all of Sappho's extant work", and that the poem turns the [...] "simple into something highly significant".|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about {{in the middle of the}} first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Nash is most {{noted for}} his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting. He {{led the league}} in assists for five years, {{averaging}} 11.5 assists per game in 2004–05, 10.5 in 2005–06, 11.6 in 2006–07, 11.0 in 2009–10 and 11.4 in 2010–11 and won the 2005 and 2010 NBA All-Star Skills Contests. As of the end of 2012–13 season, he had a 90.4% career free-throw shooting average (best in NBA history) and a 42.8% career three-point shooting average (eighth-best in league history), and ranked {{as one of the top}} 10 players in league history in total assists, assists per game, and three-point field goals made. In addition, he is ranked second (starting from 1986–87) in regular season point–assist double doubles. In the 2005–06 season, Nash became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better from the field, 40% from three-point range (43.9), and 90% from the line, joining Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, and Mark Price in the 50–40–90 club. Nash would repeat this feat three more times in the 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 campaigns. Nash (four times) and Larry Bird (two times) are the only players to have accomplished this feat more than once. A two-time NBA MVP, Nash is only the second point guard (along with Magic Johnson) to win the MVP award multiple times and the third guard in NBA history to earn back-to-back MVPs (joining Johnson and Michael Jordan). Only ten other NBA players have won back-to-back MVP awards: Johnson, Jordan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry. On 11 May 2006, ESPN.com rated Nash as the 9th-best point guard of all time, and in a survey by nba.com in 2007, Nash received 85% of the votes by the league's general managers as best point guard in the league. In a similar survey in 2009, Nash was rated as the best passer of the ball and the player possessing the best basketball IQ. Commenting on Nash losing out to former teammate Dirk Nowitzki for the 2007 NBA MVP, Boston Celtics centre and Hall of Famer Russell stated: [...] "I think, on the world stage, he's one of our great athletes in all sports... I'm a big fan. The two MVPs he got, he deserved. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he's so good and so effective is that the guys like playing with him. He creates an atmosphere where they win games." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Arctic {{consists}} of ocean {{that is largely}} surrounded by land. As such, the climate {{of much of the}} Arctic is moderated by the ocean water, which can never have a temperature below −2°C (28°F). [...] In winter, this relatively warm water, even though covered by the polar ice pack, keeps the North Pole from being the coldest place in the Northern Hemisphere, and it is also <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Antarctica is so much colder than the Arctic. In summer, the presence of the nearby water keeps coastal areas from warming as much as they might otherwise.|$|E
2500|$|Entwistle's wry and {{sometimes}} dark sense of humour clashed at times with Pete Townshend's more introspective, intellectual work. Although he wrote songs on every Who album except for Quadrophenia, he was frustrated at Townshend not {{allowing him to}} sing them himself. As he said, [...] "I got a couple [...] on per album but my problem was that I wanted to sing the songs and not let Roger sing them." [...] This was a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{he became the first}} member of the band to release a solo album, Smash Your Head Against the Wall (1971) which featured contributions from Keith Moon, Jerry Shirley, Vivian Stanshall, Neil Innes and the Who's roadie, Dave [...] "Cyrano" [...] Langston.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} all other sumo ranks yokozuna cannot be demoted.

[...] Expectations are so high that, even in the course of one tournament, a yokozuna who early on appears to be headed for a losing tournament will feel the pressure to retire; there are many cases of yokozuna dropping out mid-tournament with a real or imagined injury to avoid a make-koshi (a losing record) and the expectation to retire. These expectations are a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the promotion criteria for yokozuna are so strict in the first place.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{administrative}} capital of Sidon Eyalet was nominally Sidon, al-Jazzar made Acre his seat of power. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> al-Jazzar chose Acre as his headquarters {{was that the}} city's citadel provided him a more strategic advantage over Sidon {{in the event of}} a potential dismissal by the Ottoman authorities from his post; the central Ottoman authorities replaced provincial governors relatively quickly, either out of fear that a prolonged reign would lead to a governor's rebellion or in pursuit of bribes that aspiring governors often paid to gain appointment. According to historian William Harris, [...] "al-Jazzar aimed to make himself indispensable, while respecting Ottoman sovereignty." [...] Al-Jazzar's move to Acre was meant to secure his rule and he proceeded to strengthen the city's fortifications and stock up on arms, artillery and ammunition.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2015 cricket {{world cup}} Taylor scored two {{back to back}} centuries. The first one was against Ireland, where he scored 121 runs from 91 balls.

[...] It was later revealed that he retired from international cricket, along with Kyle Jarvis, while Craig Ervine rejected a central contract with Zimbabwe, {{all of which were}} due to financial circumstances.

2500|$|Although they do {{not have}} the same strict {{requirements}} as for daystalls, most [...] "commercial" [...] Market merchants are owner-operated businesses. In the 1970s, when the Market was undergoing extensive rehabilitation and the future of the Market was somewhat unstable, the PDA consolidated its merchant base by giving merchant tenants very favorable leases, with longer terms and lower rates than were available elsewhere in Downtown Seattle. This policy was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the PDA ran into the financial difficulties that led to its dealings with the Urban Group. The PDA now gives below-market rates only to start-up businesses, businesses or organizations designed to serve low and moderate income persons, and to [...] "the Market’s unique character-defining businesses." [...] The latter include produce, fish, and meat businesses. The PDA often will not renew multi-year leases for businesses with poor sales performance or other problems, but typically will allow them to remain indefinitely on a month-to-month basis. About once a year, the PDA has occasion to refuse to renew when a merchant's lease ends.|$|E

A new linear basis can be defined for each predictor and various sets <b>of</b> predictors. Another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> is that tree-based methods capitalize on regions in which associations with the response are weak. One by one, such regions do matter much, and conventional regression approaches bent on explanation might properly choose to ignore them. But when a large number of such regions is taken seriously, forecasting accuracy can dramatically improve.

2500|$|Proximity to Nazi Germany as a {{bordering}} nation {{made the}} Swiss government very tentative {{about dealing with}} the Jews. Sharing a physical border with Germany was also <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the Swiss maintained amicable economic relations with Germany. Correspondingly, both Sweden and especially Switzerland cooperated with the Nazis concerning banking and the exploitation of financial opportunities, as they knowingly accepted expropriation of money and goods, which previously belonged to Jewish companies and/or families for their own gain. Before 1938, Swiss alien and refugee policy was already restrictive toward certain people and groups, notably foreign Roma and Sinti. However, from that date, restrictions were intensified, particularly towards Jews. As part of that policy, the Swiss government requested that the German government mark the passports of German Jews with a [...] "J" [...] as they were not ready to grant asylum {{on the grounds of}} racial persecution. This policy took effect following the Anschluß with Austria, as the Swiss government was concerned about potential Jewish refugees fleeing and inundating them accordingly. In 1942 Swiss borders were completely closed to all Jewish refugees, which even included Jewish children.|$|E
