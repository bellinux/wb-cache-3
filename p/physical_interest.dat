40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the problem of}} {{computing}} the effective diffusivity for a particle moving in chaotic and stochastic flows. In addition we numerically investigate the residual diffusion phenomenon in chaotic advection. The residual diffusion refers to the non-zero effective (homogenized) diffusion {{in the limit of}} zero molecular diffusion as a result of chaotic mixing of the streamlines. In this limit traditional numerical methods typically fail since the solutions of the advection-diffusion equation develop sharp gradients. Instead of solving the Fokker-Planck equation in the Eulerian formulation, we compute the motion of particles in the Lagrangian formulation, which is modelled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We propose a new numerical integrator based on a stochastic splitting method to solve the corresponding SDEs in which the deterministic subproblem is symplectic preserving while the random subproblem {{can be viewed as a}} perturbation. We provide rigorous error analysis for the new numerical integrator using the backward error analysis technique and show that our method outperforms standard Euler-based integrators. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for several typical chaotic and stochastic flow problems of <b>physical</b> <b>interests...</b>|$|R
