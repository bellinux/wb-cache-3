50|$|A major {{advantage}} for multi-product pipelines of <b>piggable</b> systems {{is the potential}} of product savings. At {{the end of each}} product transfer, it is possible to clear out the entire line contents with the pig, either forwards to the receipt point, or backwards to the source tank. There is no requirement for extensive line flushing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. High {{pressure}} isolation plug {{train is}} a remote control, tetherless, highly <b>piggable</b> and high pressure isolation tool. The advantage {{of using the}} pressure isolation tool is to minimize production down time. Domestic research has started recently because of the foreign blockade of its core technologies, there are no relative products coming out currently. The smartplug that have been mentioned consist of plugging module, pigging module, hydraulic power module and communication and control module. The paper describes design ideas of each module in detail respectively {{and according to the}} design methods the prototype with diameter of 12 inches has been produced so far. Sealing pressure achieves 10 Mpa by experiment. Looking forward to the technology would be applied in pipeline valve replacements and repairs, riser replacements and repairs, pressure test of risers and pipelines, midline pipeline repairs and relative engineering areas...|$|E
