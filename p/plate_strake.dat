50|$|In a riveted steel ship, the strakes {{were usually}} lapped and joggled, but where a {{smoother}} finish was sought, they too might be riveted on a butt strap, {{though this was}} weaker.

40|$|This study {{reflects}} on two areas of vehicle aerodynamics, optimising cooling performance and features {{that will improve}} {{the handling of the}} car. Both areas will {{have a significant impact on}} the overall performance of the car and at the same time these areas are linked to each other. The considered vehicle in this study was the Chalmers Formula Student 2011 Formula SAE car and the flow field was analysed using both numerical simulations as well as performing wind tunnel experiments on a 1 : 3 -scale model of the car. The focus on increasing downforce without increasing the aerodynamic drag is particularly good in Formula SAE since fuel economy is an event at the competition. Therefore, the intention of this work is to present a study on how undertrays with different design such as added foot <b>plates,</b> diffuser and <b>strakes</b> can improve the downforce and reduce the drag. Apart from this focus has been towards a common issue among open wheeled race cars with the radiator placed behind the front wheels and how changes in this area will influence the handling of the car. Interference effects between these parts were seen as well as the influence on the general aerodynamic performance of the car...|$|R
2500|$|The 2,000 hull {{plates were}} single pieces of rolled steel plate, mostly up to [...] wide and [...] long and {{weighing}} between 2.5 and 3 tons. Their thickness varied from [...] to [...] The plates were laid in a clinkered (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were {{laid in the}} [...] "in and out" [...] fashion, where <b>strake</b> <b>plating</b> was applied in bands (the [...] "in strakes") with the gaps covered by the [...] "out strakes", overlapping on the edges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc welding methods, ubiquitous in fabrication today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel rivets, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand. In the 1990s some material scientists concluded that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, {{by the standards of}} the time, the steel plate's quality was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the metallurgy of steelmaking. As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.|$|R

The armour consisted of three equal-depth strakes, The strakes were tongue-and-grooved together, and each individual <b>plate</b> in a <b>strake</b> was keyed into neighbouring plates. The belt was at its thickest above and at the waterline. Most secondary and some primary sources describe the maximum thickness of the belt armour varying between 14 and 15 inches (possibly due to rounding up to the nearest inch). Some sources give more detail: along the magazines, the belt was 14.7inches thick (373mm); over the machinery spaces, the belt was 13.7inches (349mm). The lower section of belt tapered to a thickness of between 4.5in and 5.5in.

Immune zone calculations vary widely from source to source.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of energy converters, cooling units and heat exchangers {{is the most}} important aspect for the economical success of energy conversion systems. In order to enhance the heat transfer passive devices like roughness elements, dimples or cavities are used, mostly in micro heat exchangers or other energy converters on micro scales. On bigger scales other devices in use are guiding <b>plates,</b> diverter <b>strakes</b> or delta shaped winglets. The physical mechanism causing the enhancement of heat transfer is either to generate or amplify sufficiently strong longitudinal vortices which are interacting with the thermal boundary layer. The stratification of the thermal boundary layer near the heated walls is disturbed by these vortices. The convection of warmer fluid perpendicular to the heated wall and the mixing with colder fluid is intensified, and, additionally, further external momentum is transported into the inner boundary layer region. Depending on the specific application the used flow control devices differ in their geometry, dimensions and integration. Dupond et al. [1] used compact texture like embossed vortex generators similar to dimples. Fiebig [2], Gentry et al. [3] and Jacobi et al. [4] examined the flow effects of fins and winglets to improve the heat transfer on plates and in tubes or channels experimentally. They also conducted numerical simulations considering flow control devices with varying shape and geometry to find device design criteria for heat transfer enhancement. Since the vortex induced heat transfer enhancement depends strongly on shape and position of vortex generators the subject of ongoing research is to find design strategies for device shape and placement optimization. In particular, the investigation of confined channel flows with delta wing vortex generators has motivated numerous numerical and experimental studies [2]. Until now the physical mechanisms are not satisfactory understood. Though, in order to improve the design of compact heat exchangers a better physical understanding of the generation of these flow structures is mandatory. Therefore, the task of the presented work is to analyse the interaction between vortices and the thermal boundary layer, the impact of the vortical flow structure on the heated wall and the convective transport of heat within the flow domain. In this numerical study a generic rectangular heat transfer channel with a heated upper wall is subject of the examination. Although various types of flow manipulating devices could be used for generating coor counterrotating vortices disturbing the stratified temperature layers this consideration is restricted to delta wing vortex generators. In this case pairs of generic, prismatic delta wings are used to influence the flow whereas a special local arrangement is focal point of interest: the vortex generator pairs are arranged facing one another: one pair on the hot wall, one on the cold opposite channel wall. The upper pair on the hot wall is generating a so called “common flow up” flow structure, the other pair a “common flow down” flow structure. This leads to a transport of fluid from the hot to the cold wall. Additionally the upper vortex pair feeds and the lower vortex pair. The enforced vortex pair is now able to enhance the mixing of cold and warm fluid in the channel. A focal point of this consideration is the analysis of the vortical flow field and their interaction with the associated temperature field. Vortex analysis techniques are applied to the numerical solutions of the laminar flow. Vortices are detected by Lambda 2 values, normalited helicity is used to distinguish between co- and counter-rotating vortices. The heat transfer is examined by the temperature distribution shown on slices and by calculation of so called beta-planes, suitable for the visualisation of the convective transport of momentum and heat in regard to the localisation of the origin of mixing fluid. The usage of visualization techniques like streamline integration and advanced line integration convolution techniques yields {{a better understanding of the}} vortical structures and the associated heat transfer. A further topological analysis is done to gain an impression of the main vortical flow structures and the resulting temperature distribution. Separatrix integration reveals significant information of the vortical flow structures and their impact on heat transfer. This work presents results of a comparative analysis, especially of the topological structure of vortices generated by vortex generator pairs and their interaction with the temperature field...|$|R
