40|$|Antarctic {{ice shelves}} are buttressed by {{numerous}} <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> attaching to the otherwise freely-floating ice from below. Some of these kilometric-scale grounded features are unresolved in Antarctic-wide datasets of ice thickness and bathymetry, hampering ice-flow models to fully capture dynamics at the grounding line and upstream. We investigate {{the role of}} a 8. 7 km 2 <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> {{at the front of the}} Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf, East Antarctica. Using ERS interferometry and ALOS-PALSAR speckle tracking, we derive, on a 125 m grid spacing, surface velocities deviating from 37 on-site GNSS measurements with - 5. 2 ± 4. 5 m a− 1. We find no evidence for ice-flow changes on decadal time scales and show that ice on the <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> virtually stagnates, deviating the ice stream and causing enhanced horizontal shearing upstream. Using the BISICLES ice-flow model, we invert for basal friction and ice rigidity with three input scenarios of ice velocity and geometry. We show that inversion results are the most sensitive to the presence/absence of the <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> in the bathymetry, surface velocities at the <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> are of secondary importance. Undersampling of <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> results in erroneous ice-shelf properties in models initialised by control methods. This may impact prognostic modelling for ice-sheet evolution in case of unpinning. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Microtubules have a {{persistence}} {{length of}} the order of millimeters in vitro, but inside cells they bend over length scales of microns. It has been proposed that polymerization forces bend microtubules {{in the vicinity of the}} cell boundary or other obstacles, yet bends develop even when microtubules are polymerizing freely, unaffected by obstacles and cell boundaries. How these bends are formed remains unclear. By tracking the motions of microtubules marked by photobleaching, we found that in LLC-PK 1 epithelial cells local bends develop primarily by plus-end directed transport of portions of the microtubule contour towards stationary locations (termed <b>pinning</b> <b>points)</b> along the {{length of the}} microtubule. The <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> were transient in nature, and their eventual release allowed the bends to relax. The directionality of the transport as well as the overall incidence of local bends decreased when dynein was inhibited, while myosin inhibition had no observable effect. This suggests that dynein generates a tangential force that bends microtubules against stationary <b>pinning</b> <b>points.</b> Simulations of microtubule motion and polymerization accounting for filament mechanics and dynein forces predict the development of bends of size and shape similar to those observed in cells. Furthermore, simulations show that dynein-generated bends at a <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> near the plus end can cause a persistent rotation of the tip consistent with the observation that bend formation near the tip can change the direction of microtubule growth. Collectively, these results suggest a simple physical mechanism for the bending of growing microtubules by dynein forces accumulating at <b>pinning</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe present {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations of the shear-coupled migration (SCM) behaviour of symmetrical tilt boundaries perturbed {{by the presence}} of nano-cracks or nano-precipitates lying on the boundary plane. The simulations have been performed for copper bicrystals at room temperature (300 K). The tilt boundary gets pinned by the crack tip or by the precipitates; shear-coupled migration occurs only ahead of the <b>pinning</b> <b>points.</b> Bulging of the tilt boundary reduces the shear stress on the boundary surface near the <b>pinning</b> <b>points.</b> In the case of cracks the local deviation of the boundary from the crack plane close to the crack tip hinders mode II crack propagation; in fact, some crack healing is observed in some cases. The applied stress grows until depinning of the boundary takes place by SCM bulging or by the combined action of SCM with another deformation mechanism (emission of dislocations from the <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> vicinity, grain boundary sliding) ...|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{dislocation}} network topologies were generated by relaxing an initially <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> free dislocation loop structure using three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. Traction-free finite-sized samples were used. Subsequently, these equilibrated structures {{were subjected to}} tensile loading and their mechanical behavior was investigated {{with respect to the}} initial configuration. A strong mechanical size effect was found. The flow stress at 0. 2 % plastic deformation scales with specimen size with an exponent between - 0. 6 and - 0. 9, depending on the initial structure and size regime. During relaxation, a mechanism, also favored by cross-slip, is identified which leads to rather stable <b>pinning</b> <b>points.</b> These <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> are comparable to those of the isolated Frank-Read sources often used as a starting configuration in previous discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. These nodes act as quite stable dislocation sources, which can be activated multiple times.

40|$|The East Antarctic {{ice sheet}} is likely {{more stable than}} its West Antarctic {{counterpart}} because its bed is largely lying above sea level. However, the ice sheet in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, contains marine sectors that are {{in contact with the}} ocean through overdeepened marine basins interspersed by grounded ice promontories and ice rises, pinning and stabilising the ice shelves. In this paper, we use the ice-sheet model BISICLES to investigate the effect of sub-ice-shelf melting, using a series of scenarios compliant with current values, on the ice-dynamic stability of the outlet glaciers between the Lazarev and Roi Baudouin ice shelves over the next millennium. Overall, the sub-ice-shelf melting substantially impacts the sea-level contribution. Locally, we predict a short-term rapid grounding-line retreat of the overdeepened outlet glacier Hansenbreen, which further induces the transition of the bordering ice promontories into ice rises. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated that the onset of the marine ice-sheet retreat and subsequent promontory transition into ice rise is controlled by small <b>pinning</b> <b>points,</b> mostly uncharted in pan-Antarctic datasets. <b>Pinning</b> <b>points</b> have a twofold impact on marine ice sheets. They decrease the ice discharge by buttressing effect, and they {{play a crucial role in}} initialising marine ice sheets through data assimilation, leading to errors in ice-shelf rheology when omitted. Our results show that unpinning increases the sea-level rise by 10  %, while omitting the same <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> in data assimilation decreases it by 10  %, but the more striking effect is in the promontory transition time, advanced by two centuries for unpinning and delayed by almost half a millennium when the <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> is missing in data assimilation. <b>Pinning</b> <b>points</b> exert a subtle influence on ice dynamics at the kilometre scale, which calls for a better knowledge of the Antarctic margins...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe West Antarctic {{ice sheet}} is {{confined}} {{by a large}} area of ice shelves, fed by inland ice through fast flowing ice streams. The dynamics of the grounding line, which is the line-boundary between grounded ice and the downstream ice shelf, has {{a major influence on}} the dynamics of the whole ice sheet. However, most ice sheet models use simplifications of the flow equations, as they do not include all the stress components, and are known to fail in their representation of the grounding line dynamics. Here, we present a 3 -D full Stokes model of a marine ice sheet, in which the flow problem is coupled with the evolution of the upper and lower free surfaces, and the position of the grounding line is determined by solving a contact problem between the shelf/sheet lower surface and the bedrock. Simulations are performed using the open-source finite-element code Elmer/Ice within a parallel environment. The model's ability to cope with a curved grounding line and the effect of a <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> beneath the ice shelf are investigated through prognostic simulations. Starting from a steady state, the sea level is slightly decreased to create a contact point between a seamount and the ice shelf. The model predicts a dramatic decrease of the shelf velocities, leading to an advance of the grounding line until both grounded zones merge together, during which an ice rumple forms above the contact area at the <b>pinning</b> <b>point.</b> Finally, we show that once the contact is created, increasing the sea level to its initial value does not release the <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> and has no effect on the ice dynamics, indicating a stabilising effect of <b>pinning</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} line {{disorder}} induced by heavy ion irradiation and of point disorder induced by proton and electron irradiation {{on the upper}} and lower critical points in the vortex phase diagram of YBCO is presented.

Strong <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> defects raise the lower critical <b>point,</b> while weak <b>pinning</b> <b>point</b> defects have little or no effect on the lower critical point. The upper critical point is lowered by point disorder, but raised by line disorder.

40|$|International audienceIn ice flow modelling, the use {{of control}} methods to {{assimilate}} the dynamic and geometric state of an ice body has become common practice. These methods have primarily focussed on inverting {{for one of the}} two least known properties in glaciology, namely the basal friction coefficient or the ice viscosity parameter. Here, we present an approach to infer both properties simultaneously for the whole of the Antarctic ice sheet. After the assimilation, the root-mean-square deviation between modelled and observed surface velocities attains 8. 7 m a − 1 for the entire domain, with a slightly higher value of 14. 0 m a − 1 for the ice shelves. An exception in terms of the velocity mismatch is the Thwaites Glacier Ice Shelf, where the RMS value is almost 70 m a − 1. The reason is that the underlying Bedmap 2 geometry ignores the presence of an ice rise, which exerts major control on the dynamics of {{the eastern part of the}} ice shelf. On these grounds, we suggest an approach to account for <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> not included in Bedmap 2 by locally allowing an optimisation of basal friction during the inversion. In this way, the velocity mismatch on the ice shelf of Thwaites Glacier is more than halved. A characteristic velocity mismatch pattern emerges for unaccounted <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> close to the marine shelf front. This pattern is exploited to manually identify seven uncharted features around Antarctica that exert significant resistance to the shelf flow. Potential <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> are detected on Fimbul, West, Shackleton, Nickerson and Venable ice shelves. As <b>pinning</b> <b>points</b> can provide substantial resistance to shelf flow, with considerable consequences if they became ungrounded in the future, the model community is in need of detailed bathymetry there. Our data assimilation points to some of these dynamically important features not present in Bedmap 2 and implicitly quantifies their relevance...|$|R
