25|$|Neville had livery of his lands without <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> on 8 May 1491. From 12 August of {{that year}} until 3 November 1529 he was summoned to Parliament by writs {{directed}} to 'Ricardo Nevill de Latimer chivaler'. However, in about 1494 his inheritance was contested by Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, who although summoned to the 1491 Parliament by writs directed to 'Roberto Willughby de Broke chivaler', nonetheless claimed that he was entitled to the Latimer barony and lands through his great-grandmother's brother, John Willoughby. Neville ultimately prevailed, and a herald recorded that 'the Lord Brooke had made a wrong claim'.|$|E

25|$|Street vendors crowd Eje 1 North and {{the side}} streets on either side in both the La Lagunilla and Tepito neighborhoods. Those closest to the fixed market {{buildings}} often sell items similar to that which is inside, and those located near the formal occasion shops emulate these as well. This informal market has grown such that vendors with stalls and vehicles now routinely block several of the main avenue’s six lanes. The problem begins from Comonfort Street, two blocks from Paseo de la Reforma. Here, vendors have taken over the lane dedicated to buses, with stands selling clothing, food, unlicensed CDs and DVDs and more. In some side streets, traffic is cut in half and in the smallest, there is no passage of vehicular traffic at all on weekends. In total, there are eleven city blocks severely affected by this. Cuauhtémoc borough authorities state {{that they do not}} have enough personnel to effect an eviction of the vendors. Earlier attempts to do this have resulted in threats to administration officials. Another issue is that many roving vendors sell beer and customers in the market proper can be seen drinking their purchases as they walk through the aisles. The most popular form of buying beer here is a “michelada” with a large bottle of beer (940ml) called a caguama emptied into a large cup and mixed with lime juice, salt and sometimes chili pepper and Worcestershire sauce. These vendors do not ask for <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>age.</b> This informal market has made La Lagunilla one of the main centers for the production and sale of bootlegged CDs and DVDs.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, he {{announced}} plans to introduce Anti-Social Behaviour Orders, although {{not in the same}} form as those in Britain.

[...] In its press statement announcing the classification, the FPB referred at length to its statutory authority and responsibilities, in particular its role in [...] "promoting the safety of children"; and explicitly denied that it had been influenced by political figures or had acted beyond its jurisdiction, saying that [...] "We believe that reports to the contrary have been specifically designed to defame the Film and Publication Board, question its integrity, competence, credibility as well as formulate as a reality the false notion that the state seeks to silence and censor the media by all means possible and with total disregard for accepted procedures and principles". [...] In reply to questions, FPB chief operations officer Mmapula Fisha said that The Spear differed from other works of art containing nudity, and merited the 16N classification, because [...] "The artwork has forced society to revisit its painful history". [...] After the classification was announced, the Goodman Gallery was reported to be seeking legal advice, but to have said they [...] "felt it would {{have a significant impact on}} freedom of artistic expression", a criticism also made by commentators not involved in the case, while others expressed concern about political censorship.

6000|$|I never {{realised}} how old France was till {{we went to}} Arles. In our crowded train poilus were packed, {{standing in}} the corridors. One very weary, invited by a high and kindly colonel into our carriage, chatted in his tired voice of how wonderfully the women kept the work going on the farms. [...] "When we get a fortnight's leave," [...] he said, [...] "all goes well, {{we can do the}} heavy things the women cannot, and the land is made clean. It wants that fortnight now and then, mon colonel; there is work on farms that women cannot do." [...] And the colonel vehemently nodded his thin face. We alighted in the dark among southern forms and voices, and the little hotel omnibus became enmeshed at once in old, high, very narrow, Italian-seeming streets. It was Sunday next day; sunny, with a clear blue sky. In the square before our hotel a simple crowd round the statue of Mistral chattered or listened to a girl singing excruciating songs; a crowd as old-looking as in Italy or Spain, aged as things only are in the South. We walked up to the Arena. Quite a recent development in the life of Arles, they say, that marvellous Roman building, here cut down, there built up, by Saracen hands. For a thousand years or more before the Romans came Arles flourished and was civilised. What had we mushroom islanders before the Romans came? What had barbaric Prussia? Not even the Romans to look forward to! The age-long life of the South stands for much in modern France, correcting the cruder blood which has poured in these last fifteen hundred years. As one blends wine of very old stock with newer brands, so has France been blended and mellowed. A strange cosmic feeling one had, {{on the top of the}} great building in that town older than Rome itself, of the continuity of human life and the futility of human conceit.

40|$|This study {{proposes to}} {{determine}} the thermal conductivity of SK One Component Polyurethane (SKOCP) developed by China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research Beijing IWHR-KHL Co. Ltd. SKOCP provides excellent <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> and chemical resistance of this material. It is non-toxic, acts as a good anti-seepage, offers anti-abrasion and good anti-freezing performance. In addition, it has high strength, high elongation and good bonding with base materials (i. e. concrete, metal surfaces, etc.). With all these robust properties, the one component polyurethane seems the most favourable material for construction in cold regions as it acts as anti-freezing and protects against freeze-thaw fractures. The research aims to study SKOCP in depth and to determine its thermal conductivity using experimentations and multiphysics based numerical simulations. The standard experimental setup, as suggested by Kvadsheim, Folkow et al. (1994), will be used {{to determine the}} thermal conductivity. In addition, infrared imaging technique will also be employed to study the thermal profiles, which {{will be used to}} estimate the thermal conductivity (Rashid, Khawaja et al. 2016). The thermal data will be compared against the multiphysics numerical simulation results. The study will help in building the confidence between the experimentation and multiphysics based numerical studies and provide scientific background for application of SKOCP in the Cold Climate...|$|R
