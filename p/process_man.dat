40|$|Introduction The {{end result}} of current web {{services}} efforts {{will probably be a}} set of standards that will permit cross-enterprise integration across a wide range of institutions. The exact form of these standards is contingent on a set of tactical skirmishes between several large software vendors, but the general direction is clear enough that its implications for business can be discussed. Most of the published work related to web services is in standards documents (Christensen, Curbera et al. 2001), (Ankolekar, Huch et al. 2002) (Jim Clark 2001). In a recent journal article, Leymann, Roller et al. (2002), present a detailed view of the intersection point of web services and business processes. Agarwal and Gondha (2002) provide an example of web services research in an academic setting, with links to examples of working services.

As the tool to help me conduct the analysis, I use the theory of fatalism exercising its elements namely powerlessness and submissiveness. In general, fatalism is a doctrine, a system of philosophy, or a belief that says everything is determined by fate. Basically, the elements explain the stages or <b>process</b> <b>man</b> has to experience in living his destiny. This situation happens to Joseph K. who cannot free himself from the Court. First of all, the Court tries to make him realize that he is powerless through the work of its emissaries and intermediaries. Despite the pressures he gets from the Court, K. at first, tries to defend himself and struggle to win the case by searching for help. Nevertheless, K. ?s efforts always meet a dead end and his case gets even worse. Therefore, despite all his attempts to defend himself, K. is forced to realize that he is powerless against the Court. In the end, it finally dawns on him that he cannot escape his destiny, and, thus, submits himself entirely {{into the hands of the}} Court. In this stage, K. totally becomes submissive in facing the Court until he is killed `like a dog?...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cervical spines {{of human}} and {{non-human}} cadavera were injected with suitable media and studied.

40|$|International audienceWhen {{the human}} colon cancer cells HT- 29 undergo enterocytic differentiation, they {{correctly}} process their N-glycans, whereas their undifferentiated counterpart {{are unable to}} <b>process</b> <b>Man</b> 9 - 8 -GlcNAc 2 species, the natural substrate of alpha-mannosidase I. As this enzyme is fully active in both HT- 29 cell populations, we hypothesize that N-glycoproteins are unable to reach the cis Golgi, the site where alpha-mannosidase I has been localized. We have demonstrated this point by using 1 -deoxymannojirimycin, leupeptin, and monensin. In the presence of 1 -deoxymannojirimycin, a specific inhibitor of alpha-mannosidase I, differentiated HT- 29 cells, as expected, accumulate Man 9 - 8 -GlcNAc 2 species, whereas in undifferentiated HT- 29 cells these compounds continue to be rapidly degraded. In contrast, the use of leupeptin, a specific inhibitor of thiol and serine proteases, leads to the accumulation of these oligosaccharides in undifferentiated HT- 29 cells. Monensin, a carboxylic ionophore that perturbs distal Golgi functions, is unable to stabilize these compounds. Therefore, we conclude that N-linked glycoproteins in undifferentiated HT- 29 cells rapidly egress from the exocytic pathway to a leupeptin-sensitive degradative compartment without entering a monensin-sensitive compartment. These results favor the hypothesis that a direct pathway should exist between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and a leupeptin-sensitive degradative compartment in undifferentiated HT- 29 cells. The emergence of this new pathway could explain why protein stability and N-glycan processing may vary {{as a function of}} the state of cell differentiation...|$|E
40|$|One of man 2 ̆ 7 s {{most useful}} {{servants}} is electrical power. Technological advances {{have made it}} the greatest source of industrial power {{we have in the}} world today. The evolution of electrical power paralleled the development of our great American economic system. Like the development of mechanization, the growth of power was a long, drawn-out <b>process.</b> <b>Man</b> power was replaced with water power; water power was replaced with team, electricity, oil and natural gas. Eventually these sources may be replaced with atomic power. Although the steam engine was a vast improvement over water power, there continued a need for transmitting energy long distances. Electricity was the answer. Electric power meant a vast increase in the amount of power available for production and great savings in capital, resources, and space. The transformer needed to transmit electrical power over great distances was first perfected by George Westinghouse at the Chicago Exposition in 1893. The purpose of the transformer at the generating site is to boost the voltage so that the losses in the transmission lines will be minimized. The purpose of the transformer at the point of use is to reduce voltage to a safe operating level before it enters the circuit. In 1877 Thomas A. Edison turned to the problem believed by some experts to be 2 ̆ 2 insoluble, 2 ̆ 2 of subdividing electric current and leading it into incandescent lamps. This cask was larger than discovering an element which would glow in a vacuum bulb without quickly burning out; he had to invent a whole new system of conductors, meters, and generators. The critical date for the invention came not in 1879, when a carbonized thread in a bulb stayed incandescent for forty hours at Menlo Park, but 1882 when the central station at Pearl Street in New York was put into commercial operation. The great abundance of water power in the western states caused great interest in the pioneering and use of hydro-electric power. The first hydro-electric power plant serving a distant market was located in Oregon City, Oregon. This plant provided Portland, located thirteen miles away, with electric power as early as 1889. The electric power fever hit Utah just a few years later. The big movement started with the organizing of the Pioneer Electric Power Company in Ogden on November 27, 1893. The Mormon Church was very instrumental in the financing of this company. The object was to harness the power of the Ogden River. This was to be achieved by building a dam in Ogden Canyon and running the water through a pipeline to the plant which was to be located nearer to Ogden. This system was completed in 1897. Although this was the first major system in Utah, there were a few small, local hydro-electric systems preceding the Pioneer Electric Power Company. The accompanying paper will explain the development and growth of one of these early systems...|$|E
