50|$|<b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> {{pornography}} (<b>POV)</b> is adult entertainment filmed {{to look as}} if the watcher {{were experiencing}} the sex act themselves. In POV porn, the shooting style is generally similar to gonzo pornography, with the person receiving sexual gratification holding the camera him or herself—aiming it down at the actress or actor who is performing the sex act. This style of filming is in contrast to having a separate, third-person camera crew filming all the action. The effect is to give the viewer the sense that they are experiencing the sex acts that they are watching, as opposed to simply watching others as a voyeur.|$|R

We consider POVs to be “Op-Ed” pieces designed to stimulate thought and dialog on significant educational issues. Each author {{has the opportunity to}} revise a POV after reading drafts of the other POVs. In this issue, we ask the question, “Is PowerPoint the best instructional medium to use in your class?” Everyone seems to have an opinion on Microsoft, but the intellectual merits of using PowerPoint (or similar software) is a growing question as states and institutions put more and more money into information technology and distance learning. Four POVs are presented: 1) David Keefe and James Willett provide their case why PowerPoint is an ideal teaching software. Keefe is an educational researcher at the Center for Technology in Learning at SRI International. Willett is a professor at George Mason University in the Departments of Microbial and Molecular Bioscience; as well as Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. 2) Kim McDonald highlights the causes of PowerPointlessness, a term which indicates the frequent use of PowerPoint as a crutch rather than a tool. She is a Bioscience Educator at the Shodor Education Foundation, Inc. 3) Diana Voss asks readers if PowerPoint is really necessary to present the material effectively or not. Voss is a Instructional Computing Support Specialist at SUNY Stony Brook. 4) Cynthia Lanius takes a light-hearted approach to ask whether PowerPoint is a technological improvement or just a change of pace for teacher and student presentations. Lanius is a Technology Integration Specialist in the Sinton (Texas) Independent School District.

5000|$|Midnight Stranger (1994) is {{the first}} of two {{published}} interactive multimedia CD-ROM based collaborations between writer and director Jeff Green and the Animatics Multimedia Corporation. Noted for its cinéma vérité style, it is a <b>Point</b> <b>Of</b> <b>View</b> (<b>POV)</b> video-based experiment in simulated socializing that takes place in an anonymous city late one night. Players navigate between several locations, and can interact with one or more people in each location to varying effects based on the player's [...] "reactions" [...] to that person. The main technical innovation of Midnight Stranger is its use of an emotional continuum Mood Bar for interaction with the in-story characters rather than a text interface or an itemized set of options for each interaction. The Mood Bar simulates some of the frustration and uncertainty when dealing with other people in social situations, and provides a more realistic role playing experience.|$|E
5000|$|... "Window Rawanda" [...] is a photo {{documentary}} project which Edser filmed {{while working}} for three years for [...] "Operation Smile", a volunteer mission, which is a non profit organization. Edser was motivated by culture and politics of Rwanda where violence was a common feature {{in the form of}} mass killings and genocide. Initially her intent was to photograph scenes of rape but felt that such a depiction would not project the entire story of the country. Hence, during her second visit to Rwanda, and during her daily routine of travelling between Kigali and hospitals at {{the outskirts of the city}} she took split second photographs from the window of the moving vehicle in which she was traveling. She put these pictures in series and presented it for international viewing under the title [...] "Window Rwanda". This series consisted of black and white pictures of villagers engaged in their daily chores, children playing on the road side, women with fruit baskets on their head, and people engaged in group discussions, but there was no accompanying explanatory text. In producing this series she noted:"...While we were never as poor as those I met on the project, I recognized a commonality of experience. I saw the project as a way of disrupting the political and photographic stereotype usually associated with this subject. While my intentions are neither to sentimentalize nor seek sympathy for the subjects neither is it to ridicule." [...] <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>View</b> (<b>POV)</b> Female project established in 2010 Damien Poulain, a London-based graphic designer and art director, selected Edser's photographic series [...] "Window Rawanda" [...] for a solo exhibition held in Johannesburg during 2013.|$|E

With {{the exception of a few}} contributors, the POV's writers are for the most part liberal, which is reflective of the political leanings of the school.

For the last chapter in the trilogy the production values were higher and a police chase scenario ran through the film. Like the first two, the third episode went viral rapidly with over 6 million views in the first 3 months. France’s TF1 network titled their web article ‘The virus that is contaminating the web’. On the websites of French media outlets such as 20 Minutes, La Dépêche, and France Info all featured pieces on the video calling Candide “the king of freestyle”.The international press took interest in the release. In their online editions, magazine’s like GEO (FRA) and Adventure Journal (USA) as well as The Daily Telegraph (UK) newspaper all made comparisons between Candide and James Bond. The international news network CNN covered the video release as well. The website article took particular interest in Candide jumping over a helicopter with its rotors turning. It quotes Candide saying, “I don't think I would do it again. It was definitely kind of scary. You don't want to finish like a ham." [...] The article {{then goes on to}} confirm that, “As well as not ending up like a ham, he also jumped over a paraglider and a peloton of cyclists, skied across a lake and water-skied behind a helicopter in his latest YouTube edit.”In the specialized ski press, Powder (USA) magazine said, “The third installment of One of Those Days might be the best yet, as Candide Thovex outdoes himself again, setting the bar in ski edit creativity.” After praising the first two edits, Elemental Adventure (UK) expressed the same sentiment on their website, “This time Candide raised the bar to another level.” Mountain sports website, Mountain Watch (AUS) called it, “quite likely the greatest ski video ever”. Mashable, the global, multi-platform media and entertainment company presented it on their website as “the most insane ski video ever created”. Pitch (UK), a leading independent sports and entertainment marketing agency stated, “Singlehandedly Thovex is taking freesking into the mainstream and cementing himself as a household name in the process.” ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the use of the first person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> in Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White. The Woman in White is a novel of mystery. The use of the first person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> more than one characters is suitable to reveal the mystery of the story. It is through Walter Hartright's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Marian Halcombe's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Vincent Gilmore's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and Count Fosco's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The narrators' interpretations on the story's actions are limited.

They cannot report the thoughts and feelings of other characters for they cannot enter their minds. However these limitations have their advantages.
