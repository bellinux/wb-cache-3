5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would be obliged to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|In April 1858, Tubman was {{introduced}} to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States. Although she never advocated violence against whites, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals. Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the wrath of slaveholders. She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> {{a single}} hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with}} a limited number of lives; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life. If a player exhausts their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E
5|$|Rob-B-Hood {{tells the}} story of a {{kidnapping}} gone wrong in Hong Kong; a trio of burglars consisting of Thongs (Chan), Octopus (Koo) and the Landlord (Hui) kidnap a baby from a wealthy family on behalf of triads. With the Landlord arrested, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby for a short time, developing strong bonds with him. Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the triads who hired them in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The Mets added deGrom {{to their}} 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> being {{eligible}} in the Rule 5 draft. During the offseason, deGrom improved his mechanics, {{and learned to}} throw a curveball.

5|$|The R+L=J theory {{posits that}} rather than Rhaegar {{kidnapping}} Lyanna, {{they fell in love}} and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a child—Jon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth. Ned claimed the baby as his own to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The plan works, in a way—Dallas can't resist {{insulting}} Hunsecker's methods, and, {{forced to}} choose between them, the timid Susan breaks up with Dallas in order to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> her brother. Hunsecker, however, is enraged by Dallas's insults to him after a brief confrontation. He decides to ruin the boy after all (against Falco's advice) and wants to have marijuana planted on the musician, then have him arrested and roughed up by corrupt police Lt. Harry Kello (Emile Meyer).|$|E
5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E

During the Guipuzcoana scandal in Venezuela, Baltasar's father, Juan Francisco de León, and his sons were held prisoners in Cádiz. Juan Francisco died {{as a consequence of}} smallpox, but Don Baltasar completed his years in prison and then moved to El Hatillo.

5|$|Ash pedals furiously toward Viridian City. Ash loses {{control of}} the bike and wipes out, {{crashing}} down a hill. Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads him to go inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> players wanting {{to make a name}} for themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying on the ice.|$|E
5|$|Gambira started {{attending}} school at age five, but the 1988 pro-democracy protests caused school closings that interrupted Gambira's schooling. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), {{he ran away}} from home at age 12 and was recruited as a child soldier by a military unit in Yangon. Once his parents located him, they removed him from the unit and returned with him to their home in Pauk Township. When the authorities came to investigate, Gambira's parents enrolled him in a local monastery to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> arrest or conscription into further military service.|$|E

5|$|He {{has never}} been charged with any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, in order to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from {{a federal appeals court}} ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into {{a charity}} pet {{photograph}} contest {{as a way}} to promote the library; Dewey won the contest after receiving more than 80% of the votes. Dewey's win was covered in The Des Moines Register, which led to increased local and state publicity in print and on television, and the library never again made an effort to increase Dewey's publicity outside of the local area. An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people claimed to have been the person who left Dewey in the book drop {{as a way to}} <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the cold.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a cocktail of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride but this was blocked by a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.|$|E

His entire life has taken place within a giant arcological dome in Hollywood, fashioned to create the seaside town of Seahaven Island, and equipped with thousands of cameras to monitor all aspects of Truman's life. All of Seahaven's residents are actors, either acting out a script or repeating lines fed {{to them by the}} show's creator and executive producer, Christof, who seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behavior, give audiences a relatable everyman, and <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the outside world with a sense of normalcy.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
5|$|Filitti lived secluded in a townhouse on Oltarului Street, in the Bucharest {{quarter of}} Moșilor. He {{repeatedly}} complained about street noises, confiscated the footballs of neighborhood children, and eventually received (from Romanian Police chief Gavrilă Marinescu) a permanent guard to <b>protect</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> distractions. Filitti had few visiting friends, among them Alexandru Filitti-Robănești, teacher Alexandru Pisoschi, historians Emanoil Hagi-Moscu and G. D. Florescu. He was however in constant correspondence with other scholars who shared his passions, including Greek jurist Panagiotis Zepos, His Majesty's Antiquarian G. T. Kirileanu, bibliophile Constantin Karadja, regional historian G. Poboran, academician-priest Nicolae M. Popescu and Hungarian archivist Endre (Andrei) Veress. In {{addition to the}} anti-Germanophile Nicolae Iorga, his rivals in academia included {{a new generation of}} leading historians, who were targets of his polemical articles: Gheorghe I. Brătianu, George Fotino, Constantin C. Giurescu and P. P. Panaitescu. The latter was however influenced by Filitti's ideas on the sources of landed property, and incorporated them into his own historical narrative.|$|E
