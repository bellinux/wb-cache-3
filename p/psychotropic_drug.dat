500|$|Alcoholics {{may also}} require {{treatment}} for other <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drug</b> addictions and drug dependences. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is benzodiazepine dependence, with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine {{drugs such as}} valium or clonazopam. These drugs are, like alcohol, depressants. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, {{or they may be}} purchased as illegal drugs [...] "on the street" [...] through illicit channels. [...] Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers. Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as zolpidem and zopiclone as well as opiates and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of psychosis or seizures if not managed properly.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1940s, Frank Milan Berger {{was working}} in a {{laboratory}} of a British drug company, looking for a preservative for penicillin, when he noticed that a compound called mephenesin had a sedative effect in laboratory rodents. Berger subsequently referred to this sedating or “tranquilizing” effect in a now-historic article, published by The British Journal of Pharmacology in 1946. However, there were three major drawbacks {{to the use of}} mephenesin as a tranquilizer: a very short duration of action, greater effect on the spinal cord than on the brain, and a weak activity. In May 1950, after moving to Carter Products in New Jersey, Berger and a chemist, Bernard John Ludwig, synthesized a chemically related tranquilizing compound, meprobamate, that was able to overcome these three drawbacks. [...] Wallace Laboratories, a subsidiary of Carter Products, bought the license and named their new product [...] "Miltown" [...] after the borough of Milltown in New Jersey. Launched in 1955, it rapidly became the first blockbuster <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drug</b> in American history, becoming popular in Hollywood and gaining notoriety for its seemingly miraculous effects. It has since been marketed under more than 100 trade names, from Amepromat through Quivet to Zirpon.|$|E

Baker claimed that throughout this period the lights were kept on so he could not sleep and that he did not eat for 20 days. Baker denied that the suitcase was his and claimed that Prunier had tricked him into carrying it through customs. However, {{at the end of the}} detention period, he signed a statement in Japanese that during the trial was seen as inconsistent and self-incriminating. [...] Baroness Sarah Ludford, a member of the European Parliament and justice spokeswoman for the United Kingdom's Liberal Democratic Party, criticized the quality of the Japanese-English interpretation during the interrogation, and noted that Baker was required to sign a witness statement in Japanese, a language he did not understand. Baker later claimed that the police had told him that if he signed a statement he would be incriminating Prunier and that he would be allowed to return home. Baker was indicted on 1 May for violation of the Narcotic and <b>Psychotropic</b> <b>Drug</b> Control Law, and Customs Law.|$|E

40|$|Background: Older {{people are}} more {{susceptible}} to falls than younger people. Therefore, as the Dutch population ages, the total number of falls and costs associated with them will rise. The use of <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drugs</b> is associated with an increased risk of falling. To create tailored fall-prevention programmes, information on the magnitude of the association between fall incidents and specific <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drugs</b> or drug classes is needed. Objective: The goal {{of this study was to}} delineate the associations between fall incidents and specific <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drugs</b> or drug classes. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic patient records, medication records and fall incident reports were collected for 1415 residents receiving somatic or psychogeriatric care in 22 nursing homes in the eastern part of the Netherlands from May 2012 until March 2015. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we analysed the magnitude of the association between <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drugs</b> and the risk of falling for users and non-users of the <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drugs</b> or drug classes. Results: Antipsychotics (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1. 49; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 12 – 2. 00) and hypnotics and sedatives (aHR 1. 51; 95 % CI 1. 13 – 2. 02) increase the risk of falling. There was no difference between the risk incurred by typical and atypical antipsychotics. However, within these groups, there were differences between the most commonly prescribed drugs: haloperidol and quetiapine were seen to have an association with falls, whereas pipamperone and risperidone were not. Conclusions: The results suggest falls may be associated with individual drugs rather than drug classes. Within the drug classes, clear differences are evident between individual drugs. Future fall-prevention programmes should highlight the differential risks involved with the use of specific <b>psychotropic</b> <b>drugs,</b> and doctors should take the fall risk into account when choosing specific drugs...|$|R
