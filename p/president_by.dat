5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective <b>President.</b> <b>By</b> then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|By definition, modern {{democratic}} constitutional monarchies are parliamentary, {{as there}} is no elected head of state who could assume non-ceremonial competences; of the twenty one republican member states of the European Union, only one is a presidential republic (Cyprus) and five are semi-presidential republics (France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania). These six (semi-)presidential republics elect their <b>president</b> <b>by</b> direct popular vote. Among the fourteen parliamentary republics, half do the same (namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia), whereas in the remaining seven (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta), the president is elected by parliament or other special representative body such as the German Bundesversammlung.|$|E
5|$|Claiborne and Haw {{promoted}} Jesus for <b>President</b> <b>by</b> {{going on}} a U.S. speaking tour of 30 cities. The tour {{led up to the}} 2008 United States presidential election, and the book tour was suggestive of a third party candidate campaign for Jesus. The authors' speeches did not attempt to sway their audiences towards or away from any particular candidates, but rather encouraged them to endorse whichever candidates supported Christian values.|$|E

5|$|FC Barcelona, nicknamed Barça, is a {{football}} club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain that competes in La Liga, {{the most senior}} football league in Spain. Since its founding in 1899, the club has had 40 different presidents. The club {{is owned by the}} club-members of FC Barcelona, and similarly to a limited liability company, they elect the <b>president</b> <b>by</b> a ballot. The president has the responsibility for the overall management of the club, including formally signing contracts with players and staff. In Spain, it is customary for the president to watch the games in which the first-team participates, together with the president from the opposing team.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{as the leader}} of the UCR, and opposed the presidency of Carlos Menem. He initiated the Pact of Olivos with Menem in order to negotiate the terms for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Fernando de la Rúa led a faction of the UCR that opposed the pact, and eventually became president in 1999. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Alfonsín's faction provided the support needed for the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed <b>president</b> <b>by</b> the Congress. Alfonsín died of lung cancer on 31March 2009, at the age of 82, and was given a large state funeral.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, the Illinois state {{legislature}} passed the Chicago School Reform Act, {{which gave the}} Mayor of Chicago unprecedented new control over Chicago Public Schools. Daley asked Chico to become the CEO, but Chico declined because he was resuming his law career. Chico instead recommended that Daley appoint colleague Paul Vallas as CEO, and Chico was named chairman of the School Reform Board of Trustees. In 1997 Chico was named Outstanding School Board <b>President</b> <b>by</b> the Illinois State Board of Education for his reforms in education and fiscal policies.|$|E
5|$|In July 1947, Mandela rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, {{where he}} died; he was succeeded as ANCYL <b>president</b> <b>by</b> the more {{moderate}} Peter Mda, {{who agreed to}} co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. Mandela disagreed with Mda's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ANCYL, considering their ideology un-African. In 1947, Mandela {{was elected to the}} executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with Indians and communists, Mandela {{was one of those who}} forced his resignation.|$|E

5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or <b>President,</b> <b>by</b> 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could help prepare him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E
5|$|The {{presidency}} of Ulysses S. Grant began on March 4, 1869, {{when he was}} inaugurated as the 18th President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office {{in the aftermath of}} the Civil War, and he presided over much of the Reconstruction Era. A Republican, Grant became president after defeating Democrat Horatio Seymour in the 1868 presidential election. He was reelected in 1872 in a landslide victory, overcoming a split in the Republican Party that resulted in the formation of the Liberal Republicans, which nominated Horace Greeley to oppose him. He was succeeded as <b>president</b> <b>by</b> Republican Rutherford B. Hayes after the contested 1876 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for <b>president</b> <b>by</b> members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E

5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice <b>president</b> <b>by</b> Nellie.|$|E
5|$|Born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Kirchner studied {{law at the}} National University of La Plata. He met {{and married}} Cristina Fernández at this time, {{returned}} with her to Río Gallegos at graduation, and opened a law firm. Commentators have criticized him {{for a lack of}} legal activism during the Dirty War, an issue he would involve himself in as president. Kirchner ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987 and for governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. He was reelected governor in 1995 and 1999 due to an amendment of the provincial constitution. Kirchner sided with Buenos Aires provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde against President Carlos Menem. Although Duhalde lost the 1999 presidential election, he was appointed <b>president</b> <b>by</b> the Congress when previous presidents Fernando de la Rúa and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned during the December 2001 riots. Duhalde suggested that Kirchner run for president in 2003 in a bid to prevent Menem's return to the presidency. Menem won a plurality {{in the first round of}} the presidential election but, fearing that he would lose in the required runoff election, he resigned; Kirchner became president as a result.|$|E
5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate for Prime Minister. The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to disagree {{with the majority of}} his government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting <b>President.</b> <b>By</b> late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
