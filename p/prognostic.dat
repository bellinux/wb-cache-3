5|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} is a curable disease; {{the chance of}} cure for a {{specific}} person depends {{on a number of}} <b>prognostic</b> factors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prognostic</b> {{factors in}} NSCLC include {{presence}} of pulmonary symptoms, large tumor size (>3cm), nonsquamous cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For people with inoperable disease, outcomes are worse {{in those with}} poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%. <b>Prognostic</b> factors in small cell lung cancer include performance status, gender, stage of disease, and involvement of {{the central nervous system}} or liver at the time of diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission {{does not mean the}} disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the <b>prognostic</b> factors described above. The length of remission depends on the <b>prognostic</b> features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
30|$|Standardization in <b>prognostics</b> system {{development}} {{is aimed at}} generalizing the <b>prognostics</b> process, information exchange within <b>prognostics</b> system, implementation of <b>prognostics</b> system, and <b>prognostics</b> system design methodology. Because <b>prognostics</b> is the key enabler of CBM, the standardization of <b>prognostics</b> {{system development}} is identified within the CBM system development.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of the unavoidable uncertainties has a great effect on the <b>prognostics</b> accuracy and performance. However, their influences are rarely {{taken into account in}} the current <b>prognostics</b> performance evaluation. Consequently, the validity and/or trustiness degree of <b>prognostics</b> and health management system has not been comprehensively evaluated or measured. Considering the definition of <b>prognostics</b> performance and the characteristics of uncertainties, four <b>prognostics</b> performance metrics and two kinds of quantitative evaluation methods are proposed. On the basis of <b>prognostics</b> performance definition, a novel trustworthiness of <b>prognostics</b> concept is presented. Then, three kinds of assessment methods for trustworthiness of <b>prognostics</b> are provided. Finally, a case study has been carried out on the aviation hydraulic pump for verification purposes, in which the oil-return flow is monitored for predicting the degradation of the pump. The systematic application of trustworthiness of <b>prognostics</b> assessment is implemented based on the back propagation neural network <b>prognostics</b> algorithm. The results show that the proposed trustworthiness of <b>prognostics</b> concept and assessment methods can contribute to the systematic and comprehensive understanding of the performance of <b>prognostics</b> and health management system...|$|R
30|$|This {{literature}} review paper about <b>prognostics</b> is mainly intended for new <b>prognostics</b> researchers. Professional <b>prognostics</b> researchers who {{delve into the}} details of different <b>prognostics</b> aspects can also benefit from this paper to recall the concepts.|$|R
5|$|The WHO 2008 {{classification}} of {{acute myeloid leukemia}} attempts to be more clinically useful and to produce more meaningful <b>prognostic</b> information than the FAB criteria. Each of the WHO categories contains numerous descriptive subcategories {{of interest to the}} hematopathologist and oncologist; however, most of the clinically significant information in the WHO schema is communicated via categorization into one of the subtypes listed below.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} on renal biopsy correlate with {{the severity of}} symptoms: those with asymptomatic hematuria may only have focal mesangial proliferation while those with proteinuria may have marked cellular proliferation or even crescent formation. The number of crescentic glomeruli is an important <b>prognostic</b> factor in determining whether the patient will develop chronic renal disease.|$|E
25|$|The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) {{uses the}} term Stage to define the {{anatomical}} extent of disease. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) {{uses the term}} <b>Prognostic</b> Stage Group which may also include additional <b>prognostic</b> factors in addition to anatomical extent of disease.|$|E
40|$|<b>Prognostics</b> aims {{to improve}} asset {{availability}} through intelligent maintenance actions. Up-to-date {{remaining useful life}} predictions enable the optimization of maintenance planning. Verification of <b>prognostics</b> techniques aims to analyze if the <b>prognostics</b> application meets the design requirements. Online <b>prognostics</b> applications depend on the data-gathering hardware architecture to perform correct <b>prognostics</b> predictions. Accordingly, when verifying <b>prognostics</b> requirements compliance, {{it is necessary to}} include the effect of hardware failures on <b>prognostics</b> predictions. In this paper we investigate the use of formal verification techniques for the integrated verification of <b>prognostics</b> applications including hardware and software components. Focusing on the probabilistic model-checking approach, a case study from the power industry shows the validity of the proposed framework...|$|R
30|$|<b>Prognostics</b> {{approaches}} are classified in different ways. Sometimes, the classification {{is based on}} the type of available data and knowledge about the system. Another time <b>prognostics</b> {{approaches are}} classified according to the type of the used methodology. The <b>prognostics</b> system developers can benefit from these classifications in algorithm selection based on available background about the system and suitable forecasting techniques. <b>Prognostics</b> approaches classification also helps in identifying what techniques from other technologies can be used in <b>prognostics</b> algorithms development. A key point about <b>prognostics</b> approaches classification is building a way to obtain a standard methodology for <b>prognostics</b> applications development within a standard framework.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we tried}} to present a {{complete}} vision about <b>prognostics</b> as a major component part of ISHM. We gathered a lot of sparse information about <b>prognostics</b> and combined all of these information together to present an integrated work that shows the importance of <b>prognostics</b> and its influencing rule in ISHM. We also clarified how the maintenance strategies can shift from “fail and fix” to “predict and prevent” based on the proactivity in <b>prognostics</b> and how <b>prognostics</b> is the main building block in CBM. The concept that relates <b>prognostics</b> to health management has been also introduced (PHM). After that, we discussed the <b>prognostics</b> approaches, their advantages and disadvantages, {{and how to use}} the suitable technique according to the <b>prognostics</b> problem definition. We also presented a lot of <b>prognostics</b> applications which have been already deployed or are just an experiment. Finally, we addressed the more challenging aspects in <b>prognostics</b> and how the research community is trying to resolve these challenges.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>prognostic</b> factors in ovarian cancer. Positive <b>prognostic</b> factors - those {{indicating}} better chances of survival - include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a <b>prognostic</b> factor. Conversely, negative <b>prognostic</b> factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated cyclooxygenase-2.|$|E
25|$|Genetic and <b>prognostic</b> {{studies also}} suggest {{a role for}} cystatin C.|$|E
25|$|Age {{and poor}} {{performance}} status are established poor <b>prognostic</b> factors, as well.|$|E
40|$|<b>Prognostics</b> is {{nowadays}} {{recognized as}} a key feature in maintenance strategies as it should allow avoiding inopportune mainteance spending. Real <b>prognostics</b> systems are however scarce in industry. That can be explained from different aspects, on of them being the difficulty of choosing an efficient technology : many approaches to support the <b>prognostics</b> process exist, whose applicability is highly dependent on industrial constraints. Thus, the general purpose of the paper is to explore the way of performing failure <b>prognostics</b> so that manager can act consequently. Different aspects of <b>prognostics</b> are discussed. The <b>prognostics</b> process is defined and overview of <b>prognostics</b> metrics is given. Following that, the "prognostics approaches" are described and discussed. The whole aims at giving and overview of the <b>prognostics</b> area...|$|R
40|$|<b>Prognostics</b> is {{a systems}} {{engineering}} discipline focused on predicting end-of-life of components and systems. As {{a relatively new}} and emerging technology, there are few fielded implementations of <b>prognostics,</b> {{due in part to}} practitioners perceiving a large hurdle in developing the models, algorithms, architecture, and integration pieces. As a result, no open software frameworks for applying <b>prognostics</b> currently exist. This paper introduces the Generic Software Architecture for <b>Prognostics</b> (GSAP), an open-source, cross-platform, object-oriented software framework and support library for creating <b>prognostics</b> applications. GSAP was designed to make <b>prognostics</b> more accessible and enable faster adoption and implementation by industry, by reducing the effort and investment required to develop, test, and deploy <b>prognostics.</b> This paper describes the requirements, design, and testing of GSAP. Additionally, a detailed case study involving battery <b>prognostics</b> demonstrates its use...|$|R
30|$|Since the {{beginning}} of applying <b>prognostics</b> concept, focus was only on <b>prognostics</b> algorithms development. Recently, the ISHM community paid {{too much attention to}} the importance of having <b>prognostics</b> metrics.|$|R
25|$|Renal involvement, in scleroderma, is {{considered}} a poor <b>prognostic</b> factor and frequently a cause of death.|$|E
25|$|The Seattle Heart Watch program {{demonstrated}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} the Bruce Protocol. It also demonstrated {{that it was a}} powerful <b>prognostic</b> tool.|$|E
25|$|Increasing age (> 60 {{years of}} age) carries a worse <b>prognostic</b> risk. Death is usually due to {{widespread}} tumor infiltration with cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure.|$|E
30|$|Onboard {{resources}} {{used to run}} <b>prognostics</b> algorithm {{are always}} a barrier for the deployment of <b>prognostics</b> solutions. To resolve this challenge, Saha et al. [64] developed a distributed <b>prognostics</b> algorithm using GPR. All computer nodes run diagnostics routines, once an off-nominal situation is detected, and nodes running <b>prognostics</b> module related to the fault mode engages in RUL estimation. Wireless communication between nodes is used which imposes more difficulty to the system. A case study for battery health management is conducted to prove the concept. Distributed <b>prognostics</b> algorithm {{can be considered as}} a large step forward in <b>prognostics</b> algorithm development.|$|R
40|$|<b>Prognostics,</b> {{which deals}} with {{predicting}} remaining useful life of components, subsystems, and systems, is a key technology for systems health management that leads to improved safety and reliability with reduced costs. The <b>prognostics</b> problem is often approached from a component-centric view. However, in most cases, it is not specifically component lifetimes that are important, but, rather, the lifetimes of the systems in which these components reside. The system-level <b>prognostics</b> problem can be quite difficult due to the increased scale {{and scope of the}} <b>prognostics</b> problem and the relative Jack of scalability and efficiency of typical <b>prognostics</b> approaches. In order to address these is ues, we develop a distributed solution to the system-level <b>prognostics</b> problem, based on the concept of structural model decomposition. The system model is decomposed into independent submodels. Independent local <b>prognostics</b> subproblems are then formed based on these local submodels, resul ting in a scalable, efficient, and flexible distributed approach to the system-level <b>prognostics</b> problem. We provide a formulation of the system-level <b>prognostics</b> problem and demonstrate the approach on a four-wheeled rover simulation testbed. The results show that the system-level <b>prognostics</b> problem can be accurately and efficiently solved in a distributed fashion...|$|R
40|$|The {{discipline}} that connects <b>prognostics</b> and system lifecycle management {{is often referred}} to as <b>prognostics</b> and health management (PHM). Though <b>prognostics</b> is one of the main parts of PHM, it is the least mature. This paper is based on the past work of data driven <b>prognostics</b> applied in the field of power electronics modules and primarily concerned with the data driven <b>prognostics</b> methods that take advantage of measured characteristics of individual systems or components in order to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) ...|$|R

25|$|The BISAP score (blood urea {{nitrogen}} level >25nbsp&mg/dL, impaired mental status, systemic {{inflammatory response}} syndrome, age over 60 years, pleural effusion) has been validated as {{similar to other}} <b>prognostic</b> scoring systems.|$|E
25|$|Mast cell tumors do not {{necessarily}} follow the histological prognosis. Further <b>prognostic</b> information can be provided by AgNOR stain of histological or cytological specimen. Even then, {{there is a risk}} of unpredictable behavior.|$|E
30|$|Section 4 talks {{thoroughly}} about <b>prognostics</b> and {{its relation}} to health management, shows how <b>prognostics</b> has improved and can be applied in several areas, describes different <b>prognostics</b> approaches, advantages and disadvantages of each approach and how multiple approaches can be combined together to produce better results, and finally discusses the <b>prognostics</b> challenges and how to deal with all of these challenges.|$|R
30|$|Validation and {{verification}} of the <b>prognostics</b> process is highly required, because {{deployment of the}} <b>prognostics</b> system could not be done before the assurance of its performance. Developing a good <b>prognostics</b> algorithm without the ability to quantify its performance makes it useless.|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} section we will show how did we benefit from the developed offline <b>prognostics</b> system and build a data-driven <b>prognostics</b> system {{that can be used}} online. This <b>prognostics</b> system can be implemented onboard and works in real-time environment.|$|R
25|$|Several <b>prognostic</b> scoring {{systems have}} been devised to predict {{mortality}} and to identify who will require an early liver transplant. These include King's College Hospital criteria, MELD score, APACHE II, and Clichy criteria.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines {{outlining}} {{requirements for}} inclusion of soluble biomarkers in osteoarthritis clinical trials {{were published in}} 2015, but as yet, there are no validated biomarkers for osteoarthritis. A 2015 systematic review of biomarkers for osteoarthritis looking for molecules {{that could be used}} for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover in 25 publications. The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II (uCTX-II) as a <b>prognostic</b> marker for knee osteoarthritis progression and serum cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) levels as a <b>prognostic</b> marker for incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis. A review of biomarkers in hip osteoarthritis also found associations with uCTXII.|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{treatment}} {{is the most}} important factor in a favorable prognosis. A delay in treatment greater than six hours or the presence of peritonitis, sepsis, hypotension, or disseminated intravascular coagulation are negative <b>prognostic</b> indicators.|$|E
30|$|Another type of <b>prognostics</b> {{standardization}} is {{the unification}} of research objectives. This unification is not yet considered by the research community, although it will help to fill the gaps in <b>prognostics</b> technology and create an integrated effort to resolve <b>prognostics</b> challenges.|$|R
40|$|The goal of <b>prognostics</b> {{and health}} {{management}} (PHM) systems {{is to ensure}} system safety, and reduce downtime and maintenance costs. It is important that a PHM system is verified and validated {{before it can be}} successfully deployed. <b>Prognostics</b> algorithms are integral parts of PHM systems. This paper investigates a systematic process of verification of such <b>prognostics</b> algorithms. To this end, first, this paper distinguishes between technology maturation and product development. Then, the paper describes the verification process for a <b>prognostics</b> algorithm as it moves up to higher maturity levels. This process is shown to be an iterative process where verification activities are interleaved with validation activities at each maturation level. In this work, we adopt the concept of technology readiness levels (TRLs) to represent the different maturity levels of a <b>prognostics</b> algorithm. It is shown that at each TRL, the verification of a <b>prognostics</b> algorithm depends on verifying the different components of the algorithm according to the requirements laid out by the PHM system that adopts this <b>prognostics</b> algorithm. Finally, using simplified examples, the systematic process for verifying a <b>prognostics</b> algorithm is demonstrated as the <b>prognostics</b> algorithm moves up TRLs...|$|R
