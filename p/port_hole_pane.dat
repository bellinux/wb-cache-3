40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} the behaviour of fuel injection through a porous surface in an inlet-fuelled, radial-farming scramjet is presented. The performance of porous fuel injection is compared to discrete <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> injection at an equivalence ratio of φ ≈ 0. 4 for both cases. The comparison is performed at a Mach 6. 5 flow condition with a total specific enthalpy of 4. 3 MJ/kg. The numerical results are compared to experiments performed in the T 4 shock tunnel where available. The presented results demonstrate for the first time, that porous fuel injection {{has the potential to}} outperform <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> injectors in scramjet engines in terms of fuel-air mixing, ignition delays and achievable combustion efficiencies despite reduced fuel penetration heights...|$|R
50|$|Prince's Fort, {{circular}} in shape, {{was constructed}} of heavy logs. It was 150 ft {{in diameter and}} 15 ft high. <b>Port</b> <b>holes</b> were cut for use by riflemen, and it {{was surrounded by a}} ditch, the dirt from which was thrown against the walls to parapet height.|$|R
50|$|The plasma vessel, {{built of}} 20 parts, {{is on the}} inside, {{adjusted}} to the complex shape of the magnetic field.

40|$|Atypical mycobacterial infections at the laparoscopic port site are a {{frequent}} problem encountered in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. In {{this study we}} concentrate on the clinical diagnosis, management and prevention of this problem. In this series we assess 19 patients presenting with <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> infections after laparoscopic surgery and were treated {{with a combination of}} oral clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin. Seven patients who had persistent nodules were given injections of amikacin directly into the infection foci along with standard oral therapy. Most of the patients treated with standard oral therapy for 28  days showed recovery. The patients with persistent nodules 4  weeks after completion of therapy were treated with injections of amikacin directly into the nodule which lead to resolution of symptoms. For prevention of infection, proper sterilization and storage of instruments is recommended. Laparoscopic <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> infections is a preventable problem and can also be treated by nonsurgical method...|$|R
50|$|A {{sleeve valve}} {{takes the form}} of one or more {{machined}} sleeves. It fits between the piston and the cylinder wall in the cylinder of an internal combustion engine, where it rotates and/or slides. <b>Ports</b> (<b>holes)</b> {{in the side of the}} sleeves come into alignment with the cylinder's inlet and exhaust ports at the appropriate stages in the engine's cycle.|$|R

2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the <b>port</b> <b>hole</b> and all I could see was a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|R

5000|$|The {{name was}} revived in February 1958 when the world's first nuclear-powered {{aircraft}} carrier was laid down as the eighth Enterprise; this ship was commissioned in November 1961. Also nicknamed the [...] "Big E", various artifacts and mementos were kept aboard from her predecessor. The <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> in the captain's in-port cabin and conference room are only one example. She was inactivated and removed from service on 1 December 2012 after being in the fleet for 51 years. Due to needs involving reactor removal, she cannot {{be turned into a}} memorial. At her inactivation, it was announced that the ninth ship to bear the name Enterprise would be the planned , CVN-80. It has not been confirmed what, if any, artifacts from USS Enterprise (CV-6) will be incorporated into this next generation aircraft carrier, although a time capsule containing mementos from both CV-6 and CVN-65 will be presented to the first captain of the new Enterprise. The aforementioned <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> aboard the CVN-65 will be removed and returned to the Boston Navy Yard Museum.|$|R

2500|$|In a {{pneumatic}} siren, the stator is {{the part}} which cuts off and reopens air as rotating blades of a chopper move past the <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> of the stator, generating sound. The pitch of the siren's sound {{is a function of}} the speed of the rotor and the number of holes in the stator. [...] A siren with only one row of ports is called a single tone siren. A siren with two rows of ports is known as a dual tone siren.|$|R
50|$|The folded {{ceiling surface}} which follows {{the line of}} the roof acts as a shelter for the house. Instead of {{creating}} a parapet, the roof shifts to two sides and it creates an overhang or eave to the north. With the combination of the dark coloured ceiling and the roof of the house, it visually camouflages itself with the bush landscape. The pocket windows installed on the wall are carved out to provide <b>port</b> <b>holes</b> to isolate and frame the views.|$|R
50|$|The stockade, {{measuring}} 100 ft by 125 ft, {{was started}} on May 29. It consisted of logs set upright on end in an oval.
