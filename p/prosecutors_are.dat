40|$|A <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> {{viewed by}} the public as a {{powerful}} law enforcement official whose responsibility is to convict guilty people of crimes. But not everybody understands that a <b>prosecutor’s</b> function <b>is</b> not only to win convictions of law-breakers. A <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> a quasi-judicial official who {{has a duty to}} promote justice to the entire community, including those people charged with crimes. Indeed, an overriding function of a <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> to ensure that innocent people not get convicted and punished. A <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> constitutionally and ethically mandated to promote justice. The <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> even considered a 2 ̆ 2 Minister of Justice 2 ̆ 2 who has a constitutional, statutory, and ethical duty to ensure that a defendant is convicted on the basis of reliable evidence in proceedings that are fair. Nevertheless, some prosecutors deviate from these rules and engage in conduct that distorts the fact-finding process and produces erroneous convictions. Indeed, if a <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> motivated to zealously win a conviction by any means, and engages in conduct that either intentionally or carelessly undermines the integrity of the fact-finding process, the prosecutor inescapably will bring about the conviction of a defendant who is actually innocent...|$|R
25|$|In 2013, {{a person}} filed lèse-majesté charges against his brother, showing how easily the lèse-majesté law can be misused {{and that the}} law {{has now become a}} {{potential}} weapon in family feuds.

25|$|Austrian <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> {{investigating}} {{allegations that}} up to €100 million was made available to lobbyists to influence the original purchase decision in favour of the Eurofighter. By October 2013, all Typhoons in service with Austria had been upgraded to the latest Tranche 1 standard. In 2014, due to defense budget restrictions, there were only 12 pilots available to fly the 15 aircraft in Austria's Air Force. In February 2017, Austrian Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil accused Airbus of fraudulent intent following a probe that allegedly unveiled corruption linked {{to the order of}} Typhoon jets.|$|E
25|$|According to the Turkish legal system, {{international}} conventions {{on human rights}} automatically {{become part of the}} national legal order without additional transposition once they are ratified by the Parliament. International human rights instruments to which Turkey is party have to be taken into consideration by judges and prosecutors. Therefore, <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> strongly encouraged to directly apply the landmark decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and particularly the Handyside v United Kingdom case. Furthermore, the statement of the suspect cannot be taken before the permission of the Minister of Justice in order not to discredit the suspect {{in the eyes of the}} public.|$|E

25|$|The District of Columbia has a {{complicated}} criminal prosecution system. The Attorney General of the District of Columbia only has jurisdiction in civil proceedings and prosecuting minor offenses such as low-level misdemeanors and traffic violations. All federal offenses, local felony charges (i.e. serious crimes such as robbery, murder, aggravated assault, grand theft, and arson), and most local misdemeanors are prosecuted by the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. United States Attorneys are {{appointed by the}} President and overseen by the United States Department of Justice. This differs from {{elsewhere in the country}} where 93% of local <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> directly elected and the remainder are appointed by local elected officials.|$|E
25|$|According to the Law Governing the Organization of the Court, prosecutors’ offices {{form part}} of the court {{at the same level}} of trial: the Supreme Court has a prosecutors’ office with a number of prosecutors, of whom one is {{appointed}} as Prosecutor-General; each of the other High Courts or District Courts had its own prosecutors’ office with a number of prosecutors, of whom one is appointed as the chief prosecutor. According to the Law Governing the Organization of the Court and the Statute Governing Judicial Personnel Administration, the qualifications of <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> identical to that of judges. Both of them possess the status of judicial officials. Prosecutors shall be appointed from those persons who have passed the Examination of Judicial Officials, completed the Training Course for Judicial Officials and possessed distinguished records after a term of practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the U.S. Attorneys in the District of Columbia are neither elected nor {{appointed}} by city officials leads to criticism that the <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> not responsive {{to the needs of}} local residents. For example, new felony prosecutions by the U.S. Attorneys in the District of Columbia have fallen 34%; from 8,016 in 2003 to 5,256 in 2007. The number of resolved felony cases has also fallen by nearly half; from 10,206 in 2003 to 5,534 in 2007. In contrast, the number of misdemeanor and civil cases prosecuted and resolved by the D.C. Attorney General's office has remained constant over the same time period. The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia cites the drop in prosecutions to a 14% cut in its budget. The cuts have caused the office to decrease the number of federal prosecutors from a high of 110 in 2003 to 76 in 2007.|$|E
50|$|If no one {{is killed}} or hurt, and the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> {{proceeding}} by summary conviction, the maximum sentence is 18 months of jail. If {{no one is}} killed or hurt, and the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>is</b> proceeding by indictment, the maximum sentence is 5 years of jail.|$|R
50|$|An {{explicit}} figure {{regarding the}} dismissal of judges and <b>prosecutors</b> <b>is</b> available. Of 860 judges and <b>prosecutors,</b> 656 <b>were</b> reviewed and 176 were removed from their positions within the Ministry of Justice. In compensation, 185 new judges and <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> hired. Furthermore, the general elimination of engineers, directors, and technocrats meant that Iraqi government ministries had difficulty in fulfilling their duties to Iraqi citizens.|$|R
50|$|Private <b>prosecutors</b> <b>were</b> used in North Carolina {{as late as}} 1975. The {{court ruled}} in State v. Best in 1974 that an elected <b>prosecutor</b> must <b>be</b> {{in charge of all}} prosecutions.|$|R
25|$|Three {{statements}} {{referred to}} the case of Vignes Mourthi, who had been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. Shadrake had drawn {{attention to the fact that}} one Sergeant Rajkumar from the Central Narcotics Bureau was under investigation for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act at around the time he was giving evidence in Mourthi's case. Shadrake then stated that the high echelons of the judiciary knew about Rajkumar's misdeeds but deliberately suppressed knowledge of them until after Mourthi had been executed. There was no rational basis for these statements. Shadrake claimed that the judiciary would have known of the proceedings against Rajkumar because members of the subordinate judiciary, who deal with 95% of the cases in Singapore, and <b>prosecutors,</b> <b>are</b> both drawn from the Singapore Legal Service. Furthermore, some judges of the Supreme Court were elevated from the Subordinate Courts and had served stints in the Attorney-General's Chambers. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court's findings that this was too incredible and attenuated to form a rational basis for the claim.|$|E
500|$|... ederal {{courts and}} <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> now realizing the {{potential}} {{uses for the}} mail fraud statute in combating political corruption. The relative ease of proving mail fraud violations and the apparent increase in corrupt political activities have caused more political officials to face mail fraud prosecutions. The recent successful prosecution of a non-elected political official foreshadows the continuing evolution of the mail fraud act {{as one of the}} public's protectors against bribery and extortion committed by government personnel.|$|E
500|$|The African Union {{endorsed}} {{the position of}} the Kenyan government in seeking to delay or postpone the ICC proceedings. As of 2011, all of the formal investigations which have been put before the International Criminal Court have concerned African countries, and only African defendants have been indicted. This has led to some resentment within Africa that the Court is targeting Africa unfairly. In particular the African Union has cited this geographical imbalance of ICC investigations in its decisions not to co-operate in the proceedings against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The ICC Deputy Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda denied that the ICC or its <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> discriminatory, speaking in Côte d'Ivoire she said: ...|$|E

500|$|Article VII {{involves}} the public officers and employees, including appointment/nomination, compensation, promotions, affirmations, and powers. The role of {{officers in the}} state government is discussed. Before the officer enters the duties of office, the officer must subscribe an oath.

500|$|During this time, {{personal}} works, such as Fielding's Amelia, became {{targets for}} a [...] "paper war" [...] between various London writers. Fielding {{was quick to}} respond, and on 11 January 1752 in a piece published in The Covent-Garden Journal, he ironically stated: [...] "a famous Surgeon, who absolutely cured one Mrs Amelia Booth, of a violent Hurt in her Nose, insomuch, that she had scarce a Scar left on it, intends to bring Actions against several ill-meaning and slanderous People, who have reported that the said Lady had no Nose, merely because the Author of her History, in a Hurry, forgot to inform his Readers of that Particular." [...] However, Hill {{was not the only}} one to attack during this time; Bonnell Thornton wrote satires of Amelia in the Drury-Lane Journal. Thornton's satires were first published on 16 January 1752 and included a fake advertisement for a parody novel called [...] "Shamelia", playing off of title of Fielding's parody Shamela. He later parodied the work on 13 February 1752 in a piece called [...] "A New Chapter in Amelia." [...] Tobias Smollett joined in and published the pamphlet Habbakkuk Hilding anonymously on 15 January 1752. Although there was much criticism, there was some support for the work, and an anonymous pamphlet was written to attack [...] "Hill and 'the Town'" [...] and praise the novel. On 25 January 1752, Fielding defended his work again by bringing the novel before the imaginary [...] "Court of Censorial Enquiry", in which the <b>prosecutors</b> <b>are</b> Hill and the other critics and it is they, not Amelia that are truly put on trial.|$|E
