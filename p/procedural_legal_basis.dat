40|$|Many laws, e. g., those {{concerning}} {{taxes and}} social benefits, {{need to be}} operationalized and implemented into public administration procedures and eGovernment applications. Where such operationalization is warranted, the legal frameworks that interpret the underlying laws are typically prescriptive, providing procedural rules for ensuring legal compliance. We propose a UML-based approach for modeling pro- cedural legal rules. With help from legal experts, we investigate actual legal texts, identifying both the information needs and sources of com- plexity in the formalization of <b>procedural</b> <b>legal</b> rules. Building on this study, we develop a UML profile that enables more precise modeling of such legal rules. To {{be able to use}} logic-based tools for compliance analysis, we automatically transform models of <b>procedural</b> <b>legal</b> rules into the Object Constraint Language (OCL).

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structure}} of legal bases according to competences, instruments, and procedures; as well as <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in the European Union {{before and after the}} introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of general criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation as they have been developed under supranational EU law. It discovers several flaws inherited in the quest for the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> on the grounds of overlapping competences, divergent inter-institutional interests, and inconsistencies in the courts’ judgements. In addition, the previous pillar structure of the EU has also led to cross-pillar litigation which is particularly the case in the area of external relations. With the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the previous pillar structure has been abolished and the former third pillar has been integrated into the realm of supranational EU law. While the intergovernmental sphere is thus minimised to the area of common foreign and security policy, <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> conflicts will continue to occur between this area and the TFEU as well as within the TFEU itself. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty has even created new problems concerning the choice of the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> most notably as regards the newly codified competence categories as well as the new hierarchy of legal instruments. This may require the development of new criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in order to guarantee legal certainty in these areas for future cases...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Brill. The article examines {{the problem of the}} absence of an express <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to detain in the law of non-international armed conflict. It considers the attempts to locate the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> by way of logical inference either from a putative power to kill in non-international armed conflicts or from the power to detain in international armed conflicts. It also considers teleological and practical arguments posed against the existence of a legal power to detain. It then argues that the preferred interpretation is to view the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to detain as inherent in the law of non-international armed conflict. The existence of an implicit <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> is consistent with the understandings and expectations of the drafters of Additional Protocol I, as evidenced by a close examination of the travaux préparatoires. Moreover, the post-World War II practice and some modern-day pronouncements corroborate the existence of an inherent <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> in customary IHL. Finally, in light of the challenges posed by modern conflicts marked by the asymmetry of the parties and by the extraterritoriality of the hostilities, the law of NIAC is far more effective if it is interpreted to contain a legal power to detain than if it is not...|$|R
