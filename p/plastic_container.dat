5|$|Jif is {{packaged}} in a squeezable container {{shaped like a}} lemon, and in bottles. Development of the <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> began in the 1950s, {{and was one of}} the original blow moulded containers used for food applications. Jif brand lemon juice was established in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the <b>plastic</b> <b>container.</b> Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} research {{was to assess the}} efficacy of biodegradable <b>containers</b> compared to <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> for the production of long-term crops using a subirrigation system. Plastic and various biocontainers were used to grow `Rainier Purple 2 ̆ 7 cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum L.) in ebb-and-flood benches. After 15 weeks, the physical properties of the containers were tested. The used <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> had strengths of 23. 3, 23. 5 and 21. 9 g for the bottom, middle and top zones respectively. The peat, dairy manure and wood fiber containers had strengths of less than 2 kg for each zone. The peat, dairy manure, wood fiber and rice straw containers had used tensile strengths of 0, 0, 3. 61 and 5. 29 g respectively. Total water for wood fiber containers was significantly higher than <b>plastic</b> <b>containers.</b> Irrigation interval for <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> was significantly longer than for wood fiber <b>containers.</b> <b>Plastic,</b> bioplastic, solid ricehull and slotted ricehull containers had no algal or fungal growth. There {{were no significant differences between}} biocontainers and <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> for days to flower. All biocontainers except wood fiber had significantly higher shoot dry weights than plants grown in <b>plastic</b> <b>containers.</b> The plants grown in the <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> had root dry weights of 3. 0 g. Solid ricehull, paper, wood fiber and coconut fiber containers had higher plant root dry weights than <b>plastic</b> <b>containers.</b> The bioplastic, solid ricehull and slotted ricehull containers would all be appropriate substitutes for <b>plastic</b> <b>containers.</b> These containers retained high levels of punch and tensile strength, had no algal and fungal growth, required a similar amount of water as the <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> and did not negatively affect plant growth. The peat, dairy manure, wood fiber and rice straw containers would not be appropriate substitutes for <b>plastic</b> <b>containers</b> because of the low used strengths, high percentages of algae coverage and shorter irrigation intervals. Paper and coconut fiber containers could be used to substitute for <b>plastic.</b> These <b>containers</b> retained high used strengths, similar total water usage amounts, and did not negatively affect plant growth. These containers had algae but it was less than 9...|$|R

25|$|It's {{important}} to check {{whether there are}} any undesired interactions between the preparation and the container. For instance, if a <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> is used, tests are carried out to see whether any of the ingredients become adsorbed on to the plastic, and whether any plasticizer, lubricants, pigments, or stabilizers leach out of the plastic into the preparation. Even the adhesives for the container label need to be tested, to ensure they do not leach through the <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> into the preparation.|$|E

In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight polyethylene plastic bag contained within a hard snap-top rectangular <b>plastic</b> <b>container,</b> which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, {{or they may be}} contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.|$|E

The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time {{depending on the type of}} pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.|$|E

25|$|Pump-Type water {{consists}} of a - or 5-gallon non-pressurized metal or <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> with a pump mounted to it, and a discharge hose and nozzle. Pump type water extinguishers are often used where freezing conditions may occur, {{as they can be}} economically freeze-protected with calcium chloride (except stainless steel models), such as barns, out buildings and unheated warehouses. They are also useful where many, frequent spot fires may occur, such as during fire watch for hot work operations. They are dependent on the user's strength to produce a decent discharge stream for firefighting. Water and antifreeze are the most common, but loaded stream and foam designs were made in the past. Backback models exist for wildland firefighting, and may be solid material such as metal or fiberglass, or collapsible vinyl or rubber bags for ease of storage.|$|E
25|$|The fights {{are held}} {{outdoors}} in an oval ring (douzha), which was traditionally a flat clay pot but is more commonly a <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> today. Crickets are stimulated with a tickler (cao) {{made of a}} rat's whisker hairs (Beijing style) or of fresh grass strands (Shanghai style). The handler tickles the cricket's head, then the abdomen, and finally the hind legs. Each fight consists of three or five bouts; the winner must score in two of three or three of five bouts. A bout is stopped when the triumphant winner extends his wings {{as a sign of}} victory, or when his opponent flees from the action. Laufer wrote that the fights of his time usually ended in the death of one of the crickets: The winners physically beheaded their opponents. Present-day fights may look vicious but are not lethal; the loser is always allowed to flee from the winner.|$|E
25|$|The {{lamp housing}} is a metal or <b>plastic</b> <b>container</b> {{that serves as}} a body for the entire {{instrument}} and prevents light from spilling in unwanted directions. It comprises all of the exterior of the fixture except for the lens or opening. The housing may be designed with specific elements that help reduce heat and increase the efficiency of a lamp. Older instruments were made from rolled and machined steel or aluminum. With the advent of the Source Four, many lighting instruments are being made from die cast metal. Die casting allows for one single, light-weight body that is more economical to produce and use. The first lantern to make use of die castings was the Strand Pattern 23 designed by Fred Bentham in 1953, this small mirror spot enjoyed a 30-year production run and found its way into many British schools, halls and theaters. Some instruments are made from plastic, such as the Selecon Pacific.|$|E
