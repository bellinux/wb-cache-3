50|$|Hover {{times were}} maximized {{on the last}} four landing {{missions}} by using the Service Module engine to perform the initial Descent Orbit Insertion burn 22 hours before the LM separated from the CSM, a practice begun on Apollo 14. This meant that the complete spacecraft, including the CSM, orbited the Moon with a 9.1 nmi km <b>perilune,</b> enabling the LM to begin its powered descent from that altitude with a full load of descent stage fuel, leaving more reserve fuel for the final approach. The CSM would then raise its <b>perilune</b> back to the normal 60 nmi km.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} orbit, Worden {{performed}} a circularization burn with SPS, raising the <b>perilune</b> of his orbit. The reason for this was {{that in the case of}} an abort during landing by Falcon, a circular orbit is much easier for rendezvous than to an elliptic orbit. Without the LM, the SPS only had to burn for 4 seconds, raising its orbit to 65.2 by 54.8 nm (120.7 by 101.4 km). During the 13th orbit, Worden placed Endeavour into the science collecting attitude.|$|E

After a series of Apolune and <b>Perilune</b> lowering manoeuvres, the Lander reaches its final Low Lunar Orbit (LLO) at 100 km altitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was placed}} in a cislunar trajectory and injected into an elliptical near-equatorial lunar orbit for data acquisition after 92.5 hours flight time. The initial orbit was 196 x 1850 km at an inclination of 11.8 degrees. The <b>perilune</b> was lowered to 49.7 km five days later after 33 orbits. A failure of the amplifier {{on the final day of}} readout, December 7, resulted in the loss of six photographs. On December 8, 1966 the inclination was altered to 17.5 degrees to provide new data on lunar gravity.|$|E
5000|$|A {{major issue}} for all lunar {{orbiting}} spacecraft are mass concentrations or mascons. These are regional areas {{where it is}} believed that denser material is under the surface. Apollo 15 travelled over regions that had never been covered on previous flights, so it was unknown how its orbit would be affected by them. Mission Control predicted that by the time the crew awoke the next [...] "morning", the lowest point of their orbit, <b>perilune,</b> would have dropped to about 8.6 nm (16.1 km) but {{this turned out to be}} an underestimate.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{lunar orbit}} for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal 60 nmi km circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial {{lunar orbit insertion}} was an ellipse with a <b>perilune</b> of 60.0 nmi km and an apolune of 168.5 nmi km, at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at 60.7 nmi km by 59.7 nmi km, with an orbital period of 128.7 minutes. The effect of lunar mass concentrations ("masscons") on the orbit {{was found to be}} greater than initially predicted; {{over the course of the}} twenty-hour mission, the orbit was perturbated to 63.6 nmi km by 58.6 nmi km.|$|E

Zheng remarked that [...] "the mission goals of CE-2 were focused into the high resolution image for the future landing site of CE-3 lunar lander and rover.

50|$|The lunar gravity was studied {{from this}} orbit. After two orbital {{adjustments}} {{were performed on}} 18 September and 19 September the <b>perilune</b> was decreased to 15.1 km, {{as well as the}} inclination altered in preparation for landing. At <b>perilune</b> at 05:12 UT on 20 September, the main braking engine was fired, initiating the descent to the lunar surface. Six minutes later, at 05:18 UT, the spacecraft safely soft-landed in its target area at 0°41' south latitude and 56°18' east longitude, in the northeast area of Mare Fecunditatis (Sea of Fertility) approximately 100 kilometers west of Webb crater and 150 km north of Langrenus crater. This was the first landing made in the lunar night side, as the Sun had set about 60 hours earlier. The main descent engine cut off at an altitude of 20 m, and the landing jets cut off at 2 m height at a velocity less than 2.4 m/s, followed by vertical free fall. The mass of the spacecraft at landing was 1,880 kilograms. Less than an hour after landing, at 06:03 UT, an automatic drill penetrated the lunar surface to collect a soil sample. After drilling for seven minutes, the drill reached a stop at 35 centimeters depth and then withdrew its sample and lifted it in an arc {{to the top of the}} spacecraft, depositing the lunar material in a small spherical capsule mounted on the main spacecraft bus. The column of regolith in the drill tube was then transferred to the soil sample container.|$|E

Luna 22 was launched into Earth parking orbit {{and then to the}} Moon. It was inserted into a circular lunar orbit on 2 June 1974. The spacecraft made many orbit adjustments over its 18-month lifetime in order to optimize the operation of various experiments, lowering the <b>perilune</b> to as little as 25 km. Maneuvering fuel was exhausted on 2 September and the mission was ended in early November.|$|E

50|$|After {{achieving}} a lunar parking orbit, the Commander and LM Pilot entered and powered up the LM, replaced the hatches and docking equipment, unfolded and locked its landing legs, and {{separated from the}} CSM, flying independently. The Commander operated the flight controls and engine throttle, while the Lunar Module Pilot operated other spacecraft systems and kept the Commander informed on systems status and navigational information. After visual inspection of the landing gear by the Command Module Pilot, the LM was withdrawn to a safe distance, then the descent engine was pointed forward into the direction of travel to perform the 30 second Descent Orbit Insertion burn to reduce speed and drop the LM's <b>perilune</b> to within approximately 50000 ft of the surface, about 260 nmi km uprange of the landing site.|$|E
50|$|Lunar Orbiter 5, {{the last}} of the Lunar Orbiter series, was {{designed}} to take additional Apollo and Surveyor landing site photography and to take broad survey images of unphotographed parts of the Moon's far side. It was also equipped to collect selenodetic, radiation intensity, and micrometeoroid impact data and was used to evaluate the Manned Space Flight Network tracking stations and Apollo Orbit Determination Program. The spacecraft was placed in a cislunar trajectory and on August 5, 1967 was injected into an elliptical near polar lunar orbit 194.5 x 6023 km with an inclination of 85 degrees and a period of 8 hours 30 minutes. On August 7 the <b>perilune</b> was lowered to 100 km, and on August 9 the orbit was lowered to a 99 x 1499 km, 3 hour 11 minute period.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{entered an}} orbit with a perigee of 200 kilometers and an apogee of 380,000 kilometers, and {{separated from the}} carrier rocket as planned.

After the launch, Chang'e 2 arrived in its lunar orbit within 4 days and 16 hours, much faster than the 12 days taken by Chang'e 1. Later, the probe lowered its orbit to 100 km, with a <b>perilune</b> of 15 km. Chang'e 2 entered its 100 km working orbit on 9 October 2010 after three successful brakings. On 8 November 2010, the Chinese government announced the success of all of Chang'e 2's mission objectives, and published lunar surface images with a resolution of up to 1.3 m. In February 2012, the Chinese government released a complete lunar map constructed from Chang'e 2's data, claiming that it was the highest-resolution map of the entire Moon yet recorded.|$|E
50|$|Luna 21 {{carried the}} second {{successful}} Soviet lunar rover, Lunokhod 2, and was launched {{less than a}} month after the last Apollo lunar landing. The Proton-K/D launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit followed by translunar injection. On 12 January 1973, Luna 21 was braked into a 90 × 100 km orbit about the Moon, at a 60° inclination. On 13 and 14 January, the <b>perilune</b> was lowered to 16 km altitude. On 15 January after 40 orbits, the braking rocket was fired at 16 km altitude, and the craft went into free fall. At an altitude of 750 meters the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of 22 meters was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was 1.5 meters above the surface, where the engine was cut off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85° N, 30.45° E, between Mare Serenitatis ("Sea of Serenity") and the Taurus Mountains. The lander carried a bas relief of Vladimir Lenin and the Soviet coat-of-arms.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the landing}} site {{restrictions}} that resulted from constraining the launch to a free return that flew by the Moon, subsequent Apollo missions, starting with Apollo 12 and including the ill-fated Apollo 13, used a hybrid trajectory that launched to a highly elliptical Earth orbit that fell short of the Moon with effectively a free return to the atmospheric entry corridor. They then performed a mid-course maneuver to change to a trans-Lunar trajectory {{that was not a}} free return. This retained the safety characteristics of being on a free return upon launch, and only departed from free return once the systems were checked out and the lunar module was docked with the command module, providing back-up maneuver capabilities. [...] In fact, within hours after the accident, Apollo 13 used the lunar module to maneuver from its planned trajectory to a free-return trajectory. Apollo 13 was the only Apollo mission to actually turn around the Moon in a free-return trajectory (however, two hours after <b>perilune,</b> propulsion was applied to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean).|$|E
40|$|In general, {{the lunar}} landing stage {{can be divided}} into two {{distinct}} phases: de-orbit and descent, and the descent phase usually comprises two sub-phases: braking and approach. And many optimization problems of minimal energy are usually focused on descent phases. In these approaches, the energy of de-orbit burning is not considered. Therefore, a possible low <b>perilune</b> altitude can be chosen to save fuel for the descent phase. <b>Perilune</b> altitude is typically specified between 10 and 15 km because of the mountainous lunar terrain and possible guidance errors. However, it requires more de-orbit burning energy for the lower <b>perilune</b> altitude. Therefore, in this paper, the <b>perilune</b> altitude of the intermediate orbit is also considered with optimal thrust programming for minimal energy. Furthermore, the <b>perilune</b> altitude and optimal thrust programming can be expressed by a function of the radius of a parking orbit by using continuation method and co-state estimator...|$|E

40|$|The Space Exploration Initiative has {{generated}} {{a renewed interest}} in lunar mission planning. The lunar missions currently under study, unlike the Apollo missions, involve long stay times. Several lunar gravity models have been formulated, but mission planners do not have enough confidence in the proposed models to conduct detailed studies of missions with long stay times. In this report, a particular lunar gravitational model, the Ferrari 5 x 5 model, was chosen to determine the lifetimes for 100 -km and 300 -km <b>perilune</b> altitude, near-circular parking orbits. The need to analyze orbital lifetimes for a large number of initial orbital parameters was the motivation for the formulation of a simplified gravitational model from the original model. Using this model, orbital lifetimes were found to be heavily dependent on the initial conditions of the nearly circular orbits, particularly the initial inclination and argument of <b>perilune.</b> This selected model yielded lifetime predictions of less than 40 days for some orbits, and other orbits had lifetimes exceeding a year. Although inconsistencies and limitations are inherent in all existing lunar gravity models, primarily {{because of a lack of}} information about the far side of the moon, the methods presented in this analysis are suitable for incorporating the moon's nonspherical gravitational effects on the preliminary design level for future lunar mission planning...|$|E
