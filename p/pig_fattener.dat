40|$|Contamination in {{pigs and}} pig {{carcasses}} by Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. {{in an industrial}} abattoir was co-related with animal origin and their hide status. Animals supplied by farms joining to an integrated quality control program or other <b>pig</b> <b>fatteners</b> were kept in lairage for the night and showered or were slaughtered within few hours. Prevalence in Salmonella was similar in animals supplied by farms joining or not the IQC program and Listeria monocytogenes was never detected in pigs at bleeding. The differences in the prevalence of Salmonella, which varied from 14 to 86 % in different stocks of pigs, were related to suppliers and lairage time. The prevalence was much lower (11 %) at time of carcass dressing and boning. Listeria monocytogenes contamination was very low in pigs at bleeding, but increased after slaughtering (13 %) and much more after boning (68 %). Any correlation was found between number of Enterobacteriaceae or TMC and prevalence of the pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{effect of}} the immunocastration (vaccination against gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone using Improvac ® vac-cine) on growth performance, size of reproductive organs and levels of fat androstenone and skatole was studied in Slove-nian <b>pig</b> <b>fatteners.</b> The <b>pigs</b> (50 % crosses of Duroc), selected from 35 litters (2 castrates and 3 - 4 boars per litter) farrowed within two weeks period, were assigned to three experimental groups: boars (n= 25), immunocastrated males (n= 24) and surgically castrated males (n= 25). The vaccinations with Improvac ® were performed {{at the age of}} 10 and 19 weeks. The trial started when pigs were 12 weeks old, and lasted until 24 weeks of age, when pigs were slaughtered. During the trial, pigs were lodged individually and their daily feed intake (ad libidum) and weight (at 12, 19 and 24 weeks of age) were recorded. At the slaughter line, the testes and accessory reproductive glands were removed and weighed. Subcutaneous fat samples were taken for the determination of androstenone and skatole concentration. Results on androstenone and skatole showed that the immunisation was 100 % successful. The levels of androstenone were below a detection limit of the laboratory method in all pigs. For skatole, the concentrations were at comparably low level in surgically and immunocastrat-ed males, whereas higher levels were observed in boars. Vaccination strongly reduced the weight of testes and accessory reproductive glands. Regarding growth performance, the immunocastrated males showed comparable feed intake, fee...|$|R
40|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is a significant}} contributor to global methane, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and ammonia emissions. Poultry and pig farming in Slovenia needs to undertake a large survey on the emission of aerial pollutants, since monitoring on this field is incomplete. Despite this, measurements of aerial emissions such as ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were monitored from representative poultry laying hen, pig weaning and pig fattening farms in Slovenia. Animal category, different technologies, stocking density and body mass variations significantly influenced the outcome emissions. NH 3, N 2 O and CO 2 concentrations in the ambiental air directly correlate (p< 0. 05) to variable air streams in stables and mostly exceed the known data from other investigations made in EU. From the hen production the calculated predictions of annual ammonia (28. 5 kg lu- 1 a- 1) and nitrous oxide emissions (102 kg lu- 1 a- 1) were higher (p< 0. 05) than pig fattening production (NH 3 2. 5 kg lu- 1 a- 1 N 2 O 58. 3 kg lu- 1 a- 1) or pig weaning production (NH 3 6. 4 kg lu- 1 a- 1 N 2 O 67 kg lu- 1 a- 1), still the carbon dioxide emissions were estimated as 21. 5 - 59 % higher in <b>pig</b> (<b>fatteners</b> 3960 kg lu- 1 a- 1) than in poultry production.

Two questionnaires were designed both containing five groups of questions focused on the responder, the farm and AMU (eg, in-feed, in-drinking water and parenteral); both surveys were carried out by means of personal face-to-face interviews. Both surveys started with a sample size of 108 potentially eligible farms per survey; nevertheless, finally 67 finisher farms and 49 FtF farms were recruited. Overall percentages of animals exposed to antimicrobials (AM) were high (90 per cent in finisher farms and 54 per cent FtF farms); colistin (61 per cent and 33 per cent) and doxycycline (62 per cent and 23 per cent) were the most common AMs, followed by amoxicillin (51 per cent and 19 per cent) and lincomycin (49 per cent), respectively. Questionnaire-based surveys using face-to-face interviews are useful for capturing information regarding AMU at the farm level. Farm-level data per administration route can be used for comparative AMU analysis between farms. Nevertheless, for the analysis of the putative relationships between AMU and AM resistance, measures based on exposed animals or exposure events are needed...|$|R

40|$|In Vietnam, {{there are}} about four million {{households}} producing pigs of which more than half are producing at small scale, i. e., about one to two pigs per production cycle. One {{of the most critical}} constraints to pig production, especially for small scale, is the presence of animal disease. Many types of diseases have been reported by smallholder pig producers in Hung Yen such as diarrhea, pneumonia, fever, blue ear, head edema and pasteurellosis. The percentage of sick pigs is highest among piglets (27 percent), as compared with growing <b>pigs</b> and <b>fatteners</b> (five percent each). Diseases could lead to death of pigs, resulting in economic losses to the pig producers. Estimates of the cost of mortality in pig production in Hung Yen were about 3. 3 million VND per household, accounting for about 13. 6 percent of total income from pig production. Results {{of this study suggest that}} there are some practices that contribute to mitigating disease risk and those practices can be easily applied at small scale of pig production. These practices are related to applying a suitable production scale, isolating different age classes of pigs, designing pig houses and using specialized livestock farming tools and sanitation. The value of losses avoided from the above practices is estimated at 320. 3 USD per household per year. Australian Centre for International Agricultural ResearchPeer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{material}} {{consisted of}} 112 carcasses of crossbred fatteners (złp x dur) and 16 purebred animals (złp). The following traits were analyzed in postslaughter evaluation: carcass weight (kg), mean backfat thickness (mm), {{height of the}} longissimus dorsi muscle (mm) and lean meat percentage in the carcass (%). Based on the determined carcass weight and measurements of carcass leanness the carcasses were classified in the SEUROP system. Results of postslaughter evaluation indicate relatively low carcass leanness.

40|$|Abstract: From 2012 to 2013 were {{surveyed}} gastrointestinal parasites from pig farms located in different municpaliyies {{in the state}} of Rio de Janeiro. Fecal samples from 790 pigs were collected from the rectum on 88 family farms and 702 farms with industrial production. The samples were subjected to Faust et al., Sheather, Ritchie, Lutz and direct examination faecal techniques. The estimated parasite prevalence was 93. 1 % in family farms and 59. 1 % in industrial farms. Balantidium coli, coccidia and Entamoeba sp. were the parasites with the highest frequencies, and the male and female reproductive categories and <b>fatteners</b> <b>pigs</b> the most infected (p< 0. 05). Trophozoites of B. coli were most evident in stool samples from semi-solid followed by solid and diarrheal consistencies. Strongyles eggs and Trichuris suis have been detected exclusively in family farms. Ascaris suum eggs and Strongyloides ransomi showed low frequency. The high degree of parasitism, especially protozoa, indicates the need to reassess the management of pigs in both types of production...|$|R

The epidemiology of porcine group A rotavirus was studied in commercial herds of pigs in New Zealand. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Dakopatts, Copenhagen) was found to be highly sensitive (100 %) and specific (96. 8 %) for the detection of group A rotavirus in pig faeces when compared to electron microscopy (EM). A highly sensitive and specific ELISA test for the measurement of antibody against group A rotavirus in pigs was also developed. Of 521 faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery in a cross-sectional survey, 47 (9 %) were positive for group A rotavirus by the ELISA test. Only sucking (19. 3 %) and weaner (14. 4 %) pigs were shedding rotavirus. Rotavirus was not detected in the faeces of <b>fattener</b> <b>pigs</b> (over two months old) or adult pigs including sows and boars. Three cohort studies revealed that all pigs became infected with group A rotavirus before they were 40 days of age and shed the virus for an average of eight days. Some of the piglets shed rotavirus a second time approximately 10 days after the first period of shedding. All piglets ceased to shed the virus by two months of age. Rotaviral shedding was associated with the occurrence of milk scours in sucking piglets. Diarrhoea in weaner pigs (post-weaning diarrhoea, PWD) was more closely associated with the presence of haemolytic E. coli than with rotavirus in faeces. Infection with group A rotavirus was transmitted from piglet to piglet and from litter to litter. In one cohort of 50 piglets from five litters, shedding of rotavirus was first detected in one litter, then in the second litter two days later, and finally in other litters of piglets. Over a period of 16 days, all piglets in the five litters were infected. Group A rotavirus was also detected in dust, faeces and effluent collected from the farrowing and weaner houses, and from a weaner house which had not been used for three months. Rotavirus was not detected in any of the sows (11) during the period of investigation. Neither was rotavirus detected in <b>fattener</b> <b>pigs</b> (from two months of age to the time of slaughter), nor in the environments where old <b>pigs</b> (<b>fattener</b> and sow houses) were housed. It was not therefore possible to confirm that adult pigs, especially sows, act as carriers for rotaviral infection of young piglets as has been suggested by other workers. All the piglets acquired maternal antirotaviral antibody from their dams and the levels of antibody in piglets' sera were comparable to those in the colostrum of their dams. The maternally-derived antibody was also detected in piglets' faeces. Antibody in sera and in faeces declined rapidly after birth. Rotaviral shedding commenced in each of the cohorts when the geometric mean ELISA antibody titre fell below 1 / 1600 (equivalent to serum neutralizing antibody titre of 1 / 8 to 1 / 16). However, this correlation between antibody titres and protection was not observed in individual litters. In each of the cohorts studied, rotaviral shedding was usually detected initially in one or two piglets of a litter. The infection then spread to other piglets within the same litter and, finally, to piglets of other litters in the same group. Onset of rotaviral infection in particular litters was related to their location in the farrowing unit rather than to the levels of antibody. The shedding pattern of group A rotavirus was studied further in another five New Zealand piggeries and was found to be similar to that observed at the Massey University Piggery. Faecal samples from these piggeries were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and no common electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was found in these piggeries. More than one electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was detected in three of these piggeries. Faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery were also analyzed by PAGE and it was found that rotaviruses detected during {{the first two years of}} the present investigation had identical electrophoretypes, but one isolate detected in the third year had a distinctively different pattern. Non-group A rotaviruses were also detected for the first time in New Zealand. Nine samples had an electrophoretic pattern similar to that of group C rotavirus and one was similar to that of group B rotavirus. One of the samples containing group C rotavirus was from two litters of piglets with diarrhoea at two to four days of age. In one of these piggeries, five electrophoretypes of rotaviruses representing three groups were detected. These observations indicate that rotaviral infections are important causes of milk scours in piglets, and are probably significant in exacerbating PWD. The epidemiology of rotaviral infections is complicated by a number of factors. These include the continuous transmission of virus from pig to pig and from litter to litter, the survival of the virus in the piggery environment, the incomplete protection afforded by maternally-derived antibody, and the simultaneous circulation of different strains and different groups of rotavirus in one piggery...|$|R

Bioinformatic analysis of the complete genome sequence of strain WA 1 was used to identify genes predicted to encode outer membrane proteins. Twenty candidate genes were expressed in an Escherichia coli mediated system, and purified as histidine-tagged recombinant proteins. Selection of optimal antigens under different conditions was conducted using Western blot and ELISA with a range of pig sera from infected and uninfected pigs. From this analysis, three recombinant proteins were selected as being most suitable for use as antigens. These antigens then were tested under optimized conditions in an indirect ELISA detecting IgG 2 using 1551 sera from healthy pigs at slaughter, comprising 896 from 18 herds considered to be free from SD and 655 from 12 infected herds.

Serial sections of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum were prepared post mortem. Haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical (Ki- 67, PCNA) staining procedures were performed. The effect of the feed additives on the morphological characteristics and proliferation capacity of small intestinal crypt epithelium varied when mitotic indices in groups were compared. In comparison with group C, the enterocytes were higher in group E 2 in the jejunum (P ≤ 0. 01) and smaller in the ileum (P ≤ 0. 01). Administration of the Ki- 67 antibody resulted in fewer positive reactions in the jejunum in group E 1 than in group C (P ≤ 0. 01).

40|$|Although pigs are {{commonly}} infected with Cryptosporidium and Giardia duodenalis, and thus potential reservoirs of zoonotic species (or genotypes), {{little is known}} about age-related infection levels, seasonal differences and genetic variation in naturally infected pigs. Thus, to characterise seasonal and age-related variation in prevalence and intensity of infections at farm level, (oo) cyst shedding was monitored at quarterly intervals (September 2011 to June 2012) in piglets (n= 152), young pigs (n= 234), finishers (n= 230) and sows (n= 240) from three organic, Danish farms. (Oo) cysts were quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy; and representative Cryptosporidium (n= 75) and Giardia (n= 67) positive subsamples were characterized by amplification and partial sequencing of the SSU rRNA, hsp 70, and gdh genes, respectively. Prevalence and intensity of infections varied significantly between age-groups with 53. 3 % piglets, 72. 2 % young pigs, 40. 4 % finishers and 2. 9 % sows testing positive for Cryptosporidium (p= 0. 0002) while 2 %, 27. 4 %, 17. 8 %, and 5. 0 % tested positive for G. duodenalis in the same age-groups (p= 0. 0017). No significant differences were observed in the overall prevalence or intensity of infections between farms or seasons; and the prevalence within each age-group was stable throughout the year. Molecular analyses revealed C. scrofarum and C. suis in 69. 0 % and 29. 3 % and Giardia Assemblage E and A in 84. 6 % and 15. 4 % of successfully genotyped isolates. Presence of Cryptosporidium species was age-related with piglets exclusively hosting C. suis, apart from one exception, while young <b>pigs</b> and <b>fatteners</b> predominantly hosted C. scrofarum. In one sow, a new Cryptosporidium genotype was detected by partial sequencing of the hsp 70 gene. Although C. scrofarum and C. suis are zoonotic, they are rare in humans. In contrast, human cases of G. duodenalis Assemblage A are common, whereas Assemblage E is restricted to livestock. As organic pigs are partly reared outdoors, environmental contamination with Cryptosporidium and Giardia is inevitable.

40|$|Background: Organic pig {{production}} is expanding and amongst {{the objectives of}} organic farming are enhancing animal health and welfare. However, some studies have reported a higher prevalence of lameness and joint condemnation at slaughter in free-range/organic pigs than in conventionally raised pigs. Organic slaughter pigs have free-range housing in which indoor and outdoor access is compulsory, while in conventional farming the pigs are commonly confined to indoor pens. The present study evaluated the effects of free-range and confined housing on lameness prevalence in a herd of 106 finisher pigs, and whether osteochondrosis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae associated arthritis influences these effects. We also evaluated the association between clinical lameness during the rearing period and joint condemnations at slaughter. Results: Seventy free-range and 36 confined housed <b>fattener</b> <b>pigs</b> were scored for their gait twice during the rearing period and 848 joints were evaluated post mortem. Osteochondrosis was more frequent among free-range than confined pigs (P < 0. 05), and when present it was also more severe (P < 0. 001). Pigs with more numerous and more severe osteochondral lesions had their gait affected more than did pigs with fewer such lesions (P < 0. 05). Hence it was a paradox {{that we did not}} detect more lameness among the free-range pigs than the confined pigs. E. rhusiopathiae associated arthritis was not diagnosed. The association between gait remarks/clinical lameness and joint condemnations at slaughter was not significant. Conclusions: The results indicate that free-range housing may have both positive and negative effects on locomotory traits. Free-range pigs may be less clinically affected by osteochondrosis than are confined pigs. One explanation for this effect may be strengthening of joint supportive tissue and pain relief promoted by exercise. Visual gait scoring missed serious joint lesions that probably were harmful to the pigs, and should therefore not be used as a sole indicator of joint/leg health in welfare inspection of pigs. The association between gait scores and joint condemnation appeared to be poor. This study was limited to one herd, and so more and larger studies on the effects of free-range housing on lameness severity and osteochondrosis development in pigs are recommended...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the ratio of ham and loin in half-carcasses and the tissue composition of these cuts. The research material consisted of 140 pig carcasses. The experimental materials were derived from the Polish commercial population of <b>fattener</b> <b>pigs.</b> Genetic material representing the most commonly slaughtered fatteners in Poland. Fatteners for the study came from several suppliers. All fatteners were kept in similar farms complying with principles of animal welfare. The right half-carcasses were divided into different groups, regardless of sex, half-carcass mass, back fat thickness and lean meat content class. Ham and loin obtained from carcasses were subjected to a detailed dissection, and the percentage of ham and loin in the carcass and the overall percentage of of the cuts in relation to the entire half-carcass were calculated. Gilts were characterized by a higher content of ham in half-carcasses than barrows (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). The increase in back fat thickness reduced the content of ham in half-carcasses and increased the content of loin (P ≤ 0. 01). A similar trend was shown for the lean meat content class parameter. Additionally, interaction (P [*]≤ 0. 01) between back fat thickness and meat content with respect to the percentage content of loin in carcasses was noted. Gilts were characterised by about a 1. 38  % higher proportion of muscles in the ham (P [*] ≤ 0. 05) and a 0. 47  % lower proportion of intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). An average increase of five point in back fat thickness increases the amount of subcutaneous fat with skin (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and reduces muscle (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and bone (P [*]≤ 0. 05 and P [*] ≤ 0. 01) levels. The interaction of percentage content of muscles in ham was observed (P [*]=[*] 0. 04). The meat content class of carcasses did not only affect the level of bones in ham. It was confirmed that sex affected all the analysed dissection elements of the loin. Back fat thickness and meat content classes were present in almost identical amounts in loin tissues (P [*] ≤ 0. 05 and P [*] ≤ 0. 01). Half-carcass mass showed a strong negative correlation with bone content in ham and loin (r [*]=[*]− 0. 35 and r [*]=[*]− 0. 21, respectively).
