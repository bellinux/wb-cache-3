50|$|Biomatrica is a United States-based {{biotechnology}} {{company that}} develops chemistry for ambient temperature preservation of biological {{materials for the}} purpose of expanding the availability and accuracy of medical diagnostics and research. Specifically, the company focuses on improving the stability of biological materials, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and cells from patient samples and in research and diagnostic testing reagents. Company scientists have developed alternatives to existing preservation technologies, such as cold storage and lyophilization (freeze-drying), to prevent degradation of <b>perishable</b> <b>biological</b> materials. Biomatrica's technologies are used in applications such as pre-analytic sample collection, diagnostic assays, biobanking, forensics, and basic research.|$|R

The haemagglutinins fall into two distinct categories (i) type A and (ii) types C and D. Whereas type C or D haemagglutinins were only inhibited by certain <b>biological</b> <b>substances,</b> type A haemagglutinin was also weakly inhibited by D-galactose and more strongly by Pneumococcus type XIV polysaccharide, which contains D-galactose as a terminal sugar.

40|$|Summary: This paper {{describes}} a biosystem (biological system) {{used to measure}} the concentration of <b>biological</b> <b>substances</b> in urine, serum, plasma or cerebrospinal fluid. Rather than just one channel, it comprises 16 optical-channels that enable the measurement of the concentration of 16 different <b>biological</b> <b>substances.</b> An array of 16 optical filters based on Fabry-Perot thin-films optical resonators has been designed. Each optical-channel is sensitive in a single wavelength with a Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of 7 nm. The filter fabrication requires only 4 masks, used with different etch time. A commercially available band-pass optical filter with a band-pass wavelength in 450 - 650 nm is used. The biosystem requires only a white light source for illumination due the use of selective optical filters...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{to obtain}} nucleic acid ligands that photocrosslink to target {{molecules}} {{associated with a}} disease state are provided. The methods presented are variations on the photoSELEX methods for obtaining nucleic acid ligands. In one method, a candidate mixture of photocrosslinkable nucleic acids is contacted with a <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> obtained from a source associated with a disease state suspected of containing a target molecule to form nucleic acid-target molecule complexes, the complexes are irradiated to form crosslinked complexes, the photocrosslinked complexes are partitioned from {{the remainder of the}} candidate mixture; and the nucleic acid ligands that photocrosslink to molecule are retained. These nucleic acids are then contacted with a second <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> of the same type as the first, but obtained from a source not associated with a disease state. This removes nucleic acids with affinity to molecules that are not associated with the disease state. In another method, photocrosslinkable nucleic acids are not incorporated in the initial candidate mixture, but rather are incorporated in an enriched candidate mixture obtained by contacting a <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> associated with a disease state containing a target molecule to form nucleic acid-target molecule complexes, partitioning the complexes away from the candidate mixture.
