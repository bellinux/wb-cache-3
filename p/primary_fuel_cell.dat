40|$|As {{part of the}} Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) {{under the}} auspices of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), NASA is {{developing}} both <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power systems and regenerative fuel cell (RFC) energy storage systems within the fuel cell portion of the Energy Storage Project. This effort is being led by the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) in partnership with the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and industrial partners. The development goals are to improve fuel cell and electrolysis stack electrical performance, reduce system mass, volume, and parasitic power requirements, and increase system life and reliability. A major focus of this effort has been the parallel development of both flow-through and non-flow-through proton exchange membrane (PEM) <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power systems. The plan has been, at the appropriate time, to select a single <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technology for eventual flight hardware development. Ideally, that appropriate time would occur after both technologies have achieved a technology readiness level (TRL) of six, which represents an engineering model fidelity PEM fuel cell system being successfully tested in a relevant environment. Budget constraints in fiscal year 2009 and beyond have prevented NASA from continuing to pursue the parallel development of both <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> options. Because very limited data exists for either system, a toplevel, qualitative assessment based on engineering judgement was performed expeditiously to provide guidance for a selection. At that time, the non-flow-through technology was selected for continued development because of potentially major advantages in terms of weight, volume, parasitic power, reliability, and life. This author believes that the advantages are significant enough, and the potential benefits great enough, to offset the higher state of technology readiness of flow-through technology. This paper summarizes the technical considerations which helped form the engineering judgement that led to the final decision...|$|E

40|$|NASA {{has been}} {{developing}} proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power systems for the past decade, as an upgraded technology to the alkaline <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> which presently provide power for the Shuttle Orbiter. All <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power systems consist {{of one or more}} <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> stacks in combination with appropriate balance-of-plant hardware. Traditional PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> are characterized as flow-through, in which recirculating reactant streams remove product water from the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> stack. NASA recently embarked on the development of non-flow-through <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems, in which reactants are dead-ended into the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> stack and product water is removed by internal wicks. This simplifies the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power system by eliminating the need for pumps to provide reactant circulation, and mechanical water separators to remove the product water from the recirculating reactant streams. By eliminating these mechanical components, the resulting <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power system has lower mass, volume, and parasitic power requirements, along with higher reliability and longer life. Four vendors have designed and fabricated non-flow-through <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> stacks under NASA funding. One of these vendors is considered the "baseline" vendor, and the remaining three vendors are competing for the "alternate" role. Each has undergone testing of their stack hardware integrated with a NASA balance-of-plant.

40|$|Regenerative <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (RFCs) are {{enabling}} {{for many}} weight-critical portable applications, since the packaged specific energy (> 400 Wh/kg) of properly designed lightweight RFC systems is several-fold {{higher than that}} of the lightest weight rechargeable batteries. RFC systems can be rapidly refueled (like <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells),</b> or can be electrically recharged (like secondary batteries) if a refueling infrastructure is not conveniently available. Higher energy capacity systems with higher performance, reduced weight, and freedom from fueling infrastructure are the features that RFCs promise for portable applications. Reversible proton exchange membrane (PEM) <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> also known as unitized regenerative <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (URFCs), or reversible regenerative <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> are RFC systems which use reversible PEM cells, where each cell is capable of operating both as a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> and as an electrolyzer. URFCs further economize portable device weight, volume, and complexity by combining the functions of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and electrolyzers in the same hardware, generally without any system performance or efficiency reduction. URFCs are being made in many forms, some of which are already small enough to be portable. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has worked with industrial partners to design, develop, and demonstrate high performance and high cycle life URFC systems. LLNL is also working with industrial partners to develop breakthroughs in lightweight pressure vessels that are necessary for URFC systems to achieve the specific energy advantages over rechargeable batteries. Proton Energy Systems, Inc. (Proton) is concurrently developing and commercializing URFC systems (UNIGEN' product line), in addition to PEM electrolyzer systems (HOGEN' product line), and <b>primary</b> PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems. LLNL is constructing demonstration URFC units in order to persuade potential sponsors, often in their own conference rooms, that advanced applications based on URFC s are feasible. Safety and logistics force these URFC demonstration units to be small, transportable, and easily set up, hence they already prove the viability of URFC systems for portable applications...|$|R

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the energy needs of {{spacecraft}} over the last 25 years have been met by photovoltaic arrays with batteries, <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> and radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG). However, it might be difficult to satisfy energy requirements {{for the next generation of}} space missions with the currently used energy sources. Applications studies have emphasized the need for a lighter, cheaper, and more compact high-energy source than the scaling up of current technologies would permit. These requirements could be satisfied by a nuclear reactor power system. The joint NASA/DOD/DOE SP- 100 program is to explore and evaluate this option. Critical elements of the technology are also to be developed, taking into account space reactor systems of the 100 kW class.

40|$|Oxygen {{reduction}} reactions (ORRs) at the cathode are the rate-limiting step in <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance. The ORR is 100 times {{slower than the}} corresponding hydrogen oxidation at the anode. Speeding up the reaction at the cathode will improve <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> efficiency. The cathode material is generally Pt powder painted onto a substrate (e. g., graphite paper). Recent efforts in the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> area have focused on replacing Pt with Pt-X alloys (where X = Co, Ni, Zr, etc.) in order to (a) reduce cost, and (b) increase ORR rates. One of these strategies is to increase ORR rates by reducing the powder size, which would result {{in an increase in}} the surface area, thereby facilitating faster reaction rates. In this work, a process has been developed that creates Pt-Ni or Pt-Co alloys that are finely divided (on the nano scale) and provide equivalent performance at lower Pt loadings. Lower Pt loadings will translate to lower cost. Precursor salts of the metals are dissolved in water and mixed. Next, the salt mixtures are dried on a hot plate. Finally, the dried salt mixture is heattreated in a furnace under flowing reducing gas. The catalyst powder is then used to fabricate a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for electrochemical performance testing. The Pt- Co catalyst-based MEA showed comparable performance to an MEA fabri cated using a standard Pt black <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> catalyst. The main objective of this program has been to increase the overall efficiencies of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems to support power for manned lunar bases. This work may also have an impact on terrestrial programs, possibly to support the effort to develop a carbon-free energy source. This catalyst can be used to fabricate high-efficiency <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> units {{that can be used in}} space as regenerative <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems, and terrestrially as <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Terrestrially, this technology will become increasingly important when transition to a hydrogen economy occurs...|$|R

40|$|The {{lunar surface}} {{emergency}} shelter (LSES) {{is designed to}} provide survival-level accommodations for up to four astronauts for a maximum of five days. It would be used by astronauts who were caught out in the open during a large solar event. The habitable section consists of an aluminum pressure shell with an inner diameter of 6 ft. and a length of 12. 2 ft. Access is through a 4 in. thick aluminum airlock door mounted {{at the rear of the}} shelter. Shielding is provided by a 14. 9 in. thick layer of lunar regolith contained within a second, outer aluminum shell. This provides protection against a 200 MeV event, based on a 15 REM maximum dose. The shelter is self-contained with a maximum range of 1000 km. Power is supplied by a <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> which occupies 70. 7 cu ft. of the interior volume. Mobility is achieved by towing the shelter behind existing lunar vehicles. It was assumed that a fully operational, independent lunar base was available to provide communication support and tools for set-up and maintenance. Transportation to the moon would be provided by the proposed heavy lift launch vehicle. Major design considerations for the LSES were safety, reliability, and minimal use of earth materials...|$|E
40|$|There {{are major}} {{advantages}} {{to be gained}} by integrating a cryogenic reactant storage system with a hydrogen-oxygen regenerative fuel cell (RFC) to provide on-site electrical power during the lunar night. Although applicable to any power system using hydrogen-oxygen RFC's for energy storage, cryogenic reactant storage offers a significant benefit whenever the sun/shade cycle and energy storage period approach hundreds of hours. For solar power installations on the moon, cryogenic reactant storage reduces overall specific mass and meteoroid vulnerability of the system. In addition, it offers synergistic benefits to on-site users, such as availability of <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> reactants for surface rover vehicles and cryogenic propellants for OTV's. The integration involves processing and storing the RFC reactant streams as cryogenic liquids rather than pressurized gases, so that reactant containment (tankage per unit mass of reactants) can be greatly reduced. Hydrogen-oxygen alkaline RFC's, GaAs photovoltaic (PV) arrays, and space cryogenic processing/refrigeration technologies are assumed to be available for the conceptual system design. Advantages are demonstrated by comparing the characteristics of two power system concepts: a conventional lunar surface PV/RFC power system using pressurized gas storage in SOA filament wound pressure vessels and, that same system with gas liquefaction and storage replacing the pressurized storage. Comparisons are made at 20 and 250 kWe. Although cryogenic storage adds a processing plant (drying and liquefaction) to the system plus 30 percent more solar array to provide processing power, the approximate order of magnitude reduction in tankage mass, confirmed by this analysis, results in a reduction in overall total system mass of approximately 50 percent...|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{performed}} physical science microgravity flight {{experiments in the}} areas of combustion science, fluid physics, material science and fundamental physics research on the International Space Station (ISS) since 2001. The orbital conditions on the ISS provide an environment where gravity driven phenomena, such as buoyant convection, are nearly negligible. Gravity strongly affects fluid behavior by creating forces that drive motion, shape phase boundaries and compress gases. The need for a better understanding of fluid physics has created a vigorous, multidisciplinary research community whose ongoing vitality is marked by the continuous emergence of new fields in both basic and applied science. In particular, the low-gravity environment offers a unique opportunity for the study of fluid physics and transport phenomena that are very relevant to management of fluid - gas separations in fuel cell and electrolysis systems. Experiments conducted in space have yielded rich results. These results provided valuable insights into fundamental fluid and gas phase behavior that apply to space environments and could not be observed in Earth-based labs. As an example, recent capillary flow results have discovered both an unexpected sensitivity to symmetric geometries associated with fluid container shape, and identified key regime maps for design of corner or wedge-shaped passive gas-liquid phase separators. In this presentation we will also briefly review some of physical science related to flight experiments, such as boiling, that have applicability to electrochemical systems, along with ground-based (drop tower, low gravity aircraft) microgravity electrochemical research. These same buoyancy and interfacial phenomena effects will apply to electrochemical power and energy storage systems that perform two-phase separation, such as water-oxygen separation in life support electrolysis, and primary space power generation devices such as passive <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent years, <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been}} {{explored}} {{for use in}} aircraft. While the weight and size of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> allows only the smallest of aircraft to use <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> for their <b>primary</b> engines, <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have showed promise for use as auxiliary power units (APUs), which power aircraft accessories and serve as an electrical backup {{in case of an}} engine failure. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cell</b> MUS are both more efficient and emit fewer pollutants. However, sea-level <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> need modifications to be properly used in aircraft applications. At high altitudes, the ambient air has a much lower pressure than at sea level, which makes it much more difficult to get air into the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> to react and produce electricity. Compressors can be used to pressurize the air, but this leads to added weight, volume, and power usage, all of which are undesirable things. Another problem is that <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> require hydrogen to create electricity, and ever since the Hindenburg burst into flames, aircraft carrying large quantities of hydrogen have not been in high demand. However, jet fuel is a hydrocarbon, so it is possible to reform it into hydrogen. Since jet fuel is already used to power conventional APUs, it is very convenient to use this to generate the hydrogen for fuel-cell-based APUs. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cells</b> also tend to get large and heavy when used for applications that require a large amount of power. Reducing the size and weight becomes especially beneficial when it comes to <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> for aircraft. My goal this summer is to work on several aspects of Aircraft <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cell</b> Power System project. My first goal is to perform checks on a newly built injector rig designed to test different catalysts to determine the best setup for reforming Jet-A fuel into hydrogen. These checks include testing various thermocouples, transmitters, and transducers, as well making sure that the rig was actually built to the design specifications. These checks will help to ensure that the rig will operate properly and give correct results when it is finally ready for testing. Another of my goals is to test new membranes for use in proton-exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> in the hope that these membranes can increase the electricity that is produced by he 1 cells. Producing more electricity means that fewer <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> are needed, thus reducing the weight and volume of an APU based on <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> making such an APU much more viable...|$|R

The vision explores answers to longstanding questions {{of importance to}} science and society and will develop revolutionary technologies and capabilities for the future, while maintaining good stewardship of taxpayer dollars. One crucial technology area enabling all space exploration is electric power systems. In this paper, the author evaluates surface power technology options {{in order to identify}} leading candidate technologies that will accomplish lunar design reference mission three (LDRM- 3). LDRM- 3 mission consists of multiple, 90 -day missions to the lunar South Pole with 4 -person crews starting in the year 2020. Top-level power requirements included a nominal 50 kW continuous habitat power over a 5 -year lifetime with back-up or redundant emergency power provisions and a nominal 2 -kW, 2 -person unpressurized rover. To help direct NASA's technology investment strategy, this lunar surface power technology evaluation assessed many figures of merit including: current technology readiness levels (TRLs), potential to advance to TRL 6 by 2014, effectiveness of the technology to meet the mission requirements in the specified time, mass, stowed volume, deployed area, complexity, required special ground facilities, safety, reliability/redundancy, strength of industrial base, applicability to other LDRM- 3 elements, extensibility to Mars missions, costs, and risks. For the 50 -kW habitat module, dozens of nuclear, radioisotope and solar power technologies were down-selected to a nuclear fission heat source with Brayton, Stirling or thermoelectric power conversion options. Preferred energy storage technologies included lithium-ion battery and Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Regenerative Fuel Cells (RFC). Several AC and DC power management and distribution architectures and component technologies were defined consistent with the preferred habitat power generation technology option and the overall lunar surface mission. For rover power, more than 20 technology options were down-selected to radioisotope Stirling, liquid lithium-ion battery, PEM RFC, or <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> options.

In the membrane a base layer {{and a thin}} protective layer were bonded by porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film. The base layer, which is composed of silicon oxide supported platinum catalyst (abbreviated as Pt-SiO 2) dispersed in SPEEK resin, can suppress reactant crossover and achieve good membrane hydration due to the imbedded hygroscopic Pt-SiO 2 catalysts. The thin protective layer, which constitutes of H 2 O 2 decomposition catalyst Pt-SiO 2 and high H 2 O 2 -tolerant Nafion resin, aims to prevent the SPEEK resin degradation by H 2 O 2 produced at the cathode side by incomplete reduction of oxygen. The porous PTFE film tightly bonds with the SPEEK and the Nation resins to form an integral membrane and accordingly to avoid delamination of the two different resins. The self-humidifying membrane was characterized by TEM, SEM and EDS, etc. The self-humidifying membrane exhibits higher open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0. 98 V and maximum power density value of 0. 8 W cm(- 2) than 0. 94 V, 0. 33 W cm(- 2) of SPEEK/PTFE membrane under dry condition, respectively. The <b>primary</b> 250 h <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> durability experiment was conducted and suggested that this low-cost self-humidifying membrane was durable both on <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance and the membrane structure under <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> operation condition with dry H- 2 /O- 2.

40|$|One of the <b>primary</b> {{challenges}} in <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> stack models, {{is the lack}} of numerical methods and computational resources available to handle a full-scale stack geometry (which can often have ~ 10 - 100 single cells stacked in series) to at least the same grid resolution and detailed physics as could be obtained in an equivalently detailed single cell model. To help resolve this challenge, a 3 D modelling approach is proposed, and applied to a 5 -cell direct methanol <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (DMFC) short-stack. In this approach, the flow fields, backing layers and membranes are solved numerically in a 3 D manner, whereas the electrochemical performance is solved analytically. This approach allowed for the detailed physics to be incorporated into the model without the requirement of a high mesh density within the MEA. Thus softening the computational load. Since it is well-known that non-uniform flow distributions within the stack’s cells and within the MEA can lead to accelerated aging of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> components, a parametric study on the anode and cathode flow rates, and methanol concentrations are examined numerically. The model was used to shed light onto the mechanisms that lead to non-uniform flow behaviour within the stack’s cells; help identify methods to maintain a uniform flow and concentration distribution within the stack; and to provide methods to minimize methanol crossover to the cathode.

40|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>cells</b> {{have great}} {{application}} potential as stationary power plants, as power sources in transportation, and as portable power generators for electronic devices. Most <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> currently being developed {{for use in}} vehicles and as portable power generators require hydrogen as a fuel. Chemical storage of hydrogen in liquid fuels {{is considered to be}} one of the most advantageous options for supplying hydrogen to the cell. In this case a fuel processor is needed to convert the liquid fuel into a hydrogen-rich stream. This paper presents a second-law analysis of an integrated fuel processor and <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system. The following <b>primary</b> <b>fuels</b> are considered: methanol, ethanol, octane, ammonia, and methane. The maximum amount of electrical work and corresponding heat effects produced from these fuels are evaluated. An exergy analysis is performed for a methanol processor integrated with a proton exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> <b>cell,</b> for use as a portable power generator. The integrated FP–FC system, which can produce 100 W of electricity, is simulated with a computer model using the flow-sheeting program Aspen Plus. The influence of various operating conditions on the system efficiency is investigated, such as the methanol concentration in the feed, the temperature in the reformer and in the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell,</b> as well as the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> efficiency. Finally, it is shown that the calculated overall exergetic efficiency of the FP–FC system is higher than that of typical combustion engines and rechargeable batteries...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cell</b> {{technology}} {{will play a}} crucial role in future sustainable energy generation. Different types of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> had been developed, of which Polymer Electrolyte Membrane <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cells</b> (PEMFCs) are the <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> of choice for small scale stationary and mobile applications that operate under transient conditions. The feed for PEMFCs is hydrogen. For small scale stationary and mobile applications, the hydrogen, typically, has to be produced on-site from other energy sources, such as fossil fuels or fuel from renewable sources. At present, the most favourable approach appears to be production train that startsith a steam reformer stage, which converts most of the <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> to syngas. In the subsequent water-¬‐gas-¬‐shift stage,most of the carbon monoxide in the syngas is converted to additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In a last stage, the small amount of carbon monoxide that remains in the stream is reduced to acceptable levels for use in the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell.</b> In large scale industrial hydrogen production, the above concept (steam reforming –water gas-shift-hydrogen purification) is the state of the art, with the units operating under steady conditions for years years once started. In contrast, the said small scale units will typically operate under transient conditions and in on/off mode. This requires catalysts that are stable with respect to occasional contact with air and condensation of the steam co-fed with the <b>primary</b> <b>fuel</b> and which do not require any activation or other conditioning prior to restart. Only noble metal based catalysts meet these requirements at present. This study was aimed at the water-gas-shirhift (WGS) stage within this train. The basis of the study was the comparison of three commercial supported noble metal WGS catalysts and a state-¬‐of-¬‐the-¬‐art industrial iron/chromium high temperature WGS catalyst. All the catalysts were applied washcoated into stainless steel microchannel reactor, either coated in - house or by the catalyst manufacturer, as well as defining an operational window for the noble metal catalysts...|$|R

The 2 MW <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cell</b> Demonstration was part of the Kentucky Pioneer Energy (KPE) Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) project selected by DOE under Round Five of the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program. The participant in the CCTDP V Project was Kentucky Pioneer Energy for the IGCC plant. FuelCell Energy, Inc. (FCE), under subcontract to KPE, was responsible for the design, construction and operation of the 2 MW <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power plant. Duke Fluor Daniel provided engineering design and procurement support for the balance-of-plant skids. Colt Engineering Corporation provided engineering design, fabrication and procurement of the syngas processing skids. Jacobs Applied Technology provided the fabrication of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> module vessels. Wabash River Energy Ltd (WREL) provided the test site. The 2 MW <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power plant utilizes FuelCell Energy's Direct <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cell</b> (DFC) technology, which is based on the internally reforming carbonate <b>fuel</b> <b>cell.</b> This plant is capable of operating on coal-derived syngas as well as natural gas. Prior testing (1992) of a subscale 20 kW carbonate <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> stack at the Louisiana Gasification Technology Inc. (LGTI) site using the Dow/Destec gasification plant indicated that operation on coal derived gas provided normal performance and stable operation. Duke Fluor Daniel and FuelCell Energy developed a commercial plant design for the 2 MW <b>fuel</b> <b>cell.</b> The plant was designed to be modular, factory assembled and truck shippable to the site. Five balance-of-plant skids incorporating fuel processing, anode gas oxidation, heat recovery, water treatment/instrument air, and power conditioning/controls were built and shipped to the site. The two <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> modules, each rated at 1 MW on natural gas, were fabricated by FuelCell Energy in its Torrington, CT manufacturing facility. The <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> modules were conditioned and tested at FuelCell Energy in Danbury and shipped to the site. Installation of the power plant and connection to all required utilities and syngas was completed. Pre-operation checkout of the entire power plant was conducted and the plant was ready to operate in July 2004. However, fuel gas (natural gas or syngas) was not available at the WREL site due to technical difficulties with the gasifier and other issues. The <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> power plant was therefore not operated, and subsequently removed by October of 2005. The WREL <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> site was restored to the satisfaction of WREL. FuelCell Energy continues to market carbonate <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> for natural gas and digester gas applications. A fuel cell/turbine hybrid is being developed and tested that provides higher efficiency with potential to reach the DOE goal of 60 % HHV on coal gas. A system study was conducted for a 40 MW direct fuel cell/turbine hybrid (DFC/T) with potential for future coal gas applications. In addition, FCE is developing Solid Oxide <b>Fuel</b> <b>Cell</b> (SOFC) power plants with Versa Power Systems (VPS) as part of the Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) program and has an on-going program for co-production of hydrogen.
