40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{challenges in}} Molecular Communication, a new communication paradigm inspired by biological systems. Molecular communication allows biological and artificially-created nanomachines to communicate over {{a short distance}} using molecules. In molecular communication, a sender nanomachine encodes information onto molecules (information molecules). Information molecules then propagate to a receiver, and the receiver, upon receiving the information molecules, reacts biochemically. One of major research challenges in molecular communication is building a molecular <b>propagation</b> <b>system</b> that directionally transports information molecules from a sender to a receiver in an artificially created aqueous environment without or with little external control. This paper proposes a design of an autonomous molecular <b>propagation</b> <b>system</b> that loads, transports, and unloads information molecules using DNA hybridization and biomolecular linear motors. In the proposed system, protein filaments (i. e., microtubules and actin filaments) glide over immobilized motor proteins (i. e., kinesins, dyneins, and myosins) along preconfigured microlithographic tracks, and these gliding protein filaments are used as carrier molecules that transport information molecules from a sender to a receiver. In addition, DNA hybridization is used to load and unload the information molecules onto and from the carrier molecules. In the proposed system, these loading/transporting/unloading processes require no external control.

SysML is first used to construct the system conceptual model for a generic seedling <b>propagation</b> <b>system</b> in terms of system structure and activities in a hierarchical manner (i. e. low, medium and high levels). Simulation models conforming to the conceptual model are then con-structed in Arena. An additive regression model-based approach is proposed to estimate parameters for the aggregated simulation model. The proposed framework is demonstrated via {{one of the largest}} grafted seedling propagation systems in North America. The results reveal that 1) the proposed framework al-lows us to construct accurate but computationally affordable simulation models for seedling <b>propagation</b> <b>system,</b> and 2) model aggregation increases the randomness of simulation outputs. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Propagation</b> <b>systems</b> for {{seedling}} growth play a {{major role}} in agriculture, and in notable cases (such as organic systems), are under constant threat from soil and seedborne fungal plant pathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani or Pythium spp. Yet, to date little is known that links the risk of disease invasion to the host density, which is an agronomic characteristic that can be readily controlled. We introduce here, for the first time in an agronomic system, a percolation framework to analyze the link. We set up an experiment to study the spread of the ubiquitous fungus R. solani in replicated <b>propagation</b> <b>systems</b> with different planting densities, and fit a percolation-based epidemiological model to the data using Bayesian inference methods. The estimated probability of pathogen transmission between infected and susceptible plants is used to calculate the risk of invasion. By comparing the transmission probability and the risk values obtained for different planting densities, we are able to give evidence of a nonlinear relationship between disease invasion and the inter-plant spacing, hence to demonstrate the existence of a spatial threshold for epidemic invasion. The implications and potential use of our methods for the evaluation of disease control strategies are discussed. © 2013 The American Phytopathological Society.

40|$|Abstract The {{amount of}} {{information}} that people share on social networks is constantly increasing. People also comment, annotate, and tag their own content (videos, photos, notes, etc.), {{as well as the}} content of others. In many cases, the content is tagged manually.

In such a scenario, however, a wrong or a spam tag can damage the integrity and reliability of the automated <b>propagation</b> <b>system.</b> Users may make mistakes in tagging, or irrelevant tags and content may be added maliciously for advertisement or self-promotion. Therefore, a certain mechanism insuring the trustworthiness of users or published content is needed.

Significant differences (p< 0. 001) in mortality associated with F. circinatum were observed between the P. patula x P. tecunumanii (LE) hybrid (6 %) and P. patula (19 – 23 %). No significant differences in mortality associated with F. circinatum were observed within P. patula x P. tecunumanii (LE) families, which ranged from zero to 15 %. Significant mortality differences (p < 0. 001) were observed between P. patula families, which ranged from 8 % to 44 %. The number of rooted cuttings produced, per hedge established, over the four-year period was significantly better (p  0. 001) in the P. patula x P. tecunumanii (LE) hybrid (52) than in P. patula (29 – 33). Significant differences (p < 0. 001) were also observed in the number of rooted cuttings produced per family, with P. patula x P. tecunumanii (LE) families ranging from 35 to 70 cuttings per hedge plant established and P. patula families between 20 and 42 cuttings. Over the four-year duration of the trial all taxa showed increased productivity in hedges grown in a hydroponic sand bed system, which received more consistent fertilisation and yielded an average of 55 rooted cuttings per hedge, over those grown in polythene bags with composted pine bark medium, which yielded 41 cuttings on average.
