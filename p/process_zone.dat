Tube expansion, tube reduction and tube beading are performed on the friction stir processed and parent tubes.

40|$|Abstract. Friction stir {{processing}} (FSP) is a solid-state process {{leading to}} very significant microstructural modifications. Despite {{the large number}} of studies, most of the work that has been done in the FSP field focuses on microstructural evolution, tensile properties, hardness, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance etc. However there is not much information available on correlation of FSP parameters with evolution of defect free <b>processed</b> <b>zone.</b> In order to produce a defect free <b>processed</b> <b>zone,</b> selecting the best processing parameters is very important. In this investigation, the effect of two main FSP parameters (such as tool rotational speed which was kept constant and tool transverse speed which was varied) on the formation / evolution of defect free <b>processed</b> <b>zone</b> was studied. It is found that at a tool rotational speed 600 rpm and a traverse speed of 12 mm/min the <b>processed</b> <b>zone</b> is defect free. Numerous investigations have been conducted to understand material flow behavior during FSW/FSP. However, the flow process of material during FSW/FSP is still not well-understood, and different explanations have been proposed.

The variation in traction in relation to displacement is plotted on a curve and is called the traction-displacement curve. The area under this curve {{is equal to the}} energy needed for separation.CZM maintains continuity conditions mathematically; despite physical separation. It eliminates singularity of stress and limits it to the cohesive strength of the material. [...] The traction-displacement curve gives the constitutive behavior of the fracture. For each material system, guidelines are to be formed and modelling is done individually. This is how the CZM works. The amount of fracture energy dissipated in the work region depends on the shape of the model considered. Also, the ratio between maximum stress and the yield stress affects the length of fracture <b>process</b> <b>zone.</b> Smaller the ratio, longer is the <b>process</b> <b>zone.</b> The CZM allows the energy to flow into the fracture <b>process</b> <b>zone,</b> where a part of it is spent in the forward region and rest in the wake region.|$|E

In FSP, the tool plays a very important role in producing a defect free <b>processed</b> <b>zone.</b> The shoulder of the tool, which is the main source of heat generation, is typically either flat or tapered in shape. The typical shape of the shoulder aids in material consolidation during processing by forcing the softened material to be retained in the <b>processed</b> <b>zone,</b> as the tool traverses {{along the length of the}} work piece.

Engineers use an energy-balance approach to model how particle size and rubber modulus factors influence material toughness.

50|$|In LEFMPA, during cracking, no {{specific}} region is mentioned {{in between the}} area which is cracked and that which is not.

FPZ consists of micro cracks which are minute individual cracks situated nearer to crack tip. As the crack propagates these micro cracks merge and becomes a single structure to give continuity to the already existing crack. So indeed, FPZ acts as a bridging zone between cracked region and uncracked region. Analysis of this zone deserves special notice because it is very helpful to predict the propagation of crack and ultimate failure in concrete.In steel (ductile) FPZ is very small and therefore strain hardening dominates over strain softening. Also due to small FPZ, crack tip can easily be distinguished from uncracked metal. And in ductile materials FPZ is a yielding zone.|$|E

Friction stir processing is a solid state process where the material beneath the shoulder and around the pin region undergoes severe plastic deformation resulting in dynamically recrystallised equiaxed grain structure.

This article reports the effects of Friction stir processing parameters such as tool rotational speed (1000 rpm, 1200 rpm), tool traversing speed (40 mm/min, 75 mm/min and 105 mm/min) and shoulder diameter (18 mm and 24 mm) on microstructure and tensile properties of friction stir processed extruded AZ 31 B alloy.

5000|$|Zdeněk Bažant’s {{main focus}} is on {{mathematical}} modeling in mechanics of materials and structures. He has {{made significant contributions to}} several important engineering fields. E.g., in 1976 he showed by stability analysis that the concept strain-softening (then regarded by mechanics gurus as “insane”) does make sense if there is a finite material characteristic length that limits strain localization. Then, in 1983, he published a paradigm changing paper on the crack band model, which presented a simple way to handle nonlocal damage and avoid spurious mesh sensitivity. Both papers were hardly cited for two decades but then the citations exploded (even though the 1983 paper was declined in a premier American journal and then published in a French journal little known at that time; the citations of this papers now run several hundred a year and in 2016 exceeded 2600, on Google). The crack band model is now embedded in various commercial programs and is applied in user’s subroutines for concrete, rocks and comosites, and is the mainstay in design of large commercial composite airframes (e.g., at Boeing). [...] It was similar with Bažant’s (by now classical) material models for nonlocal damage, for energetic (non-statistical) size effect in quasibrittle fracture, for microplane constitutive modeling, for a solidifying material model for concrete creep, for calculations of moisture diffusion in nano-pores of concrete, and for his solution of elastic three-dimensional singularities at skew intersections of crack front line with a surface. They all became highly cited only recently. So did. his monumental treatise on stability of structures, innovative in treating the stability of fracture and damage, thermodynamics of structural stability, and objective stress rates for 3D bodies. Ditto his pioneering books on fracture and size effect in concrete, on concrete at high temperatures, and on concrete creep and shrinkage. Bažant is best known as the world leader in scaling research in solid mechanics. Bažant size effect law, with his demonstrations (mainly in six papers during 1976-91) of damage localization instabilitites and of spurious dependence of the early strain-softening models on element size, {{took a long time to}} sink in. But eventually it changed the design computations in concrete and geotechnical industry, and impacted the design practice in fiber composites (for large aircraft, ships and, car crashworthiness). The RILEM standard recommendation for testing of fracture energy and characteristic length of concrete (FMT/1990) is based on Bažant’s law. [...] Later Bažant extended his scaling research to statistical size effect. Exploiting the frequency law of interatomic bond breaks, he showed that, due to fracture <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> finiteness, the statistical strength of quasibrittle structures follows a graft of Gauss and Weibull distributions and exhibits a strong size effect, causing the safety factors and static and fatigue lifetimes of quasibrittle structures to be size dependent. He demonstrated that disregard of size effect was a major factor in many structural failures. His proposals of code provisions taking into account the size effect on shear failures of beams and slabs has been endorsed by ACI Committee 446 but not yet accepted for the ACI concrete design code. [...] Bažant’s microplane model for softening damage in concrete, rocks, composites, etc., in which the constitutive law is written in terms of stress and strain vectors on a generic plane, trades conceptual simplicity and clarity of physical interpretation for higher computational demands, which initially stifled applications but recently ceased to be an obstacle. The microplane model is now included in large-scale computer codes at U.S. national labs (EPIC, PRONTO, etc.) and in various commercial codes (ATENA, DIANA, SBETA, OOFEM). His microplane model for jointed rock is embedded, e.g., in ANSYS. With the microplane model, Bažant was able to capture the `vertex’ effect in softening damage, which is important for dynamics but cannot be simulated with the classical tensorial constitutive models (for concrete he also demonstrated by tests). He showed experimentally and theoretically that material strain softening reverses to hardening when the loading rate suddenly increases. [...] Bažant further made major theoretical and experimental contributions to the sustainability problems of infrastructure, to high temperature effects in nuclear containments and in tunnels exposed to fire, to thermodynamics and nano-mechanics of creep and shrinkage in hydrating cement, and to 3D singularities at fracture surface intersections. His Model B3 for practical prediction of concrete creep and shrinkage, calibrated by a worldwide database of thousands of laboratory tests assembled by his assistants, became an international standard recommendation (RILEM-CGS/1991). His nonlinear diffusion model for concrete is featured in Eurocode and widely used in durability analysis. His simple age-adjusted effective modulus method for concrete structure taking into account multi-decade chemical aging is embedded in the Eurocode as well as ACI standard recommendation. His unconditionally stable ‘exponential’ algorithm for rate-type concrete creep law is now standard in structural computations. [...] In finite strain theory and structural stability analysis, Bažant was the first to resolve the decades-old controversy about the 3D stability theories of Engesser, Haringx, Hencky, Truesdell, Biot, etc., as applied to soft-in-shear structures. In 1971, he showed by energy variational analysis that these theories correspond to different choices of objective stress rate and are all equivalent upon certain transformations of the tangential elastic moduli, and that some objective stress rates used in Abaqus, Ansys, LS-Dyna and other commercial codes do not conserve energy. This 1971 result was generally ignored until, a few years ago, Bažant demonstrated that the energy conservation error is non-negligible and can be of the order of 100% in the case of highly orthotropic structures, orthotropic damage, or high compressibility. Furthermore, he provided a coherent mechanical explanation of the collapse of WTC Towers in New York, and then derived the crush-down and crush-up differential equations of progressive collapse of tall buildings. [...] Bažant also developed a theory of the destructive alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete (including the diffusion of expanding gel) which matches test results; a theory on hundred year prediction of concrete creep based on inverse analysis of observed excessive bridge deflections, coupled with Bayesian extrapolation of short-time test data; and predictions models B3 and B4 for concrete creep and shrinkage (both drying and chemical-autogenous) which became standard international recommendations of RILEM. He also formulated new theory chemical aging due to cement hydration from hours to centuries at variable temperature and humidity, and a theory for of microprestress (eigenstress) in hydrated cement originating from disjoining pressures of hindered adsorbed water in nanopores. He extended his probabilistic theory of quasibrittle failure to the size effect on residual strength and lifetime, and on Paris law the cyclic crack growths in quasibrittle materials, and showed an analosy with dielectric breakdown. He demonstrated his non-statistical size effect for the fracture of bones and of dental materials. [...] Recently, with his motivated group of assistants, Bažant works on stability and propagation of hydraulic fracture in gas or oil shale and mitigation of environmental risks of fracking; on size effect in fatigue crack growth in quasibrittle materials; and on energy absorption in composite crush cans for cars. Considering the body forces do to water diffusing into shale pores, he showed that hydraulic fracture must branch laterally, and determined their spacing inversely, based on gas production observations. He formulated a new theory of comminution of solids under impact due to release of kinetic energy of high-rate shearing, analogous to turbulence. He examined critically the new theory of ‘peridynamics’ and showed its limitations. Bažant strives in his contributions for practical relevance, originality, clarity and mathematical simplicity. Despite engaging in some super-computer simulations, he prefers analytical approaches as a way to reach deeper understanding, even at the cost of inevitable simplifications. At the same time, he has always extensively validated his results by experimental data and, when facing a vacuum of experimental evidence, conducted a host of innovative experiments with his own research team. [...] By 2016, Bažant’s H-index reached 112, i10-index 550 and his total citations 54,000 (on Google Scholar, incl. self-cit.).|$|E

Friction stir processing (FSP) {{was carried out}} using a load of 8 [*]kN and with a tool rotation speed of 800 [*]rpm and thus a surface composite was processed. Processed samples were characterized for revealing the microstructural features. SEM and XRD analysis revealed the presence of fine Ni particles in the stir zone which lead to {{a significant increase in}} hardness. Using the “refined energy model,” the maximum temperature developed within the <b>processed</b> <b>zone</b> was estimated and found to be around 275 °C. Impression creep behaviour was assessed on both the base metal and <b>processed</b> <b>zone</b> at the temperature of 30, 100, and 200 °C. Creep curves were generated and steady state creep rate (SSCR) values were found out to determine the activation energy. It is observed that friction stirred regions record higher creep rate values compared to the base metal. Estimated activation energy is in the range of 6 to 16 [*]kJ/mol. Activation energy is marginally lower in the base metal compared to friction stir processed region...|$|R
30|$|In all, {{the results}} suggest that DTTM {{can be used as a}} foaming and water viscosification agent. Similar to polymer {{enhanced}} foam, viscosification is a means to increase foam stability, and thereby the effective viscosity of aqueous foams for gas mobility control. The surfactant can be injected in CO 2 or brine to generate foam in situ for reducing gas mobility in excessively gas <b>processed</b> <b>zones</b> (thief zones). Foam stability and propagation can be enhanced as the formation brine is viscosified in situ.|$|R
