The authors observed dual existing tax regimes: the hard and standardized state <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> under central custody versus de facto soft and flexible local <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> under local promotion and argue that despite central persisting initiatives in unifying <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> and recentralization, local variation and divergence continue to play indispensable role in implementation of central reform due to China’s sheer size, geographical, cultural and resource endowment disparity {{as well as local}} state’s self-interest seeking inevitably induces localized adaptation of central policy and, consequently, calls for further decentralization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The paper {{argues that}} the {{appropriate}} approach to determine public good provision fi nanced by distortionary taxes should depend on the available <b>tax</b> <b>regime.</b> If a suffi ciently rich <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> exists, one could rely on the Pareto criterion, which would be less information–demanding than a social welfare approach re-quiring access to social welfare weights assigned to various groups. The discussion is related {{to a number of}} representative <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> and cost–benefi t approaches in the literature. It is also argued that, whatever the available <b>tax</b> <b>regime,</b> cost–benefi t analysis runs into problems unless one can assume that taxes are set optimally...|$|R
40|$|The {{recession}} {{that started in}} the late 2000 s has created significant economic and financial challenges globally and within nation states. In particular, oil-producing countries have been further affected by the fall in oil price. It is therefore crucial that alternative, more sustainable methods of sourcing revenue be investigated and utilised. The purpose of this thesis therefore {{is to examine the}} use of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> as a sustainable revenue source in promoting economic growth and development in Nigeria. Using a qualitative legal analysis, of the Nigerian corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> and through an extensive literature review, the thesis identified a number of key findings. Inter alia, that revenue from corporation tax structures are a sustainable revenue source mostly because of the amount of revenue generated through Multinational Corporations (MNCs). Secondly, the existing Nigerian corporation <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> is in need of reform as there are developmental challenges, including lack of implementation and ambiguous legislation, which continue to thwart its success. Therefore, this leads to establishing how, and to what extent that Nigeria can use its corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> as a sustainable revenue source. The answer to this lies in the legal framework of corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes.</b> This thesis argues that legal uncertainties in the corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> are the principal reason for the challenges faced by both state governments and MNCs. The thesis concludes by recommending reforms to the Nigerian <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> while also recommending a tax compliance strategy for both domestic and international corporate <b>tax</b> <b>regimes.</b> This will set a foundation for corporation <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> as a sustainable revenue generation source for developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} consistency test reveals that Maryland applies systematically higher “county” taxes to interstate commerce than to in-state commerce. Economic analysis of Maryland’s <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> — including its taxes on inbound, outbound, and domestic activities — confirms what the {{internal consistency}} test suggests, namely, that the Maryland “county” tax discourages interstate commerce. Specifically, the Maryland <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> discourages Maryland residents from earning income outside of Maryland, and it simultaneously discourages nonresidents from earning income in Maryland. Maryland alone causes this distortion; the distortion {{does not depend on}} the taxes imposed by any other state. Petitioner’s argument that Maryland’s outbound <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> should be upheld because it is facially neutral when compared to Maryland’s domestic tax requires the Court to ignore Maryland’s inbound tax on nonresidents. Ignoring relevant parts of a state’s <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> obscures the overall effect of that regime on interstate commerce. Although crediting other states’ taxes would cure Maryland’s dormant Commerce Clause violation, other practical and legitimate alternatives for curing the violation exist.

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} the study is to find a metric-variable of {{competitiveness}} for each country's <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> and {{to assess the impact of}} <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> differentiation across the common market. A country adopting competitive taxation policies manages to attract productive factors, funds and investments from other intra- and inter-countries. The value added tax (VAT), property tax as well as corporate and personal taxes are examined for the twenty seven (27) European Union (EU) countries. The methods applied consist of Least Square Dummy variable models and the results from the estimations for each one of the aforementioned taxes are integrated into a new total competitiveness taxation index (TCTI), following weighted hierarchical quantitative approaches. Our findings suggest that significant differences still exist between the countries examined and the application of diverse <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> systems results in various tax performances. Using the above procedure, we also find that subgroups exist within the (27) EU countries and that EU lacks taxation policies with common rules or restrictions. Following the TCTI methodology proposed by this research, a tool for monitoring EU <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> is introduced in order to assist in the EU integration to a common <b>tax</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R

First, in Luxembourg and the Netherlands owner-occupiers have to include an imputed rental income in their taxable income. Second, in the Netherlands, the tax-deductibility of mortgage interest payments is almost unre-stricted. The <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> of owner-occupied homes increasingly erodes the personal income tax base in the Netherlands, so that higher tax rates are needed to collect a given amount of revenue. However, elimination or reduction of the mortgage interest deduction can only be realized gradually. Due to a lack of data both within the various <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> and across time periods, a comprehensive multivariate time-series comparison among the various <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> in the EU- 15 is not pos-sible. Thus, the statistical analysis is limited to bivariate compari-sons. ...|$|R

Our micro data covers the full population of non-financial Norwegian corporations over ten years. During this period, the dual income tax system allowed corporations to shift <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> without changing organizational form. We show that the income shifting potential is large for the active owners of a corporation that participate in a tax reducing coalition. Our results show that corporations respond to tax incentives and change <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> in order to reduce tax payments. But persistent cohort effects in the choice of <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> and substantial unobserved corporation-specific effects indicate that non-tax factors matter as well. Corporations founded prior to the introduction of the dual income tax differ substantially from those founded after in their adaptation to the incentives for shifting <b>tax</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R
40|$|Neither an {{international}} tax, nor {{an international}} taxing body exists. Rather, there are domestic taxing rules adopted by jurisdictions which, coupled with double tax treaties, apply to cross-border transactions and international taxation issues. International bodies {{such as the}} OECD and UN, which provide guidance on tax issues, often steer and supplement these domestic adoptions but have no binding international taxing powers. These pragmatic realities, together with the specific {{use of the word}} ‘regime’ within the tax community, lead many to argue that an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> does not exist. However, an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> should be defined no differently to any other area of international law and when we step outside the confines of tax law to consider the definition of a ‘regime’ within international relations it is possible to demonstrate that such a regime is very real. The first part of this article, by defining an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> in a broader and more traditional context, also outlining both the tax policy and principles which frame that regime, reveals its existence. Once it is accepted that an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> exists, it is possible to consider its adoption by jurisdictions and subsequent constraints it places on them. Using the proposed changes to transfer pricing laws as the impetus for assessing Australia’s adoption of the international <b>tax</b> <b>regime,</b> the constraints on sovereignty are assessed through a taxonomy of the level adoption. This reveals the subsequent constraints which flow from the broad acceptance of an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> through to the specific adoption of technical detail. By undertaking this analysis, the second part of this article demonstrates that Australia has inherently adopted an international <b>tax</b> <b>regime,</b> with a move towards explicit adoption and a clear embedding of its principles within the domestic tax legislation...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe {{government}} of Cuba established a <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> for micro-enterprises {{as soon as}} it legalized the sector in 1993. It was designed to function in a difficult context in which a tax-paying culture did not exist, in which widespread noncompliance was feared, and in which some micro-entrepreneurs' incomes were high. The <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> included advance monthly lump-sum payments, a 10 % maximum amount of total revenues which could be deducted as costs in calculating taxable income, and an escalating tax schedule. This <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> has a number of weaknesses which make it inequitable, inefficient and ineffective in revenue generation. The analysis of this essay indicates that the actual incidence of the tax is higher than the official tax scale when actual production costs exceed the maximum allowable 10 %, even exceeding 100 % in some circumstances. The up-front lumpsum tax payments result in marginal tax rates of 100 % for initial levels of revenue, followed by a rate of 0 % until a level of taxable income is reached where taxes payable according to the tax scale are equal to the initial lump-sum payment. The <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> discriminates against micro-enterprises which have costs of purchased inputs in excess of 10 % of gross revenues. It is regressive in that the tax rates are higher for lower-income micro-enterprises up to a fairly significant level of true net income. The micro-enterprise sector also faces a more onerous <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> than the foreign and joint venture sector of the economy. From the standpoint of its impact on the efficiency of resource use, the <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> restricts the entry of new firms into the sector and forces some out of business or underground, thereby reducing production, raising prices, reducing employment and reducing the generation of income. Finally, to the extent that firms "go underground," refrain from starting up, go out of business, or evade taxes, the government loses revenue. A number of modifications in the <b>tax</b> <b>regime</b> are suggested in order to overcome its weaknesses. These changes could help the sector to make a more valuable contribution to Cuba in terms of employment and income generation, increased production at lower real costs and prices, and increased tax collection...|$|R

The model allocates a fixed private capital stock among various classes of nonresidential and residential capital, depending upon the rental costs for the capital components, the price elasticities of demand with respect to the rental costs, and the elasticities of homeownership with respect to the cost of owning versus renting. The interest rate adjusts in response to tax/inflation changes so as to maintain the aggregate demand for capital at this initial level. The model is employed to deduce the efficiency of the allocation of real capital under various <b>tax</b> <b>regimes</b> at different inflation rates. ...|$|R
