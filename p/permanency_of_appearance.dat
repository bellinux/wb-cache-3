40|$|The {{transformation}} of fog at a non-visible water {{layer on a}} membrane of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) was evaluated. Nonionic surfactants of major demand in the polyolefin industry were studied. A kinetic study using a hot fog chamber showed that condensation is controlled by both the diffusion and <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> the surfactant more than by the change of the surface energy developed by the wetting agents. The greatest <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> the anti-fog effect of the LDPE/EVA surface was close to 3000 h. The contact angle results demonstrated {{the ability of the}} wetting agent to spread out to the surface. Complementarily, the migration of nonionic surfactants from the inside of the polymeric matrix to the surface was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy. Additionally, electrical measurement on the anti-fogging membrane at alternating currents and at a sweep frequency was proposed to test the conductivity and wetting ability of nonionic surfactants. We proved that the amphiphilic molecules had the ability to increase the conductivity in the polyolefin membrane. A correlation between the bulk electrical conductivity and the <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> the fogging control on the LDPE/EVA coextruded film was found...|$|R

30|$|Logit model {{results for}} the lack of pre-requisites as a binary outcome {{variable}} (Table  18), confirm the existence of those differences across teachers groups. Moreover, based on model results, a set of background characteristics is also found to be significantly associated with the perception of lack of pre-requisites. These include age, gender educational attainment and <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> the job. In particular, controlling for other factors, teachers with lower educational attainment, those aged 50 + and those having a fixed term contract were found significantly more likely to indicate the lack of pre-requisites as a barrier to professional development.

Duas especialistas brasileiras em educação infantil analisaram a pertinência de cada um dos 35 itens da ITERS para avaliar a qualidade de ambientes educacionais oferecidos para crianças de 0 a 30 meses. Considerando-se os 70 itens avaliados, verificou-se que em 69 houve indicação de permanência e apenas uma sugestão de exclusão. As indicações de permanência dos itens foram classificadas nas seguintes categorias: Permanência sem sugestões de alterações (56 %); Permanência com sugestão de adequação de termos, de materiais ou de situações (19 %); Permanência com sugestão de acréscimo de esclarecimentos (11 %); Permanência com alterações de estrutura ou de conteúdo (10 %). O alto índice de acordo obtido entre as juízas (97 %) quanto à permanência de 34 itens sugere a pertinência da ITERS, representada pelos 35 itens, para avaliar a qualidade do atendimento oferecido em ambientes educacionais coletivos em nosso contexto.

40|$|Wing {{polymorphism}} of semiaquatic bugs {{is affected}} by environmental factors as temperature, photoperiod, population density or <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> habitat. The heritability has its own specific part, too. A lot of field studies suggest that crucial effect on wing polymorphism has temperature, but laboratory experiments often do not confirm this hypothesis. The main aim of this thesis was to describe the effect of environmental factors (photoperiod, temperature and <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> habitat) on wing polymorphism of Microvelia reticulata, additionally of Gerris lacustris. The partial tasks included description of effect of mentioned abiotic factors on mortality and rate of development. The individuals of both species were kept at combinations of two levels of temperature, photoperiod and <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> habitat (overall at eight treatments) from first larval instar to adult. All adults of Microvelia reticulata emerged as apterous, {{so there was no}} response of wing polymorphism to tested environmental factors. The main influence of heritability is presumable. Only ten individuals of G. lacustris developed into the adult stage, so it was impossible to describe the influence of abiotic factors on wing polymorphism, mortality and lenght of development in this species. Mortality of individuals of M. reticulata was significantly influenced by the type of substrate. Only 3. 5 % of individuals survived when reared on wet filter paper, while 80. 5 % on the water surface. Both other factors (temperature, photoperiod) had no effect on total mortality. There was no difference between mortality of males and females, so it is impossible to note sexual dependent mortality. The lenght of development did not differ between sexes either. Lenght of development was significantly affected by temperature, as low temperature reduces development of M. reticulata. The fastest development showed nymphs of second instar and slowest development nymphs of fifth instar at all treatments. Since the effect of abiotic factors on wing polymorphism was not found in M. reticulata, it would be sufficient to study the effect of heritability on development of wings in this species in the future...|$|R
