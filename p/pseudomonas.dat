5|$|Bacterial {{disease is}} {{uncommon}} in Narcissus but includes <b>Pseudomonas</b> (bacterial streak) and Pectobacterium carotovorum sp. carotovorum (bacterial soft rot).|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic study revealed that A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as the bacterium <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa, and in 2007 it was suggested that the genera Azotobacter, Azomonas and <b>Pseudomonas</b> are related and might be synonyms.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{effective}} antiseptic when used as a 1% solution, with broad spectrum of activity against streptococci, staphylococci, <b>pseudomonas,</b> enterococci and others. It may be an option for skin infections caused by <b>pseudomonas</b> resistant to typical antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{bacteria}} such as <b>Pseudomonas</b> and Salmonella attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as Penicillium infect loggerhead {{sea turtle}} nests and cloacae.|$|E
5|$|Most aerobic Gram-negative {{bacteria}} (such as <b>Pseudomonas,</b> Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) {{are resistant}} to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice.|$|E
5|$|Steer and Colin-Jones publish {{their results}} {{regarding}} H. pylori {{and its relation}} to PUD. They decide that it was <b>Pseudomonas,</b> a contaminant, and not related to PUD.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles {{may suffer}} from {{bacterial}} infections. Aeromonas and <b>Pseudomonas</b> are two genera of bacteria that cause pneumonia in individuals. Bacterial aggregates (sometimes known as biofilms) {{have also been}} found in the lungs of two deceased specimens discovered in 1982 and 1995 from colonies in the southern population.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} <b>Pseudomonas</b> and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet fully understood. The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has no {{clinically}} {{significant effect on}} most Gram-negative bacteria. <b>Pseudomonas</b> and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E
5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as <b>Pseudomonas,</b> the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and <b>Pseudomonas</b> fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also {{plays a role in}} the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} were once intensively hunted for their meat and eggs; {{consumption}} has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed {{in countries where}} regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an aphrodisiac. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens, {{and high levels of}} toxic metals that build up through bioaccumulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{spreading}} {{of organisms}} is facilitated when risk factors are present. Alcoholism {{is associated with}} Streptococcus pneumoniae, anaerobic organisms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; smoking facilitates the effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella pneumophila. Exposure to birds is associated with Chlamydia psittaci; farm animals with Coxiella burnetti; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and cystic fibrosis with <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is more common in}} the winter, and should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of anaerobic organisms.|$|E
25|$|Probiotic {{prophylaxis}} {{may prevent}} colonization and delay onset of <b>Pseudomonas</b> infection in an ICU setting. Immunoprophylaxis against <b>Pseudomonas</b> is being investigated.|$|E
25|$|In the gammaproteobacterial order Pseudomonadales, {{the genus}} Azotobacter and the species Azomonas macrocytogenes are {{actually}} {{members of the}} genus <b>Pseudomonas,</b> but were misclassified due to nitrogen fixing capabilities and the large size of the genus <b>Pseudomonas</b> which renders classification problematic. This will probably rectified in the close future.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa has {{the ability}} to metabolise a variety of substrates including n-alkanes, hexadecane and oils. Uptake of these hydrophobic substrates is speculated to rely on the production of rhamnolipids. It is thought that rhamnolipids either cause the <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa cell surface to become hydrophobic, promoting an interaction between the substrate and the cell, or secreted rhamnolipids emulsify the substrate and allow it to be taken up by the <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa cell. There is evidence that rhamnolipids are highly adsorbent to the <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa cell surface, causing it to become hydrophobic. It has also been shown that production of rhamnolipids promotes uptake of hexadecane by overcoming the inhibitory effect of the hydrophilic interactions caused by LPS. Production of rhamnolipids is observed on hydrophobic substrates but equally high yields are achievable on other carbon sources such as sugars. Furthermore, although mono-rhamnolipids have been shown to interact with the <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa cell membrane and cause it to become hydrophobic, di-rhamnolipids do not interact well with the cell membrane because the polar head group is too large to penetrate the LPS layer. Therefore, although Rhamnolipids may play a part in interaction of <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa with hydrophobic carbon sources, they are likely to have additional functions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudomonas,</b> Rhizobium, Salmonella, Serratia, Streptomyces, Streptococcus and Xanthomonas.|$|E
25|$|Motility {{is a key}} {{virulence}} determinant in <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa. <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa {{has three}} distinct methods of moving across or through a medium. Rhamnolipids are particularly important in swarming motility where they are postulated to lower the surface tension of the surface through their surfactant properties, allowing the bacterial cell to swarm. New evidence suggests that rhamnolipids are necessary to allow <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa cells to overcome attachment mediated by type IV pili. There is some discrepancy between the role of HAAs and RHLs in swarming motility. Some studies use a rhlA mutation to assess the effect on motility, which prevents the formation of HAAs and rhamnolipids. Studies that use a rhlB mutant show that <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa can swarm {{in the absence of}} rhamnolipids, but HAAs are absolutely necessary for swarming. Rhamnolipids have been proposed to be important in regulating swarm tendril formation.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{are formed}} by {{bacteria}} that colonize plants, e.g. <b>Pseudomonas</b> putida, <b>Pseudomonas</b> fluorescens, and related pseudomonads which are common plant-associated bacteria found on leaves, roots, {{and in the}} soil, {{and the majority of}} their natural isolates form biofilms. Several nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes such as Rhizobium leguminosarum and Sinorhizobium meliloti form biofilms on legume roots and other inert surfaces.|$|E
25|$|One {{specific}} research {{topic of}} interest is how microbes such as <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated <b>Pseudomonas</b> binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia {{is to increase the}} amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility, they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft CLs. A recent study showed that <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermis adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel CLs than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa was 20 times stronger than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This might partly explain why <b>Pseudomonas</b> infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel CLs showed that worn silicone CLs were less prone to Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.|$|E
25|$|Cetrimide agar is {{used for}} the {{selective}} isolation of the Gram-negative bacterium <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa {{produces a}} host of virulence factors in concert, {{under the control of}} the quorum sensing system. Many studies show that inhibiting quorum sensing down-regulates the pathogenicity of <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa. However, it has been shown that rhamnolipids specifically are a key virulence determinant in <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa. A variety of virulence factors were analysed in <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa strains isolated from pneumonia patients. Rhamnolipids were found to be the only virulence factor that was associated with the deterioration of the patients to ventilator-associated pneumonia. Several other reports also support the role of rhamnolipids in lung infections. The effect of rhamnolipids in <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa virulence has been further noted in corneal infections (Alarcon et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2004). It has been shown that rhamnolipids are able to integrate into the epithelial cell membrane and disrupt tight-junctions. This study used reconstituted epithelial membranes and purified rhamnolipids to demonstrate this mechanism. In addition to inhibition and killing of epithelial cells, rhamnolipids are able to kill polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and macrophages and inhibit phagocytosis. In summary, rhamnolipids have been shown unequivocally to be a potent virulence factor in the human host, however, they are also produced outside of the host, for example in a soil environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} Streptomyces coelicolor, <b>Pseudomonas</b> citronellolis, and Nocardia spp. {{are capable}} of degrading vulcanized natural rubber.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa, a {{bacterium}} in immunocompromised individuals that infects the pulmonary and urinary tracts, blood and skin.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} few {{clinical}} studies to define the optimal therapy for infections caused by ESBL producing <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa strains.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic consortia degrade styrene, {{using it}} as a carbon source. <b>Pseudomonas</b> putida can convert styrene oil into various {{biodegradable}} polyhydroxyalkanoates.|$|E
25|$|Most well studied are the tailocins of <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa. They can {{be further}} {{subdivided}} into R-type and F-type pyocins.|$|E
25|$|One {{preliminary}} study showed coriander essential oil to inhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase, {{which can}} be found in <b>Pseudomonas</b> fluorescens, uses (4-hydroxyphenyl)ethan-1-one, NADPH, H+ and O2 to produce 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate, NADP+, and H2O.|$|E
25|$|In general, both {{anaerobic}} and aerobic unsaturated {{fatty acid}} synthesis will not occur within the same system, however <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa and Vibrio ABE-1 are exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{examples}} of negative cooperativity for the binding of transcription factors were also documented, {{as for the}} homodimeric repressor of the <b>Pseudomonas</b> putida cytochrome P450cam hydroxylase operon (n=0.56).|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudomonas</b> putida {{is capable}} of {{converting}} styrene oil into the biodegradable plastic PHA. This may someday be of use in the effective disposing of polystyrene foam.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria {{and fungi}} may form complex biofilms, {{protecting}} from immune cells and proteins; biofilms {{are present in}} the chronic <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|Moraxella catarrhalis, Brucella melitensis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are {{generally}} susceptible to doxycycline, while some Haemophilus spp., Mycoplasma hominis, and <b>Pseudomonas</b> aeruginosa have developed resistance to varying degrees.|$|E
