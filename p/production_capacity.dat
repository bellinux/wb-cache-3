This problem is addressed from an energy point of view, i. e. the deployment of technologies is seen as an energy investment under the constraint that an initial budget of non-renewable energy is provided.

Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's aluminum and 40percent of the aluminum produced in the United States. The commoditization of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80percent of its <b>production</b> <b>capacity.</b> By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's aluminum, and many smelters along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E

5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity.

In a state of unemployment and unused <b>production</b> <b>capacity,</b> one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment.
