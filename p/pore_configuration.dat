40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} investigation aimed at studying microstructural features and their consequences on water retention properties of statically compacted unsaturated silt. The {{evolution of the}} microstructure of the aggregate fabric induced by compaction is investigated by studying the pore size distribution changes under different initial conditions (void ratio and water content). The material used is low plasticity silt from Jossigny near Paris, France. A series of mercury intrusion porosimetry tests (MIP) were performed at different void ratios and water contents to provide microstructural information. The arrangement of aggregation/particles and pore network was also investigated with environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The MIP data {{were used to determine}} the water retention curve on drying for the specific <b>pore</b> network <b>configuration</b> induced on compaction. The MIP data were used to formulate and calibrate a multimodal water retention model for a specific <b>pore</b> network <b>configuration,</b> which is obtained by linear superposition of subcurves of a modified van Genuchten type. The study is then complemented with controlled suction oedometer tests on compacted samples to obtain the water retention properties of the material at two different void ratios. Finally, we compare the water retention properties obtained by the simulated progression of the different <b>pore</b> network <b>configurations</b> induced on the hydraulic path with the water retention properties under suction-controlled conditions.

40|$|The coupled {{mechanics}} of fluid-filled granular media controls {{the behavior of}} many natural systems such as saturated soils, fault gouge, and landslides. The grain motion and the fluid pressure influence each other: It is well established that when the fluid pressure rises, the shear resistance of fluid-filled granular systems decreases, {{and as a result}} catastrophic events such as soil liquefaction, earthquakes, and accelerating landslides may be triggered. Alternatively, when the pore pressure drops, the shear resistance of these systems increases. Despite the great importance of the coupled {{mechanics of}} grains-fluid systems, the basic physics that controls this coupling is far from understood. We developed a new multi-scaled model based on the discrete element method, coupled with a continuum model of fluid pressure, to explore this dynamical system.

Experimental studies of rarefied flows under conditions of a large pressure gradient show flows in the continuum regime to be responsible for the largest portion of the pressure drop between source and sink for one dimensional flow, provided the entrance Knudsen number is sufficiently small. The concept of local similarity leading to a universal nondimensional function of Knudsen number was shown to have approximate validity; flows in all regimes may be described in terms of an area fraction and a single length parameter. Synthetic porous media prepared from glass beads exhibited flow behavior similar in many regards to that of a natural sandstone; studies using artificial stones with known <b>pore</b> <b>configurations</b> may lead to new insight concerning the structure of natural materials.

In addition, we compared two procedures for evaluating water-conducting macroporosities, and evaluated the efficiency of the pedotransfer function ROSETTA in estimating the parameters of the van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) model in these soils. Soil <b>pore</b> <b>configuration</b> and hydraulic properties were not stable and changed according to the crop sequence and the last crop grown in both sites. For both sites, saturated hydraulic conductivity, K 0, water-conducting macroporosity, &# 949;ma, and flow-weighted mean pore radius, R 0 ma, increased from the 1 st to the 2 nd year of the crop sequence, and this was attributed to the creation of water-conducting macropores by the maize roots. The VGM model adequately described the water retention curve (WRC) for these soils, but not the hydraulic conductivity (K) vs tension (h) curve. The ROSETTA function failed in the estimation of these parameters. In summary, mean values of K 0 ranged from 0. 74 to 3. 88 cm h- 1.

40|$|Most current {{commercial}} automated fingerprint-authentication {{systems on}} the market {{are based on the}} extraction of the fingerprint minutiae, and on medium resolution (500 dpi) scanners. Sensor manufacturers tend to reduce the sensing area in order to adapt it to low-power mobile hand-held communication systems and to lower the cost of their devices. An interesting alternative is designing a novel fingerprintauthentication system capable of dealing with an image from a small, high resolution (1000 dpi) sensor area based on combined level 2 (minutiae) and level 3 (sweat pores) feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a new strategy and implementation of a series of techniques for automatic level 2 and level 3 feature extraction in fragmentary fingerprint comparison.

For this purpose a recently described model of the neural membrane [Wooldridge, D. E. (1975) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72, 3468 - 3471] is extended.

Characterization of the samples included measurement of green density, green and nitrided pore structure, weight gain during nitridation, final density, microstructure, toughness, and flexural strength. It was found that a more uniform pore structure existed in the green gelcast samples. It is believed that this <b>pore</b> <b>configuration</b> aided in nitridation, and manifested itself in a more uniform final microstructure. In addition, improved mechanical properties were achieved in the gelcast samples. This improvement can be attributed to green microstructure homogeneity.

Based on the analysis of a single migrating boundary facet dragging a pore, evolution equations for the grain size and the porosity are suggested for {{the final stage of}} sintering. It turns out that three-dimensional pores on two-grain junctions have an only moderate effect on the rate of grain coarsening: pores with a high mobility follow the migrating grain boundary easily, while those with a low mobility detach from the boundary. It is also shown that a two-dimensional pore does not detach and can therefore reduce the coarsening rate to very low values if the pore mobility is low.

Though our boundary condition is much simpler in its implementation, all investigated schemes show proper droplet spreading behaviour following the Cox-Voinov law. Still, numerical artefacts like spurious velocities or chequer board effects in the pressure field can be significantly reduced by the use of a two-relaxation-time (TRT) scheme, likewise recent studies by the Yeomans group. The outstanding property of our implementation is the presence of an (artificial) thin wetting layer, which influences the relation between the saturation (S-w) and capillary pressure p(cap) in channels with irregular polygonal cross section. The p(cap) (S-w) relation from our simulation follows the shifted-Young-Laplace (sYL) law, showing that the physics of this wetting layer is similar to precursor films due to Van der Waals forces.

40|$|Background: Titanium {{implants}} {{have been}} widely used clinically for various types of bone-anchored reconstructions. A thin native oxide film, naturally formed on titanium implants contacts with bone tissue and has been considered to be of great importance for successful osseointegration. However, the precise role of surface oxide properties in the osseointegration process is not known in detail. Aims and Hypothesis: The overall aims of this thesis were (i) to develop anodic oxidation methods of titanium implants (paper 1), (ii) to characterize the surface properties of native and anodic oxides (paper 2) and (iii) to investigate if and which surface oxide properties will influence the bone tissue response. In vivo animal studies (papers 3 - 6) in the present thesis hypothesized that osseointegration would be reinforced by mechanical interlocking and chemical bonding between bone and implant surface. Mechanical interlocking is assumed {{to be associated with the}} surface roughness/ <b>pore</b> <b>configurations,</b> while chemical bonding is dependent on surface chemistry. Materials and Methods: Machined-turned commercially pure (c. p) titanium implants were used for controls. Test implants were prepared by electrochemical anodic oxidation at the galvanostatic mode in various electrolytes. We tested implants with enhanced oxide films achieved by micro arc oxidation (MAO) process in acetic acid as electrolyte. Other investigated electrolytes were sulphuric acid (S implants), phosphoric acid (P implants) and a calcium containing mixed electrolyte system (Ca implants). The surface oxide properties were analyzed in terms of the oxide thickness, chemical composition, <b>pore</b> <b>configurations</b> (<b>pore</b> size, pore size distribution, porosity), crystal structure and surface roughness by using different analytical techniques including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), thin-film X-ray diffractometry (TF-XRD), Raman spectroscopy and TopScan 3 D®. Implants (n = 176) were inserted in the femur and tibia of mature New Zealand white rabbits (n = 22). The follow up time was 6 weeks. Bone tissue responses were evaluated with resonance frequency analysis (RFA), removal torque test (RTQ), qualitative histology, histomorphometrical quantifications and enzyme histochemistry of alkaline (ALP) and acidic phosphatase (ACP). Results: The electrochemical oxide growth behaviour was greatly dependent on the nature of the electrolytes employed, the current density, the electrolyte concentration, the electrolyte temperature, the agitation speed and the chemical composition of the titanium electrode. The MAO method at galvanostatic mode demonstrated systemic changes of surface oxide properties of titanium implants by controlling the mentioned electrochemical parameters. This provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of such oxide properties on the bone tissue response. Oxidized, microporous implants having oxide thicknesses of about 600, 800 and 1000 nm demonstrated significantly stronger bone responses as compared to nonporous implants with oxide thicknesses of 17 and 200 nm. Chemically modified S and P implants demonstrated significantly improved bone responses compared to controls. Calcium deposited, oxidized titanium implants showed the strongest bone responses of all tested implantsConclusions: Our findings indicated that osseointegration occurred from a combination of mechanical interlocking and biochemical bonding at least with respect to two tested implants, namely S and P implants.

30|$|In summary, a resist-free nonlithographic {{method for}} the {{fabrication}} of ordered silicon nanohole arrays {{by a combination}} of localized metal deposition and the subsequent metal-assisted chemical etching was demonstrated. The porous alumina formed directly on the Si substrate served as a mask for localized metal deposition and controlled the position and size of noble metals, which were deposited only in the exposed area at the alumina mask/silicon interface. After metal deposition, the pattern transfer of the self-ordered <b>pore</b> <b>configuration</b> of porous alumina into silicon was examined by metal-assisted chemical etching. In brief, the present process consists of two independent processes: (1) noble metal nanodot arrays are obtained by displacement plating using an alumina mask in HF solution containing the desired metal ion and (2) straight silicon nanohole arrays are formed by the site-selective etching of silicon using the deposited noble metal as the catalyst in a solution of HF and H 2 O 2. The dimensions of the resultant nanohole pattern can be controlled by changing the anodization conditions of aluminum for forming an alumina mask, which include electrolyte type and anodization voltage, and the chemical etching conditions such as catalyst type, catalyst amount, etchant concentration, and etching time. The periodicity of silicon hole arrays, which was basically determined by the pore interval of the upper anodic porous alumina, could be adjusted to 60 and 100 nm, corresponding to formation voltages of 25 and 40 V, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Hysteresis {{loops and}} {{scanning}} curves for argon adsorbed in sequential mesopore arrays {{consisting of two}} cavities and three necks have been studied using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation. We examined four different <b>pore</b> <b>configurations</b> and find {{that there are two}} patterns for scanning: (i) Type S 1, the scanning curve crosses the hysteresis loop from one boundary to the opposite boundary with the possibility that condensation/evaporation occurs within the hysteresis loop; and (ii) Type S 2, the scanning curve leaves one boundary and then returns to the same boundary. The first array has three necks with sizes that are smaller than the critical width (which demarcates cavitation from pore blocking as the mechanism for evaporation from a cavity). The second, third, and fourth arrays are the same as the first with the exception that one neck is larger than the critical width. This large neck connects the large cavity to the gas surroundings in array 2, connects the two cavities in array 3, and connects the small cavity to the gas surroundings in array 4. The mechanism of evaporation from the arrays 1 and 3 is found to be cavitation, they have the same type of hysteresis loop (H 2 a), but their descending scanning curves (DSC) are different. The DSC of array 1 scans across the hysteresis loop (Type S 1), while that of array 3 is of Type S 2. In arrays 2 and 4, the evaporation follows a sequence of pore blocking and cavitation from the two cavities; a double loop of Type H 2 a. Although these two arrays have the same type of hysteresis loop, their scanning curves are different. Array 2 has Type S 1 scanning with a subloop within the primary hysteresis loop, while array 4 has Type S 2 scanning curve with a subloop...|$|R

To properly describe its evolving nature, a multimodal retention model is proposed by considering a linear superposition of two subcurves of the Van Genuchten type. The model is constructed based on PSDs obtained with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) data at specified initial state, and thus, is representative of this initial <b>pore</b> network <b>configuration.</b> Based on the WRC model proposed above, the evolution of parameter ¿ will be evaluated based on the microstructural evolution of the pore network.

40|$|International audienceThe coupled {{mechanics}} of fluid-filled granular media controls {{the behavior of}} many natural systems such as saturated soils, fault gouge, and landslides. The grain motion and the fluid pressure influence each other: It is well established that when the fluid pressure rises, the shear resistance of fluid-filled granular systems decreases, {{and as a result}} catastrophic events such as soil liquefaction, earthquakes, and accelerating landslides may be triggered. Alternatively, when the pore pressure drops, the shear resistance of these systems increases. Despite the great importance of the coupled {{mechanics of}} grains-fluid systems, the basic physics that controls this coupling is far from understood. We developed a new multi-scaled model based on the discrete element method, coupled with a continuum model of fluid pressure, to explore this dynamical system. The model was shown recently to capture essential feedbacks between porosity changes arising from rearrangement of grains, and local pressure variations due to changing <b>pore</b> <b>configurations.</b> We report here new results from numerical experiments of a continuously shearing layer of circular two-dimensional grains, trapped between two parallel rough boundaries. The experiments use a fixed confining stress on the boundary walls, and a constant velocity applied to one of the boundaries, as if this system was the interior of a sliding geological fault filled with 'fault gouge'. In addition, we control the layer permeability and the drainage boundary conditions. This paper presents modeling results showing that the localization of shear (into a narrow shear band within the shearing layer) is strongly affected by the presence of fluids. While in dry granular layers there is no preferred position for the onset of localization, drained systems tend to localize shear on their boundary. We propose a scaling argument to describe the pressure deviations in a shear band, and use that to predict the allowable positions of shear localizations {{as a function of the}} fault and gouge properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{breathing}} {{behavior of}} metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) {{is an exciting}} new phenomenon in which a framework significantly changes unit cell shape depending on adsorbent, change in pressure, or temperature. There are few force fields capable of computationally describing MOF breathing behavior, and they exist only for MIL- 53. In this study, fully flexible force fields were created for the MOF "DMOF- 1 " (Zn₂(BDC) ₂(DABCO)), which is known to breathe {{with the addition of}} benzene and isopropyl alcohol, and upon post-synthetic modification with amines. Over the course of the study, three flexible force fields were examined: a non-bonded force field, a restrained force field, and a fully-bonded force field. The non-bonded and restrained force fields represented the Zn-ligand bonds by electrostatic interactions, and did not reasonably simulate the DMOF- 1 breathing behavior. The fully-bonded force field explicitly described the Zn-ligand interactions and was found to quantitatively reproduce experimental data of DMOF- 1 and of DMOF- 1 with benzene, and qualitatively reproduce DMOF- 1 with isopropyl alcohol. The aminated DMOF- 1 series DMOF- 1 -AM 1 to DMOF- 1 -AM 4 was not as successfully modeled, however. The fully-bonded force field incorrectly predicted the DMOF- 1 -AM 1 and DMOF- 1 -AM 2 structures to be in a large <b>pore</b> <b>configuration.</b> This highlights a potential issue with force field transferability between different breathing systems for DMOF- 1, a current problem with flexible MOF force fields. At present, {{it is not clear whether}} the difficulties in transferability to the aminated framework are due to insufficient representation of to the amine chains or a more fundamental problem describing the framework flexibilit...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{microstructure}} of cement paste {{is the basis}} of a study towards properties and behaviour of cementi¬tious materials. It is attractive exploit¬ing modern computer facilities for this purpose, favourably competing with time-consuming and laborious experimental approaches. This study aims at bringing mate¬rial studies into virtual reality through a compre¬hensive computa¬tional frame-work that is composed of three parts as de¬scribed below. The first part deals with generating virtual representations of hardening cement composites at micro-scale, starting with producing a paste of randomly packed cement grains at the fresh state. A DEM-based dynamic packing process is used for this purpose to obtain, not only paste with high density but also that with a wide particle size range. The next stage involves simulation of {{the microstructure}} during hydration, based on an improved version of the well-known vector approach. The proposed model denoted ‘eXtended Integrated Particle Kinetics Method’ (XIPKM) includes the following improvements: a multi-com¬ponent particle model to take major cement compounds and the pozzolan into account, a numerical technique to capture the complex contact between expanding particles (a crucial issue in vector approaches), and finally a concept to avoid the extreme computational effort in generating a very large amount of fine particles. Furthermore, a numerical procedure is proposed to obtain the basic penetration rates of different minerals instead of using a laborious calibration process commonly used in vector approaches. In the second part, two computational porosimetry methods to explore the pore network characteristics are developed. The first method denoted ‘Random Node Structuring’ (RaNoS) charac¬terises the pore space, based on analysing the configuration of a system of random points dispersed in the pore space. These random points are further employed, together with an enhanced version (for a more efficient size assessment of irregular pores) of the well-known stereological technique – star volume measure (SVM), to estimate the pore size distribution. The second porosimetry method named ‘Double-Random Multiple Tree Structuring’ (DRaMuTS) is an enhanced version of RaNoS, whereby the topology of the pore structure is further efficiently explored by a system of concurrent virtual trees growing and branching randomly in pore space, configured by a robotics-inspired path planning algorithm. Based on topological information attained by the tree systems, the pore space is then converted into a cylindrical tube network for directly estimating permeability. Based on the <b>pore</b> <b>configuration</b> obtained by the porosimetry methods, 2 D representative samples to study the tensile damage response of porous materials in bulk as well as interfacial transition zone (ITZ) are proposed, whereby extremely demanding 3 D FEM modelling is dis¬missed but the impact of the 3 D pore space is nevertheless taken into account. In the final part, several tests are carried out on cement pastes with/without blended pozzolanic admixtures, i. e. rice husk ash (RHA) by applying the presented methodologies, aiming at assessment of the impact of different design parameters (e. g., w/c, cement fineness and RHA blending percentage) on pore characteristics, permeability and tensile damage behaviour. The relations between the pore structural features are discussed. Furthermore, the minimum size for exist¬ence of a representative volume element (RVE) for various pore characteristics as well as tensile damage response is also studied. RHA-blending is shown to improve transport-based capacities but causes a reduction in Young’s modulus, in tensile strength and ductility. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} harvest and convert solar energy has been {{associated}} with the evolution of human civilization. The increasing consumption of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution, however, has brought to concerns in ecological deterioration and depletion of the fossil fuels. Facing these challenges, humankind is forced to seek for clean, sustainable and renewable energy resources, such as biofuels, hydraulic power, wind power, geothermal energy and other kinds of alternative energies. However, most alternative energy sources, generally in the form of electrical energy, could not be made available on a continuous basis. It is, therefore, essential to store such energy into chemical energy, which are portable and various applications. In this context, electrochemical energy-storage devices hold great promises towards this goal. The most common electrochemical energy-storage devices are electrochemical capacitors (ECs, also called supercapacitors) and batteries. In comparison to batteries, ECs posses high power density, high efficiency, long cycling life and low cost. ECs commonly utilize carbon as both (symmetric) or one of the electrodes (asymmetric), of which their performance is generally limited by the capacitance of the carbon electrodes. Therefore, developing better carbon materials with high energy density has been emerging as one the most essential challenges in the field. The primary objective of this dissertation is to design and synthesize functional carbon materials with high energy density at both aqueous and organic electrolyte systems. The energy density (E) of ECs are governed by E = CV 2 / 2, where C is the total capacitance and V is the voltage of the devices. Carbon electrodes with high capacitance and high working voltage should lead to high energy density. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a new class of nanoporous carbons were synthesized for symmetric supercapacitors using aqueous Li 2 SO 4 as the electrolyte. A unique precursor was adopted to create uniformly distributed nanopores with large surface area, leading to high-performance electrodes with high capacitance, excellent rate performance and stable cycling, even under a high working voltage of 1. 6 V. The second part of this dissertation work further improved the capacitance of the carbon electrodes by fluorine doping. This doping process enhances the affinity of the carbon surface with organic electrolytes, leading to further improved capacitance and energy density. In the third part, carbon materials were synthesized with high surface area, capacitance and working voltage of 4 V in organic electrolyte, leading to the construction of prototyped devices with energy density comparable to those of the current lead-acid batteries. Besides the abovementioned research, hierarchical graphitic carbons were also explored for lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors. Overall, through rational design of carbons with optimized <b>pore</b> <b>configuration</b> and surface chemistry, carbon electrodes with improved energy density and rate performance were improved significantly. Collectively, this thesis work systematically unveils simple yet effective strategies to achieve high performance carbon-based supercapacitors with high power density and high energy density, including the following aspects: 1) 	Constructed electrodes with high capacitance through building favorable ion/electron transportation pathways, tuning pore structure and pore size. 2) 	Improved the capacitance through enhancing the affinity between the carbon electrodes and electrolytes by doping the carbons with heteroatoms. 3) 	Explored and understand the roles of heteroatom doping in the capacitive behavior by both experimental measurement and computational modeling. 4) 	Improved energy density of carbon electrodes by enlarging their working voltage in aqueous and organic electrolyte. 5) 	Scalable and effective production of hierarchically porous graphite particles through aerosol process for use as the anode materials of lithium ion batteries. These strategies can be extended as a general design platform for other high-performance energy storage materials such as fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries...|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of pore space geometry on solute transport in porous media is investigated performing computational fluid dynamics pore-scale simulations of fluid flow and solute transport. The three-dimensional periodic domains are obtained from three different <b>pore</b> structure <b>configurations,</b> namely, face-centered-cubic (fcc), body-centered-cubic (bcc), and sphere-in-cube (sic) arrangements of spherical grains. Although transport simulations are performed with media having the same grain size and the same porosity (in fcc and bcc configurations), the resulting breakthrough curves present noteworthy differences, such as enhanced tailing. The cause of such differences is ascribed {{to the presence of}} recirculation zones, even at low Reynolds numbers. Various methods to readily identify recirculation zones and quantify their magnitude using pore-scale data are proposed. The information gained from this analysis is then used to define macroscale models able to provide an appropriate description of the observed anomalous transport. A mass transfer model is applied to estimate relevant macroscale parameters (hydrodynamic dispersion above all) and their spatial variation in the medium; a functional relation describing the spatial variation of such macroscale parameters is then proposed...|$|R

In addition, shape recovery tests showed a good recovery of the permanent shape for both scaffold configurations. When cells were seeded onto the scaffolds in the temporary shape and the permanent shape was recovered, cells were significantly more elongated after shape recovery. Thus, the mechanical stimulus imparted by shape recovery is able to influence the shape of cells and nuclei.
