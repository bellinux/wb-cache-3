Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner with the Commissioner having little time to learn to assert control over their staff.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overthrow of Árbenz was a fait accompli. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E

5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to {{the maker of}} these riddles is {{impossible}} to say. In Hávamál 160 {{it is said that}} the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling's doors, which (in {{view of the fact that}} Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in Vafþrúðnismál 25) may mean that he gave warning to his <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sun was coming up, and they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then virtually mean 'at sunrise.'

5|$|In 1967, Brooke-Little was {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} Richmond Herald. On 7 July 1980, after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter Verco as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the Trent, as well as in Northern Ireland. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry – he remained ex officio an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until such time as the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.|$|E
5|$|When Ponce de León {{arrived in}} Puerto Rico, {{he was well}} {{received}} by the Cacique (Tribal chief) Agüeybaná (The Great Sun), chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, {{some of the first}} colonists were farmers and miners in search of gold. In 1508, Ponce de León became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of Caparra between the modern-day cities of Bayamón and San Juan. After being named Governor, de León and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos {{died as a result of}} cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, upon Agüeybaná's death, his brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), and a group of Tainos led Diego Salcedo, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led his people in the Taino rebellion of 1511, the first rebellion in the island against the better armed Spanish forces. Guarionex, cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day Aguada) and killed eighty of its inhabitants. Cacique Guarionex died during the attack which was considered a Taino victory.|$|E

Prisoners are still recognized as citizens and retain some rights. Their incarceration terms are typically not for life, and family visits are possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} Tet in early 1968 {{as a whole}} were also {{remarkable}} in shifting public opinion regarding the war. U.S. military officials had previously reported that counter-insurgency in South Vietnam was being prosecuted successfully. While the Tet Offensive provided the U.S. and allied militaries with a great victory in that the Vietcong was finally brought into open battle and destroyed as a fighting force, the American media, including respected figures such as Walter Cronkite, interpreted such events as {{the attack on the}} American embassy in Saigon as an indicator of U.S. military weakness. The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the American <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> military had been untruthful to them about the success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the ability to achieve a meaningful military solution in Vietnam.|$|E
