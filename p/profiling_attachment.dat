40|$|International audienceWhile the {{relationships}} between hosts and guests are still frequently thought of {{in terms of a}} conflicting opposition between two groups, this article intends to question the co-presence and the sharing of space at work in heritagized and touristified cities. Based on a fieldwork conducted in Sarlat, a city with a very pronouced seasonality in tourism, we argue that the willingness to share the space, even though it is linked to the status of people in relation to the place (tourists / inhabitants), also depends on other factors (socio-economic <b>profiles,</b> <b>attachment</b> to place, territorial anchor, etc.). In this sense, our hypothesis is that the concepts of social and cultural capital, originally developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, associated to the concept of indigenous capital proposed by Jean-Noël Retière, which reintegrates the spatial dimension {{at the heart of the}} concept of capital, can help to refine the understanding of the dynamics and socio-spatial stakes that come into play in touristified cities. We postulate that the input brought by those various types of capitals activates an interesting dialogue between tourism studies and social geography by apprehending the spatial dimension of social reality in a tourism context...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{enrichment}} {{is currently}} in high demand in medical engineering. We have reported that non-blood cells can attach to a blood-compatible poly(2 -methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) substrate through integrin-dependent and integrin-independent mechanisms because the PMEA substrate suppresses protein adsorption. Therefore, we assumed that PMEA analogous polymers can change the contribution of integrin to cell attachment through the regulation of protein adsorption. In the present study, we investigated protein adsorption, cell <b>attachment</b> <b>profiles,</b> and <b>attachment</b> mechanisms on PMEA analogous polymer substrates. Additionally, we demonstrated the possibility of attachment-based cell enrichment on PMEA analogous polymer substrates. HT- 1080 and MDA-MB- 231 cells started to attach to poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) and poly(tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate) (PTHFA), on which proteins could adsorb well, within 1 h. HepG 2 cells started to attach after 1 h. HT- 1080, MDA-MB- 231, and HepG 2 cells started to attach within 30 min to PMEA, poly(2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethyl acrylate-co-butyl acrylate) (30 : 70 mol%, PMe 2 A) and poly(2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethoxy ethyl acrylate-co-butyl acrylate) (30 : 70 mol%, PMe 3 A), which suppress protein adsorption.

40|$|Introduction: {{this single}} case study aims to {{consider}} psychological features as fundamental elements {{to be assessed}} {{in the evaluation of}} “pseudo” dermatological disorders. Case description: the case illustrates a rare skin disease, which occurs in comorbidity with Somatic Symptom Disorders in a young patient, aged 15. It was administered a battery of tools to investigate the personality <b>profile,</b> Child <b>Attachment</b> Interview (CAI), Separation Anxiety Test (SAT), Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ-CA), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC-A), and WISC-IV. Comment: somatization, defined as the “conversion” of psychological conflicts and overwhelming emotions into more acceptable physical symptoms, is encountered among a wide range of syndromes in dermatology. These syndromes include medically unexplained cutaneous sensory symptoms, which represent the sensory component of a traumatic experience, and may be associated to dermatological manifestations. This case was carried out to demonstrate that the psychological side of this clinical condition has been poorly investigated and further evaluations are required. The clinical implications for paediatric care are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Attachment {{theory is}} an {{encompassing}} theory for understanding human reactions to life stressors, such as loss and separation, and interpersonal problems are common reasons for seeking psychotherapy. Psychotherapy {{may be an}} opportunity to revise insecure attachment and handle interpersonal problems. This study examined attachment styles and interpersonal problems in a clinical sample of psychotherapy patients (n = 168) {{at the start of}} psychotherapy. The main aim was to study how self-reported attachment styles, measured by the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), correlated with interpersonal problems measured using the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP). Avoidant-related and anxious-related attachment scales correlated positively to the total IIP scores. Inconsistent with findings in non-clinical samples, specific interpersonal problems in the dominant and affiliative parts of the IIP correlated positively to both the anxious-related and the avoidant-related attachment scales. The findings imply that a challenge for the therapist at the start of psychotherapy is to balance providing security with encouraging exploration of feelings, thoughts, and behaviour in the patient’s interpersonal problems in current relationships. Exploring individual <b>profiles</b> of <b>attachment</b> styles helps to clarify motives in expressed interpersonal problems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the dynamics, both spatio-temporal and heat release, of harmonically excited non-premixed flames. Analytical, numerical, computational, and, experimental analyses were performed, along with combined analyses methods, to study excitation {{and evolution of}} wrinkles on the flame front. Explicit expressions for the dynamics were developed. Wrinkle convection at the mean axial flow speed, and wrinkle dissipation and dispersion were analytically identified in the Pe [...] >∞ and Pe>> 1 limits, respectively. Altered inlet mixture fraction <b>profiles</b> and <b>attachment</b> point dynamics were shown to accompany axial diffusion effects. Some physical effects such as axial diffusion, forcing configuration, and anisotropic diffusion altered the wrinkle interference pattern/waveform characteristics, while others, such as confinement, dimensionality, and differential diffusion, altered the dynamics through modifying the mean flame location. Comparisons to established premixed flame dynamics were made throughout. Despite having similar space-time dynamics, the heat release dynamics of the two differed greatly, having different dominant contributions, as well as different asymptotic trends. Experimental results obtained validated previous findings as well as enabled advanced model development, revealing the importance of accurate mixture fraction field capture, particularly in the near burner exit region. Findings shed light onto model and predictive improvements for future works. Ph. D...|$|R

SAMs were formed on gold-coated glass slides from solutions containing mixtures of methyl- and carboxylic acid-terminated alkane-thiols and mixtures of methyl- and hydroxyl-terminated alkanethiols. C. marina attached in increasing num-bers to SAMs with decreasing advancing water contact angles (AW), in accordance with equation-of-state models of colloidal attachment.

All three human KT proteins are necessary for correct binding of spindle checkpoint proteins to KTs. The differing functions and KT-binding properties of Nnf 1 R, Mcm 21 R and Nuf 2 R suggest that, like their yeast counterparts, the proteins act independent of each other in KT assembly, but that their combined activities are required for checkpoint signaling...|$|R

40|$|Fibromyalgia (FM) is {{a chronic}} pain {{syndrome}} of unknown etiology. It was previously suggested {{that patients with}} fibromyalgia were, in early life, often subjected to either psychological or physiological trauma. It is, in general, known that early life experiences and attachment to primary caregivers can influence physiological function in adult life, especially those functions related to stress vulnerability. Many studies have been performed on fibromyalgia patients {{but most of them}} investigated either psychological or physiological aspects. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the psychological <b>profile</b> (<b>attachment</b> style, preferred way of thinking as well as prevalence of depression and anxiety) and physiological aspects (autonomic nervous system function and cortisol levels) simultaneously in an attempt to see whether a link exists between the two aspects and whether a specific psychoneurological profile could be discerned for fibromyalgia patients. Sixteen patients (14 females, 2 males) with fibromyalgia, and 15 age- and sex-matched controls (13 females, 2 males) were studied. Patients were diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR, 1990) criteria for fibromyalgia. The Patient Health Questionnaire gathered information on the patient’s past health problems, operations, accidents and the prevalence of traumatic events. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and Review of Current Symptoms Questionnaire were completed to assess the severity of the disorder. The Experiences in Close Relationships – Revised Questionnaire determined attachment styles. Hemisphere dominance (preferred way of thinking) was evaluated by the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI), heart rate variability (HRV) by recording R-R intervals and calculating time and frequency domain parameters and salivary cortisol levels by ELISA. Significant differences were seen between patients and controls for cortisol levels; the total number of symptoms; the number of adverse events in lifetime; anxiety and avoidance subscales of the ECR-R; FIQ total scores; and scores for scales within the FIQ. R-R spectral analysis revealed distinct lowered overall HRV in patients. An orthostatic test revealed a weakened shift towards sympathetic dominance upon standing. During a psychological stressor (filling out the ECR-R), the patients’ autonomic nervous system failed to respond with lower HRV as with the controls. As far as the hemispheric dominance of the patients was concerned, the majority appeared to be right-brain orientated with thinking styles preferences strongly influenced by limbic functions. Preference for thinking styles influenced by right limbic structures increased during stress. A link existed between anxiety and depression and the severity of the fibromyalgia symptoms. The results of individual psychological and physiological parameters found in this study are largely in concordance of that of other studies. Significant differences exist between the psychoneurological variables of fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls: The patient group in this study were characterised by a high prevalence adverse events, insecure attachment styles, high emotionality in the absence of rationality, multiple somatic symptoms, and altered stress-axes activity reflected in low HRV, an inability to mount an appropriate sympathetic response to acute stressors and elevated baseline cortisol levels. It can be concluded that fibromyalgia patients in the present study presented with a distinct psychoneurological profile. Dissertation (MSc (Physiology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{study the}} {{structure}} of consumer psychological attachment {{in the context of}} relationship marketing. ^ I propose that consumer psychological attachment has four specific dimensions: utilitarian attachment, affective attachment, symbolic attachment, and obligatory attachment. Together, these four dimensions of psychological attachment determine the overall strength {{of the relationship between the}} customer and the firm. I suggest that these different dimensions of psychological attachment may coexist within the same individual for a particular customer-firm relationship and may be found to varying degrees across different customer-firm relationships. Further, I argue how consumer psychological <b>attachment</b> <b>profiles</b> can vary systematically both across different relationship marketing customer segments and across different product and service categories. ^ I explore and test my conceptual framework in two essays. In Essay 1, I synthesize from multiple literatures a model of {{the structure of}} consumer psychological attachment. I then test this model in an experiment with two replicate product categories. Two firm-level and two situational variables are selected and manipulated in an experiment such that each one of them hypothetically should have a main-effect impact on primarily one dimension of psychological attachment and a lesser impact on the others. This approach permits me to predict and test different consequences for these independent variables on different dimensions of psychological attachment, thus enabling me to validate the latter 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization within a nomological network of constructs. The results support my prediction that consumer psychological attachment has four dimensions and that these dimensions are differentially impacted by specific firm-level and situational variables. ^ Essay 2 further extends our understanding of consumer psychological attachment. I posit a typology of customer segments relevant to relationship marketing using the following three dimensions: relationship strength, behavioral loyalty, and number of choice alternatives. I then use survey research to investigate how psychological <b>attachment</b> <b>profiles</b> vary across six customer segments and ten product/service categories. The results suggest that the various consumer psychological attachment dimensions play significantly different roles in distinguishing specific market segments (e. g., committed customers from transactional customers). ^ Finally, across both essays, I develop, refine, and validate multi-item scales for measuring the four dimensions of consumer psychological attachment. ...|$|R

In total, the present study examines 13 studies drawn from these three areas, and includes 11 quantitative and 2 mixed method studies. These studies were chosen for their attention to the middle age child in foster care who was demonstrating problematic sexual behaviour. Due to the lack of attachment studies on fostered middle age children, two infant studies were included with the rationale that middle age children and foster parents engage in a similar attachment process and infant studies would provide direction and context for future studies with older children. In the area of childhood sexuality, clinical samples were also included as they contained large numbers of children who had experienced sexual abuse or who had contact with child protection agencies even if they did not reside in foster care. Studies were examined along dimensions of sample, methods and findings. The results of this inquiry are then discussed, weaving together the three areas of study to answer two research questions: Is there a relationship between problematic childhood sexual behaviour {{and the development of a}} successful attachment relationship with a foster parent? And secondly, is there a particular foster parent <b>attachment</b> <b>profile</b> that promotes <b>attachment</b> security with children who are in care?Studies reviewed support the hypothesis that problematic childhood sexual behaviour presents challenges to foster parents significant enough to seriously impair the development of a secure attachment and that the foster parent's attachment state of mind will be an important factor in success. Results of the analysis of these questions contribute to an emerging hypothesis that the human sexual system may be intricately woven together with the attachment system, making an attachment analysis of problematic sexual behaviour in children particular relevant. A concluding discussion examines clinical issues which may be targets of intervention and the necessity of future research in this area is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: There {{is a wide}} {{literature}} suggesting abnormal mother-daughter {{and familial}} attachment patterns in individuals with eating disorders. We surmised that this insecurity would extend to adult attachment relationships. Methods: The Reciprocal Attachment Questionnaire (RAQ) was administered to all inpatients and outpatients at a tertiary referral eating disorders unit over a given period of time, and to controls. The RAQ operationalizes the key components of reciprocal attachment, and is in close theoretical agreement with the Adult Attachment Interview. Results: Patients {{scored significantly higher than}} controls on most scales of the RAQ, most notably on Compulsive Care-Seeking and Compulsive Self-Reliance. We did not find any associations between eating disorder diagnoses and particular <b>attachment</b> <b>profiles.</b> Conclusions: A basic “pull-push” dilemma was demonstrated in the reciprocal attachment relationships of eating-disordered subjects. This dilemma bedevils attempts at therapy and may illuminate the strong feelings elicited by these patients in their therapists. The association of attachment style with particular disorder subgroup diagnoses is complicated. Childhood attachment insecurity may provide a vulnerability whose symptomatic manifestation is colored by later events...|$|R

In this study, PAA with tunable pore sizes (25 nm,  50 nm, and  75  nm) were fabricated by a two-step anodizing procedure in oxalic acid. The surface morphology and elemental composition of PAA were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The nanopore arrays on all of the PAA samples were highly regular. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggested that the chemistry of PAA and flat aluminum surfaces were similar. However, contact angles were significantly greater on all of the PAA compared to flat aluminum substrates, which consequently altered protein adsorption <b>profiles.</b> The <b>attachment</b> and proliferation of preosteoblasts were determined for up to  7  days in culture using field emission scanning electron microscopy and a Cell Counting Kit- 8. Results showed that nanoporous surfaces did not enhance initial preosteoblast attachment, whereas preosteoblast proliferation dramatically increased when the PAA pore size was either  50 nm or  75  nm compared to all other samples (P< 0. 05). Thus, this study showed that one can alter surface energy of aluminum by modifying surface nano-roughness alone (and not changing chemistry) through an anodization process to improve osteoblast density, and, thus, should be further studied as a bioactive interface for orthopedic applications.

40|$|A Research Report {{submitted}} to the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfillment of {{the requirements of the}} PhD degree. Johannesburg 2014 The current study investigates the relationship between stressful life events, personality <b>profile,</b> dissociative experiences, <b>attachment</b> styles and the types of crimes committed among 100 mentally ill offenders and 100 criminal offenders in the South African context. It is motivated by {{the fact that there are}} no studies in South Africa comparing forensic patients and criminal offenders and the various factors that may lead to criminal behaviour, and how these may present in terms of the type and/or nature of offences committed. Instead, there is a growing emphasis on observation of patients and assessments for fitness and competence to stand trial with very little focus on understanding the mentally ill offenders and criminal offenders. This study aims to improve the understanding and knowledge with regards to the presentation of each of these groups under study and also to investigate possible differences in the types of crimes committed. It aims to assess possible correlations between the variables of the study (stressful life events, personality <b>profiles,</b> dissociative experiences, <b>attachment</b> styles and the types of crimes). It further aims to inform future treatment interventions in the forensic setting and to offer possible prevention models for the community setting. The study hypothesises that there are no differences between the mentally ill offenders and criminal offenders with regards to stressful life events, personality <b>profile,</b> dissociative experiences, <b>attachment</b> styles and the types of crimes committed. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Committee for Research on Human Subjects of the University of Witwatersrand‟s medical school. The sample size of this study consists of 200 participants (156 males and 54 females). Convenience sampling was used, where 100 mentally ill offenders admitted at the Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital and 100 criminal offenders, incarcerated at the Johannesburg Correctional Services in the Johannesburg area at the time of data collection, were involved in the study. The mentally ill offenders from Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital were interviewed at the hospital and the criminal offenders from Correctional Services were interviewed in their respective prisons without the presence of a prison guard. Participants‟ ages ranged from 18 years to 60 years. Those people who were not willing to participate were not included in the study. The Biographical details questionnaire, Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (SLESQ), Multiphasic Minnesota Personality Inventory – II (MMPI-II), Dissociative Experience Scale (DES) and Attachment Styles Questionnaire (ASQ) were administered to the participants of the study as a means of gathering information regarding the variables under study. The types of crimes and diagnoses were obtained from the records. The study attempted to ascertain whether there were any associations, and whether predictions could be made for possible future assessments and treatment strategies. It is a quasi-experimental design with “diagnosis” as the between-participants factor. Independent variables of the study were the type of offender, i. e. mentally ill/clinical/forensic patient offender and criminal offenders, as well as the types of crimes, i. e. violent or non-violent crime. The dependent variables were stressful life events. These variables were measured in terms of low risk to illness, moderate risk and high risk to illness; personality profile; dissociative experiences, measured as either low levels or high levels of dissociation and attachment styles (secure, fearful avoidant, ambivalent and preoccupied attachment styles). The confounding variables were substance abuse, medication and comorbid diagnoses. Descriptive statistics and the discriminant function analysis were performed. Box M was also performed to test the null hypothesis that the covariance matrices did not differ between groups formed by the dependent variables. The Chi Square test for independence was also used to determine whether associations existed between two nominally categorical variables. The results of the study indicated that there were only four female participants in the clinical offender group. A high number of research participants were single in both the criminal (72...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{reports that}} adopted persons are destined for poor {{psychological}} and relational adjustment, this conclusion remains controversial. Previous {{research on this}} topic has been inconclusive, and has failed to provide a complex assessment of the predictors of adjustment. For instance, whether attachment security {{plays a key role}} in later relationship outcomes remains unresolved. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal study of adults who were adopted as infants, and a comparison sample of adults who grew up with both biological parents. Two research questions were addressed: differences in attachment security between the two samples, and the predictive relations between initial attachment scales and relationship variables (e. g., risk in intimacy, loneliness) assessed at follow-up. <b>Attachment</b> <b>profiles</b> at Time 1 indicated less security in the adopted sample than the comparison sample, and these differences were maintained at follow-up. However, adoptees who had not searched for birth relatives did not differ from the comparison sample. Although adoption status (adopted/comparison) was an important predictor of some relationship variables, it became less influential when attachment measures were included. Discussion focused on the complex factors that influence attachment security, and the need for in-depth study of the relational experiences of adopted people. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} resistance of substratum-attached, detached, and planktonic cells of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 was studied by using several inimical processes and in vivo bioluminescence as a nondestructive, real-time reporter of metabolic activity. Bioluminescence in this strain was mediated by a construction containing the entire lux operon from Photorhabdus luminescens. An excellent correlation between bioluminescence and classical plate count data was obtained when we compared <b>attachment</b> <b>profiles,</b> biocide concentration exponents, and thermal inactivation D values (D value {{was the time}} required for a 10 -fold {{reduction in the number}} of survivors). Biocide challenge of surface-adherent S. enteritidis resulted in concentration exponents that were experimentally indistinguishable from those obtained with Luria-Bertani broth-grown planktonic cells. It appears that cleansing regimes developed by using planktonic cell data are effective against surface-attached cells of this bacterium. Both attached and detached cells exhibited an approximately twofold increase in D values at 52 degrees C compared with values calculated for planktonic cells, strongly indicating that the detached cells exhibited an attached phenotype during the heating process. A model of a physiological adaptive response induced in attached cells and also reflected in detached cells is presented...|$|R
