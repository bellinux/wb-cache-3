30|$|We take a {{step forward}} into nanoscopic domains by {{combining}} these two key technologies AFM and STED microscopy. The AFM covers a vast field of queries and hence this step of coupling with STED is an inevitable one in order to answer sub diffraction level morphology questions supported with fluorescence specificity. It is {{important to realize that}} we overcome limitations of individual setups with a combined setup, for example: the performance of AFM is limited by non-specificity and resolution of STED is experimentally limited by available laser power for depletion and photo-stability of the dye used (Harke et al. [2008]); (Hotta et al. [2010]). Pre-indication of sample distribution can help to configure the AFM correctly and similarly, <b>photo</b> <b>exposure</b> can be avoided in areas, if identified by morphology. Thus, both techniques support each other in a way other techniques would not. This reliability and the precision of measurements reach nano dimensions by avoiding artifacts (Battaglia et al. [2011]); (Sharma S [2999]), providing an accurate chemical identification of the features by fluorescence.|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were set up}} to track chemical changes of organic matter in the Muskegon River watershed. An outdoor incubation experiment {{was set up to}} track chemical changes due to microbial activity at six sites from Cedar Creek to Lake Michigan. Changes in the concentration of tannins and lignins (of exclusively terrestrial origin), bacterial abundance and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were measured before and after the incubation. DOC increased from Cedar Creek to Muskegon Lake as the water traveled further along land gathering terrestrial inputs, but rapidly decreased in concentration as the water mixed into Lake Michigan. Tannin and lignin concentration varied only slightly during the microbial incubation. A photochemical experiment was set up in the lab to track chemical changes in the water due to “sunlight” exposure at the Muskegon Lake site. Tannin and lignin concentration, bacterial abundance, DOC concentration and a colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) spectrum were collected throughout the <b>photo</b> <b>exposure.</b> The concentration of tannins and lignins actually increased during the UV exposure in the light bottles, which was contrary to our prediction. The CDOM spectra clearly showed a decrease in CDOM concentration due to the “sunlight”, suggesting that photochemically released phenol-like compounds are likely responsible for the apparent increase in tannin or lignin concentration in irradiated water...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> injury and {{increased risk of}} neurodegenerative disease, specifically chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is widely recognized.

However, in all cases thus far reported, {{it is clear that}} it is the <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> injury which is associated with increased dementia risk, and not the circumstances or environment of exposure. As such, there is considerable potential for under-recognition of CTE in patients presenting with neurodegenerative disease, particularly where <b>head</b> injury <b>exposure</b> might have been historical and through sport.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityChronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease marked by widespread accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau). CTE {{is associated with a}} constellation of symptoms, including impairments in cognition, behavior, and mood. Although initially described in boxers as dementia pugilistrca, CTE has been diagnosed in athletes from a variety of backgrounds, as well as military veterans and other individuals exposed to traumatic brain injury (TBI). To date, the only shared risk factor for CTE is a history of single or multiple TBI. This work aimed to better elucidate the relationship between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts and the development and progression of CTE. Although the link between brain injury and CTE has been well described, the magnitude of this relationship has never been studied epidemiologically. The minimum prevalence of CTE was determined in a cohort at high risk of <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts, specifically National Football League (NFL) athletes. All former NFL athletes who passed away in 2011 were identified; a subset of these athletes were studied and diagnosed with CTE to establish a minimum prevalence of CTE. The characteristics of those examined and diagnosed with CTE and those undiagnosed were explored. These analyses represent the first epidemiologic study of CTE; the high prevalence highlights the relationship between <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts and the diagnosis of CTE. Next, the relationship between the nature of athletic exposure and CTE was quantified. An athletic history questionnaire was developed and integrated into a mathematical model, incorporating data from sensors placed in football players' helmets, to identify the theoretical frequency and magnitude of an athlete's <b>head</b> impact <b>exposure.</b> This model was adapted for use postmortem, and {{it was found that the}} duration of athletic exposure, total theoretical collisions experienced; and the sum of the 95 th percentiles of the rotational acceleration endured, were all significantly associated with extent of CTE pathology. The relationships between the type of athletic exposure and the clinical presentation of disease and the specific neuroanatomic distribution of p-tau were also explored. These findings indicate the significant role of athletic <b>exposure</b> to <b>head</b> impacts on the diagnosis and progression of CTE, clinically and pathologically...|$|R

We investigated whether constant blue light (BL) exposure can eliminate the residual visual responses in a comparatively rapid RD rat model. Pigmented rhodopsin mutant S 334 ter line- 3 rat pups (21 days old) were exposed for 5 - 6 consecutive days to constant BL. Visual behavior was evaluated with an optokinetic head tracking apparatus. Electrophysiological recordings {{were made from}} the superior colliculus (SC). S-antigen, red-green opsin and rhodopsin immunoreactive residual photoreceptors were counted. Following BL <b>exposure,</b> <b>head</b> tracking was significantly reduced at 0. 25 cycles degree - 1 in 38 -day-old line 3 rats. With a 0. 125 cycles degree - 1 stimulus, the head tracking performance of 80 -day-old BL rats were {{similar to that of}} 220 -day-old no-BL-treated line- 3 rats. SC recordings also revealed a significant decrease in the residual photoreceptor activity. Histological evaluation showed reduction of the rod population in the central area of the light-damaged retina.

40|$|Background: A {{reduction}} in hearing sensitivity {{is common in}} adults and was previously considered to be normal as age increases. However, other health variables {{may play a role}} in the sensory changes. This prospective, comparative, hospital-based study assessed the risk factors (RFs) associated with sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in adult patients in a specialized tertiary hospital clinic in South-western Nigeria. Materials and Methods: Patients with clinical diagnosis of hearing impairment (bilateral SNHL) were the test subjects and age and sex-matched comparable group without SNHL were the Controls. Using a structured questionnaire, variables assessed included current and past medical history, family and social history, use of medications including ototoxic drugs, and prolonged medications. Results: One hundred and twenty-seven patients participated in the study comprising of 76 test subjects with SNHL (including 14 with suspected ARHL) and 51 controls. 59. 8 % of the participants were males. Univariate analysis revealed statistically-significant differences in family history, alcohol consumption, smoking, exposure to noise, previous ear discharge, previous head injury, hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, ototoxic drugs usage, prolonged medication and obesity between the two categories of subjects. Logistic regression analysis revealed family history, smoking, noise <b>exposure,</b> <b>head</b> injury, hypertension had significantly increased odds of developing SNHL. Conclusion: It was concluded that the RFs for SNHL in adult Nigerians were multifactorial while some of the RFs may be amenable to primary prevention.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a problem of}} enhancement of amateur photos damaged by backlighting for printing. The purpose of correction is to make photos more pleasant for an observer. <b>Photos</b> with <b>exposure</b> problems and with poorly distinguishable details in dark areas are main subject of our research. Our approach is based on contrast stretching and alpha-blending of both brightness of the initial image and estimations of reflectance. For obtaining reflectance estimation a simplified illumination model is used. The luminance is estimated using bilateral filter. Reflectance is estimated using heuristic functions of ratio between brightness of the initial image and estimation of luminance. The correction parameters are chosen adaptively based on histogram analysis. Noise suppression and some sharpening occur during correction. Also the time and memory optimization issues are considered. Recursive separable bilateral filter is applied {{to speed up the}} algorithm. The quality of the algorithm is evaluated by surveying of observer’s opinions and by comparisons with already existing software and hardware solutions for local shadow correction...|$|R
