40|$|The {{effects of}} record spacing on track edge noise are studied for CoCrTa and CoCrPt/CoCrTa media. Variations in record {{spacings}} (seperation from magnetic media to write head pole tips) are accurately achieved {{by using an}} identical set of disks {{for each type of}} media, with different overcoat thicknesses. Track edge noise is characterized using track profiles of the media noise. An integrated spectral technique is used to measure media noise, and the effects of the different playback spacings (seperation from magnetic media to read head pole tips or read element) are removed by dividing the spectral <b>playback</b> <b>loss</b> factor from the media noise spectra. On track transition noise is studied as a function of linear density at three different record spacings for each media type. Transition noise is found to increase with linear record density as expected, as well as with record spacing for a given linear density. Track profiles were performed at three linear record densities for each record spacing to observe the density dependence of similar effects on track edge noise. For both media, on-track noise and track edge noise are found to decrease with reduced record spacing, and the amount of decrease are found to be record density dependent. Acknowledgment...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the problem of}} regular small telemetry losses incurred during coherency mode transitions in Cassini's telecommunication. The project did not originally plan any corrective steps for avoiding these data losses, because of 1) the disparity between the small durations of the transitions (1 - 2 min) and large <b>playback</b> capability <b>losses</b> (15 min) needed for bracketing the transition time spans and 2) the unpredictable content of data downlinking during the transitions. However, as the intense science data return from the tour began, {{it became apparent that}} the impact of these small losses can sometimes be significant. We provide two examples of the impact on Radar-dedicated Titan flybys...|$|R
5000|$|Tool-assisted speedrunning {{relies on}} the same series of inputs being played back at {{different}} times always giving the same results. In a manner of speaking, the emulation must be deterministic {{with regard to the}} saved inputs (e.g. random seeds must not change from run to run). Otherwise, a speedrun that was optimal on one playback might not even complete it on a second <b>playback.</b> This <b>loss</b> of synchronization, or [...] "desync", occurs when the state of the emulated machine at a particular time index no longer corresponds with that which existed at the same point in the movie's production. Desyncs can also be caused by incomplete savestates, which cause the emulated machine to be restored in a state different from that which existed when it was saved.|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue in real-time interactive voice transmissions over unreliable IP networks {{is the loss}} or late arrival of packets for <b>playback.</b> Such <b>losses</b> cannot be recovered by retransmissions due to tight time constraints in interactive applications. This problem is especially serious in transmitting low bit-rate coded speech when pervasive dependencies are introduced in a bit stream, leading {{to the loss of}} subsequent dependent frames when a single packet is lost or arrives late. In this paper, we propose a novel LSP-based multiple-description coding method that adapts its number of descriptions to network loss conditions in order to conceal packet losses in transmitting low-bit-rate coded speech over lossy packet networks. Based on high correlations observed in linear predictor parameters, in the form of Line Spectral Pairs (LSPs), of adjacent frames, we generate multiple descriptions in a sender by interleaving LSPs, and reconstruct lost LSPs in a receiver by linear interpolations. Without increasing the transmission bandwidth, our scheme represents a trade-off between the quality of received packets and the ability to reconstruct lost packets. Our experimental results on FS CELP show good performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{develop an}} {{analytical}} framework {{to investigate the}} impacts of network dynamics on the user perceived video quality. Our investigation stands from the end user’s perspective by analyzing the receiver playout buffer. In specific, we model the playback buffer at the receiver by a 1 and 1 queue, respectively, with arbitrary patterns of packet arrival and playback. We then examine the transient queue length of the buffer using the diffusion approximation. We obtain the closed-form expressions of the video quality {{in terms of the}} start-up delay, fluency of video <b>playback</b> and packet <b>loss,</b> and represent them by the network statistics, i. e., the average network throughput and delay jitter. Based on the analytical framework, we propose adaptive playout buffer management schemes to optimally manage the threshold of video playback towards the maximal user utility, according to different quality-of-service requirements of end users. The proposed framework is validated by extensive simulations. Index Terms—Diffusion approximation, playout buffer, qualitydriven. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the problem of}} regular small telemetry losses incurred during coherency mode transitions in Cassini’s telecommunication. The project did not originally plan any corrective steps for avoiding these data losses, because of 1) the disparity between the small durations of the transitions (1 - 2 min) and large <b>playback</b> capability <b>losses</b> (15 min) needed for bracketing the transition time spans and 2) the unpredictable content of data downlinking during the transitions. However, as the intense science data return from the tour began, {{it became apparent that}} the impact of these small losses can sometimes be significant. We provide two examples of the impact on Radar-dedicated Titan flybys. In general, the impacts are larger for high-rate data and for data acquired during a targeted flyby of Titan any other icy satellites. Although the content of data during a transition for every downlink pass is unpredictable, we are certain that some important data will be lost on downlink passes dedicated to transmit the flyby data and it does not matter what part of the data will be hit by the transitions. We collected more than 200 days of data from Cassini tour operations between June 2004 and February 2005 to analyze the distributions of the start time and duration of the transitions. We found that the occurrence of a transition can be predicted within a 5 -min window, with 95 percent confidence. Given that, it is possible to eliminate the data <b>losses</b> by pausing <b>playback</b> {{at the beginning of a}} transition for 5 minutes and resuming playback after transition completion. We briefly describe three operational fixes as to how to implement the playback pause, with the pros and cons for each method. Finally, we report the results of the method chosen by the project and implemented on the spacecraft for several Titan and icy satellites flybys between September and October, 2005. I...|$|R
50|$|Flash-based MP3 {{player with}} many {{features}} including an FM radio, simple Flash games, a text viewer, video playback, a picture viewer and recording from the integrated microphone or the FM radio. The YP-T9 supports WMA, OGG, and MP3 audio. The player is currently available in 2, 4 and 8 GBs. While the player {{is similar in}} size to the iPod nano (1st Generation), the screen is much bigger at 1.8″. The firmware {{is based on a}} Unix-like operating system (VxWorks) and uses Flash for animations. The International (non-US YP-T9B) version {{was one of the first}} digital audio players to feature bluetooth.This player had long pauses between transferring files with the included media studio, this has now been fixed with newer firmware (1.23 WA). Unlike some other models of Samsung digital audio devices, the YP-T9 utilizes a processor designed in-house by Samsung. As for the hardware, the unit sports the Samsung SA58700X processor (ARM 940T at 200 MHz) with integrated audio codec.The Bluetooth function allows pairing with your mobile phone allowing you to answer or dial incoming/outgoing calls.The Audio player allows multiple bookmarks. This function is great for indexing a point to go back to in a song.The audio software also allows you to vary the <b>playback</b> speed without <b>loss</b> of pitch.|$|R
40|$|Humpback whale ‘‘social sounds’’ {{appear to}} be used in {{communication}} when whales interact but they have received little study in comparison to the song. During experiments as part of the Humpback whale Acoustics Research Collaboration (HARC), whales migrating past the study site on the east coast of Australia produced a wide range of social sounds. Whales were tracked visually using a theodolite and singers were tracked acoustically using an array of five widely spaced hydrophones. Source levels of social sounds were calculated from the received level of the sounds, corrected for measured propagation <b>loss.</b> <b>Playbacks</b> of social sounds were made using a J 11 transducer and the consequent reactions were recorded in terms of the change in direction of the migrating whales in relation to the playback position. In one playback, a DTAG was place on a female with calf. Playback of social sounds resulted in significant changes {{in the course of the}} migrating whales, in some cases towards the transducer while in others it was away from the transducer. From the estimates of source levels it is possible to assess the effectiveness of the playback and the range of influence of social sounds. [Work supported by ONR and DSTO. ...|$|R
