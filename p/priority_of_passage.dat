40|$|The {{majority}} of philosophers of time hold that the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time is objective change in A-series properties. On this “traditional” view <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> {{there is an}} objective, non-relative present moment (or set of simultaneous events) and the moment or set of simultaneous events that is present continuously changes. That the traditional view construes passage in these A-theoretic terms makes the existence <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> depend on the truth {{of one of the}} A-theoretic views of the ontology of time. The {{majority of}} B-theorists deny that time passes because they reject the A-theoretic views. I defend a “revisionist” B-theoretic view <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time, wherein <b>passage</b> is the temporally successive occurrence of events. Time passes in that one moment occurs after another in a B-series of equally existing events. I begin by defending the viability of the revisionist view as a view <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time. Then I argue that since both the revisionist and traditional views <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> are viable views <b>of</b> <b>passage,</b> whether passage is really objective change in A-series properties or the temporally successive occurrence of equally existing events depends on which view of the ontology of time is correct. I argue that the B-theory is the correct view of the ontology of time, first by showing that there are several arguments that sink the A-theoretic views, then by showing that the B-theory escapes its main objection: that it is incompatible with temporal experience, particularly with the experiences of the present and <b>of</b> the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time. Since the revisionist B-theoretic view <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> is a viable view <b>of</b> <b>passage</b> and since the B-theory is the correct view of the ontology <b>of</b> time, the <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> time is the temporally successive occurrence of equally existing events. Finally, I argue that events only occur in temporal succession if they are time-like related to each other and there are multiple series of time-like related events.

An algorithmic network that implements the search for an acceptable schedule must implement the following for conflicting operations: the operation that has started is not interrupted; If several operations simultaneously claim for one workplace (port, reach) and their number is greater than its throughput, then the conflict resolution is carried out in accordance with predefined preference rules or based on the user's decision; If the operation is waiting for the release of the workplace, it does not occupy the resource; The resource is returned immediately after the operation is completed. The considered design of algorithmic networks allows to resolve the conflict, with a simultaneous resource request, to take the resource once, remember that it was received and return it {{after the end of the}} operation, then the resource receives a contra-controlling operation for execution.
