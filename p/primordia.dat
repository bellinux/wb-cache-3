5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching <b>primordia</b> in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, {{mushrooms}} occur predominantly on decaying petioles of the palm Phenix roeberenii. The fungus requires a proper range of humidity to form mushrooms; for example, on Hachijo Island, fruiting only occurs in the rainy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative humidity is around 88%, usually the day after rain falls. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom <b>primordia</b> that are too wet become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause the caps to warp and break because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E
5|$|Fruit body <b>primordia</b> first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of {{thin-walled}} generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E

25|$|The rate {{of cooling}} {{has been shown to}} {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot <b>primordia</b> of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral <b>primordia</b> responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the <b>primordia</b> accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{mammalian}} kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm. Kidney development, {{also called}} nephrogenesis, proceeds {{through a series}} of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The metanephros are <b>primordia</b> of the permanent kidney.|$|E
25|$|Using A. thaliana, the {{genetics}} behind leaf shape development {{have become more}} clear and have been broken down into three stages: The initiation of the leaf primordium, the establishment of dorsiventrality, {{and the development of}} a marginal meristem. Leaf <b>primordia</b> are initiated by the suppression of the genes and proteins of the class I KNOX family (such as SHOOT APICAL MERISTEMLESS). These class I KNOX proteins directly suppress gibberellin biosynthesis in the leaf primordium. Many genetic factors were found to be involved in the suppression of these class I KNOX genes in leaf <b>primordia</b> (such as ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1, BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1, SAWTOOTH1, etc.). Thus, with this suppression, the levels of gibberellin increase and leaf primordium initiates growth.|$|E
25|$|Cranial {{neural crest}} migrates dorsolaterally {{to form the}} craniofacial mesenchyme that differentiates into various cranial ganglia and craniofacial cartilages and bones. These cells enter the {{pharyngeal}} pouches and arches where they contribute to the thymus, bones {{of the middle ear}} and jaw and the odontoblasts of the tooth <b>primordia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{cultivated}} mushroom {{as well as}} the common field mushroom initially form a minute fruiting body, referred to as the pin stage because of their small size. Slightly expanded they are called buttons, once again because of the relative size and shape. Once such stages are formed, the mushroom can rapidly pull in water from its mycelium and expand, mainly by inflating preformed cells that took several days to form in the <b>primordia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{formation}} in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes {{that are involved in}} the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the <b>primordia</b> of zebrafish fins, for example, express four genes from the homeobox msx family during development and regeneration.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new <b>primordia</b> are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} little evidence to support this (and mounting evidence to refute it), some early studies implicated the Ephs to {{play a part in}} the signaling of limb development. In chicks, EphA4 is expressed in the developing wing and leg buds, {{as well as in the}} feather and scale <b>primordia.</b> This expression is seen in the distal end of the limb buds, where cells are still undifferentiated and dividing, and appears to be under the regulation of retinoic acid, FGF2, FGF4, and BMP-2 – known to regulate limb patterning. EphA4 defective mice do not present abnormalities in limb morphogenesis (personal communication between Andrew Boyd and Nigel Holder), so it is possible that these expression patterns are related to neuronal guidance or vascularisation of the limb with further studies being required to confirm or deny a potential role of Eph in limb development.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuity}} of Xenoblade Chronicles X is unconnected to any previous {{game in the}} Xeno series, although there are thematic and aesthetic references. After Earth is {{caught in the crossfire}} of a war between two alien races, humanity escapes on spaceships — only a few ships make it off the planet, one of them being the White Whale, containing the city New Los Angeles (NLA). The game takes place on Mira, an uncharted world far away from Earth where the White Whale has crash-landed: NLA becomes the center of human activity and commerce. Mira is divided into five continents — <b>Primordia,</b> which has the most Earth-like environment; Noctilum, covered by forests and filled with bioluminescent lifeforms; Oblivia, dominated by desert and ancient ruins; Sylvalum, a pale-colored landscape clouded in mist and dominated by large plants and rock formations; and Cauldros, a volcanic land controlled by the Ganglion.|$|E
25|$|Ebony spleenwort {{is capable}} of proliferating by forming new plantlets from buds on the rachis {{at the base of}} the plant. These allow new {{individuals}} to form at different levels when prostrate fronds become buried in the leaf litter. Wagner & Johnson found proliferous buds in almost every site in the Great Lakes populations they studied; very rarely did more than one bud per plant occur. They occurred, on average, on 1 out of 6 plants, both on sterile and fertile fronds, and their position {{at the base of the}} lowest pinnae made them difficult to find among the cluster of fronds. The buds are button-like, pale in color, and appear on the upper side of the lowest pinnae. Each bud contains a shoot and one or sometimes two leaf <b>primordia,</b> covered in clathrate scales, occasionally with roots if the bud has begun to develop. Contact with soil at the plant base stimulates their development, and the decay of their connection with the parental leaf results in the development of a new plant. Similar buds have also been reported from the single-sorus spleenwort, Asplenium monanthes.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{mushroom}} is small, and fruits {{in only a}} limited season in a small area, researchers have investigated the conditions needed to artificially cultivate the species in laboratory conditions, {{in order to have}} more material to study the mechanism of bioluminescence, and to help preserve the species. The optimum temperature for the growth of mycelia is , while the optimum for the growth of <b>primordia</b> is [...] These temperatures are consistent with the subtropical climate in which the species is typically found. Maximum luminescence occurs at 27°C, and about 25–39hours after the <b>primordia</b> begin to form, when the cap has fully expanded. At 21°C, luminescence persists for about 3days, and becomes undetectable to the naked eyes about 72hours after primordium initiation.|$|E

500|$|Flower {{longevity}} {{varies by}} species and conditions, ranging from 5–20 days. After flowering leaf and root senescence sets in, {{and the plant}} appears to be 'dormant' till the next spring, conserving moisture. However the dormant period {{is also one of}} considerable activity within the bulb <b>primordia.</b> It is also a period during which the plant bulb may be susceptible to predators (see Pests and diseases below). Like many bulb plants from temperate regions, a period of exposure to cold is necessary before spring growth can begin. This protects the plant from growth during winter when intense cold may damage it. Warmer spring temperatures then initiate growth from the bulb. Early spring growth confers a number of advantages, including relative lack of competition for pollinators, and lack of deciduous shading. [...] The exception to requiring cold temperatures to initiate flowering is N. tazetta.|$|E
500|$|Tremella mesenterica has a yeastlike {{phase in}} its life cycle that arises {{as a result}} of budding of basidiospores. The {{alternation}} between asexual and sexual propagation is achieved by mating of yeast-form haploid cells of two compatible mating types. Each mating type secretes a mating pheromone that elicits sexual differentiation of the target cell having the opposite mating type to the pheromone-producing cell. The sexual differentiation is characterized by the arrest of the growth in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle and subsequent formation of an elongated mating tube. Formation of the mating tube, initiated by the pheromones A-10 and a-13, is similar to the process of bud emergence during bipolar budding in yeasts. Tremerogen A-10 has been purified and its chemical structure found to be S-polyisoprenyl peptide. Fruit bodies arise from a [...] located beneath the wood bark, and sometimes more than one fruit body can originate separately from the same <b>primordia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{the genetic}} level, {{developmental}} {{studies have shown}} that repression of the KNOX genes is required for initiation of the leaf primordium. This is brought about by ARP genes, which encode transcription factors. Genes of this type have been found in many plants studied till now, and the mechanism i.e. repression of KNOX genes in leaf <b>primordia,</b> seems to be quite conserved. Expression of KNOX genes in leaves produces complex leaves. It is speculated that the ARP function arose quite early in vascular plant evolution, because members of the primitive group lycophytes also have a functionally similar gene [...] Other players that have a conserved role in defining leaf <b>primordia</b> are the phytohormone auxin, gibberelin and cytokinin.|$|E
