5|$|Pensford Colliery, {{which opened}} in 1909, had the latest {{equipment}} at the time including coal cutters. It had a red brick winding house, <b>pithead</b> baths and a coal washery. Faulting made coal production expensive and it closed in 1958.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} {{to the men who}} died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the dead of both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former <b>pithead,</b> depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of the survivors of the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like many}} architects of his generation, {{following}} the British victory Hollamby pursued {{a career in}} local authority offices. He first worked as an architect for the Miners' Welfare Commission from 1947 to 1949, in this position designing <b>pithead</b> baths and a colliery extension at Lofthouse, Yorkshire. After gaining further qualifications from the Royal Institute of British Architects, he proceeded with a three-year evening course in town planning, run by William Holford and Arthur Ling at the Bartlett School of Architecture, London.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominance}} of commuting voters forced candidates {{to adopt a}} different style of campaigning than was usual elsewhere in England. In rural areas, candidates held meetings on village greens or at market fairs, while in industrial areas they held midday meetings at factory gates or at the <b>pitheads.</b> Neither approach was viable in Walthamstow, where electioneering {{took place in the}} evenings after the commuters had returned.|$|R
50|$|From the 1840s mining {{activity}} {{developed in the}} ridge of terrain south and west of Cinderford, and traffic was being lost to the GWR Forest of Dean branch, even though the dock facility at Bullo, to which that line led, was inferior to Lydney. Accordingly, the Board planned the Mineral Loop, a new line running from Tufts Junction to Drybrook Road, near Cinderford, and connecting {{in many of the}} new <b>pitheads.</b>|$|R

5|$|Watts Morgan {{was married}} twice, first to Elizabeth Williams then to Blanche Amy Morgan. Blanche was herself a strong campaigner for miners' rights, and was {{among a group}} of agents' wives who {{promoted}} the provision of <b>pithead</b> baths, bathing areas for the miners at the surface. She was outspoken in her views, and once supported a political rival of her husband's party, forcing Watts Morgan to make a public apology.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of <b>pithead</b> baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little {{could be further from the}} truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few years}} of nationalisation, a number of {{progressive}} measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme (with proper standards at all the collieries), a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface, and the making of <b>pithead</b> baths into a standard facility.|$|E
50|$|In three {{quarters}} of a century the mining industry had drastically altered the eastern corner of South Limburg in every aspect. When the first <b>pitheads</b> were built, this was an agricultural region of small villages with a population of scarcely 22,000. By the time the mines were closed down, more than ten times as many people lived there, {{and it was one of}} the most densely populated parts of the Netherlands, second only to the Randstad, the urban agglomoration in the western part of the country.|$|R
50|$|It {{entered the}} rail {{business}} in 1917 via Commonwealth Steel Products Company of Waratah, Newcastle, a {{wheel and axle}} manufacturer because {{they could no longer}} be imported from Belgium due to World War I. A Goninan & Co moved to more convenient freehold land at Broadmeadow in 1919 and built a flourishing business in general engineering. They made <b>pitheads,</b> boilers, wagons and a huge, cast 41-ton block for the district's coal trade. In October 1964 A Goninan & Co was purchased by Howard Smith.|$|R
50|$|Selby {{coalfield}} (also {{known as}} the Selby complex, or Selby superpit) was a large scale deep underground mine complex based around Selby, North Yorkshire, England, with <b>pitheads</b> at Wistow Mine, Stillingfleet Mine, Riccall Mine, North Selby Mine, Whitemoor Mine and at Gascoigne Wood Mine; all coal {{was brought to the}} surface and treated at Gascoigne Wood, being distributed onwards by rail. The primary purpose of the pit was to supply coal for electrical power generation; much of it was used in the nearby Aire valley power stations.|$|R
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, {{he became}} an oncost worker at Bowhill Colliery, where his father also worked. He worked 300 yards below the <b>pithead</b> surface, {{uncoupling}} the chain clips of the waggons that carried the coal up from the mine. During the 1924–25 season, Thomson played for Bowhill Rovers. The following season, he moved to Wellesley Juniors, where his talent was spotted by the local press who predicted that he would become a very good goalkeeper in future.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{were the}} first to exploit mineral {{deposits}} using advanced technology, especially the use of aqueducts to bring water from great distances to help operations at the <b>pithead.</b> Their technology is most visible at sites in Britain such as Dolaucothi where they exploited gold deposits with at least 5 long aqueducts tapping adjacent rivers and streams. They used the water to prospect for ore by unleashing a wave of water from a tank to scour away the soil and so reveal the bedrock with any veins exposed to sight. They used the same method (known as hushing) to remove waste rock, and then to quench hot rocks weakened by fire-setting.|$|E
25|$|Work was {{commenced}} at Tilmanstone in 1906. An {{accident in}} 1909 killed {{three men and}} destroyed the pumping system, causing the mine to flood and work was abandoned for nine months. The site {{was connected to the}} East Kent Light Railway in 1912 and coal first brought to the surface in March 1913. An accident at the pit on 27 February 1931 resulted in Sydney William Padfield being awarded a bronze Edward Medal, the only one awarded in the Kent Coalfield. An aerial ropeway was built in 1930 to link the pit with Dover Harbour. This included tunnelling through the cliff at Dover to deliver the coal to a 5,000 ton bunker at the harbour. It wasn't used much after 1935, and was dismantled in 1954. In 1945, the workforce was 914, with 631 being employed sub-surface and 283 above. The colliery closed in 1986, having produced over 20,000,000 tons of coal. A system of tokens was used in the <b>pithead</b> baths and canteen and a lamp check was operated, in common with the majority of pits. All buildings have been demolished.|$|E

50|$|Flanged rail was {{an early}} type of rail and had an 'L' cross section in which the flange kept an unflanged wheel on the track. The flanged rail has seen a minor revival in the 1950s, as guide bars, with the Paris Métro (Rubber-tyred metro or French Métro sur pneus) and more {{recently}} as the Guided bus. In the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway the rail is a 350 mm thick concrete beam with a 180 mm lip to form the flange. The buses run on normal road wheels with side mounted guidewheels to run against the flanges. Buses are steered normally when off the busway, analogous to the 18th-century wagons which could be manoeuvered around <b>pitheads</b> before joining the track for the longer haul.|$|R
50|$|McClure {{was born}} in Lochwinnoch in 1926 and {{attended}} Queens Park School in Glasgow. During the Second World War David served as a Bevin Boy in the mines of West Lothian. Some of his earliest known works depict these times; mining scenes and portraits of the miners themselves as well as surrealist and cubist landscapes depicting <b>pitheads</b> and bings, richly influenced by the works of Graham Sutherland. Previously he had been studying English and History at Glasgow University but his mining experiences seemed to have help determine that an already strong interest {{in the visual arts}} developed in a need to paint. On his father's side of the family were several generations of Lochwinnoch furniture designers and manufacturers; many of the great, Clyde-built liners were fitted out with Lochwinnoch furniture and decorative woodwork. His father, Robert, in his spare time was active in the local art society and went to drawing classes, even painting portraits of locals' prize pets or racing pigeons. David first enrolled in the Fine Art course at Edinburgh, his time divided between History of Art at Edinburgh University and Drawing and Painting at the Art College. Tellingly, after a year, he moved solely to the Art College and to painting.|$|R
500|$|Dibnah {{had another}} course of chemotherapy, {{but this time}} the {{treatment}} was unsuccessful. [...] Undeterred, he began to dig a replica coal mine in the back garden of his home. [...] Although the sight of <b>pithead</b> gear may have been considered by his neighbours to be unusual, as a child raised in Bolton he had been surrounded by pits such as Ladyshore Colliery and had long harboured an interest in mining. [...] He had already assembled the wooden <b>pithead</b> gear and was planning to sink a [...] brick-lined shaft below this into the hillside. [...] At the bottom of the shaft, a horizontal tunnel would have led out to the steep side of the valley above which his garden sits. [...] The intention was to have a narrow gauge railway running along the tunnel, back up the hillside on a rope-hauled inclined plane, returning to the <b>pithead.</b> [...] The ultimate aim was to be able to demonstrate the basic working of an early colliery. [...] Seven years before his diagnosis, therefore, Dibnah had sourced drawings of suitable <b>pithead</b> gear and built a frame from timber and iron bolts. [...] He had applied for and was given planning permission to erect the structure, but made no mention of his wish to dig a shaft underneath it. [...] The BBC decided to make a documentary on Dibnah's proposed mine, which would entail his once again travelling around the country, visiting working collieries and heritage mines. [...] Filming started late in 2003, by which time Dibnah and his friend Alf Molyneux had already made a start on the shaft.|$|E
500|$|At school Dibnah {{was placed}} in an art class (his reading and writing skills were judged to be poor), {{following}} which he spent three years at art college, where his work was based mainly on industrial themes such as machinery, <b>pithead</b> gear and spinning mills. [...] On leaving college at16 he was offered {{a job at a}} funeral parlour, but left quickly to begin work at a local joinery.|$|E
500|$|The {{industrial}} historians Helen and Baron Duckham consider Universal Colliery to {{have been}} [...] "an unlucky mine". At approximately 5:00am on 24 May 1901 three underground explosions occurred as the night shift was exiting the pit. Because the explosion damaged the pit winding gear, it took time to clear the debris from the <b>pithead</b> to allow rescuers to begin work. They descended at 11:00am and rescued one man, an , found alongside the corpse of the horse he was tending. There were no other survivors and 81 men died. Although the funerals for the victims started four days later, the rescue and recovery operations lasted for six weeks.|$|E
50|$|The slow {{progress}} of the rescue exacerbated the tensions between the mining communities and the companies. By 1 April only 194 bodies {{had been brought to}} the surface. There were many accusations that the Compagnie des mines de Courrières was deliberately delaying the reopening of blocked shafts to prevent coalface fires (and hence to save the coal seams): more recent studies tend to consider such claims as exaggerated. The mine was unusually complex for its time, with the different <b>pitheads</b> being interconnected by underground galleries on many levels. Such complexity was supposed to help the access of rescuers {{in the case of an}} accident—it undoubtedly also helped the coal to be brought to the surface—but in fact contributed to the large loss of life by allowing the dust explosion to travel further and then by increasing the debris which had to be cleared by the rescuers. About 110 km (70 mi) of tunnel are believed to have been affected by the explosion. Gérard Dumont of the Centre historique minier de Lewarde has shown that the plans of the mine existing at the time of the accident were difficult to interpret: some of them measured the depth of galleries by reference to the minehead, others by reference to sea level.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis that}} follows is {{interdisciplinary}} in nature, bringing together {{the fields of}} contemporary archaeology, cultural and historical Geography to explore the changing landscape of the Dean Forest and Wye Valley National Forest Park. During {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, the Forest of Dean was a significant industrial region, a landscape dominated by <b>pitheads,</b> tramroads and railways, coal mines, ironworks, and quarries. However, the twentieth century saw the radical transformation of this landscape, from industry to leisure. In the chapters that follow, it is aspects of this landscape transformation that are examined through the lens of non-representational theory, as each chapter explores the questions: what might a ‘more-than-representational’ approach to contemporary archaeology look like? And, what can archaeological perspectives offer in terms of the development of non-representational theory? Starting from the premise that contemporary archaeology is not just about the recent past, but about how we engage with the past {{from the perspective of the}} present, this thesis focuses upon those barely perceptible echoes from the past that have the power to move us in unexpected ways. As such, it examines not just the legacy of the past in the landscape, but its capacity to generate affective registers, to evoke and to unsettle. It develops a distinctly archaeological approach to considerations of materiality and time within non-representational theories, placing an emphasis on matter, memory and haunting, absence and presence. It focuses on new temporalities arising from the time of the ‘event’, new materialisms that are ‘more-than-representational’, and new ways of performing and practicing the archaeological.

Jones said: [...] "Mining is central to the story of Wales. It has shaped our history and communities and its social and physical legacy is still with us to this day....

500|$|Filming {{continued}} at various {{locations around the}} country, with sons Jack and Roger, who had become essential members of the tour, providing much-needed support for their father. [...] By the end of July, the crew had filmed only 34days with Dibnah, out of a planned60. [...] It was becoming more difficult by the day for Dibnah to fulfil his filming duties and the crew decided to cut short the schedule. [...] Once home, Dibnah decided to creosote the <b>pithead</b> gear in his garden but fell and injured his back. [...] He was adamant that he would continue filming, however, and made the trip to North Wales to complete filming. [...] He later made a partial recovery and completed his last day's filming at an Ironworks in Atherton.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the village}} flourished, so too did the colliery. It was modernised after World War I and, in 1922, a Koepe {{friction}} winding engine {{was installed in}} the West Pit. New <b>pithead</b> baths followed in 1939, described as being [...] "of especially pleasant design," [...] and Murtons swimming pool was opened in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{improvements}} proved necessary; {{attempts to}} ship coal directly from Saltom were unsuccessful, and an underground roadway {{was driven to}} the bottom of another pit, from whose <b>pithead</b> a waggonway ran to Whitehaven harbour. The pumping engine originally installed at Saltom proved inadequate, and [...] by 1739 two much larger ones were in use. [...] But Saltom pit allowed the working of much coal inaccessible from previous pits; [...] by 1765, workings extended {{a mile and a half}} from the shaft and as much as three-quarters of a mile out to sea. [...] Clerk of Penicuik (who thought it folly to have assumed the ingress of sea water would be manageable) commented At Whitehaven I took notice that Sir Ja. Louder, by the meer force of money, was working a field of Coal under the sea, which neither he nor any man else had ever attempted but from ignorance and a vast store of Richess. Lowther had spent on a scale beyond other Cumbrian coal-owners (and beyond most other coal-owners elsewhere in Britain) - £1900 had been invested before any significant amount of coal was raised, and it took over £4,500 to get the pit into full production. But the expenditure was rewarded: by 1752 over a quarter of a million tons had been extracted and sold at a profit of over a shilling a ton; Saltom pit continued to be worked until 1848.|$|E

The charges were to be reduced to a third after fourteen years, but a further Act of 1711 deferred the reduction for another fourteen years, and authorised the borrowing of £1350 (against future revenue) to complete the improvements. The harbour was to be run by a committee of twenty-one trustees. Seven of the trustees were to be nominated by Lowther and to hold the position at his pleasure; the other fourteen were to be elected by the traders using the port. [...] The trustees were also entrusted with the cleansing, paving, and sewerage of the town of Whitehaven, and empowered to levy domestic rates to pay for this. During Lowther's lifetime, the harbour was deepened, and a new outer harbour built, considerably increasing the port capacity. Land transport to the harbour from the main Whitehaven pits was improved by the introduction of waggonways and the need for coal to be loaded into sacks at the <b>pithead</b> removed by a new staith at the harbour: [...] "In this staith are fixed five hurries or spouts, at such a distance from each other that a ship of three hundred tons burthen can be under each hurry and receive a loading at one time. The staith is about thirty-seven feet above the level of the quay, and when the waggons arrive there the bottom of each waggon is drawn out and the coals are dropped from there into the hurry or spout under it, through which they run down into the ship laid below to receive her loading" [...] The staith also contained storage for three thousand waggon loads (six thousand tons Dublin measure) ...|$|E
