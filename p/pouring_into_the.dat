5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of the ROK 6th Infantry Division and the ROK 10th Infantry Regiment from the ROK 8th Infantry Division, the ROK II Corps was devastated, and {{effectively}} ceased to be an organized fighting force. This meant the right flank of the US Eighth Army was completely open to the Chinese forces, which were now advancing south to overwhelm the UN forces. Exploiting the situation, the Chinese launched another attack on the now exposed Eighth Army center, resulting in {{the loss of}} the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment and the US 8th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of Unsan. With the Chinese forces <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rear of the UN lines, the Eighth Army was forced to retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. Only the stubborn defense of Kunu-ri by the US 5th Regimental Combat Team and the ROK 7th Infantry Division on November 4 managed to stop the Chinese advance and prevented a disastrous defeat for the Eighth Army. By November 5, logistics difficulties forced the Chinese to end the First Phase Campaign.|$|E

5|$|With the {{new orders}} on November 28, the US 5th Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division left Kunu-ri {{to rejoin the}} {{division}} to the northeast of Sunchon. With the US 5th Cavalry Regiment absent and the 8th Cavalry Regiment still recovering from devastating losses from the battle at Unsan, Major General Hobart Gay of the US 1st Cavalry Division placed the US 7th Cavalry Regiment {{to the south of}} Pukchang-ni, behind the remnants of the ROK 6th Infantry Division. Lacking reinforcements, the ROK 6th Infantry Division was quickly routed by the PVA 42nd Corps on the night of November 28. Chinese forces then attacked the 7th Cavalry Regiment under the cover of the fleeing Korean soldiers and refugees <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American front. Under Gay's order, the 7th Cavalry Regiment withdrew southwest to the town of Sinchang-ni on the morning of November 29, and the Chinese resumed the drive southward. A fierce battle between the PVA 125th Division and the 7th Cavalry Regiment broke out during the night of November 29, but by the morning of November 30 the PVA 42nd Corps' advance was halted.|$|E

25|$|Speculators {{typically}} {{fall into}} three categories: position traders, day traders, and swing traders (swing trading), though many hybrid types and unique styles exist. With many investors <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> futures markets {{in recent years}} controversy has risen about whether speculators are responsible for increased volatility in commodities like oil, and experts are divided on the matter.|$|E
25|$|The Federals {{suffered}} many casualties (including General Long) {{but continued}} their attack. Once the Union Army reached the works, there was vicious hand-to-hand fighting.

In less than 30 minutes, Long's men had captured the works protecting the Summerfield Road.|$|E
25|$|But United Empire Loyalists were <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Maritime Provinces and in 1784 Loyalist {{settlers}} in the Saint John River Valley set up New Brunswick as a separate colony.

25|$|Cahaba, now a ghost town, was {{the first}} {{permanent}} state capital from 1820 to 1825.

25|$|During the American Revolution, 1775–1783, {{settlers}} {{soon began}} <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> region; Dragging Canoe responded by leading his faction into the Cherokee–American wars, 1776–1794, especially along the Holston River, {{at the height}} of the American Revolutionary War. The Shawnee north of the Ohio River were also unhappy about the American settlement of Kentucky. Although some bands tried to be neutral, Historian Colin Calloway reports that most Shawnees fought allied with the British against the Americans.|$|E

25|$|But is it {{possible}} that the particular temperature increase observed in the last 100 years is the result of carbon dioxide produced by human activities? The scientific evidence clearly indicates that this is not the case... measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years. This is just the period in which humanmade carbon dioxide has been <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the fall}} of Grozny, Dudayev {{abandoned}} the presidential palace, moved south with his forces and continued leading the war throughout 1995, reportedly from a missile silo close to the historic Chechen capital of Vedeno. He continued to insist that his forces would prevail after the conventional warfare had finished, and the Chechen guerrilla fighters continued to operate across the entire country picking off Russian units and demoralising their soldiers. A jihad was declared on Russia by the Dudayev-appointed Mufti of Ichkeria, Akhmad Kadyrov, and foreign volunteers began <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> republic, mostly from neighbouring North Caucasian Muslim republics such as Dagestan.|$|E
25|$|Milwaukee's {{founding}} fathers {{had a vision}} for the city: they knew it was perfectly situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new immigrants who were <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new state of Wisconsin {{during the middle of the}} 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.|$|E

25|$|During {{the war in}} Croatia, arms {{had been}} <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country. The JNA armed Bosnian Serbs and the Croatian Defence Force the Herzegovinian Croats. The Bosnian Muslim Green Berets and Patriotic League were {{established}} already in fall 1991, and drew up a defense plan in February 1992. It was estimated that 250–300,000 Bosnians were armed, and that some 10,000 were fighting in Croatia. By March 1992, perhaps {{three quarters of the}} country were claimed by Serb and Croat nationalists. On 4 April 1992, when Izetbegović ordered all reservists and police in Sarajevo to mobilize, and SDS called for evacuation of the city's Serbs, came the 'definite rupture between the Bosnian government and Serbs'. Bosnia and Herzegovina received international recognition on 6 April 1992. The most common view is that the war started that day.|$|E
25|$|The 19th {{century was}} also a new era for Europe. Church power was declining, and friars began coming to the Philippines, ending hopes that the friars would {{relinquish}} their posts. With {{the opening of the}} Suez Canal, the voyage between Spain and the Philippines was made shorter. More peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain) began <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> colony and started to occupy the various government positions traditionally held by the criollos (Spaniards born in the Philippines). In the 300 years of colonial rule, the criollos had been accustomed to being semi-autonomous with the governor-general, who was the only Spaniard (peninsulares) government official. The criollos demanded representation in the Spanish Cortes where they could express their grievances. This, together with the secularization issues, gave rise to the Criollo Insurgencies.|$|E
25|$|Long's men {{attacked}} {{in a single}} rank in three main lines, dismounted and firing their 7-shot Spencer repeating carbines. They were supported by their own artillery. The Confederates defenders replied with heavy small arms and artillery fire. In {{one of the many}} ironies of the Civil War, the Confederate artillery had only solid shot on hand, while just a short distance away was an arsenal which produced tons of canister, a highly effective anti-personnel ammunition. The attackers suffered many casualties, including General Long himself, but the attack continued. Once the Union troops reached the works, vicious hand-to-hand fighting broke out. Many on both sides were struck down with clubbed muskets. Still, Union troops kept <b>pouring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> works. In less than 30 minutes, Long's men had captured the works protecting the Summerfield Road from the hopelessly outnumbered defenders.|$|E
