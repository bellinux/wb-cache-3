5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} {{near the mouth of}} Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and Sulphur Creeks. Present-day Laguna Niguel takes its name from this settlement. The Acjachemen were renamed the Juaneño by Spanish <b>priests</b> <b>in</b> the 18th century, who established a mission at the present-day location of San Juan Capistrano. Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is no trace of it remaining.|$|E
