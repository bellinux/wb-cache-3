25|$|Economist {{and social}} {{reformer}} Henry George opposed sales taxes and protective tariffs for their {{negative impact on}} trade. He also believed in the right of each person to {{the fruits of their}} own labour and <b>productive</b> <b>investment.</b> Therefore, income from labour and proper capital should remain untaxed. For this reason many Geoists—in particular those that call themselves geolibertarian—share the view with libertarians that these types of taxation (but not all) are immoral and even theft. George stated there should be one single tax: the Land Value Tax, which is considered both efficient and moral. Demand for specific land is dependent on nature, but even more so on the presence of communities, trade, and government infrastructure, particularly in urban environments. Therefore, the economic rent of land is not the product of one particular individual and it may be claimed for public expenses. According to George, this would end real estate bubbles, business cycles, unemployment and distribute wealth much more evenly. Joseph Stiglitz's Henry George Theorem predicts its sufficiency for financing public goods because those raise land value.|$|E

2500|$|Dutch [...] "merchant capitalism" [...] {{was based}} on trading, {{shipping}} and finance rather than manufacturing or agriculture and marked the transition of the Dutch economy to a new stage. [...] The accumulation of capital in the enormous amounts generated in this period caused demand for <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities beside the immediate reinvestment in the own business. It also necessitated innovative institutional arrangements to bring demand and supply of investment funds together. From this period date the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Amsterdamsche Wisselbank. There were also innovations in marine insurance and legal structuring of firms like the joint stock company. These innovations helped manage risk. For example, ships were financed by shares, with each of 16 merchants, say, holding a 1/16 share. This minimized risk and maximized opportunity for windfall gains.|$|E

It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods. As a result, the upswing lacks a solid base. It is not a real prosperity. It is illusory prosperity. It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth, i.e. the accumulation of savings made available for <b>productive</b> <b>investment.</b> Rather, it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase. Sooner or later, it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{relationship}} between household remittance income {{and the financial}} sector discussed above yields several testable hypotheses. First, households that lack access to financial services {{are more likely to}} use remittances to finance <b>productive</b> <b>investments</b> and large purchases, such as homes and land, than those with access. Second, this substitution effect should decline as the financial sector develops. That is, as competition among the financial sector increases, declining transfer costs makes remittances more attractive relative to bank loans. So, at some point, financial sector development can make households more likely to use remittances to finance investments and large purchases. Finally, {{an increase in the number}} of financial products should compete with other investment opportunities. Thus, the use of remittances for <b>productive</b> <b>investments</b> will decline as banks begin to offer lower-risk alternative investments.|$|R

[...] The administration campaigned for the citizens' support in patronizing Filipino products and services, and implemented import and currency controls favorable for Filipino industries.

The Anti Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, through Republic Act No. 301, aimed to prevent corruption, and promote honesty and public trust.

[...] Towards the end of the Bretton Woods era, the central role of the dollar became a problem as international demand eventually forced the US to run a persistent trade deficit, which undermined confidence in the dollar. This, together with the emergence of a parallel [...] market for gold where the price soared above the official US mandated price, [...] led to speculators [...] running down the US gold reserves. Even when convertibility was restricted to [...] nations [...] only, some, notably France, [...] continued building up hoards of [...] gold at the expense of the US. [...] Eventually these [...] pressures caused President Nixon to end all convertibility into gold on 15 August 1973.

2500|$|The US {{economic}} history {{is rife with}} unwelcomed financial crises. Frederic S. Mishkin defines a financial crisis as [...] "a disruption to financial markets in which adverse selection and moral hazard problems become much worse, so that financial markets are unable to efficiently channel funds {{to those who have}} the most <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities". Monetary policymakers have turned their attention to financial stability in order to mitigate the damage incurred during shocks. This is due to another outcome from failing to satisfy the principle is the existence of [...] "a multiplicity of bounded equilibria in which output and inflation respond to nonfundamental—sunspot—disturbances". Crises are typically unpredictable and uncontrollable due to the vast number of factors involved, which prompts the necessity for improved crisis stabilization policy. The Federal Reserve essay points out a couple cases, such as the Stock Market Crash of 1987 and the September 11 terrorist attack, in which the Federal Reserve had prevented even worse crises from arising by providing the liquidity essential to keeping the markets from crashing. The Federal Reserve’s quick response to stabilizing crises was made possible due to the improvement of monetary policy.|$|E

As is well-known, public expenditure may exert an effect on the economic growth rate through the positive externality in the productivity of the capital stock. When public expenditure in the households' utility function is considered, a further effect operates to modify the saving and investment decisions of households, depending on the relative weight of public consumption. In particular, if households consider public expenditure to be useful, I shall show that - whatever the exogenous fiscal policy may be - the growth rate is always higher {{than it is in the}} case of <b>productive</b> <b>investments</b> alone. Moreover, if households are able to choose the optimal income tax rate, an optimal growth rate greater than the maximum one may be obtained. economic growth, public expenditure...|$|R
2500|$|In a May 2014 {{review of}} Piketty's book, the Marxist {{geographer}} David Harvey argued that capitalists nowadays {{drive up the}} industrial rate of profit by restricting the supply of capital to new (<b>productive)</b> <b>investment.</b> For example, Chinese steel producers agreed to reduce steel production in response to overcapacity that emerged in 2015, and steel prices and profits are expected to rise significantly by 2018. The Argentinian scholar Esteban Ezequiel Maito, studying longterm trends in profitability, has argued that [...] "hen a proper definition of the matter in Marxian terms is done, Piketty's data itself confirms {{the law of the}} tendency of the rate of profit to fall". Economists like Odran Bonnet, Boe Thio, and Matthew Rognlie have argued that Piketty's results are largely attributable to his broad definition of capital, specifically to the growth in the value and profitability of the housing stock. Once the housing stock is excluded from capital data, Piketty's results no longer hold. Michael Hudson notes that if industrial profits are not statistically segregated from real estate profits, the overall rate of return on capital is [...] "considerably understated". Anwar Shaikh argues that Piketty's measure of capital is [...] "an inconsistent measure of real and financial assets", and that Piketty's [...] "hybrid definition of the rate of profits is invalid".|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 1920s and 1930s onward, {{classical}} revolutionary orthodox Marxists like Henryk Grossmann, Louis C. Fraina (alias Lewis Corey) and Paul Mattick [...] argued {{that at a}} certain point, the falling rate of profit stops the total mass of profit in the economy from growing altogether, or at least from growing at a sufficient rate. This results in a crisis of overaccumulation (or a shortage of surplus value), and consequently a drop in new <b>productive</b> <b>investment,</b> causing an increase in unemployment. This, in turn, leads to a wave of takeovers and mergers to restore profitable production, plus a higher intensity of labor exploitation. In the end, however, {{after a lot of}} cycles, capitalism collapses. This contrasted with V.I. Lenin’s idea that in the crises of bourgeois society [...] "there {{is no such thing as}} an absolutely hopeless situation", since the bourgeoisie can – in principle – always find a way out. Lenin regarded the abolition of capitalism as a conscious political act, not as a spontaneous result of the breakdown of the economy. In 1931, two years after publishing his breakdown theory, Grossman qualified his idea more, emphasizing that he did not believe that capitalism had to collapse [...] "by itself" [...] or [...] "automatically"; the objective law of breakdown had to be combined with the subjective factor of the class struggle.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores two {{mechanisms}} {{through which}} a sovereign default can disrupt the domestic economy via its banking system. First, a sovereign default creates a negative balance-sheet effect on banks, which reduces {{their ability to}} raise funds and prevents the flow of resources to <b>productive</b> <b>investments.</b> Second, default undermines internal liquidity as banks replace government securities with less <b>productive</b> <b>investments.</b> I quantify the model using Argentinean data and find that these two mechanisms can generate a deep and persistent fall in output post-default, which accounts for the governmentâ€™s commitment necessary to explain observed levels of external public debt. The balance-sheet effect is more important because it generates a larger output cost of default and a stronger ex-ante commitment for the government. Post-default bailouts of the banking system, although desirable ex-post, are welfare reducing ex-ante since they weaken governmentâ€™s commitment. Imposing a minimum public debt requirement on banks is welfare improving as it enhances commitment by increasing the output cost of default. Sovereign default, public debt, banks, liquidity...|$|R
