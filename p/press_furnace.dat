40|$|Abstract. A {{series of}} {{diffusion}} bonding {{tests were conducted}} on high Nb containing TiAl alloy with duplex microstructure, the evolution of microstructure at bonding interface was investigated. Bonding process was performed by using vacuum hot <b>press</b> <b>furnace</b> at the temperature range from 850 to 1150 ℃ with the pressure of 30 MPa for 45 min. The microstructure observation indicates that sound joint without unbounded area can be obtained when bonded above 950 ℃. Recrystallization happens in bonding interface when bonded at 1150 ℃ and the recrystallized grain prior nucleated at bonding interface between the lamella colonies. Nucleation and growth of recrystallized grains promote migration of bonding interface and thus improve bonding quality. Besides, the post-bonding heat treatment (PBHT) was also performed to promote the evolution of bonding interface. The experimental results reveal that the bonding interface disappears after PBHT at 1135 ℃for 12 h, and exhibits near gamma microstructure...|$|E

In this thesis, the synthesis, characterization and {{properties of}} Ni and Zn substituted YBa[sub 2]Cu[sub 4]O[sub 8] high-T[sub c] superconducting single crystals and polycrystalline Sr^(57) FeO[sub x] samples will be presented. The unique Ni or Zn substituted millimeter size, flat single crystals of YBa[sub 2]Cu[sub 4]O[sub 8] (Y 124) were grown at 1100 ?C and 600 bar of O[sub 2] pressure {{in a hot}} isostatic <b>press</b> <b>furnace</b> from polycrystalline starting materials BaCuO[sub 2], CuO, NiO/ZnO, and YBa[sub 2]Cu[sub 3]O[sub 7 -?] (Y 123). The starting contents for the substituted materials ranged from 1 % to 5 % for Ni, and from ly% to 20 % for Zn. The final contents of Ni and Zn in the Y 124 crystals were from 1. 5 % to 7 % for Ni and 1 % to 4 % for Zn. It was difficult to obtain single crystals with high Zn doping since they frequently showed YBa[sub 2]Cu[sub 35]O[sub 75] impurity or mixed compositions of YBa[sub 2]Cu[sub 35]O[sub 75] and Y 124. The superconducting transition temperatures, T[sub c], of these single crystals were measured with AC susceptibility and found to depend linearly on final Ni and Zn contents. In both cases, T[sub c] was suppressed to zero, which was not known for corresponding polycrystalline materials. Unlike in Y 123, The Ni and Zn substitutions were found to suppress T[sub c] almost identically in Y 124. The oxygen stoichiometric Sr^(57) FeO[sub 3. 00] was successfully synthesized at 400 ?C and 300 bar in pure O[sub 2], followed by very slow cooling. By hydrogen reduction (20 % H[sub 2] in Ar) and unique partial oxygen pressure annealings (0. 2 % or 12 % O[sub 2] in Ar) with a thermogravimetric analyzer, the oxygen deficient Sr^(57) FeO[sub x] (x = 2. 50, 2. 74, 2. 86 respectively) materials were made.

Two types of boron powders were used, one is amorphous nano boron {{and the other}} is C-doped boron. Characteristics of superconductors were determined by XRD and resistance measurements. Systematic levitation force measurements were performed by using a modular system at low temperatures. These bulk superconductors showed around 9 N repulsive and 4 N attractive forces in the z-axis at 20 K at closest point to the cryostat lid which contains the MgB 2 superconductor. These values slightly decreased by increasing temperature to 24 and 28 K for both samples. Comparing two samples, nano boron MgB 2 showed slightly higher levitation force than C-doped MgB 2 although C-doped MgB 2 has higher attractive force value at the closest point. This situation points out that C-doped MgB 2 is much proper for attractive force applications (as guidance force) while the nanoboron MgB 2 sample is much appropriate for repulsive force (as levitation) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This {{research}} aims {{to enrich}} the debate concerning Industry 4. 0 and its implementation. In particular, using a case study we want to explore the relationships with the strategic management system of a manufacturing company {{which is trying to}} implement Industry 4. 0. Indeed, the company has issued a strategic plan according to the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) methodology (Hoque, 2014) setting strategic objectives and action plans for Industry 4. 0. Methodology. The research process is based on a typical qualitative exploratory inquiry; data/information has been gathered mainly through a semi-structured interview (Barriball, While 1994; Leech 2002) to four senior managers who participated in the strategic process of a manufacturing company which is implementing Industry 4. 0 tools and principles. The company manufactures ceramic tiles and has around 800 employees with several plants in Italy and in other countries. Due to the sector, it can be considered a capital-intensive company with lines of machines dedicated to families of similar products and high volumes of production. Lines follow a process made up of blenders, driers, <b>presses,</b> <b>furnaces</b> and cutting machines. Internal logistics is mainly managed through Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) which can serve and connect machines without workers. The company is using the Balanced Scorecad methodology (BSC) for setting its objectives and deploying them towards the operations (Paci and Becagli, 2011). The semi-structured interview is based on three open questions which are: -	In your strategic plan, have you set new specific goals/objectives for implementing Industry 4. 0 ? -	Have you issued specific plans for deploying your objectives into operative actions? -	What kinds of management systems, processes and resources will you need for meeting your strategic goals? After having gathered information from the four senior managers, results have been analysed and coded using a grounded theory approach. According to Strauss and Corbin (1990) it is important to use coding to shape the concepts. In grounded theory there are three basic types of coding: ‘open’, ‘axial’ and ‘selective’. For the purpose of the research presented here, open coding and selective coding have been used to handle the data collected through the qualitative interviews...|$|R

It had now to be maintained, worked, and rapidly extended. The terminus at Halfa had become a busy town. A mud village was transformed into a miniature Crewe. The great workshops that had grown with the line were equipped with diverse and elaborate machines.

The permutations and combinations of the stores were multiplied. Some of the engines were old and already worn out. These broke down periodically. The frictional parts of all were affected by the desert sand, and needed ceaseless attention and repair. The workshops were busy night and day for seven days a week.|$|R

30|$|Crack-free c-MDF {{manufacture}} {{method has}} been established using plate <b>press</b> in vacuum <b>furnace.</b> Many researches have been conducted involving use of c-MDF for industry. We attempt to evaluate c-MDF uses as indoor construction material due to its advantages such as adsorbing toxic substances and electromagnetic shielding. Before, using as indoor construction material, c-MDF should satisfy the flame-retardant regulation. On increasing carbonization temperature of MDF, there are decreasing in the weight reduction and increasing in flame-retardant. On MDF carbonized above 800  °C, no external damage was observed and THR and HHR were determined 7  MJ/m 2 and 40  kW/m 2, respectively. Based on the results, c-MDF at 800 and 1000  °C satisfied class III flame retardancy which means these carbonized boards {{can be used as}} indoor construction material. Even though c-MDF produced more CO and CO 2 than virgin MDF, the total amount of smoke was significantly lower on c-MDF than virgin MDF. The c-MDF satisfied smoke toxicity, while virgin MDF did not. Therefore, c-MDF can be a useful material for replacement of indoor construction material such as firewall, sound-absorbing material, and electromagnetic shielding material.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} document {{describes the}} processing, testing and post-test analysis of two Be-Cu assemblies that have successfully met the heat load {{requirements for the}} first wall and dome sections for the ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) fusion reactor. Several different joint assemblies were evaluated {{in support of a}} manufacturing technology investigation aimed at diffusion bonding or brazing a beryllium armor tile to a copper alloy heat sink for fusion reactor applications. Judicious selection of materials and coatings for these assemblies was essential to eliminate or minimize interactions with the highly reactive beryllium armor material. A thin titanium layer was used as a diffusion barrier to isolate the copper heat sink from the beryllium armor. To reduce residual stresses produced by differences in the expansion coefficients between the beryllium and copper, a compliant layer of aluminum or aluminum-beryllium (AlBeMet- 150) was used. Aluminum was chosen because it does not chemically react with, and exhibits limited volubility in, beryllium. Two bonding processes were used to produce the assemblies. The primary process was a diffusion bonding technique. In this case, undesirable metallurgical reactions were minimized by keeping the materials in a solid state throughout the fabrication cycle. The other process employed an aluminum-silicon layer as a brazing filler material. In both cases, a hot isostatic <b>press</b> (HIP) <b>furnace</b> was used in conjunction with vacuum-canned assemblies in order to minimize oxidation and provide sufficient pressure on the assemblies for full metal-to-metal contact and subsequent bonding. The two final assemblies were subjected to a suite of tests including: tensile tests and electron and optical metallography. Finally, high heat flux testing was conducted at the electron beam testing system (EBTS) at Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico. Here, test mockups were fabricated and subjected to normal heat loads to 10 MW/m{sup 2 } (3 Hz) and abnormal heat loads to 250 MJ/m{sup 2 } (0. 5 s) to determine their performance under simulated fusion reactor conditions for first wall components. Both assemblies survived the normal heat loads with no visual damage. Optical and electron microscopy were used to evaluate the extent of the damage at the interfaces following the VDE simulations...|$|R

Ammonia borane (AB) synthesized according to Ramachandran [31] {{was used as a}} starting material, and ferrocene was used as a catalyst. In a typical procedure, AB powder (4.0 g) and ferrocene (1.5 g) were mixed and charged into an graphite crucible of about 2 l capacity using a piece of graphite paper as inner lining, then the crucible was loaded into the furnace chamber. The chamber was sealed and pumped down to a base pressure of 0.1 Pa. Subsequently, 0.8 MPa high pure nitrogen was <b>pressed</b> into the <b>furnace</b> chamber. The furnace was heated to 1, 450 °C at a rate of 10 °C min- 1 and held for 60 min before it was finally cooled to room temperature. The BNNTs were found on the graphite paper.
