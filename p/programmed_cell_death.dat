5|$|During its lifetime, {{a nucleus}} may {{be broken down}} or destroyed, either {{in the process of}} cell {{division}} or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of <b>programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>death).</b> During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During <b>programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E

40|$|The enteric {{pathogen}} Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium induces apoptosis in infected macrophages. This process is rapid, specific, and {{depends on the}} type III protein secretion system encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI 1). Here, we demonstrate that serotype Typhimurium can activate <b>programmed</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> independently of SPI 1. SPI 1 independent induction of apoptosis in infected macrophages is observed as early as 12 to 13 h postinfection, {{even in the absence}} of intracellular bacterial replication. Delayed activation of <b>programmed</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> is not observed with serotype Typhimurium strains mutated in ompR or SPI 2. Even though SPI 2 mutants have a defect in intracellular proliferation, our results indicate that long-term intracellular survival and growth are not required for delayed macrophage killing per se, since Salmonella mutants that are severely defective in intracellular growth still induce delayed apoptosis. Inactivation of genes required for either rapid or delayed induction of apoptosis results in a conditional noncytotoxic phenotype, whereas simultaneous inactivation of genes required for both rapid and delayed induction of apoptosis renders serotype Typhimurium noncytotoxic under all conditions tested. Our hypothesis is that differential activation of <b>programmed</b> macrophage <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> by serotype Typhimurium occurs under discrete physiological conditions at distinct locations within an infected host...|$|R
5|$|Other {{immunotherapy}} treatments {{interfere with}} the binding of <b>programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> 1 (PD-1) protein with its ligand PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces <b>programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> (apoptosis).

The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E

In addition, we demonstrate the mechanisms whereby BMP 7 induces cancer <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> that involve the repression of the hTERT gene and subsequent inhibition of telomerase activity and shortening of telomeres. We show that BMP 7 -induced cancer <b>cell</b> senescence and <b>death</b> are significantly reduced after hTERT gene is constitutively overexpressed to prevent telomerase inhibition. Consistently, silencing the hTERT gene induces breast cancer <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> without potentiating the effect of BMP 7 on cancer <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> In addition, an additive effect has been observed between BMP 7 and hTERT shRNA on cell senescence and apoptosis, and that establishing telomerase activity by expressing hTERT does not completely eradicate BMP 7 -induced cell senescence and apoptosis. These data suggest that other mechanism(s) than hTERT gene repression are also involved in BMP 7 -induced breast cancer cell senescence and apoptosis.|$|R
5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about <b>programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing <b>programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E

Their activity {{to disrupt the}} binding of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bim, to the pro-survival proteins, Mcl- 1 and Bcl-xL, was evaluated using ELISA assays. Fluorescence-quenching (FQ) assays confirmed the direct binding of marinopyrroles to Mcl- 1. Benzyl- and benzyl methoxy-containing sulfide derivatives 4 and 5 were highly potent dual Mcl- 1 /Bim and Bcl-xL/Bim disruptors (IC 50 values of 600 and 700 nM), whereas carboxylate-containing sulfide derivative 9 exhibited 16. 4 -fold more selectivity for disrupting Mcl- 1 /Bim over Bcl-xL/Bim binding. In addition, a nonsymmetrical marinopyrrole 12 is as equally potent as the parent marinopyrrole A (1) for disrupting both Mcl- 1 /Bim and Bcl-xL/Bim binding.

Flow cytometric analyses of 1 -NP-exposed/ 3 NF-exposed Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells revealed that caspase- 3 was only activated in the subpopulation of cells corresponding to that with classic apoptotic morphology. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that leucocyte elastase inhibitor-derived DNaseII (LEI/L-DNaseII), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) were more clearly translocated to the nucleus following 3 -NF exposure than after 1 -NP. These 3 -NF-induced changes in AIF and EndoG translocation were reduced by necrostatin- 1, an inhibitor of necroptotic <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> Both compounds lead to accumulation of lipid droplets and induced DNA damage.

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>death</b> is {{a normal}} {{physiological}} process. Morphological {{studies have shown that}} cells that die by physiological mechanisms often undergo characteristic changes termed "apoptosis" or "programmed <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> " Recent work has begun to unravel the molecular mechanisms of these deaths and has shown that one of the primary cell-death pathways is conserved throughout much of evolution. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans <b>programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> are mediated by a mechanism controlled by the ced- 9 gene; in mammals apoptosis can often be inhibited by expression of the bcl- 2 gene. The ability of the human BCL 2 gene to prevent <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> in C. elegans strongly suggests that bcl- 2 and ced- 9 are homologous genes. Although the process of <b>cell</b> <b>death</b> controlled by bcl- 2 can occur in many cell types, there appears to be more than one physiological cell-death mechanism. Targets of cytotoxic T cells and cells deprived of growth factor both exhibit changes characteristic of apoptosis, such as DNA degradation. However, bcl- 2 expression protects cells from factor withdrawal but fails to prevent cytotoxic T-cell killing. DNA degradation is, thus, not specific for any one cell-death mechanism. The ability of bcl- 2 to protect cells {{from a wide variety of}} pathological, as well as physiological, stimuli indicates that many triggers can serve to activate the same suicide pathway, even some thought to cause necrosis, and not physiological <b>cell</b> <b>death...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background <b>Programmed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>deaths</b> in the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{are generally}} considered suicides. Dying cells are engulfed by neighboring cells {{in a process}} of phagocytosis. To better understand the interaction between the engulfment and death processes, we analyzed B. al/rapaav <b>cell</b> <b>death,</b> which has been previously described as engulfment-dependent and hence as a possible murder. Results We found that B. al/rapaav is resistant to caspase-pathway activation: the caspase-mediated suicide pathway initiates the cell-death process but is insufficient to cause B. al/rapaav death without the subsequent assistance of engulfment. When the engulfing cell P 12. pa is absent, other typically non-phagocytic cells can display cryptic engulfment potential and facilitate this death. Conclusions We term this death an “assisted suicide” and propose that assisted suicides likely occur in other organisms. The study of assisted suicides might provide insight into non-cell autonomous influences on <b>cell</b> <b>death.</b> Understanding the mechanism that causes B. al/rapaav to be resistant to activation of the caspase pathway might reveal the basis of differences in the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli of tumor and normal cells, a key issue in the field of cancer therapeutics.
