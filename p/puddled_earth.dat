60|$|First {{a number}} of boards two feet long, and cut to fit the grooves, were slipped down into them, forming a solid wall, and then upon the upper side of these the <b>puddled</b> <b>earth</b> was thrown down into the water, Terence {{standing}} below in the stream and pounding down the earth with a rammer. The success was complete: {{in a couple of}} hours' time the gap in the dam was filled up, and they had the satisfaction of seeing the little stream overflowing its banks and widening out above, while not a drop of water made its escape by the old channel.|$|E
50|$|Poured and puddled adobe (<b>puddled</b> clay, piled <b>earth)</b> today called cob, is made {{by placing}} soft adobe in layers, rather than making by {{individual}} dried bricks or using a form. Puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand based material worked into a dense, plastic state. These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and then later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Wood's Crossing and Whiskey Hill, ca. 1900 (ca. 1930 ?). In center a small <b>puddle</b> {{surrounded}} by <b>earth</b> and rock is all that occupies the riverbed. The farthest riverbank leads to an automobile parked to the left {{in front of a}} large tree. To the right of the automobile Whiskey Hill is sandy and littered with large rocks in the center, but covered with thick woods on the right-hand side, further down the bank of the dried riverbed. Photo file card reads "It was here in 1848 that the first gold was found in Tuolumne County. Saloons and shanties soon sprung up on the hill [...] but all is deserted now"...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} a mechanical approach for manipulating the capillary length and spreading of liquid coatings on flexible substrates with high gravity. Experimental verification {{in the literature}} has focused on cases under standard gravity on earth, and to the authors' knowledge, this work {{is the first to}} explore its relevance to spreading puddles under high gravity. By using centrifugation with a high-density liquid base underneath a coated substrate, it is possible to apply acceleration normal to a substrate to decrease the capillary length and increase the rate of spreading. Due to the nature of centrifugation, this method works primarily on flexible substrates, which bend with a curvature that conforms to a contour of uniformly distributed centrifugal acceleration. With high gravity of 600 g applied, the capillary length reduces by a factor of 24. 5, and the spreading shifts from "transient spreading" between the surface tension-driven and gravity-driven regimes to the gravity-driven regime. Experimental results show that high gravitational acceleration will enhance the rate of spreading such that a puddle, which would require 12 hours under standard gravity on earth to go from an 8 -μl droplet to a 40 -μm thick puddle, would require less than 1 minute under 600 g. Overall, this work suggests that previously derived expressions for gravity-driven spreading of <b>puddles</b> under <b>earth's</b> standard gravity extend to predicting the behavior of puddles spreading on smooth, wetting substrates exposed to more than 100 g's of acceleration.
