40|$|This study {{examined}} the energy use pattern of <b>poultry</b> <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> farms of Iran and ranked the selected farmers using fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA) {{from the viewpoint of}} energy efficiency. Since data used in our study were not measured precisely, fuzzy forms of them could help us to reach the ideal situations. Hence, the conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) was remodeled using triangular fuzzy numbers and finally the resulted efficiency scores of decision making units (DMUs) were compared. Those with efficiency score of less than one were reported as inefficient units and they were also ranked by calculating an index. The results of this study indicated that from 40 poultry farms selected randomly, 33 of them were inefficient. FDEA was performed using α-cut approach and eleven α-levels (0 to 1 by 0. 1) were examined. According to our results, the efficiency scores showed a decreasing trend as α- levels increasing to crisp situations. It is obvious that applying fuzzy data can show the real situation more accurately. Based on the results of this study, decision makers and farmers can improve their attitudes against energy use and applying well established practices. To achieve this, firstly, we should distinguish efficient units from inefficient ones. Keywords: Energy Efficiency, Fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis, Feed Intake, Poultry, Egg Production...|$|E

40|$|Poultry {{breeding}} {{presents an}} important part of agricultural production. Its importance is growing in relation with globalization of market. <b>Egg</b> <b>production</b> is {{a very important part of}} that. After a period of stable growth of <b>eggs</b> <b>production</b> during 80 s and 90 s of last century, we can currently observe stagnation and decline of the production.

The intention of each breeder of <b>poultry</b> <b>for</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>production</b> is to minimize the costs and maximize the production. An important tool for reaching this target is using the <b>poultry</b> <b>for</b> maximal possible period of time. That means for the second yielding cycle after molting. Although the yield of eggs during the second cycle is less frequent, the eggs are bigger and heavier. This method ensures costs savings in acquisition of new poultry. Any improvements during any faze of the <b>eggs</b> <b>production,</b> that would bring cost savings is highly appreciated. There was done a comparison of <b>eggs</b> <b>production</b> under the standard method and also under the method of using controlled molting and second yielding cycle. The project took three years.

40|$|A 7. 1 ha {{agroforestry}} {{field experiment}} located in south-western Germany demonstrates, how to combine short rotation coppicing for fuel wood production with poultry {{keeping with the}} <b>production</b> of <b>eggs.</b> This combined system offers additional ecosystem services and gives multifarious benefits. The agroforestry system has been established since 2009 by an organic farmer (certified) in close cooperation with the University of Applied Forest Sciences Rottenburg. While changing from indoor to outdoor housing required {{by the standards of}} organic farming the owner of the farmland wanted to meet not only with the standards, but additionally he wanted to fulfill objectives like: * Raising and keeping hens in a close-to–nature environment, * Finding a way, that hens exploit all the terrain available and not only those areas close to the chicken-coop, * Improving the conditions of the vegetation, soil and hygiene of the hens. The agroforestry system has been implemented based on two components: The first component consists of the construction of mobile chicken-coops (patent of the farmer). The mobile coops can be moved in their position over the experimental plots several times per year without much effort. The second component consists of strips of willows and poplars, which are managed by short rotation coppicing. Trees are harvested every 4 to 7 years and will be marketed as woodchips for energy production. The rootstocks will sprout again after harvesting. The trees offer several additional services in the agroforestry system: * Protection of the hens against hawks, sun and wind (animal health and survival) * Production of renewable resources (renewable energy) * Absorption of nitrogen from the excrements (nutrient cycling in the ecosystem) * Field integration into the country side (aesthetics and landscape planning) The whole experimental field was subdivided into 18 tracts of 0. 4 ha. Strips of willow and poplar trees have been established along the tracts. Between the tree strips there is enough space for moving the mobile chicken-coops. Every chicken-coop offers space for 1000 – 1200 hens. In total six coops are installed on the experimental field. The establishment of the trees and the selection of appropriate tree species and provenances have been difficult due to challenging site conditions and standards of organic farming: shallow soil depths, a high clay content and the prohibition of herbicides. Different techniques of non-herbicide-establishment of the short rotation coppicing system have been tested during the last years. For instance the use of mulch foil has emerged as the essential factor for a successful establishment and reduced mortality of trees under such difficult soil conditions. Willows and poplars helped quickly to create a structured field already after two years setting up the agroforestry experiment. In addition the hens indeed use the whole area for grazing and pawing. However the main aim of the adding trees to <b>poultry</b> keeping <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> is not raising the financial yield with the fuel wood production, but the keeping of the hens in a close-to-nature environment...|$|R

Consequences of these demands, particularly energy-partitioning during egg laying and incubation, are fundamentally important for arctic nesters. This study investigated differences in breeding strategies between Long-tailed Duck (Clangula hyemalis) and King Eider (Somateria spectabilis) in the central Canadian arctic. The focus was on ecological variables and influences of variation in nutrient resources used during incubation and <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Research was done at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, where both species nest sympatrically at relatively high densities, permitting comparative research about breeding strategies. This study used stable-carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotope analysis to investigate origins and allocation of endogenous (stored) and exogenous (external) nutrients used in <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Remote temperature sensors were placed in nests to estimate and compare incubation rhythms and gain insight into capital and income incubating strategies of both species. Results suggest that breeding Long-tailed Ducks and King Eiders used a “mixed” breeding strategy, that is they relied on both exogenous and endogenous resources for reproduction. Close correspondence between d 13 C and d 15 N values of egg components and potential diet items indicated that King Eiders allocated exogenous nutrients <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (albumen 98. 1 %, yolk protein 96. 8 %, whole yolk 98. 4 %, and yolk lipids 84 %). Female King Eiders relied on endogenous nutrients for incubation, as evidenced by high incubation constancy (96 %). Conversely, the range of d 13 C values in components of Long-tailed Duck eggs and d 13 C values of diet items suggested that although some females allocated endogenous reserves <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> most females allocated exogenous resources <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (albumen 98. 5 %, yolk protein 78. 3 %, whole yolk 84. 9 %, and yolk lipids 38. 3 %).
