5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour <b>porpoises</b> suggests that they mainly feed on benthic fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat benthic invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic <b>porpoises</b> are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's <b>porpoises</b> reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea benthic organisms.|$|E

Most of the {{population}} has been found around the Korean peninsula in the Yellow and East China Seas, although a freshwater population is found around Jiuduansha near Shanghai at the mouth of China's Yangtze River. Genetic studies indicate that the finless <b>porpoise</b> is the most basal living member of the <b>porpoise</b> family.|$|R
5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 <b>porpoises</b> per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow <b>porpoises,</b> and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of <b>porpoises</b> are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the <b>porpoises</b> are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, <b>porpoises</b> are {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but <b>porpoises</b> cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, <b>porpoises</b> in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Harbour <b>porpoises</b> have {{historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour <b>porpoises</b> kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with <b>porpoises,</b> and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless <b>porpoises).</b> Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
40|$|The {{implications}} of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) for reducing harbor <b>porpoise</b> bycatch in a multi-species fishery are investigated. Our intra-year bioeconomic model incorporates {{spatial and temporal}} patterns of abundance and harvest rates of commercial fish species and <b>porpoise.</b> Results indicate that <b>porpoise</b> ITQs, when compared to closures, are more profitable than closures, and distribute effort and profit reductions more evenly across seasons and areas. Price estimates for a unit of <b>porpoise</b> quota ranges from $ 1, 395 to $ 5, 782, for total allowable catches ranging from 951 to 209 <b>porpoise,</b> respectively. Total annual willingness to pay for <b>porpoise</b> quota is approximately $ 1. 25 million. ...|$|R

Similarly, the urine osmolality of Yangtze finless <b>porpoise</b> was also significantly {{lower than that of}} its marine counterpart (P[*]<[*] 0.05). However, the urine sodium concentration of freshwater finless <b>porpoise</b> was significantly lower than that in the marine subspecies (P[*]<[*] 0.01), even though their serum sodium has no significant difference. Moreover, the freshwater <b>porpoise</b> has significantly lower urine urea concentration but much higher serum urea than in the marine finless <b>porpoise</b> (P[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of other species of <b>porpoises.</b> A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's <b>porpoises</b> shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids.

5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. <b>Porpoises</b> are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, <b>porpoises</b> are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of <b>porpoises</b> are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is that <b>porpoises</b> have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. <b>Porpoises,</b> and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|Burmeister's <b>porpoise</b> (Phocoena spinipinnis) is {{a species}} of <b>porpoise</b> endemic to the coast of South America. It was first {{described}} by Hermann Burmeister, for whom the species is named, in 1865. Locally it is known as marsopa espinosa (thorny <b>porpoise)</b> and chancho marino (sea pig).|$|R
5000|$|The vaquita ( [...] ; Phocoena sinus) is a {{rare species}} of <b>porpoise</b> endemic to the {{northern}} part of the Gulf of California. The word vaquita is Spanish for [...] "little cow". Other names include cochito (Spanish for [...] "little car"), desert <b>porpoise,</b> vaquita <b>porpoise,</b> Gulf of California harbor <b>porpoise,</b> Gulf of California <b>porpoise,</b> and gulf <b>porpoise.</b> Since the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) is believed to have gone extinct in 2006, the vaquita has taken on the title of the most endangered cetacean in the world. It has been listed as critically endangered since 1996. The population was estimated at 600 in 1997, below 100 in 2014, approximately 60 in 2015 and approximately 30 in November 2016, leading to the conclusion that the species will soon be extinct unless drastic action is taken.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA finless <b>porpoise</b> (Neophocaena phocaenoides) was {{discovered}} in the coast of Yeon-do island, Yeosu-si, Korea on 19 June 2008. The finless <b>porpoise</b> (Neophocaena phocaenoides) was a juvenile. The body length was 126 cm and the weight was 24. 5 kg. In this study, the skeletal specimen of the finless <b>porpoise</b> (Neophocaena phocaenoides) was measured, described and analyzed. The {{purpose of this study}} is to offer basic data for the future research on the finless <b>porpoise</b> from Korea...|$|R
5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many <b>porpoises,</b> mainly the vaquita, {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues {{to be caught in}} small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour <b>porpoises</b> also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> are {{not very}} widespread, with many specialising near the polar regions, usually near the coast. <b>Porpoises</b> feed largely on fish and squid, much {{like the rest of}} the odontocetes. Males {{typically}} mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Some <b>porpoises</b> produce a variety of clicks and whistles, which are thought to be primarily for social purposes. A few species, like the harbour porpoise, are highly sociable, but pods generally do not exceed ten individuals for most species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor <b>porpoises</b> in the North and Baltic Seas are under increasing pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour <b>porpoises</b> from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The Harbour <b>porpoise,</b> spectacled <b>porpoise,</b> Burmeister's <b>porpoise,</b> and Dall's <b>porpoise</b> are all {{listed on}} Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In addition, the Harbour <b>porpoise</b> {{is covered by}} the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia. Their {{conservation}} statuses are either at least concern or data deficient.|$|R
50|$|The harbour <b>porpoise</b> (Phocoena phocoena) {{is one of}} six {{species of}} <b>porpoise.</b> It {{is one of the}} {{smallest}} marine mammals. As its name implies, it stays close to coastal areas or river estuaries, and as such, is the most familiar <b>porpoise</b> to whale watchers. This <b>porpoise</b> often ventures up rivers, and has been seen hundreds of miles from the sea. The harbour <b>porpoise</b> may be polytypic, with geographically distinct populations representing distinct races: P. p. phocoena in the North Atlantic and West Africa, P. p. relicta in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, an unnamed population in the northwest Pacific and P. p. vomerina in the northeast Pacific.|$|R

5|$|<b>Porpoises,</b> {{as opposed}} to their dolphin counterparts, {{generally}} do not thrive in captivity, and {{are very difficult to}} maintain. The reopened Miyajima Aquarium in Hiroshima (Japan) houses three finless <b>porpoises.</b> In the Vancouver Aquarium (Canada), there is a harbour porpoise on display, Daisy, who beached herself into Horseshoe Bay in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} Dall's <b>porpoises</b> {{have been kept}} in captivity in both the United States and Japan. However, these animals {{consistently}} failed to thrive. Captive P. dalli repeatedly ran into the walls of their enclosures, refused food, and exhibited skin sloughing. All Dall's <b>porpoises</b> introduced to aquaria died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Finless <b>porpoises</b> have {{commonly}} {{been kept}} in Japan, {{as well as}} China and Indonesia. Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. Japan has had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that <b>porpoises</b> can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.|$|E

40|$|Hundreds of harbor <b>porpoise</b> {{die each}} year as bycatch in the Gulf of Maine 2 ̆ 7 s sink gillnet fishery. In recent years, concern has arisen whether the Gulf of Maine {{population}} of harbor <b>porpoise</b> can sustain this level of bycatch. It is believed that the population may have declined, or is declining {{as a result of}} the incidental moralities. This paper reviews what is known about Gulf of Maine harbor <b>porpoise</b> demographics and how that information is incorporated into the management of the porpoise/fishery interaction. Included in this paper is a new study on the trend of relative abundance of harbor <b>porpoise</b> off mid-coast Maine 1982 - 1990. Sighting data from a commercial whale watch was used to determine changes in the relative abundance of harbor <b>porpoise</b> over the time period. Relative abundance was calculated as the number of harbor <b>porpoise</b> sighted per nautical mile. Mean annual sighting rates south of Mount Desert Island, Maine increased from a low of 0. 17 <b>porpoise</b> per natuical mile in 1984 to a high of 0. 54 <b>porpoise</b> per nautical mile in 1990, the last year of this survey. In 1982, the first year of the survey, the mean was 0. 30. The increasing trend may represent a redistribution of animals into the study area rather than a large-scale population phenomena. Harbor <b>porpoise</b> distribution may be related to environmental factors such as the density of prey species. to investigate this possibility, I compared the relative density of Atlantic herring, which increased during the survey period, to the relative abundance of harbor <b>porpoise.</b> Herring data was collected within a 30 mile radius of my study area. A positive correlation was found (r=. 96). This positive correlation indicates that the increase in the relative abundance of harbor <b>porpoise</b> may be related to the increase in herring, the <b>porpoise</b> 2 ̆ 7 s favorite prey in this region...|$|R
50|$|<b>Porpoise</b> {{returned}} to Fremantle, Australia on 24 October. On its return from Operation Rimau, <b>Porpoise</b> is noted to have encountered a small enemy convoy {{and later a}} large tanker. <b>Porpoise</b> declined an engagement at either opportunity as her orders were to remain hidden unless an important target presented itself. <b>Porpoise</b> {{is believed to have}} sustained unknown damages during the Rimau mission and was noted to be leaking fuel. Heavy weather was also encountered during the return trip to Fremantle. The submarine's journey was mainly on the surface during heavy rainstorms. <b>Porpoise</b> was required to dive somewhere in the Lombok Strait nearly losing control as it plunged violently in the strong currents and eddies associated with that strait.|$|R
5|$|<b>Porpoises</b> have a two-chambered stomach that {{is similar}} in {{structure}} to those of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porpoises,</b> {{along with}} whales and dolphins, are {{descendants}} of land-living ungulates (hoofed animals) that first entered the oceans around 50 {{million years ago}} (Mya). During the Miocene (23 to 5 Mya), mammals were fairly modern, meaning they seldom changed physiologically from the time. The cetaceans diversified, and fossil evidence suggests <b>porpoises</b> and dolphins diverged from their last common ancestor around 15 Mya. The oldest fossils are known from the shallow seas around the North Pacific, with animals spreading to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porpoises,</b> {{divided into}} seven species, live in all oceans, mostly near the shore. Probably best known is the harbour porpoise, {{which can be}} found across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|HMS <b>Porpoise</b> was a 10-gun storeship, {{formerly}} the Spanish sloop Infanta Amelia. HMS Argo captured her in 1799 off Portugal; <b>Porpoise</b> was wrecked in 1803 off New South Wales.|$|R

30|$|YFP and BFP are two <b>porpoise</b> {{subspecies}} {{living in}} osmotically distinct environments. Their differences in serum electrolyte and osmotic blood homeostasis {{suggest that they}} may have divergent osmoregulation strategies to adapt to their distinct environments. Based on our findings, conserving serum sodium appears to be essential for the freshwater <b>porpoise.</b> Conversely, excreting highly concentrated urine with much higher sodium and chloride content is the major strategy for the marine <b>porpoise</b> to release their hypertonic burden. Furthermore, serum urea appears {{to play an important role}} in maintaining the blood osmolality homeostasis in the freshwater finless <b>porpoise.</b> They have much higher serum urea but much lower urine urea than their marine counterpart. This study helps to shed light on the adaptation divergence of the finless <b>porpoise</b> in osmotically different habitats. It also suggests that further morphological and physiological investigation is needed on the osmoregulation adaptation mechanisms in these two ecologically different subspecies of finless <b>porpoise.</b>|$|R
