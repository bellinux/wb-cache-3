DiffServ policies concerning HTTP traffic are commonly focused on preferential treatment of short flows, which are more sensitive to Internet delays and congestion, whereas long flows are penalized by the application of best-effort policies.

40|$|The {{derivation}} of multiplier-based optimality {{conditions for}} elliptic mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) {{is essential for}} the characterization of solutions and development of numerical methods. Though much can be said for broad classes of elliptic MPECs in both polyhedric and non-polyhedric settings, the calculation becomes significantly more complicated when additional constraints are imposed on the control. In this paper we develop three derivation methods for constrained MPEC problems: via concepts from variational analysis, via <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> the control constraints, and via <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> the lower-level problem with the subsequent regularization of the resulting nonsmoothness. The developed methods and obtained results are then compared and contrasted...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue to the ill-posedness of inverse problems, it is {{important}} to make use of most of the a priori informations while solving such a problem. These informations are generally used as constraints to get the appropriate solution. In usual cases, constrains are turned into <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> some characteristics of the solution. A common constraint is the regularity of the solution leading to regularization techniques for inverse problems. Regularization by penalization is affected by two principal problems: - as the cost function is composite, the convergence rate of minimization algorithms decreases - when adequate regularization functions are defined, one has to define weighting parameters between regularization functions and the objective function to minimize. It is very difficult to get optimal weighting parameters since they are strongly dependant on the observed data and the truth solution of the problem. There is a third problem that affects regularization based on the <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> spatial variation. Although the <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> spatial variation is known to give best results (gradient penalization and second order regularization), there is no physical underlying foundation. <b>Penalization</b> <b>of</b> spatial variations lead to smooth solution that is an equilibrium between good and bad characteristics. Here, we introduce a new approach for regularization of ill-posed inverse problems. <b>Penalization</b> <b>of</b> spatial variations is weighted by an observation based trust function. The result is a generalized diffusion operator that turns regularization into pseudo covariance operators. All the regularization informations are then embedded into a preconditioning operator. On one hand, this method do not need any extra terms in the cost function, and of course is affected neither by the ill-convergence due to composite cost function, nor by the choice of weighting parameters. On the other hand, The trust function introduced here allows {{to take into account the}} observation based a priori knowledges on the problem. We suggest a simple definition of the trust function for inverse problems in image processing. Preliminary results show a promising method for regularization of inverse problems...|$|R

Two different cases are considered: (i) homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in convex, possibly non-smooth and unbounded domains, and (ii) general oblique derivatives boundary conditions in smooth, bounded, and possibly non-convex domains. In each case we give apropriate definitions of viscosity solutions and prove uniqueness of solutions of the corresponding boundary value problems.

40|$|As remarked by Ravallion (J Dev Econ 99 : 201 – 209, 2012), {{the recent}} switch from {{arithmetic}} to geometric {{mean in the}} aggregation of the United Nations’ Human Development Index has caused a more severe inequality <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> the index for less developed countries, with outlying consequences. We clarify and explain this fact and propose an aggregation function, the Trichotomy Mean, that depends on two parameters: one regulates the overall <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> disequilibria (among or within dimensions) in analogy with Atkinson’s inequality aversion parameter for power means; the other modulates the Level Dependence of the Adjustment, a novel concept describing the behavior—decreasing, increasing, or constant—of <b>penalization</b> <b>of</b> given disequilibria for increasing index level. Unlike the geometric mean (which, incidentally, has decreasing LDA type), the TM remains valid for zero or negative—and does not distort for small positive—values of the input variables, thus permitting less restrictive raw-variable normalizations and to overcome the need for exogenous lower bounds. We compare the three versions of TM with the geometric mean in an empirical analysis on the HDI 2014 data.

40|$|In 2010 - 2014, {{approximately}} 86 % <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> {{took place}} in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although abortion incidence varies minimally across geographical regions, it varies widely by subregion and within countries by subgroups <b>of</b> women. Differential <b>abortion</b> levels stem from variation {{in the level of}} unintended pregnancies and in the likelihood that women with unintended pregnancies obtain abortions. To examine the characteristics of women obtaining induced abortions in LMICs. We use data from official statistics, population-based surveys, and abortion patient surveys to examine variation in the percentage distribution <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> and abortion rates by age at abortion, marital status, parity, wealth, education, and residence. We analyze data from five countries in Africa, 13 in Asia, eight in Europe, and two in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Women across all sociodemographic subgroups obtain abortions. In most countries, women aged 20 - 29 obtained the highest proportion <b>of</b> <b>abortions,</b> and while adolescents obtained a substantial fraction <b>of</b> <b>abortions,</b> they do not make up a disproportionate share. Region-specific patterns were observed in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> by parity. In many countries, a higher fraction <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> occurred among women of high socioeconomic status, as measured by wealth status, educational attainment, and urban residence. Due to limited data on marital status, it is unknown whether married or unmarried women make up a larger share <b>of</b> <b>abortions.</b> These findings help to identify subgroups of women with disproportionate levels <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> and can inform policies and programs to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancies; and in LMICs that have restrictive abortion laws, these findings can also inform policies to minimize the consequences <b>of</b> unsafe <b>abortion</b> and motivate liberalization <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> laws.
