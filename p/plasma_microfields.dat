Although, for most plasmas of interest, the damping of the laser pulse is due to collective plasma effects, in certain regimes the energy absorbed in the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfields</b> can be important.

Line profiles, photographically recorded in second order, were compared with closeby wavelength fiduciaries from low-pressure rare-gas lamps. Electron densities for each exposure were found by fitting H-beta profiles to theoretical line shapes. Results, estimated reliable to 25 - 30 %, are compared with theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|Dielectronic {{recombination}} (DR) is {{the dominant}} recombination mechanism at coronal temperatures and densities. We present a procedure for calculating DR rate coefficients {{as a function of}} electric field strength and apply this method to carbon ions. We focus on the competing effects of enhancement by <b>plasma</b> <b>microfields</b> and rate decrease through collisional excitation and ionization. We find that, in the case of C(3 +), a significant rate enhancement results, leading to a reinterpretation of C IV emission-line intensities in the sun and late-type stars. We further consider how macroscopic electric fields, in particular motional electric fields, can affect DR rate coefficients, demonstrating dramatic rate increases for a number of the carbon ions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new {{expression}} for the Stark profiles of spectral lines in plasma has been {{obtained by the}} method of the kinetic equation {{taking into account the}} dynamics of the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield.</b> The result represents a dynamic line profile in the form of simple functionals of a static profile. The relation of the new solution with the known fluctuatingﰀfrequency method has been analyzed. It has been shown that this method is a discrete analog of the method of the kinetic equation and passes to the latter method in the limit of the continuous fluctuations. Simple formulas (4), (5), and (21) for dynamic line profiles provide ultrafast calculations of the profiles of spectral lines taking into account the dynamics of the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the electric microfield at a charged particle moving in a two-component plasma is calculated. The theoretical approximations are obtained via the parameter integration technique and using the screened pair approximation for the generalized radial distribution function. It is shown that the two-component <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield</b> distribution shows a larger probability of high microfield values than the corresponding {{distribution of}} the commonly used OCP model. The theory is checked by quasiclassical molecular-dynamics simulations. For the simulations a corrected Kelbg pseudopotential has been used.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of spectra observed in a corona discharge designed {{for the study of}} dielectrics in electrical engineering. The medium is a gas of helium and the discharge was performed at the vicinity of a tip electrode under high voltage. The shape of helium lines is dominated by the Stark broadening due to the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield.</b> Using a computer simulation method, we examine the sensitivity of the He 492 nm line shape to the electron density. Our results indicate the possibility of a density diagnostic based on passive spectroscopy. The influence of collisional broadening due to interactions between the emitters and neutrals is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The laser induced double {{ionization}} of helium is considered. We {{propose a}} heuristic nonsequential picture which explains {{the enhancement of}} double ionization rate in comparison with a sequential ionisation process. According to this picture the first electron reaches the continuum by field induced tunnel ionization. A rescattering mechanism, which is strongly regulated by electric <b>plasma</b> <b>microfields,</b> leads to the impact ionization or excitation of the single ionized helium. It is shown that the complex process of impact excitation combined with the tunnel ionization of the excited single ionized helium is the most probable process for not to high laser intensities. Simple analytic formulas for the ionization rate within these processes are given. The theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} the Li i 4 d– 4 f energy separation {{is essential for the}} determination of electric fields, as is pursued using several modern diagnostic techniques. However, there is a rather large spread in the values of this quantity in the available data sources. We have measured the Li i 4 d– 4 f energy separation using a technique that combines laser-induced-fluorescence with the utilization of collisional excitations. The plasma used for these measurements is laser-produced, which allows for selection of an electron-density range for which line shifts due to the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfields</b> are sufficiently small. An observation of the forbidden 2 p– 4 f line provides the information on the microfields that allows for accounting for the Stark-shifts and evaluating the 4 d– 4 f energy separation in the field-free limit. A comparison of the measured value with a few previous measurements allows for resolving the uncertainties in this quantity. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electric}} and magnetic <b>plasma</b> <b>microfields</b> on elementary many-body processes in plasmas is con-sidered. As detected first by Inglis and Teller in 1939, the electric microfield controls several elementary processes in plasmas as transitions, line shifts and line broadening. We concentrate {{here on the}} many-particle processes ionization, recombination, and fusion and study a wide area of plasma parameters. In the first part the state of art of investigations on microfield distributions is reviewed in brief. In the second part, various types of ionization processes are discussed {{with respect to the}} influence of electric microfields. It is demonstrated that the processes of tunnel and rescattering ionization by laser fields as well as the process of electron collisional ionization may be strongly influenced by the electric microfields in the plasma. The third part is devoted to processes of microfield action on fusion processes and the effects on three-body recombination are investigated. It is shown that there are regions of plasma densities and temperatures, where the rate of nuclear fusion is accelerated by the electric microfields. This effect may be relevant for nuclear pro-cesses in stars. Further, fusion processes in ion clusters are studied. Finally we study in this section three-body recombination effects and show that an electric microfield influences the three-body electron-ion recombination via the highly excited states. In the fourth part, the distribution of the magnetic microfield is investigated for equilibrium, nonequilibrium...|$|E
40|$|Broadband {{approximate}} expressions for {{calculating the}} broadening of the spectral lines of hydrogenlike ions in a multicomponent plasma are derived {{taking into account}} both {{the influence of the}} interaction between plasma particles on the distribution function of the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield</b> and the effect of the microfield dynamics on the broadening of the central component of the spectral line. With the approximate expressions proposed, the calculation of the shape of a given spectral line of a certain ion in a plasma with a given ion composition requires only a few seconds of computer time. The approximate expressions provide a good computational accuracy not only for the central component of the spectral line but also for the spectral line wings...|$|R
40|$|We review methodologies for {{describing}} dielectronic recombination (DR). We look {{briefly at the}} state-of-play of theory vs experiment. We then discuss how to deliver DR data in a form suitable for modelling and we review {{the status of the}} partial and total DR database being assembled for the modelling of dynamic finite-density plasmas. We comment on the role of fields and how modelling l-changing collisions approximately models the dynamic part of the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield.</b> We also consider the inverse process of photoionization and discuss how the same approach to DR is being used for inner-shell photoionization and the determination of opacities in stellar interiors. In particular, we pay attention to the role of opacity in connection with the discrepancy between the helioseismology observations and stellar evolution models for the position of the base of the solar convective zone...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{model is}} {{developed}} that permits {{the calculation of}} the radiation emitted by complex or highly charged ions in a plasma. The model {{is based on the}} usual separation of the plasma-emitter interaction into the homogeneous broadening effects of the fast electrons and the inhomogeneous broadening arising from slow ions. For plasma conditions where the ion motion can be neglected, the spectrum is the usual static line shape. To account for ion dynamics, the frequency-fluctuation model is introduced by decomposing the line shape of each radiative transition into a sum of radiative channels that are associated with the smallest observable inhomogeneities that form the static profile. The fluctuations of the ion microfield, the ion dynamics effect, is modeled by an exchange process between the static radiative channels. This results in both a smoothing and an overall coalescence of the radiative channels and depends strongly on an averaged characteristic fluctuation rate associated with the dynamics of the interaction of the local <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield</b> with the ion. This rate is formally related to the double-time field-field correlation function behavior. This stochastic model of the observed frequency fluctuations permits fast and accurate calculations of the emitted spectral profiles, including ion dynamics emitted by complex ions {{in a wide range of}} plasma conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{universal}} {{approach for}} {{the calculation of}} Rydberg atom line shapes in plasmas is developed. This approach goes far beyond the calculation capabilities of the standard models. It is based on analytical formulae for the intensity distribution in radiation transitions n − n' between highly excited atomic states with large values of principal quantum numbers n, n' 1, with Δn = n − n' n, and on the frequency fluctuation model to account for ion thermal motion effects. The theory allows us to describe a transition from the static to the impact broadening domains for every hydrogen spectral line. The specific cases of broadening of Hn−α(Δn = 1) and Hn−β(Δn = 2) lines are considered in detail for various values of plasma parameters. The line shapes are presented in a universal manner as functions of the relative frequency splitting and of the fluctuation rate ν of the ion <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield,</b> using dimensionless variables. For small values of ν, the static line shapes which generalize the well-known Underhill–Waddell data for the Rydberg state case are presented. For large values of ν, the transition to impact ion broadening is observed, resulting in a narrowing effect. A comparison with the hydrogen Hα line shape calculations shows a good agreement between the universal approach for Rydberg lines and traditional spectral line shapes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{introduce}} a full and closed system of atomic kinetic equations on fractions of atomic energy levels {{taking into account the}} effect of the <b>plasma</b> ions electric <b>microfield</b> mixing dynamics. The system of equations that we present is deduced from a full quantum multi-atomic states density matrix master equation. The analytical derivation of this atomic kinetic system of equations is based on the introduction of a new hierarchy chain of equations involving a new set of statistical atomic variables. The final system of atomic kinetic equations is obtained by introducing relation de fermeture to truncate the hierarchy chain of equations. We show that the final system of equations contains a new <b>plasma</b> ions electric <b>microfield</b> dependent atomic rates related to the process of mixing dynamics of atomic energy states. The analytical expression of this rate is given in this paper. We discuss the importance of the present analysis in view of the radiation emission originating from dense plasmas created by the interaction of the X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) with solid density matter.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we give {{numerical}} estimations of the <b>plasma</b> ion electric <b>microfield</b> mixing dynamics rate. This rate was deduced from a quantum atomic density matrix formalism and corresponds to the mixing dynamics effect of energy levels by the <b>plasma</b> ion electric <b>microfield.</b> The rate in question is {{to be added to}} the usual collisional-radiative model for the modeling of dielectronic satellites originating from multi-excited atomic configurations to diagnose high density plasma regimes generated by the interaction of X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL's) with solid density matter. The obtained numerical values of this rate are compared to usual relaxation atomic rates of the collisional-radiative model in the case of three atomic energy levels of the doubly excited 2 l 2 l' configuration of helium-like aluminium (Z = 13) : 2 p^ 2 1 D_ 2, 2 s 2 p 1 P_ 1 and 2 p 2 1 S_ 0. The comparison is made for different values of the electronic density n_e (10 ^+ 20, 10 ^+ 22, 10 ^+ 23, 10 ^+ 24 cm^- 3) and for the electronic temperature T_e = 500 eV. The numerical result shows that at high densities this rate is at the same order of magnitude as usual collisional-radiative rates and even exceed them in certain cases. This demonstrates the potential role of this rate for a better understanding of the heating mechanism underlying the evolution of a solid state matter to a plasma...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>plasma</b> {{electric}} <b>microfields</b> on line-like optical features arising from atomic levels above the ionization threshold are investigated {{within the framework}} of the quasi-static and single-frequency dynamic-field theories of spectral-line broadening. The 2 p(23) P to 1 s 2 p(3) P and 2 s 2 p(3) P to 1 s 2 s(3) S transitions in helium and helium-like ions are treated as examples. The mixing of the doubly excited levels in the perturbing microfields produces Stark broadening of the emission lines and induces autoionization of the 2 p(23) P level, which, unlike the 2 s 2 p(3) P level, is metastable against autoionization in the field-free environment. Determination of the complete Stark-broadening profiles in thermal plasmas is complicated by the need to include the effects of both the (quasi-static) ion and the (dynamic) electron fields. Under nonequilibrium conditions, where electric fields from either electron or ion plasma waves can far exceed nearby particle fields, the calculation and interpretation of the line shapes may be simplified and could provide a diagnostic probe of the wave-field properties...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhat {{is meant}} by {{continuum}} lowering and ionization potential depression (IPD) in a Coulomb system depends very much upon precisely what question is being asked. It is shown that equilibrium (equation of state) phenomena and non-equilibrium dynamical processes like photoionization are characterized by different values of the IPD. In the former, the ionization potential of an atom embedded in matter is {{the difference in the}} free energy of the many-body system between states of thermodynamic equilibrium differing by the ionization state of just one atom. Typically, this energy is less than that required to ionize the same atom in vacuo. Probably, the best known example of this is the IPD given by Stewart and Pyatt (SP). However, it is a common misconception that this formula should apply directly to the energy of a photon causing photoionization, since this is a local adiabatic process that occurs {{in the absence of a}} response from the surrounding plasma. To achieve the prescribed final equilibrium state, in general, additional energy, in the form of heat and work, is transferred between the atom and its surroundings. This additional relaxation energy is sufficient to explain the discrepancy between recent spectroscopic measurements of IPD in dense plasmas and the predictions of the SP formula. This paper provides a detailed account of an analytical approach, based on SP, to calculating thermodynamic and spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPDs in multicomponent Coulomb systems of arbitrary coupling strength with Te ≠ Ti. The ramifications for equilibrium Coulomb systems are examined in order to elucidate the roles of the various forms of the IPD and any possible connection with the <b>plasma</b> <b>microfield.</b> The formulation embodies an analytical equation of state (EoS) that is thermodynamically self-consistent, provided that the bound and free electrons are dynamically separable, meaning that the system is not undergoing pressure ionization. Apart from this restriction, the model is applicable in all coupling regimes. The Saha equation, which is generally considered to apply to weakly-coupled non-pressure-ionizing systems, is found to depend on the Thermodynamic IPD (TIPD), a form of the IPD which takes account of entropy changes. The average Static Continuum Lowering (SCL) of SP relates to changes in potential energy alone and features in EoS formulas that depend on the variation of the mean ionization state with respect to changes in volume or temperature. Of the various proposed formulas, the Spectroscopic (adiabatic) IPD (SIPD) gives the most consistent agreement with spectroscopic measurements...|$|R
