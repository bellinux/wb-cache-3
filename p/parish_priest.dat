The Christian protestors also clashed with police at St. Sebastian Church in the Permannur area of Ullal {{on the outskirts of}} Mangalore, shouting slogans and throwing stones at the police for their failure to arrest the perpetrators of the attacks. The police arrested several Christians after firing into the air and being involved in a lathi charge. A witness in Permannur claimed that Christians attacked the houses of Hindus in retaliation, shouting slogans against the BJP government. Four people of pro-Hindu organisations were reportedly injured at Kalladka and Attavar {{on the outskirts of the}} Mangalore when their vehicles were attacked and were pelted with stones. Ten people, including one of the Sri Ram Sena activists, were reportedly stabbed during the protests and according to the police, the situation was used by some to settle personal scores and not all stabbing incidents were related to attack on churches and the subsequent violence in the city. The Sri Ram Sena protested against the stabbing of one of their activists by organising a shutdown of educational institutions and shops. The district administration responded by declaring a holiday for all educational institutions in Mangalore taluk, and extended prohibitory orders under the Section 144 Criminal Procedure Code for two more days in the wake of the attacks and protests as a precaution.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the problem how <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> and female <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> respond to the trends {{in the number of}} the believers who attend their worships and the {{strategies}} used by <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> to keep the current number of believers constant, or even how to increase it. According to the results of population census the number of believers organized in three largest Czech religious denominations has been decreased in the last 20 years. The attitudes and opinions of <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> and female <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> on the number of their believers have been examined {{with the help of a}} qualitative research. Nine semi-structured interviews with <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> and female <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> of three largest Czech churches, which are the Roman Catholic Church, the Evangelical Church and the Czechoslovak Hussite Church, have been done. According to the obtained data we can identify two strategies currently used by clergymen. The first one is a passive approach to addressing believers during ritualistic religious ceremonies. The <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> and female <b>parish</b> <b>priests</b> who noticed a decrease in the number of their believers identify themselves with this strategy. On the other hand the other group is characterized by efforts to organize a huge number of cultural events and programs for the general public [...] . ...|$|R
