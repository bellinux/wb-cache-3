The proportions of exotic and native grasses, as well as their distribution, differed significantly among the plots. The distribution of the grass species varied according to the level of degradation of the creek bank, occurring more frequently where the bank had been disturbed. Therefore, we assume that grasses can be used as indicators of degradation in riparian zones.

With the aspects found in these authors, I created ten groups on Elan linguistic analysis software for the analysis of Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) poems. These were: glosses, sign repetition, rhyme, morphism, pauses and holds, movement size, movement emphasis, movement duration, visual sonority, and symmetry. The corpus of this dissertation is composed of two Libras poems, Nelson <b>Pimenta's</b> "Bandeira Brasileira", and Fernanda Machado's "Voo sobre Rio".

Para tanto, fez-se necessário, inicialmente, o levantamento e análise da legislação educacional federal e estadual sobre imigração. A pesquisa empírica foi efetivada em duas escolas públicas municipais, em duas regiões distintas, <b>Pimentas</b> e Bonsucesso, locais com grande concentração de alunos imigrantes bolivianos matriculados na rede. Foram utilizados três instrumentos de pesquisa: entrevistas e observação de atividades escolares e {{consulta}} a prontuários e cadernos dos alunos, Foram entrevistadas duas gestoras e seis professores alfabetizadores em cada escola: com as primeiras, pode-se caracterizar o contexto escolar; a dos professore foram divididas em três categorias, a saber: o que eles dizem, o que fazem e como fazem para garantir a alfabetização de crianças imigrantes em suas salas de aula. Com as observações, foi possível montar “cenas” do cotidiano escolar que foram transcritas e analisadas. A consulta aos prontuários serviu para verificar a cidade de origem da família e a nacionalidade de cada um deles. A consulta aos cadernos dos alunos permitiu verificar o seu desenvolvimento nas atividades propostas pela professora. A análise dos dados coletados foi feita utilizando as contribuições de Pierre Bourdieu e Gimeno Sacristán. Os resultados desta pesquisa permitiram compreender a lacuna que existe entre a política pública educacional e a escola quando se trata da escolarização e alfabetização de imigrantes não falantes da língua portuguesaThis study, {{taken into}} effect in 2014 and 2015, conducted {{the investigation of the}} schooling and literacy processes of Bolivian immigrant children enrolled in schools in the city of Guarulhos, which is situated in the great region of São Paulo, focusing on the pedagogic work accomplished with non Portuguese-speaking children. First of all, it was necessary the inventory and analysis of the federal and state educational legislation concerning immigration. Secondly, the empirical research was implemented in two public municipal schools, in two distinct regions, <b>Pimentas</b> and Bonsucesso, locations with great concentration of Bolivian immigrant students enrolled in the public schools. Three different instruments of data collection were used: interviews and observation of school activities and verification of school handbooks and students’ notebooks. Two school administrators and six literacy teachers were interviewed in each school. With the first interviewees, the school context was characterized; the interviews with the teachers were divided into three categories: what they say, what they do, and how they do it to ensure the immigrant children’s literacy in their classrooms. With the observations, it was possible to build “scenes” of the school daily routine that were transcribed and analyzed. The verification of the school handbooks helped to verify the children’s family city of origin and nationality. The verification of the students’ notebooks allowed us to verify their development in the activities proposed by the teachers. The data analysis was accomplished by means of Pierre Bourdieu’s and Gimeno Sacristán’s contributions.

40|$|Controlling the {{diameter}} and chirality of carbon nanotubes to fine tune their electronic band gap {{will no longer}} be enough to satisfy the growing list of characteristics that future carbon nanotube applications are starting to require. Controlling their band gap, wall reactivity and mechanical properties is imperative to make them functional. The solution to these challenges is likely to lie in smart defect engineering. Defects of every kind can induce significant changes on the intrinsic properties of carbon nanotubes. In this context, this thesis analyzes the effects of doping single and double walled carbon nanotubes with nitrogen and boron. We describe the synthesis of N-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWNTs), that agglomerate in bundles and form long strands (< 10 cm), via the thermal decomposition of ferrocene/ethanol/benzylamine (FEB) solutions in an Ar atmosphere at 950 °C. Using Raman spectroscopy, we noted that as the N content is increased in the starting FEB solution, the growth of large diameter tubes is inhibited. We observed that the relative electrical conductivity of the strands increases with increasing nitrogen concentration. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed novel features for highly doped tubes, that are related to chemical reactions on N sites. (cont.) We also carried out resonance Raman studies of the coalescence process of double walled carbon nanotubes in conjunction with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) experiments on the same samples, heat treated to a variety of temperatures and either undoped or Boron doped. As the heat treatment temperatures are increased (to 1300 °C) a Raman mode related to carbon-carbon chains (w = 1855 cm- 1) is observed before DWNT coalescence occurs. These chains are expected to be 3 - 5 atoms long and they are established covalently between adjacent DWNTs. The sp carbon chains trigger nanotube coalescence via a zipper mechanism and the chains disappear once the tubes merge. Other features of the Raman spectra were analyzed as a function of heat treatment with special emphasis on the metallic or semiconducting nature of the layers constituting the DWNTs. DWNTs whose outer wall is metallic tend to interact more with the dopant and their outer tubes are the predominant contributors to the line shape of the G and G' bands. (cont.) The metallic or semiconducting nature of the layers of the DWNTs does not affect their coalescence temperature. All the experiments and analysis presented in this thesis are the result of a collaborative effort between Professor Dresselhaus' group at MIT and its international collaborators, including Professor Endo's group at Shinshu University, Nagano, Japan, Professors <b>Pimenta's</b> and Jorio's group at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and Professors M. and H.

De acordo com os resultados obtidos, constatou-se que a citada enzima catalisou preferencialmente o etanol presente no meio reacional para a formaÃÃo do Ãster oleato de etila.

Several {{experiments were}} done aiming at the {{study on the}} enzymatic esterification of the oleic acid with fructose in ethanolic medium, focusing the synthesis of biodegradable biosurfactants. For that purpose, it was utilized the enzyme, Candida antartica B., at temperature of 55 ÂC, in reacting time of 48, 72, 96 e 120 hours. Accordingly to the obtained results it was verified that the related enzyme catalyzed primarily the ethanol present in the reactional medium to form the ester: ethyl oleate. This fact was confirmed through magnetic nuclear resonance spectra (1 H and 13 C) as well as, through infrared spectrum, {{by the presence of}} absorption peak at 1738, 4 cm- 1, characteristic of that ester. The results of the reaction of ethyl oleate production indicate that the highest yield was observed in about 96 hours time, and for the 120 hours time it was observed also an inferior yield. The experiments accomplished for the obtention of fructose esters from oleic acids in ethanolic medium were not successful like in other solvents not recommended for food use. The ethyl oleate shows a lipophilic character and in the food industry it finds application in the osmotic dehydration of tomatoes and peppers âdedo de moÃaâ, improving water release, sugar yield and solar brightness.

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} battle, Afonso Henriques {{is said to}} have called for the first {{assembly}} of the estates-general (...) of Portugal at Lamego, where he was given the Crown from the Bishop of Braga, to confirm the Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León. This was a patriotic falsification perpetuated by the clergy, nobility and supporters who promoted the Restoration of Portuguese sovereignty and the claims of John IV, after the Iberian Union. The documents that refer to the estates-general were [...] "deciphered" [...] by Cistercian monks from the Monastery of Alcobaça to perpetuate the myth and justify the legitimacy of the Portuguese crown in the 17th century. The author of this falsification was Oliveira Marques, and even in 1632 there were misgivings about the validity of the chronicler's account or the existence of the Cortes of Lamego The account continued to support the notion that in the 12th century a meeting of the Cortes occurred in the Church of Santa Maria de Almacave, in Lamego, in 1143. During this meeting, after being acclaimed by estates-general, Afonso Henriques accepted a group of laws on royal succession and excluded the Castilian line of Kings from the Portuguese throne, made provisions for the nobility, on justice and the independence of Portugal. But, even as Spanish jurists and diplomats later demonstrated that the document was uncreditable, the Portuguese defended the authenticity of the account. Alexandre Herculano later recounted the patriotic re-imagining in his História de Portugal, which caused its own controversy, and was later perpetuated by the writings of Alfredo <b>Pimenta</b> (who defended the existence of the Cortes of Lamego).|$|E

The varieties of the tomato and aubergine (Solanum) and the <b>pimenta</b> (<b>Pimenta</b> vulgaris?) are said (15/16. Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 72.) never to cross, even when growing alongside one another. But it should be observed that these are all exotic plants, {{and we do not}} know how they would behave in their native country when visited by the proper insects. With respect to the common pea, I have ascertained that it is rarely crossed in this country owing to premature fertilisation. There exist, however, some plants which under their natural conditions appear to be always self-fertilised, such as the Bee Ophrys (Ophrys apifera) and a few other Orchids; yet these plants exhibit the plainest adaptations for cross-fertilisation. Again, some few plants are believed to produce only closed flowers, called cleistogene, which cannot possibly be crossed. This was long thought to be the case with the Leersia oryzoides (15/17. Duval Jouve 'Bull. Soc. Bot. de France' tome 10 1863 page 194. With respect to the perfect flowers setting seed see Dr. Ascherson in 'Bot.
