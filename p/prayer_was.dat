5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common <b>Prayer,</b> <b>was</b> swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
5|$|Kenyon {{taught that}} Christ's {{substitutionary}} atonement secured for believers {{a right to}} divine healing. This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> understood to be a binding, legal act. Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E
5|$|Stark {{attributes}} {{the rise of}} the movement in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to several factors, chiefly that medical practice was in its infancy. Because patients often fared better without medical treatment, Christian Science <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> favorable in comparison. Other factors included that the church retained cultural continuity with Christianity by stressing that it was Christian and adopting its terms, despite the new content Eddy introduced. It was not puritanical. Members were expected not to drink or smoke, but could otherwise do as they pleased, and several exceptions to the avoidance of medicine were permitted.|$|E
50|$|Individual <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these <b>is</b> when <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.|$|R
25|$|<b>Prayer</b> may <b>be</b> {{expressed}} vocally or mentally. Vocal <b>prayer</b> may <b>be</b> spoken or sung. Mental <b>prayer</b> can <b>be</b> either meditation or contemplation. The basic {{forms of}} <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> praise, petition (supplication), intercession, and thanksgiving.|$|R
50|$|The aim of <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> that {{we should}} acquire from it love of God, for in <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> to be found all sorts of reason for loving God (Brock, 1997).|$|R
5|$|The Church holds three {{scheduled}} prayer meetings each day. The first daily prayer {{meeting is}} at 5:00a.m. and usually lasts one hour. The service includes a talk that {{is meant to}} recordar (remember) the material covered in the Sunday School. The 9:00a.m. <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> originally started by González's wife, Elisa Flores. A female church member presides over the prayer meeting, which includes a talk. The evening prayer has the same structure as the 5:00a.m. meeting. In each prayer meeting members {{are expected to be}} prepared with their Bibles, hymn books and notebooks and to be consecrated.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> shifted towards Mecca from Jerusalem {{and the most}} negative verses about Jews were set down after this time.|$|E
25|$|No {{first place}} in 1985. Drake's <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> disqualified after winning on handicap, but 1985 NOR did not allow for lower placed {{finishers}} to move up following a disqualification.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prayers</b> <b>were</b> offered. Until the English Reformation, the <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> {{addressed}} {{not only}} to God but also to Virgin Mary and the saints.|$|R
50|$|Morning Prayer and Evening <b>Prayer</b> <b>are</b> said {{daily in}} the Chapel, and the Holy Eucharist is celebrated Tuesdays at 7:30 a.m. and other weekdays (except Mondays) at 10 a.m. If Monday is a Holy Day, Evening <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{followed}} by {{a celebration of the}} Holy Communion. Morning <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> said 15 minutes before the Eucharist. This daily round of worship and <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> part of the liturgy or work of the Cathedral. The Chapel is open every day for personal prayer and meditation.|$|R
25|$|In {{the event}} {{one of the}} <b>prayers</b> <b>was</b> missed inadvertently, the Amidah <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> said twice in the next service—a {{procedure}} known as tefillat tashlumin.|$|R
25|$|All this {{served for}} {{external}} consumption. Within the community Ḥakhamim still taught that the Karaites were and {{have always been}} a part of the Jewish people, <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> in Hebrew, the lineage of Kohens, Levites, and families of Davidic descent were meticulously preserved, and books printed in Hebrew adamantly identified the Karaites as Jews.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Taymiyyah {{fell ill}} in early September 1328 and {{died at the}} age of 65, on 26 September of that year, whilst in prison at the Citadel in Damascus. Once this news reached the public, there was a strong show of support for him from the people. After the {{authorities}} had given permission, it is reported that thousands of people came to show their respects. They gathered in the Citadel and lined the streets up to the Umayyad mosque which was and is still close by. A Janaza (funeral <b>prayer)</b> <b>was</b> held in the citadel by the sheikh, Muhammad Tammam, and a second was held in the mosque. A third and final funeral <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> held by Ibn Taymiyyah's brother, the sheikh, Zain al-Din. He was buried in Damascus, in Maqbara Sufiyya (the cemetery of the Sufis). His brother Sharafuddin had been buried in that cemetery before him.|$|E
25|$|The Husaynid Beys ruled from 1705 to 1881, and reigned until 1957. In theory, Tunisia {{continued}} as a vassal of the Ottoman empire (the Friday <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> {{pronounced in the}} name of the Ottoman Sultan, money was coined in his honor, and an annual ambassador brought gifts to Istanbul) but the Ottomans never were able to depend on, or exact, obedience.|$|E
50|$|Beloved God <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{the name}} of a prayer {{composed}} by Meher Baba on August 25, 1959. The <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> one of three frequently recited at some gatherings of Baba followers as well as some individuals, along with the Prayer of Repentance and the Parvardigar Prayer. The three <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> repeated morning and evening at Meher Baba's samadhi in Ahmednagar, India.|$|R
50|$|The Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} {{individual}} <b>prayer</b> should <b>be</b> performed {{when one is}} alone, and when free of distractions such as {{early in the morning}} or late at night. Collective <b>prayers,</b> which usually <b>are</b> performed by individuals taking turns in reading <b>prayers,</b> <b>are</b> also encouraged; collective <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> usually performed at the beginning of meetings such as Nineteen Day Feasts, and Bahá'í administrative meetings. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, wrote that <b>prayers</b> may <b>be</b> addressed to God, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, or other messengers from God; he recommended, however, that the <b>prayers</b> <b>be</b> addressed to Bahá'u'lláh.|$|R
2500|$|The same <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{added to}} the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) ( [...] - [...] ) are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> omitted.|$|R
25|$|On the one hand, the Zohar was lauded by many rabbis {{because it}} opposed {{religious}} formalism, stimulated one's imagination and emotions, {{and for many}} people helped reinvigorate the experience of prayer. In many places prayer had become a mere external religious exercise, while <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed to be a}} means of transcending earthly affairs and placing oneself in union with God.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, the church's {{structure}} underwent greater centralization. Constitutional changes {{transformed the}} presiding bishop into an elected executive officer (formerly, the presiding bishop {{was simply the}} most senior bishop and only presided over House of Bishops meetings) and created a national council to coordinate the church's missionary, educational, and social work. It was during this period that the Book of Common <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> revised, first in 1892 and later in 1928.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to forgive}} is widely {{recognized}} by the public, but they are often {{at a loss for}} ways to accomplish it. For example, in a large representative sampling of American people on various religious topics in 1988, the Gallup Organization found that 94% said it was important to forgive, but 85% said they needed some outside help to be able to forgive. However, not even regular <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> found to be effective.|$|E
6000|$|... "To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> God <b>is</b> the one God.--To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> Mohammed <b>is</b> the Prophet of God.--To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> Time <b>is</b> {{flying from}} you.--To prayer--to <b>prayer!</b> Judgment <b>is</b> drawing nigh to you." ...|$|R
50|$|In Islam, Muslims {{of their}} {{community}} gather to their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead, a <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> recited and this <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> known as the Salat al-Janazah (Janazah prayer).|$|R
50|$|Today, {{perpetual}} <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} practice in many churches. Often the term 24-7 <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> used to express that the prayer continues 24 hours 7 days a week. A notable example of current day perpetual <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> the Jerusalem House of Prayer, International House of Prayer in Kansas City {{as well as other}} prayer houses such as the Justice House of <b>Prayer</b> that <b>were</b> inspired by this ministry. Many churches organize 24-7 prayer weeks that last for one or several weeks.|$|R
25|$|The Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church {{formed in}} 1880. A Portuguese {{language}} Prayer Book {{is the basis}} of the Church's liturgy. In {{the early days of the}} church, a translation into Portuguese from 1849 of the 1662 edition of the Book of Common <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> used. In 1884 the church published its own prayer book based on the Anglican, Roman and Mozarabic liturgies. The intent was to emulate the customs of the primitive apostolic church.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{into the}} new millennium, the {{conversation}} on a National level turned {{to the role of}} religion in ritual. In 1968, Theta Phi opened its doors to women of all faith and replaced the crucifix used in ritual to a cross. In 1988, there was discussion of removing the cross in ritual. The discussion was tabled during convention but it was decided that the cross would have a less prominent role in ritual In 1990, Theta Phi Alpha surveyed the sisters about the Catholic influences in the ritual. The most positive response was to adjusting the ritual to match the current views of the national fraternity, while the most negative response was to removing all references to God in the ritual. This dissonance between the sisters is still discussed today. However, Theta Phi Alpha is slowly removing religious aspects, in 1990 the Lord's <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> removed from the ritual. In 1992, the Theta Phi Alpha <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> removedand the following year a less religious ritual for deceased members and a nonreligious national philanthropy, The House that Theta Phi Alpha Built were introduced.|$|E
25|$|The eighteenth {{canon of}} the Council of Laodicea (between 343 and 381) orders {{that the same}} prayers be always said at Nones and Vespers. It is likely that {{reference}} is made to famous litanies, in which <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> offered for the catechumens, sinners, the faithful, and generally for all the wants of the Church. John Cassian states that the most common practice was to recite three psalms {{at each of the}} Hours of Terce, Sext, and None.|$|E
50|$|Sunnah <b>prayer</b> (صلاة السنة) <b>is</b> an {{optional}} salah {{that can be}} performed by Muslims at almost {{any time of the}} day. These <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> performed in addition to the five daily <b>prayers,</b> which <b>are</b> compulsory for all Muslims. There are a range of <b>prayers</b> available: some <b>are</b> done {{at the same time as}} the compulsory <b>prayers,</b> some <b>are</b> done only at certain times, e.g. late at night, and some are only done for specific occasions such as during a drought. All of these optional <b>prayers</b> <b>were</b> originally performed by Muhammad.|$|R
50|$|Some Sufis, however, {{have made}} a {{distinction}} between Al-Ishraq Prayer and Duha Prayer. According to them, Al-Ishraq <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> done after sun rise (around fifteen minutes after) while Duha <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> done much later.|$|R
25|$|When two or {{more people}} gather {{together}} to pray, their <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> called communal <b>prayer.</b> Examples of communal <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> the Rosary, devotional prayers including novenas and litanies, classroom prayers, and, most importantly, the Mass.|$|R
25|$|By 1840 William Williams had {{translated}} {{much of the}} New Testament {{into the}} Māori language. After 1844 Robert Maunsell worked with William Williams on the translation of the Bible, with Maunsell working on the translation of the Old Testament, portions of which were published in 1840. In 1845 the Book of Common <b>Prayer</b> <b>was</b> translated by a committee comprising William Williams, Robert Maunsell, James Hamlin and William Puckey. The full translation of the Bible into the Māori language was completed in 1857.|$|E
25|$|In the end, Rabbi Frank's <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> realized. His sons-in-law {{became the}} pillars of Torah Jewry through the next generation, and its guides after {{the ashes of the}} Holocaust. When the European strongholds of Torah were replanted in America and Israel, it was the sons-in-law and grandsons of Rabbi Shraga Frank who {{cultivated}} it. These four leaders were Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer of Slabodka and Kletzk, Rabbi Boruch Horowitz of Slabodka, Rabbi Sheftel Kramer of Slutzk and later New Haven, Connecticut; and Rabbi Moshe Mordechai Epstein.|$|E
25|$|From 1910 to 1940 various rooms {{had been}} hired for Jumu'ah prayers on Fridays. Finally, in 1940, three houses were {{purchased}} at 446–448Commercial Road in {{the east end of}} London as a permanent place of prayer. On 2 August 1941 the combined houses were inaugurated as the 'East London Mosque and Islamic Culture Centre' at a ceremony attended by the Egyptian Ambassador, Colonel Sir Gordon Neal (representing the Secretary of State for India). The first <b>prayer</b> <b>was</b> led by the Ambassador for Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Hafiz Wahba.|$|E
5000|$|Tarawih <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> prayed {{in pairs}} {{of two and}} can be prayed in at least 08/12/20 raka‘āt {{according}} to the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of Sunni Islam.

50|$|In {{comparison}} to other fields {{that have been}} scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research. If and when more studies of <b>prayer</b> <b>are</b> done, the issue of <b>prayer's</b> efficacy may <b>be</b> further clarified.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{a series}} of {{introductory}} <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> said as the start of Shacharit. The main pieces of these <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> Pesukei dezimra, consisting of numerous psalms, hymns, and <b>prayers.</b> Pesukei dezimra <b>is</b> said so that an individual will have praised God before making requests, which might be considered rude.|$|R
