5|$|<b>Pathan</b> had a quiet {{series against}} England {{following}} {{his return to}} India, taking 8 wickets {{at an average of}} 39.37 runs and scoring 121 runs at an average of 24.20 runs in three Tests. <b>Pathan</b> scored 52 in the first innings of the Second Test in Mohali, helping India to a first-innings lead and eventually a nine-wicket win. In the Third Test, <b>Pathan</b> managed only 1/84 in total and scored 26 and 6 as they collapsed on the final day and ceded their series lead. Again his ODI form was unaffected, taking eleven wickets at 15.63 in five matches, and scoring 123 runs at 41.00 with the bat as India easily claimed the series 5–1. <b>Pathan</b> scored 28 and then took 3/21 in a low-scoring 29-win in the first match, before scoring 36 and taking 4/51 in the third match in Goa. India then took an unassailable 4–0 lead by winning the fourth match, in which <b>Pathan</b> took 1/27 before scoring 46 in the run-chase.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathan</b> {{subsequently}} led {{the pace}} attack {{again on the}} 2004 Test tour to Pakistan, taking 12 wickets and bowling {{a higher proportion of}} maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India's first series victory over Pakistan in two decades. In the first innings, he bowled 28 overs and took 4/100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead. After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on, <b>Pathan</b> tied the Pakistanis down, bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2/26 as India secured an innings win. <b>Pathan</b> then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order, helping India to recover to 287. However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite <b>Pathan</b> bowling 44 overs to take 3/107, and the hosts went on to complete a nine-wicket win. In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi, <b>Pathan</b> took 2/49 and 1/35 in an innings win. He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28.50 and 64 runs at 21.33.|$|E
5|$|After his batting {{displays}} in Perth, <b>Pathan</b> {{was promoted to}} open the batting in the Fourth Test in Adelaide, replacing the struggling Wasim Jaffer and thereby allowing Harbhajan to return in a five-bowler attack. In a high-scoring match, <b>Pathan</b> took 3/112, but he struggled with the responsibility of opening, scoring nine and a duck. In a high-scoring match, he took 3/112 in Australia's 563.Following the Test series, he top-scored with 26 as India were skittles for 74 in the one-off T20 international. <b>Pathan</b> held {{his place in the}} ODI team and played all 10 matches in the Commonwealth Bank Trophy, scoring 118 runs at 19.66 mostly in the lower order and taking 11 wickets at 34.27 at an economy rate of 5.49. His best performance was a 4/41 against Australia at Adelaide to help restrict the hosts to 203 but India then collapsed to a 50-run loss. His top-score of 31 in the series came in partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the closing stages of a successful and tense run-chase against Sri Lanka. <b>Pathan</b> struggled in the two finals against Australia, taking three wickets at 39.00 at an economy rate of 7.46 but his teammates did enough to ensure a 2–0 win.|$|E
50|$|These non-frontier <b>Pathans</b> {{are usually}} {{known by the}} town or {{locality}} {{in which they are}} settled, e.g., Qasuria <b>Pathans</b> or Multani <b>Pathans.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first Muslim {{masters of}} Swat were non-Pathan Dilzak tribes from {{south-east}} Afghanistan. These were later ousted by Swati <b>Pathans,</b> who were succeeded {{in the sixteenth}} century by Yisufzai <b>Pathans.</b> Both groups of <b>Pathans</b> came from the Kabul Valley.|$|R

Most of these Pashtun communities are scattered throughout the Punjab and have over time assimilated into the Punjabi identity.|$|R
5|$|After scoring two {{consecutive}} ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka, <b>Pathan</b> was elevated to {{opening in the}} second innings of the Second Test in Delhi, after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness. Having taken 3/34 from 22 overs in the first innings, <b>Pathan</b> scored 93 runs, building on a first innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436. In the following match in Ahmedabad, he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall {{during the first half}} of the opening day. He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series, which India won 2–0. <b>Pathan</b> later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century. Following his strong performances in 2005, <b>Pathan</b> was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.|$|E
5|$|After taking 1/12 and 3/25 in warm-up matches {{against the}} Netherlands and the West Indies in the Caribbean, <b>Pathan</b> {{did not play}} a match at the World Cup, and was {{among a group of}} players to be dropped from the squad {{following}} India's exit from the first round. He played no part in the tours of Bangladesh and England. Instead, he was sent on an India A tour of Africa. Two years after devastating the Zimbabwean batsmen, he played against a Zimbabwe Select XI, he took only six wickets at 30.16 in two matches, and then took eight wickets at 18.12 in two matches against Kenya. India won all four matches, and <b>Pathan</b> scored 87 runs at 21.75. <b>Pathan</b> then took six wickets at 23.83 and scored 93 runs at 31.00 in four one-dayers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{performances}} in South Africa, <b>Pathan</b> was recalled to the ODI team and played in the home series against Australia and Pakistan in late 2007. He played in all 12 matches, seven against Australia and five against Pakistan. <b>Pathan</b> scored 131 runs at 18.71 in the lower-order and took 12 wickets at 46.00 at an economy rate of 5.02, averaging substantially worse than his overall career statistics. It was a steady performance; <b>Pathan</b> never took more than two wickets in any match and his economy rate was always between 4.60 and 6.66 and scored 26 and 29 in consecutive matches in Baroda and Rajkot against Australia before making 43 in the final match against Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|One notable {{thing about}} the Punjabi <b>Pathans</b> of Malerkotla is the fact the women {{strictly}} observe pardah, albeit {{they are no longer}} required to wear the burqa. In regards to language, Pashto was their primary language until 1903. Afterwards, the Malerkotla <b>Pathans</b> began to speak Punjabi and Hindustani. In the city, there are twenty nine shrines to saints from Afghanistan, whom the Malerkotla <b>Pathans</b> revere. Although the level of education is low among the community, many of these <b>Pathans</b> serve in the civil service, particularly in the Indian Police Service. Others maintain businesses, rent property, and rear horses. Because the level of religiosity amongst Malerkotla <b>Pathans</b> is high, many families sent their children to madrasahs where Qur'anic education is compulsory. For higher education, many children study in schools in Patiala or Ludhiana.|$|R
50|$|The 40th <b>Pathans</b> were an {{infantry}} regiment of the British Indian Army. It {{was raised}} in 1780 as Bengal Native infantry and then again in 1858 as the Shahjehanpur Levy. It was designated as the 40th <b>Pathans</b> in 1903 and became 5th Battalion (<b>Pathans)</b> 14th Punjab Regiment in 1922. In 1947, it was allocated to the Pakistan Army, where it continues to exist as 16th Battalion The Punjab Regiment.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Mughal Empire, many <b>Pathans</b> {{migrated}} from Rohilkhand. Bareilly (like other cities in Uttar Pradesh) experienced economic stagnation and poverty, leading to the migration of Rohilla Muslim <b>Pathans</b> to Suriname and Guyana as indentured labour.|$|R
5|$|BCCI {{announced}} on 13 July 2012 inclusion of Irfan <b>Pathan</b> in the Indian {{team for the}} tour of Sri Lanka as a replacement to the injured Vinay Kumar. With his all round performance, India managed to win {{four of the five}} ODIs and the lone T20 match in the next series in Sri Lanka. <b>Pathan</b> emerged as the top wicket taker with a 5-wicket haul.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{his career}} as a fast-medium swing and seam bowler, <b>Pathan</b> broke into the {{national}} team soon after turning 19, and evoked comparisons with Pakistan's Wasim Akram with his promising performances and prodigious swing. In early 2006, <b>Pathan</b> became the only bowler to take a Test hat-trick in the first over of the match (vs Pakistan at Karachi). However, the productive run did not last and after the start of 2006, <b>Pathan</b> began to steadily lose pace and swing, and his wicket-taking dwindled. Although Pathan's batting continued to be productive, he was not regarded as a specialist and was dropped from the team in both Tests and ODIs by the end of 2006, and by 2007 was no longer in the squad until return in 2007 World Twenty20.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathan</b> gained {{selection}} for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, {{but did not}} play {{in the first two}} Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth, <b>Pathan</b> replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh. He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted {{for more than two hours}} and was the sixth man to fall. <b>Pathan</b> rediscovered his ability to swing the ball, taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and <b>Pathan</b> was recognised with the man of the match award.|$|E

50|$|Subsequent to {{the reforms}} brought {{about in the}} Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's {{designation}} was changed to 40th <b>Pathans.</b> In 1904, the 40th <b>Pathans</b> proceeded to Tibet as reinforcements for the Tibet Mission Force. On {{the outbreak of the}} First World War the regiment was stationed in Hong Kong. It arrived in France on 2 April 1915, and within days, was on the frontlines. The 40th <b>Pathans</b> fought with great gallantry in the Second Battle of Ypres, where they suffered 320 casualties on 26 April, and in the Battles of Aubers Ridge and Loos. In December, the regiment left for East Africa, where they served till February 1918, and again distinguished themselves in the long and bitter campaign. The 40th <b>Pathans</b> suffered a total of 800 casualties (killed or wounded) during the war, while 1066 officers and men were invalided out of service due to sickness. In 1919, the 40th <b>Pathans</b> participated in the Third Afghan War.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the author}} of {{numerous}} books, including In Those Days, American Diplomacy in Turkey, The Way of the <b>Pathans,</b> <b>Pathans</b> of the Latter Day, and a series of novels featuring Dodo Dillon. He contributed articles on foreign affairs to a variety of publications.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pathan</b> {{made his}} name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh. Swinging the ball both ways, <b>Pathan</b> took 5/45 and 6/51 {{including}} several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory. He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, <b>Pathan</b> managed only five and four. He played in {{only one of the}} three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathan</b> {{received}} {{the award for}} maximum sixes in a match; he hit four sixes in the match. He was also named {{the man of the}} Match.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathan</b> {{was a part}} of the Indian squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka. In the Ranji Trophy 2012–13 opener against Karnataka, <b>Pathan</b> raised his First-class top-score to 121 with his 3rd {{domestic}} hundred. But, he injured his knee during match and only made comeback to cricket in March 2013. In 2014 he was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad to play in the Indian Premier League.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pathans</b> in Kashmir (also called Kashmiri <b>Pathans)</b> include Pashtun people (Pathans)who still follow Pashtunwali {{and speak}} Pashto as their mother-tongue who have {{settled in the}} Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir region of South Asia.

While exact numbers are hard to determine, cursory estimates put the number of these <b>Pathans</b> or Pashtuns above 100,000. Many of these <b>Pathans</b> have over time absorbed Kashmiriyat and use Kashmiri language as their first language , although some people following Pashtunwali customs and aspects of Pashtun culture and [...] Pashto are still notably practiced among the community, but are largely few in number and reside in certain areas only.|$|R

5|$|<b>Pathan</b> was {{recalled}} to the ODI {{team for}} the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August. This was Chappell's first series as a coach, in which <b>Pathan</b> played in all five matches and took 6 wickets at 33.83 at an economy rate of 4.41, but conceded 0/59 from nine overs as the hosts won the final. He scored 58 runs at 29.00 including an unbeaten 36 after India's batting collapsed in a loss to the hosts in a preliminary match.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathan</b> {{was rewarded}} with {{selection}} in the Rest of India team that played against Railways in the Irani Trophy {{at the start of}} the 2002–03 season. He took a total of 2/84 and scored 29 as the Ranji champions prevailed. He struggled in the Ranji Trophy, taking 18 wickets at 39.33 in seven matches. Half of his wickets came in one match against Orissa in which he claimed 6/31 and 3/46 in an innings victory. He scored 161 runs at 23.00, with a 54 against Tamil Nadu being his maiden first-class fifty, as well as two other forties. Despite a lack of wickets for Baroda, <b>Pathan</b> was selected for the Duleep Trophy, playing for Elite Group A. He took 5/88 and 4/106 against Plate Group A and 4/101 against Elite Group C, before taking 3/53 and 2/42 as Elite Group A defeated Elite Group B in the final by seven wickets. <b>Pathan</b> ended the tournament with 19 wickets at 27.00 and scored 72 runs at 24.00. In the one-dayers, <b>Pathan</b> also struggled for Baroda, taking three wickets at 64.66 in four matches at an economy rate of 4.85, but he was nevertheless selected for the zonal team, where he took four wickets at 34.25 in four matches at an economy rate of 3.91.|$|E
5|$|Since then, <b>Pathan</b> {{was dropped}} from the limited overs team and was then injured for an {{extended}} period, until he made his return to cricket in the Ranji Trophy in November. He played in six matches for Baroda as captain and was successful with both bat and ball, scoring 397 runs at 49.62 and taking 22 wickets at 18.54. In his most productive first-class season with the bat, <b>Pathan</b> made starts in eight of his nine innings, only failing to reach 24 once, and scoring four fifties, although {{he was unable to}} convert any to triple figures. In his fourth match of the season, <b>Pathan</b> top-scored in both innings with 68 and 81 as Baroda lost to Karnataka by an innings after making 153 and 223. He then took a total of 7/76 and scored 65 not out to secure a seven-wicket win over Saurashtra, and then totalled 7/96 in a seven-wicket triumph over Maharashtra. However, these performances were not enough to earn <b>Pathan</b> a Test recall. Furthermore, on 25 February 2010 the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced its list of 30 probables for the T20 World Cup to be held in the West Indies, the most notable omission being Irfan <b>Pathan.</b>|$|E

The Chhachh <b>Pathans</b> have very little in common with the Sagri Khattaks, as they are {{separated}} by the Kala Chita mountains. The Chhachhies are also known as Chhachi (Pashtun). The Chhachh have both Hindko and Pushto speaking communities, and have much in common with the Pashtun tribes settled in the neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Chhachh have Pukhtun culture and some people are following Pashtunwali code of conduct strictly like in KPK. Mostly <b>Pathans</b> in Chhachh came with Ghaznavi.|$|R
5|$|The Ranji win saw Baroda {{qualify for}} the {{following}} season's Irani Trophy where they took on the Rest of India. <b>Pathan</b> scored 32 in the second innings and took 3/95 and 1/34 in a defeat, but his performance reminded Test batsman V. V. S. Laxman of Zaheer. However, he was omitted from the senior team and {{sent back to the}} Under-19s the next week and stayed there for the next two months, playing eight double-innings matches for Baroda. He took 20 wickets at 20.40, including a best of 6/41 against Gujarat, and scoring 190 runs at 31.66 with a best of 63 not out. <b>Pathan</b> was then recalled to the senior team and made his List A debut against Mumbai, taking 1/69 from nine overs. <b>Pathan</b> further honed his bowling at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai, after being referred by Indian selector Kiran More.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} were further magnified in late 2006, when <b>Pathan</b> conceded 54 runs in six overs {{in the first}} two matches of a triangular ODI tournament in Malaysia. Despite scoring 64 in the top-order in the first of these matches against the West Indies, <b>Pathan</b> was dropped {{for the rest of the}} tournament. He appeared to have run into some form during the Challenger Trophy when he took five wickets at 15.80 at an economy rate of 4.64 and scored 95 runs at 31.66 in three matches.|$|E
5|$|With India's older players {{opting out}} of the inaugural World Twenty20, <b>Pathan</b> {{was one of several}} younger players to regain {{national}} selection. India were not expected to do well in a format that favoured stronger fielding sides. In the first match, he scored 20 and took 2/20 in four overs as India tied with Pakistan in the first round, before winning in a bowl-out. He then took 0/16 from two chamatkar as India lost to New Zealand before taking 3/37 in a defeat of England. India needed a win over hosts South Africa to reach the semi-final and <b>Pathan</b> conceded only 16 runs from his four overs, helping to restrict the hosts to 9/116 in pursuit of 154. <b>Pathan</b> then took 2/44, removing Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds as India managed to defend 188 for a 15-run win to reach the finals. India faced arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. <b>Pathan</b> was declared the Man of the match after bowling a tidy spell and taking 3/16, including the removal of Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and then the big-hitting Shahid Afridi for a duck in the space of three balls, before later bowling Yasir Arafat.|$|E
