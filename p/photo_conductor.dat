40|$|Two {{dimensional}} (2 D) materials bear a lot {{of expectations}} on playing important role in next generation electronics and optoelectronics. Driven by the thrust of this, this project studies the electronic and optoelectronic properties of 2 D materials through device fabrication with 2 D materials. Graphene and WS 2 are the representative 2 D materials studied in this thesis. In the study of graphene, a simple method to grow uniform continuous layer of graphene via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is developed. Factors cause micro-defects like cracks and holes in the graphene sheet are revealed. Our study helps to develop the growth and transfer method of producing chip-sized continuous single layer graphene. This growth and transfer method is currently used as the routine for high quality graphene production in our lab. The study on graphene device fabrication soon extends to device fabrication with other 2 D materials like WS 2. WS 2 <b>photo</b> <b>conductor</b> is fabricated with the CVD WS 2. Large gain factor up to several hundred is achieved in WS 2 <b>photo</b> <b>conductor.</b> A close link between the large gain and trapped states between WS 2 and metal contact is revealed. A photo induced Schottky barrier lowering is measured in this study. Subsequent studies aim to deepen the understanding on the relation between WS 2 microstructure and its electronic properties results the fabrication of in-situ electronic devices. A novel in-situ electronic measurement TEM chip is designed and fabricated. Our measurement reveals the detailed atomic structure of WS 2 after electronic break-down. Furthermore we developed a one-step method to synthesis WS 2 nanoparticles decorated graphene film by electric shock. Our in-situ electronic measurement concludes with a discovery of negative electronic responsivity in the conductance of suspended WS 2 single crystal domain. This result cast light on the fabrication of novel 2 D direct electron detector. </p...|$|E

40|$|The two lowest lying singlet {{electronic}} {{states of}} molecular oxygen O 2 (1 Δg) and O 2 (1 Σg +) {{are present in}} the atmosphere and undergo optical transitions to the ground state molecule giving rise to the atmospheric bands: O 2 (1 Σg +) ↔ O 2 (3 Σg -) (O,O) 762 nm and the infra-red atmospheric bands: O 2 (1 Δg) ↔ O 2 (3 Σg -) (O,O) 1268 nm. Possible mechanisms for the production of the excited species were studied in the laboratory. The reactions were carried out in time resolved flow systems and the species observed by their optical emission with the aid of photomultipliers and <b>photo</b> <b>conductors</b> in conjunction with phase sensitive detection circuitry. The ultra violet photolysis of ozone with λ = 253. 7 nm was studied as a source of O 2 (1 Σg +) and O 2 (1 Δg). O 2 (1 Δg) was observed in the photolysis of ozone-oxygen mixtures with λ = 253. 7 nm and its production was attributed to the energy transfer process: O(1 D) + O 2 (3 Σg -) → O(3 P) + O 2 (1 Δg). O 2 (1 Σg +) was observed in a system involving the photolysis of oxygen with λ = 147 nm by an analogous reaction: O(1 D) + O 2 (3 Σg -) → O(3 P) + O 2 (1 Σg +) The atom recombination reaction: O(3 P) + O(3 P) + M → O 2 (singlet) + M and the chemi luminescent reaction: NO + O 3 → NO 2 + O 2 + hν were studied but found not to produce significant quantities of excited molecular oxygen. The excited species have relatively long lifetimes and generally undergo physical or chemical deactivation reactions in preference to radiative transitions. The reactions of O 2 (1 Σg +) and O 2 (1 Δg) with ozone: O 3 + O 2 (1 Σg +) → 2 O 2 + O(3 P) O 3 + O 2 (1 Δg) → 2 O 2 + O(3 P) and the quenching reactions: O 2 (1 Σg +) + M → O 2 + M where M = O 2, N 2 and Ar were studied and rate constants evaluated. A value for the efficiency of deactivation of O 2 (1 Σg +) at a pyrex surface was also obtained and the rate of the energy pooling process O 2 (1 Δg) + O 2 (1 Δg) → O 2 (1 Σg +) + O 2 (3 Σg -) was estimated. The rates of the following O(1 D) atom reactions: O(1 D) + N 2 → O(3 P) + N 2 O(1 D) + Ar → O(3 P) + Ar O(1 D) + O 3 → O 2 + O 2 O(1 D) + O 2 → O 2 (1 Σg +) + O(3 P) O(1 D) + O 2 → O 2 (1 Δg) + O(3 P) were estimated. Calculations were carried out to test the importance of the various mechanistic schemes studied as sources of excited singlet oxygen in the atmosphere, In addition the major loss processes of excited oxygen molecules and atoms were calculated and the results compared with atmospheric data. </p...|$|R

Saturday, Jan. 24, in the Pavilion of the Performing Arts Center’s Christopher Cohan Center at Cal Poly. The concert, titled “Masters of the Mission,” will feature works that were reconstructed from the original sources in the missions by Cal Poly Music Professor and noted California mission music scholar Craig Russell. The Early Music Ensemble {{will be joined by}} a small instrumental group, including Russell on baroque guitar. Cal Poly Music Professor Thomas Davies will conduct the performance. Some of the repertoire for the concert is drawn from the manuscripts of Juan Bautista Sancho, a friar at Mission San Antonio in {{the first decades of the}} 19 th century, including a selection from his “Misa de Los Angeles” and “Credo” and “Sanctus” from “Misa en Sol. ” In addition, the ensemble will perform the mass “Misa del quarto tono para quatro voces” (“Mass in Mode four for four voices”). The music was found in the choirbooks of Narciso Durán, who served at Mission San José in the early 1800 s. Movements from masses by Ignacio de Jerusalem, the chapel master in Mexico City from 1750 - 1769, will also be performed, as well as a few selections in plainchant from the California choirbooks. Works from the Corpus Christi processions will be included. Parades and ceremony were indispensable tools of the friars in their goal to convert the native Californians to the Christian faith, according to Russell, who calls some of the parade pieces “quite lovely and lilting. ” The group will also perform a selection of villancicos by Manuel de Sumaya. Villancicos are church pieces meant to imitate in style the music actually heard in popular culture in the plaza, ranch, field or city street. Tickets are $ 12 for the public and $ 8 for seniors and students. They are on sale at the Performing Arts Ticket Office from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. weekdays and 10 a. m. to 2 p. m. Saturdays. To order by phone, call SLO- ARTS (756 - 2787). The concert is sponsored by Cal Poly’s Music Department, College of Liberal Arts, and Instructionally Related Activities program.

40|$|Because {{in modern}} copiers image quality {{is a very}} {{important}} issue, a lot of research is done in design of controllers that can optirnise it. The main idea with the OCE copier, which is the object of research, is that most processes involved in the image transport inside the copier are cyclic. There is, thus, reason to believe that errors will also have a cyclic behaviour. This knowledge can be used in the form of implementing repetitive contro!lers. Before research on these controllers can be done, the copier has got to be operational. The image transport system consists mainly of three units. The Organic <b>Photo</b> <b>Conductor</b> (OPC) unit, the Toner Transfer Fusion (TTF) unit and the paper feed. The main parts of the units are the belts on which the image is passed on. In this report is explained how the OPC unit is brought operational and what problems will arise when designing repetitive controllers for the image transportation system. The OPC belt will move axially from its centre due to several disturbances. This axial displacement can be corrected by making use of sensors and actuators. A controller has been designed that corrects this displacement. It is stable is test runs, but stabilit...|$|E
30|$|Often, {{the first}} step in {{document}} forensics focuses on source identification. The aim is to trace the source of the documents including the brand and model of the device. Typically, statistical characteristics of the printed characters are used to identify the source brands and models. For example, Delp et al. used gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) [2, 3] features, variance/entropy, and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [4] features to identify the printer source. Banding frequency is another characteristic used to identify the source as a laser printer. Banding, which appears as non-uniform light and dark lines perpendicular to the printing direction [5], is caused by fluctuations in the rotating angular velocity of the organic <b>photo</b> <b>conductor</b> (OPC) drum and by errors in the gear transmission mechanism. Delp et al. [6] printed pre-generated gray images and exploited the projection method and Fourier transform to estimate banding frequencies. Some researchers have also focused on hardware defects to trace the source; these include spinning velocity fluctuations of the polygon mirror in the laser printer and the imperfections of the paper feeding mechanism, which result in geometric distortions in the document that can serve to characterize individual laser printers. Kong et al. [7] established a projective transformation model to estimate such geometric distortions. Bulan et al. [8] computed the geometric distortion signature from printed halftone images to trace the source laser printer by estimating the variations in the center positions of halftone dots.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays it is unthinkable {{to live in}} a {{world without}} copiers. The {{customers}} expect increasing performance of a copier. This results in a machine with complex mechanical components. The copier that is relevant for this research is an 8445 copier of Oce. This copier can be divided into three main units namely the Organic <b>Photo</b> <b>Conductor</b> unit (OPC), the Toner Transfer Fusion unit (TIF) and the Paper Feed unit. The copy of the original document appears for the first time on the OPC belt and will from there be transported via the TTF belt to the out going paper. During the transport of the image on the OPC belt arise different problems that have to be solved. The OPC unit consist of several cylinders, which cannot be placed exact parallel to each other. This causes a displacement of the ope belt in axial direction. The beltfmally can hit the copier frame l'lnd will be damaged. The installation of a steering roller solves this problem in combination with a controller. Another problem appears when the OPC belt and the TTF belt making contact with each other. Both units are driven by two different motors. It is not possible that hoth motors give exactly the same velocity to each belt, there are always small deviations. To compensate for these small errors OCE has introduced a yoke. The installation of the yoke turned out to be not necessary afterwards, when a functional controller is used. One control strategy seems to be a serious option for implementation, namely Iterative Learning Control (ILC). Because the copier is set up of cyclic components and the interaction between these components causes errors that are expected to have a cyclic behaviour. This is suitable for ILC. Therefore a case study of ILC is worked out, to illustrate how ILC can be used and implemented on the copier in future research projects...|$|E
