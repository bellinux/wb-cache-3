40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) laminates {{are being}} successfully used for strengthening of existing reinforced concrete structures. Bond of the FRP reinforcement {{to the concrete}} substrate is of critical importance for {{the effectiveness of the}} technique. In this project, flexural test specimens were prepared to address some of the factors expected to affect bond, namely, bonded length, concrete strength, number of plies (stiffness), sheet width and, to a limited extent, surface preparation. Results are presented and discussed in this paper. A shear lag approach, along with a simple shear model for the evaluation of the slip modulus, is used to model the strain distribution at moderate load levels. Finally, expressions of the <b>peeling</b> <b>load</b> and the effective bond length are presented. A design equation is proposed to calculate the effective FRP ultimate strain to be used in design to account for bond-controlled failure...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The structural behaviour of simply supported reinforced concrete (R. C.) beams strengthened in flexure by externally bonded steel or fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) plates has been investigated. A novel theoretical model coupled with simple (hence, practical) procedure(s) for designing such beams against premature plate peeling failure has been developed. The theoretical model and the design procedures have been validated by an extensive number (169) of mainly large-scale test data (using steel or FRP plates) from other sources. The effects of variations in the magnitude of Young's modulus for FRP plates on the potential changes in the flexural ultimate load of R. C. beams with externally bonded FRP plates, in the absence and/or presence of plate peeling, have been investigated in some detail with the theoretical predictions of various failure loads and associated modes of failure supported by an extensive number of test results from other sources. Moreover, brief theoretical parametric studies for other first order composite beam design parameters have also been carried out in order to clarify the effects of variations in such parameters on the predicted modes of failure. It has been shown (both, theoretically and by using large scale experimental data) that the load bearing capacity for a plated beam could (under certain circumstances) be significantly lower than even that for the corresponding unplated beam with the mode of failure being of an undesirable brittle nature. Such brittle failures can obviously have serious implications in practice, where this method has been used extensively for upgrading both bridges and buildings {{in a number of}} countries, with the design calculations very often not having properly accounted for the possible occurrence of premature plate peeling phenomenon, especially when FRP plates have been used. Further work in this area included a quantitative theoretical insight into the effect of pre-cracking of the beams (under service conditions) on the ultimate plate <b>peeling</b> <b>load.</b> A critical quantitative examination of a number of previously available theoretical models, as proposed by others, has also been carried out, and some of these models for predicting the plate peeling failure of R. C. beams have been shown to suffer from rather serious shortcomings...|$|E
30|$|Secondly, the peel {{strengths}} {{obtained from}} the CPT are significantly lower than from the FRPT, even if the percentage of failure modes is similar. As it has been addressed in previous studies of the authors, <b>peel</b> <b>loads</b> can differ significantly when peeling off different adherend materials, {{and it does not}} mean a poor interface adhesion [12]. <b>Peel</b> <b>loads</b> can only be compared if using exactly the same type of flexible adherend (peeling off member).

This potential drawback is overcome in the present paper, which reports details of some simplified (but still reasonably accurate) procedures for predicting the lower bound (i. e. safe) steel or FRP plate <b>peeling</b> <b>loads,</b> with the proposed formulations being amenable to hand calculations, using a pocket calculator, hence, of value to busy practising engineers...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) {{have been}} used to {{externally}} reinforce concrete beams, it has been known that the strength of the bond is what controls the design. Recently, it has been proven that the primary mode of debonding failure is cohesive failure within the concrete substrate close to the FRP/concrete interface. To further enhance the research in this area, finite element analysis has been used to help study this debonding phenomenon. This thesis is a parametric study of the FRP/concrete interface using finite element analysis software. The finite element model was calibrated using experimental data. The parameters taken into consideration were the geometric configuration of the materials (thickness), the material properties (Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus), the effects of the cohesive zone elements (maximum stress and its corresponding displacement), and finally mixed mode loading conditions. Conclusions were then made concerning the effects of adjusting the parameters of the model. By increasing the respective thicknesses of the FRP, adhesive, and residual thickness of concrete, the maximum <b>peel</b> <b>load</b> was increased, however, debonding was also faster. In general, increasing Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus of the individual materials had the same effect, increasing the maximum <b>peel</b> <b>load.</b> Mode II loading in the mixed mode loading conditions has a severe impact on the bond behavior, reducing the maximum <b>peel</b> <b>load</b> for initial debonding...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive joining {{is today}} viewed {{as one of}} the key {{technologies}} to achieve decreased emissions in the automobile industry. To decrease weight, optimal material selection often results in different materials for different parts. This leads to the necessity to join mixed material. Here, the use of adhesives is the most promising joining technology. For a rational design process, good models for strength analysis of adhesively joined structures are essential. With cohesive modelling, fracture of the adhesive layer is modelled with a stress-deformation law. This law - often denoted a cohesive law - gives the traction exerted on the adherends due to the deformation of the adhesive layer. This thesis is concerned with experimental methods to measure cohesive properties of engineering adhesives and standardized methods to measure the fracture energy of adhesives. A new method to measure cohesive laws is developed. With this method, the cohesive law of an epoxy adhesive is measured in shear. In <b>peel</b> <b>loading,</b> with elastically deforming adherends, the cohesive law is shown to be independent of the geometry of the specimen. If the adherends deform plastically the fracture energy increases. Experiments are performed {{in order to determine the}} temperature dependence of the cohesive layer for an epoxy adhesive. It is shown that the peak stress is strongly dependent on the temperature while the fracture energy shows only small temperature dependence. Experiments are also performed to study the influence of strain rate in <b>peel</b> and shear <b>loading.</b> The experiments show that the peak stress increases with an increasing strain rate and that the fracture energy increase in <b>peel</b> <b>loading</b> and decreases in shear with increasing strain rate. A new method to experimentally determine the relation between damage and plasticity in the adhesive during the fracture process is developed. For the present adhesive, it is shown that only minor plasticity occurs during the fracture process in <b>peel</b> <b>loading.</b> For <b>peel,</b> several commonly used methods to evaluate the fracture energy using the double cantilever beam specimen are critically studied. For some methods the error in evaluated fracture energy is larger than 40 %. It is shown that the evaluated fracture energy is more dependent on the choice of method than on the cohesive properties of the adhesive layer...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article aims {{to analyze}} the {{difference}} in stresses generated in the bracket-cement-tooth system {{by means of a}} <b>peel</b> <b>load</b> in single and double-mesh bracket bases using a three-dimensional finite element computer model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A three-dimensional finite element model of the bracket-cement-tooth system was constructed and consisted of 40, 536 bonds and 49, 201 finite elements using a commercial mesh generating programmer (ANSYS 7. 0). Both single and double-mesh bracket bases were modified by varying the diameter from 100 - 400 &# 181;m progressively, and the spacing between the mesh wires was kept at 300 &# 181;m for each diameter of wire. A <b>peel</b> <b>load</b> was applied on the model to study the stresses generated in different layers. RESULTS: In case of double-mesh bracket base, there was reduction in stress generation at the enamel in comparison to single-mesh bracket base. There was no difference in stress generated at the bracket layer between single and double-mesh bracket bases. At the impregnated wire mesh (IWM), layer stresses increased as the wire diameter of the mesh increased. CONCLUSION: Results show that bracket design modification can improve bonding abilities and simultaneously reduce enamel damage while debonding. These facts may be used in bringing about the new innovative bracket designs for clinical use...|$|R

Fibre-reinforced composite materials are extensively {{used in many}} industries, such as boat building, automotive and aeronautical. Although the manufacturing methods reduce the connections to the minimum, these are still necessary due to component size and design, technological and logistical limitations. Frequently, the combination of composites with metals such as aluminium or titanium brings design benefits. This work aims to study, by experimentation and cohesive zone modelling (CZM), single-L adhesive joints between aluminium components and carbon-epoxy composites under a <b>peel</b> <b>loading,</b> considering different joint configurations and adhesives of distinct ductility.

For metal bonding, a widely accepted industrial test {{to secure a}} proper bond is the standard floating roller peel test [1]. A cohesive failure when peeling-off the aluminium part ensures that the adherends are properly bonded and that this bond will endure. This is a fast and reliable test to assess metal bonding adhesion. Significant research has been performed using these type of peel test for metal bonding with diverse objectives, including adhesives screening, effect of surface pre-treatments, bond durability, etc. [2 - 4]. Diverse studies have also investigated the adherends effects in the floating roller peel test.

40|$|Methods {{to assess}} the fatigue {{strength}} of spot welds in built-up structures are used {{on a daily basis}} in the automotive industry. Efficient and reliable numerical methods make it possible to achieve designs with low weight, low manufacturing costs and good durability within short development cycles, since the number of prototypes built can be reduced. To refine the existing methods further, this thesis investigates the fatigue behaviour of spot welded joints. Experiments as well as three-dimensional elastic and elastic-plastic finite element simulations were carried out to investigate the influence of welding residual stresses, spatial variation in yield stress, and fatigue properties on fatigue crack initiation at spot welds. It was found that tensile residual stresses relax for higher loads, and that linear elastic fracture mechanics could be used to predict the early growth of fatigue cracks initiating at the spot weld perimeter. The fatigue crack propagation through the sheet thickness at <b>peel</b> and shear <b>loaded</b> spot welds was then studied experimentally with interrupted fatigue tests. These tests showed that fatigue life was much shorter for a shear loaded weld than for a <b>peel</b> <b>loaded</b> one when both were subjected to the same initial stress intensity factor range. This was taken into account by a new fatigue life prediction method for built-up structures. A new shear correction factor takes the crack propagation into account, although only the initial stress intensity factor range is used for the fatigue life prediction. The method was verified with fatigue data from eight specimens. The effects of mean stress on the fatigue life of <b>peel</b> and shear <b>loaded</b> welds were investigated experimentally. The results observed could be explained by crack closure. This was found both experimentally and with elastic-plastic finite element simulations. Fatigue tests with variable amplitude loads were also conducted. It was found that the Palmgren-Miner cumulative damage rule can give non-conservative results by up to a factor of four, because of load interaction effects. To avoid this, a new fatigue life prediction method for variable amplitude fatigue of spot welds was developed and verified experimentally. The method is based on crack closure and linear damage accumulation...|$|R

40|$|A {{procedure}} is {{proposed for the}} identification of spatial interfacial traction profiles of <b>peel</b> <b>loaded</b> Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) samples, from which the corresponding traction-separation relation is extracted. The procedure draws upon recent developments {{in the area of}} non-contact optical techniques and makes use of so-called Integrated Digital Image Correlation (I-DIC) concepts. The distinctive feature of the I-DIC approach proposed herein is that the unknown degrees of freedom are not displacements or rotations, but the set of interfacial fracture properties describing the traction profile. A closed-form theoretical model is developed to reconstruct a mechanically admissible displacement field representing the deformation of the adhering layers during debonding in the DCB fracture test. The proposed modeling accounts for the spatial traction profile along the interface between the adherends using few degrees of freedom, i. e. crack tip position, maximum stress and size of the process zone. By minimizing the correlation residual with respect to the degrees of freedom, the full set of interfacial fracture properties is obtained through a one-step algorithm, revealing a substantial gain in terms of computational efficiency and robustness. It is shown that the identified traction profile can be effectively combined with the crack opening displacement to extract the corresponding traction-separation relation, i. e. the key input data for any cohesive zone model (CZM). The proposed {{procedure is}} validated by post-processing virtually deformed images generated through the finite element method. The robustness with respect to noisy data, as well as the low sensitivity to the initial guess, are demonstrated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this study, honeycomb cores were manufactured from sawdust-polypropylene composites. The composites were thermoformed between matched-dies into half hexagonal profiles which were ultrasonically bonded at their nodes and facesheets to form recyclable sandwich panels. As the bonding efficiency at the nodes and the core-to-facing interface will {{be governed by}} several process parameters, an L 8 partial factorial and full factorial design of experiments (DoE) based on the Taguchi method was used. Single lap shear {{test was used to}} determine the shear strength of the bond at the nodes, and climbing drum peel test was used to determine the skin-to-core bonding strength in the sandwich panels. The energy absorption characteristic of the honeycombs was determined experimentally by subjecting them to quasi-static compressive loads. The effect of the thickness-to-length ratio (t/l) of the cell walls on the energy absorption was evaluated using finite element (FE) modelling, and energy absorption maps were constructed for various t/l ratios.

A model was developed to establish criteria for damage, which take into account viscoelastic fatigue, and to establish safe rates of change for environmental parameters. To establish the methodology, the investigation focused on modern paintings executed in mixed media. In particular, acrylic gesso grounds with superimposed alkyd paint layers on canvas were investigated, which have been found to be vulnerable to stresses and delamination. Data from uniaxial testing of free-standing paint films were used to determine the constitutive properties of the paint. The effects of temperature, strain rate and age on the tensile properties were investigated. Results from peel tests, performed to determine the energy release rate of the interface between the paint and gesso layers, are reported. The peel tests were modelled using Finite Element Analysis with cohesive zone elements at the interface in a commercial finite element software Abaqus. The value of the maximum traction in the traction-separation law was determined by comparing numerical and experimental <b>peel</b> <b>loads</b> and the cohesive energy was determined using an established analytical method. The cohesive zone properties determined from the peel tests, and the calibrated constitutive model for the alkyd paint, were used in a separate finite element model of a coating on a primed canvas substrate subjected to combined cyclic hygrothermal and static mechanical loadings typically experienced by fine art paintings; interface separation was controlled by an irreversible cohesive zone model that includes damage accumulation due to cyclic loading.

The aim with this thesis is concerned with the development of simulation models of the joining process as well as mechanical properties of self piercing riveted (SPR) joints and pierce nut joints. In both of these joining methods problems occur when introducing more high strength steel sheets. For SPR, fractures occur in the rivet, and for pierce nut the thread will be damaged. Since both the SPR process and the pierce nut process expose the material for plastic deformation up to 150 %, correct material properties for very large strain and a simulation program that could handle this was required. With the commercial finite element program Deform 2 D an axi-symmetric model has been built for the SPR process and the pierce nut process. Because of the computational time, 3 D simulations were only used where it was necessary. The developed 3 D models use the commercial finite element program ABAQUS-Explicit. All simulation models have been verified with satisfactory agreement to experimental results. For SPR, an axi-symmetric simulation model was used for evaluating and optimising the setting process in the stainless steel sheets EN 1. 4301, HyTens 800 and HyTens 1200. Subsequently, 3 D models were used for predicting the mechanical properties of new SPR joints that have showed reduced risk for rivet cracking. In pierce nut simulations, nuts with hardness 8 and 10 have been set in the high strength steel sheet DP 600. An axi-symmetric simulation model was used for centred nut setting and two different simulation models in 3 D were used to evaluate eccentric nut setting and torque resistance. This work resulted in more knowledge about the fracture risk in the rivet and how to reduce it. The strain and stress, which was used as fracture indicators, were reduced to the half with modifications of the rivet and the die geometry. Mechanical property simulations in shear and <b>peel</b> <b>load</b> resulted in satisfactory results for new SPR joints that have showed reduced fracture risk during rivet setting. New die and rivet designs can be developed effectively by combining the process and mechanical property simulations. For a pierce nut joint in high strength steel sheets (1. 5 mm DP 600), the simulations show that the cutting of the sheet in combination with eccentric setting over the die causes the thread damage. The thread damage can be avoided by changing the dimension of the nut or by increasing the strength of the nut material. The simulation models can also be used to develop new nut and die geometries for future applications. QC 2010111...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{in vitro}} {{the influence of}} fiber reinforcement on the failure loads of resin composite beams, simulating cantilevered two-unit resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses, and compare the results with similarly obtained failure loads of ZrO 2 and CoCr beams of a comparable design. Materials and Methods: Peel tests were performed using resin composite, fiber-reinforced resin composite, and zirconia beams, simulating two-unit cantilevered resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses, luted with Panavia F 2. 0 onto flat-ground buccal surfaces of bovine mandibular incisors. The recorded failure loads were {{compared with those of}} CoCr beams of a similar size and design from earlier research. Finite element analysis revealed the stress concentrations within the cement layers at failure. Results: The failure loads (N) of the peel tests, depending on the beam type and including the type of failure, were statistically analyzed. The highest failure values were obtained with the fiber-reinforced resin composite beams, which were luted with the exposed fibers directly on the bovine enamel. Finite element analysis showed that peak stress locations depend on the beam type and facilitate the explanation of the different failure modes. Conclusion: Fiber-reinforcement of simulated two-unit cantilevered resin composite resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses does not necessarily lead to higher failure loads. This study identified significant differences in <b>peel</b> failure <b>loads</b> between identical specimens, depending on whether or not the fiber reinforcement was exposed on the luting surface. Further research needs to be carried out regarding the combination of resin composite and fiber reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} predict the {{mechanical}} behavior of adhesively bonded joints, {{it is necessary to}} develop robust numerical models. This robustness is only reached if an extensive experimental database with tensile, shear and complex combined <b>peel</b> and shear <b>loads</b> can be established. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present a multi axial device for testing adhesively bonded joints, using KS 2 -type specimens traditionally utilized for spot-weld characterization. The tests were conducted on a glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic polymer (PA 6 - 6) composite adhesively bonded with a flexible polyurethane adhesive. This adhesive/substrate combination allows short process times and good performances. This experimental study investigates the effects of axial and shear load, loading speed, temperature and adhesive thickness on the mechanical properties of the joints which are compared in terms of stiffness and ultimate strength. Results show that the strength of the assemblies largely depends on the load orientation, the joint thickness, the loading speed and also the test temperature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn exact {{theory of}} {{interfacial}} debonding is developed for a layered composite system consisting of distinct linear elastic slabs separated by nonlinear, nonuniform decohesive interfaces. Loading {{of the top}} and bottom external surfaces is defined pointwise while loading of the side surfaces is prescribed in the form of resultants. The work is motivated by the desire to develop a general tool to analyze the detailed features of debonding along uniform and nonuniform straight interfaces in slab systems subject to general loading. The methodology allows for the investigation of both solitary defect as well as multiple defect interaction problems. Interfacial integral equations, governing the normal and tangential displacement jump components at an interface of a slab system are developed from the Fourier series solution for the single slab subject to arbitrary loading on its surfaces. Interfaces are characterized by distinct interface force–displacement jump relations with crack-like defects modeled by an interface strength which varies with interface coordinate. Infinitesimal strain equilibrium solutions, which account for rigid body translation and rotation, are sought by eigenfunction expansion of the solution of the governing interfacial integral equations. Applications of the theory to the bilayer problem with a solitary defect or a defect pair, in both <b>peeling</b> and mixed <b>load</b> configurations are presented...|$|R
