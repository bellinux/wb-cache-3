5|$|The UERL had {{financial}} problems. Ticket {{prices were}} low and passenger numbers were significantly below the <b>pre-opening</b> estimates. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly {{the result of}} competition between the UERL's lines {{and those of the}} other tube and sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening {{was not the}} financial success that had been expected. In the Hampstead Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 25million passengers, just half of the 50million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's <b>pre-opening</b> predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway in only seven years, its opening {{did not bring}} the financial success that had been expected. In the Piccadilly Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 26million passengers, {{less than half of}} the 60million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's <b>pre-opening</b> predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR – in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets.|$|E

5000|$|After having {{accomplished}} numerous {{projects in}} Greece and Europe, in 2005 Bekris {{was invited to}} move to Dubai, UAE to join the 5* Kempinski Hotel Mall of Emirates as an executive chef where he worked for 2 years and has led the evolution of Sezzam restaurant transforming it in to an award-winning dining destination.. In June 2007 Bekris was promoted to become a regional executive chef for Middle East and Africa of Kempinski Hotel S.A., being responsible {{for all of the}} hotel chain’s <b>pre-openings</b> in the UAE, Djibouti, Bahrain, Lebanon, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt including conceptualizing of new F&B outlets, recruitment, training, kitchen design and SOP’s. Then in 2008 he took a position of executive chef [...] at The Address Downtown Dubai Hotel leading the opening set up for the venue. Later in 2010 Bekris joined FRHI Hotels & Resorts, taking on the role of corporate F&B director of development for Swissôtel Hotels & Resorts and overseeing the brand’s worldwide F&B operations of 34 properties. In April 2011 Bekris returned to Greece where he was appointed a complex culinary director at Costa Navarino, The Westin Resort & The Romanos Luxury Collection being in charge of culinary operations of 19 restaurants of the resort.|$|R
5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases <b>pre-opening</b> predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|Despite the UERL's {{success in}} {{financing}} and constructing the railway, its opening {{did not bring}} the financial success that had been expected. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's <b>pre-opening</b> predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be similarly over-optimistic, as did the projected figures for the newly electrified DR– in each case, numbers achieved only around fifty per cent of their targets. 37,000 people used the line on the first day, but {{in the months following}} the line's opening only about 20,000–30,000 passengers a day used the service. The number of carriages used by the BS was cut back to three per train at peak times and only two during off-peak hours. The Daily Mail reported in April 1906 that the rush-hour trains were carrying fewer than 100 people at a time. To add to the line's misfortunes, it suffered its first fatality only two weeks after opening when conductor John Creagh was crushed between a train and a tunnel wall at Kennington Road station on 26 March.|$|E
5|$|Guardians of the Galaxy earned $11.2 {{million on}} its Thursday night <b>pre-opening,</b> surpassing Captain America: The Winter Soldiers gross ($10.2 million) {{for the biggest}} Thursday evening start for a movie in 2014. IMAX {{accounted}} for 17% of the total gross ($1.9 million), which was the biggest August pre-release in IMAX format. On its opening day, the film earned $37.8 million, including the Thursday night earnings. Guardians of the Galaxy was the number one movie during its opening weekend and grossed $94.3 million, setting an August weekend record. During the opening weekend, IMAX earnings amounted to $11.7 million and 3-D showings accounted for 45% of ticket sales. The film's success was partially attributed to its appeal to both genders: the opening weekend audience was 44% female, which is the biggest proportion ever for a MCU film; 55% of the opening-weekend audience was {{over the age of}} 25.|$|E
5|$|Yerkes {{also did}} not {{live to see the}} UERL's {{financial}} struggle during the first years after the opening of the new lines. Because of greatly over-optimistic <b>pre-opening</b> predictions of passenger numbers, the lines failed to generate the income expected and needed to fund the interest payments on the UERL's substantial borrowings. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26million of a predicted 60million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25million of a predicted 50million. For the DR, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55million. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies, and the further spread of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The low price of tickets also depressed income.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, Welles {{was given}} another TV {{commission}} to film a condensed adaptation of The Merchant of Venice. Although Welles had actually completed the film by 1970, the finished negative was later mysteriously stolen from his Rome production office.

The two-hour lunch break between {{the morning and}} afternoon sessions was the longest among the world's 20 major stock exchanges. A 2003 proposal to shorten the lunch break failed due to opposition from brokers. Another plan to shorten the lunch break to one hour was floated by the exchange in 2010; the morning session would then start earlier, run from 9:30am to 12:00pm, and the afternoon session from 1:00pm to 4:00pm, leaving the closing time the same as before. Justifications included bringing hours into line with China. Reactions from both brokers and the restaurant industry were mixed.|$|E
500|$|The {{first public}} {{exhibition}} of material from Kubrick’s personal archives was presented jointly in 2004 by the Deutsches Filmmuseum and Deutsches Architekturmuseum in Frankfurt, Germany, {{in cooperation with}} Christiane Kubrick and Jan Harlan / The Stanley Kubrick Estate. In 2009, an exhibition of paintings and photos inspired by Kubrick's films was held in Dublin, Ireland, entitled [...] "Stanley Kubrick: Taming Light". On October 30, 2012, an exhibition devoted to Kubrick opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and concluded in June 2013. Exhibits include a wide collection of documents, photographs and on-set material assembled from 800 boxes of personal archives that were stored in Kubrick's home-workplace in the UK. A number of celebrities attended and spoke at the museum's <b>pre-opening</b> gala, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Jack Nicholson, while Kubrick's widow, Christiane, appeared at the pre-gala press review. In October 2013, the Brazil São Paulo International Film Festival paid tribute to Kubrick, staging an exhibit of his work and a retrospective of his films. The exhibit opened at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in late 2014 and ended in January 2015.|$|E
500|$|At age 17, {{in a bid}} to {{show people}} he was {{prepared}} for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer's play Equus, which had not been revived since its first run in 1973, at the Gielgud Theatre. Radcliffe took on the lead role as Alan Strang, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped £1.7million, and the role generated significant <b>pre-opening</b> media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he [...] "displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward." [...] He added: [...] "I never thought I would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion." [...] The production then transferred to Broadway in September 2008, with Radcliffe still in the lead role. Radcliffe stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. Radcliffe's performance was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Holiday World {{initially}} {{announced plans}} to have new Timberliner trains ready and operating for the 2012 season.

The park now plans on having the Timberliner trains operating {{by the beginning of the}} 2013 season. In addition to routine track work, Holiday World, in conjunction with the Gravity Group, rebuilt and reprofiled portions of the ride's turn around, which is commonly referred to as the [...] "spaghetti bowl". As a result of the reprofiled turn, an additional 0.1 second of air-time was created, bringing the ride's new total to 24.3 seconds of air-time.|$|E
2500|$|Before New York's two National League teams {{left the}} city, the Yankees and Dodgers played an annual midseason {{exhibition}} game called the Mayor's Trophy Game to benefit sandlot baseball in New York City. The proceeds {{raised by the}} Yankees were given to leagues in Manhattan and the Bronx, while proceeds raised by the Dodgers went to leagues on Long Island and Staten Island. [...] The annual charity event was discontinued following the 1957 season, when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the Giants moved to San Francisco. leaving the Yankees as the only major league team in the city. The game was revived in 1963, after the National League returned to New York with the expansion New York Mets in 1962. [...] After dwinding interest and public bickering between the owners of both teams, the Mayor's Trophy Game was discontinued following the 1983 season. It was revived again as a <b>pre-Opening</b> Day series titled the [...] "Mayor's Challenge" [...] and held in 1989.|$|E
