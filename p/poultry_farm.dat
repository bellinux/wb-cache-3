5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a <b>poultry</b> <b>farm</b> and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E

40|$|Background: Air {{pollution}} {{has been}} shown to increase the susceptibility to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Previously, we observed an increased incidence of CAP in adults living within 1 km from <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> potentially related to particulate matter and endotoxin emissions. We aim to confirm the increased risk of CAP near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> by refined spatial analyses, and we hypothesize that the oropharyngeal microbiota composition in CAP patients may be associated with residential proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> Methods: A spatial kernel model was used to analyze the association between proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> and CAP diagnosis, obtained from electronic medical records of 92, 548 GP patients. The oropharyngeal microbiota composition was determined in 126 hospitalized CAP patients using 16 S-rRNA-based sequencing, and analyzed in relation to residential proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> Results: Kernel analysis confirmed a significantly increased risk of CAP when living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> suggesting an excess risk up to 1. 15 km, followed by a sharp decline. Overall, the oropharyngeal microbiota composition differed borderline significantly between patients living < 1 km and ≥ 1 km from <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> (PERMANOVA p = 0. 075). Results suggested a higher abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (mean relative abundance 34. 9 % vs. 22. 5 %, p = 0. 058) in patients living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> which was verified by unsupervised clustering analysis, showing overrepresentation of a S. pneumoniae cluster near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> (p = 0. 049). Conclusion: Living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> is associated with an 11 % increased risk of CAP, possibly resulting from changes in the upper respiratory tract microbiota composition in susceptible individuals. The abundance of S. pneumoniae near farms needs to be replicated in larger, independent studies. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

An estimated 134,973 persons are engaged in fishing and allied activities. Cheriazheekkal, Alappad, Pandarathuruthu, Puthenthura, Neendakara, Thangasseri, Eravipuram and Paravur are eight of the 26 important fishing villages. There are 24 inland fishing villages also. Recognizing the unique location and infrastructure available, the Government has initiated steps for establishing a fishing harbour at Neendakara which is expected to increase fish production by 15%. Average fish landing is estimated at 85,275 tonnes per year. One-third of the state's fish catch is from Kollam. Nearly 3000 mechanised boats are operating from the fishing harbour. FFDA and VFFDA promote fresh water fish culture and prawn farming respectively. A model fishing village with 100 houses is being built at Eravipuram. A model prawn farm is being built at Ayiramthengu, and several new hatcheries are also planned to cater {{to the needs of the}} aquaculturists.

Although a sizeable number of parishioners were not particularly religious and only attended church three or four times per year, Đujić earned a monthly salary of 1,000 dinars, and received numerous gifts from locals. He also had a <b>poultry</b> <b>farm,</b> and owned a property which produced about [...] of wheat annually. Although most of the inhabitants of Strmica were impoverished, Đujić's home was always filled with food. Due to his wealth, Đujić became the most influential person in the village. He sought to use his money and influence to help the Serb peasants in the Dalmatian hinterland. In 1934, he organised the construction of a cultural centre in Strmica, financed and oversaw the irrigation of farmland west of Mračaj and approved the reconstruction of a pair of church bells on the Church of St. John the Baptist. The reconstruction of the church bells, which had been destroyed by Austro-Hungarian artillery in 1916, was done with money donated by the Yugoslav government and further improved his reputation among the local population, though Đujić's critics accused him of misappropriating funds.|$|E
