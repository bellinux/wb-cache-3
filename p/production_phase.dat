Ghantasala composed the film's soundtrack and score. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors.

5|$|Pathala Bhairavi was {{the first}} big budget film {{produced}} by Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Although principal photography only took eight to nine months, the <b>production</b> <b>phase</b> continued {{for a whole year}} starting from 5 February 1950 until 8 February 1951, due to the film being shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy conducted the choreography for the song sequences. Major portions of the film were shot in large sets and many trick shots were used by Bartley during the process. Both versions were filmed using an Arri 11 CBR Camera.|$|E
5|$|The <b>production</b> <b>phase</b> of Malliswari {{lasted for}} two years and the film was {{released}} on 20December 1951. It opened to a tepid response at the box office, but soon saw a growth in ticket sales due to favourable word of mouth. It grossed over 0.8 million and was commercially successful. Malliswari was later screened at the 9th International Film Festival of India and the 1952 Peking film festival, making it the first Telugu film to be screened in an international film festival. Narasimha Reddy planned to dub the film into English, but backed out due to budget considerations.|$|E

The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their <b>production</b> <b>phase.</b> They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, France {{pressed for}} an {{independent}} European crew launch vehicle. Around 1978 {{it was decided to}} pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of Hermes was introduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for the Space Shuttle and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the Ariane 5 rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use in Low-Earth orbit space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; the <b>production</b> <b>phase</b> was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the Soviet Union ESA looked forward to co-operation with Russia to build a next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The Columbus space station programme had a similar fate.|$|E

Narasimha Reddy incorporated a few of his childhood incidents in the film, and according to Bhanumathi, the pranks between Malliswari and Nagaraju and the sequence before the song [...] "Kothi Bavaku Pellanta" [...] were inspired by his childhood experiences.

500|$|The <b>production</b> <b>phase</b> of Gundamma Katha lasted {{nearly a}} year, {{with one of}} the reasons being that both Rama Rao and Nageswar Rao had delays in giving bulk dates for the project.

Srinivasan supervised the erection of sets. The film's shooting was severely affected by scheduling conflicts; Chakrapani would make telephone calls to all the key artistes, and sequences were filmed based on their availability. The filming of the song [...] "Kolo Koloyanna" [...] was significantly affected by this; all four lead actors were supposed {{to take part in the}} song's shoot; the film's editor took care to ensure a smooth flow in the sequences during the post-production phase. The scene before the song that features Rama Rao and Nageswara Rao communicating with whistles was conceptualised by Narasaraju. Harbans Singh supervised the film's special effects.|$|E
