40|$|In the {{run up to}} the elections, {{parties have}} several ways of {{communicating}} with voters. In this article, we focus on one piece of the puzzle: <b>advertisements</b> of <b>political</b> parties in the mass media. More specifically, {{we are interested in}} the choice of candidates within these advertisements. In countries where parties are the dominant actor, they are faced with a choice: not all candidates can be promoted in the campaign, as this would be too costly and inefficient. Thus, the first question we want to answer is which factors determine candidate choice in <b>political</b> <b>advertisements?</b> Secondly, does candidate choice in <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> {{have an effect on the}} subsequent coverage in media as well? Agenda setting research has shown that as far as issues are concerned, advertisements do set the media agenda. We use a content analysis of seven magazines and newspapers that was collected in the run up to the 2009 regional elections in Flanders, the largest region of Belgium. The results indicate that both internal party hierarchy, as well as external visibility of candidates determines candidate choice in <b>political</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Furthermore, the agenda setting effect of <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> is confirmed as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{general debate}} around {{political}} advertising on television {{has been that}} the <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> on television concentrate more on the images rather than the political issues and thus, create an electorate who is entertained by the catchy slogans and this hinders a well informed decision. The study investigates the rise of political advertising on television in South Africa and its implications for democracy. It is focused on the 2009 pre-elections and specifically on the <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> which appeared on national television during the pre-election period beginning from 30 th March 2009 up until 20 th April 2009. The study also examines the extent to which <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> on television commodify politics. Furthermore, it explores the themes covered in the <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> on television {{and the extent to which}} these <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> focus on the images than the themes. In addition, the study also looks into the underlying issues and complexities, such as regulation and funding and financing issues which are hidden from the public glare, accompanying the images and messages seen on television around election time. Qualitative methods are used and the study is both descriptive and explorative and as means of interpreting the data, thematic content analysis is used. The critical political economy of the media theory is employed as well as the democratic theories of the media, with a key focus on liberal democracy and deliberative democracy. Thus the findings showed that the <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> on television in South Africa were informative as they concentrated more on the themes than the images and, in many instances where the images were used it was mainly to support the message. However, the <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> had some emotional appeals which communicated emotions of sadness and despair as well as emotions of happiness and success. Character appeals were used at minimum and it was only three political parties which made use of their leaders with only one political party, out of the three, using their leader throughout the advertisement. The issue of commodity in politics was very prominent in the <b>political</b> <b>advertisements</b> on television thus it can be concluded that political advertising on television commodify politics to a large extent in the production and distribution process but to a minimum extent in the content. The implications of the rise of political advertising on television for democracy are twofold because they are both positive and negative. It is recommended that the regulations on political advertising on television be re-visited and reviewed. Thus, a prospective model for the regulation of political advertising on television is also illustrated in the study...|$|R
