40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the requirements of}} a nuclear amplifier of short resolving time, designed to accept pulses of widely varying amplitudes. Data are given which show that a <b>proportional</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> loaded with a 1, 000 -ohm resistor develops pulses of 0. 5 microsecond duration and several volts amplitude. Results indicate that seven basic requirements are imposed on the amplifier when counting soft beta and gamma radiation {{in the presence of}} alpha particles, without absorbers. It should, (1) have a fast recovery time, (2) have a relatively good low frequency response, (3) accept pulses of widely varying heights without developing spurious pulsed, (4) have a limiting output stage, (5) preserve the inherently short rise time of the chamber, (6) minimize pulse integration, and (7) have sufficient gain to detect the weak pulses well below the chamber voltage at which continuous discharge takes place. The results obtained with an amplifier which meets these requirements is described. A formula is derived which indicates that redesign of the <b>proportional</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> might eliminate the need for an amplifier.

The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to compare the calibration factors for Cs- 137 and Co- 60 of six radiation measuring instruments in fast five years to evaluate the accuracy of radiation measurements of different instruments. For this comparison, we used survey meters with different type of gaseous ionization detectors mainly GM tube, <b>Proportional</b> counters and <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers.</b> This research shows that, response of the survey meter for Co- 60 radiation {{is higher than the}} Cs- 137. Hence Calibration Factor for Co- 60 radiation is much lower than the Cs- 137. Calibration Factor of instrument remaining nearly stable within the regions of 0. 1 to 10 mSv/h for the duration of five years while other two regions, 0 - 0. 1 mSv/h and 10 - 30 mSv/h show some variation. Survey meters with GM counters and proportional counters have nearly same response to the gamma radiation.

In the present investigation, the relative response of 17 cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> was evaluated at three proton beam qualities: at two points in a modulated beam and one point in a non-modulated beam, all with an incident energy of 75 MeV. Thirteen of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> had a Farmer-type geometry but consisted of different combinations of wall and central electrode materials. All <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> were calibrated in terms of air kerma as well as in terms of absorbed dose to water in a Co- 60 beam. The relative response of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> was compared with results of Monte Carlo simulations of proton and secondary electron transport in the phantom and the <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> geometry. The results of the measurements for cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> show relative perturbation effects that are limited to 0. 5 - 1 %, resulting in perturbation correction factors that are larger than unity compared with an NE 2571 <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> The experimental relative wall and total perturbation correction factors agree with Monte Carlo calculated values, indicating that the differences between the responses of different <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> are due to secondary electron effects, This conclusion is supported by the comparison of our results with those from other investigators after re-analysis of their data.

This homemade ion chamber was manufactured using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) coated with graphite, and co-axial cables. In order to evaluate the performance of this <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber,</b> some characterization tests were performed: short- and medium-term stability, leakage current, saturation, ion collection efficiency, polarity effect and linearity of response.

The saturation curve was obtained varying the applied voltage from- 400 V to + 400 V, in steps of 50 V, using the charge collecting time of 20 s.

40|$|Since 2008, the Solar Auto-Calibrating EUV Spectrometer (SolACES) {{experiment}} {{monitors the}} solar EUV radiation. SolACES {{is part of}} the SOLAR mission, a device mounted on the COLUMBUS module on the International Space Station (ISS). The SolACES device is capable of measuring the EUV radiation of the full solar disk, with three grazing incidence spectrometers, covering the spectral range from 17 to 135 nm. Degradation and ageing effects of hardware components are a major issue in the field of EUV measurements. In addition, propellant pollution from ISS logistic vehicles strongly complicate the instrumental operation as well as the data evaluation. To correct these effects, two double <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> have been mounted onto the device frame. These are considered as a primary radiometric detector standard. By refilling the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers,</b> the absolute EUV flux can be measured. Efficiency changes, being a severe issue in the field of measurements of EUV radiation, can corrected via an in-situ auto-calibration. The use of this method requires a thorough understanding of electron multiplier degradation and processes inside an <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> Aims The main focus of this paper lies on the correction of hardware ageing effects in the spectrometer readout, {{as well as on the}} usage of <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements for absolute calibration.
