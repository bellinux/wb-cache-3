5000|$|In April 2008, the {{district}} won a Safety Excellence {{award from the}} school system's <b>prime</b> <b>insurer,</b> Utica National Insurance Group. Of 340 schools, 54 of them -including Clyde-Savannah- received Titanium Plus status and a $500 award. To earn the award, {{the district}} documented 124 safety-related items. Dean of Students Larry Hartwell says, [...] "We've practiced just about everything in the emergency handbook...." [...] The state-mandated Emergency Management Plan includes detailed procedures for bomb threats, chemical spills on the railway in Clyde and severe weather. Clyde-Savannah schools {{have been set up}} with the Red Cross to act as emergency centers. If the schools must be evacuated, the district would set up a command post in the bus garage, sending all phone lines through there. If a chemical spill were to occur, the schools can immediately close all air-circulation systems that draw in outside air.|$|E
