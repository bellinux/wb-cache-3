5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, {{and is known}} to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Hunting for {{sperm whales}} {{during this period}} was a {{notoriously}} dangerous affair for the crews of the 19th-century whaleboats. Although a properly harpooned sperm whale generally exhibited a fairly consistent pattern of attempting to flee underwater {{to the point of}} exhaustion (at which point it would surface and offer no further resistance), it was not uncommon for bull whales to become enraged and turn to attack pursuing whaleboats on the surface, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had already been wounded by repeated harpooning attempts. A commonly reported tactic was for the whale to invert itself and violently thrash {{the surface of the water}} with its , flipping and crushing nearby boats.|$|E
25|$|The Camp Fire {{ceremonial}} gown {{is based}} on the pattern for the Native American women's gowns. Due to its simple pattern that can be becoming to all girls, it is an inexpensive design that makes all girls equal, and it is easy to adjust as the owner grows older. Now a youth may choose any style of ceremonial attire, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> honors the ethnic background to which the youth can trace his or her background or toward which he or she has an affinity. This attire can include tunics, kimonos, Scandinavian skirts/aprons, etc. The ceremonial attire is decorated with honor beads, earned emblems, and other personal items the youth chooses. Sometimes the youth's symbolgram is used on the gown/tunic. The symbolgram is a symbol created by the youth to represent him/herself. By 1946 the ceremonial gown was optional.|$|E

25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E

[...] NBC Sports commentators for their Olympic coverage began referring to Vinicius as [...] "the challenge mascot." [...] Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website Thrillist, wrote that the mascot took [...] "a little of the anger out of a challenge." [...] Jason Bryant, the in-house commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was slightly surprised to see the practice at the Olympics, given the emphasis there on [...] "protocol", but he eventually commented that it does not matter what the challenge object is, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> has cultural significance to the location of the competition. Coach Mike Maliconico argued that the practice does not belong at the Olympic Games, stating, [...] "The fate of one of my athletes who has been training for this specific moment for four years hangs in the balance of a referee's error.

500|$|As a bowler, Rhodes was {{recognised}} {{by critics}} {{as one of}} the greatest slow bowlers of all time. Very effective at dismissing batsmen on difficult pitches, it was difficult to score runs from his bowling even on a good batting surface. He could make the ball turn if the pitch offered the slightest assistance, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been affected by rain. Cricket writer E. W. Swanton described how Rhodes had [...] "a beautifully controlled, economical and rhythmical action which ensured supreme accuracy of length and direction. He was a master of the stock left-hander's spin and could vary it with the ball that came on with the arm." [...] In his early years as a bowler, Rhodes was able to spin the ball very sharply, and while this ability decreased in later years, he became expert at working out a batsman's weaknesses. Critics considered him expert at flighting the ball; Neville Cardus wrote that [...] "Flight was his secret. Flight and the curving line, now higher, now lower, tempting, inimical; every ball like every other ball, yet somehow unlike; each over in collusion with the others, part of a plot..." [...] In the early part of his career, his bowling partnership with Hirst, who shared Rhodes's Kirkheaton birthplace, was particularly effective and established a formidable reputation. As time passed, his accuracy increased to the extent that it seemed every ball landed in exactly the same place. In his first five seasons, he was top of the national bowling averages twice and in second place three times, while in the first six seasons after the war, he was first four times and second once. In his whole career, he only fell outside the top 20 in the bowling averages in four seasons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} port scanners use {{the operating}} system's network functions and are generally the next option {{to go to}} when SYN is not a feasible option (described next). Nmap calls this mode connect scan, named after the Unix connect (...) system call. If a port is open, the operating system completes the TCP three-way handshake, and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid performing a Denial-of-service attack. Otherwise an error code is returned. This scan mode has the advantage that the user does not require special privileges. However, using the OS network functions prevents low-level control, so this scan type is less common.

Also, Japanese parents tend to give their children a name in kanji, hiragana or katakana, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is a Japanese name. Even individuals born in Japan, with a Japanese name, might be referred to using katakana, if they've established residency or a career overseas.

2500|$|There {{is a risk}} of {{confusion}} of okurigana with compounds: some Japanese words are traditionally written with kanji, but today some of these kanji are hyōgaiji (uncommon characters), and hence are often written as a mixture of kanji and kana, the uncommon characters being replaced by kana; {{this is known as}} mazegaki.

2500|$|The time of {{harvesting}} is {{a crucial}} decision because the grape quickly begins to lose acidity as it ripens. For sparkling wine production, the grapes will be harvested early and slightly unripe to maintain the acid levels. Sparkling Chardonnay based wines tend to exhibit more floral and steely flavors in their youth. As the wine ages, <b>particularly</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> spends significant time on lees, the wines will develop [...] "toasty" [...] notes. Chardonnay grapes usually have little trouble developing sugar content, even in cooler climates, which translates into high potential alcohol levels and limits the need for chaptalization. On the flip side, low acid levels can be a concern which make the wine taste [...] "flabby" [...] and dull. Winemakers can counteract this by adding tartaric acid in {{a process known as}} [...] "acidification". In cooler climates, the extract and acidity of Chardonnay is magnified which has the potential of producing very concentrated wines that can develop through bottle aging. Chardonnay can blend well with other grapes and still maintain some of its unique character. The grapes most often blended with Chardonnay include Chenin blanc, Colombard and Sémillon.|$|E
