At a solution pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as precipitants. The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric <b>point</b> <b>precipitation</b> is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids.

To recover {{residual}} rubber from skim {{natural rubber}} (SNR) latex, the effective and environmentally friendly methodology developed based on using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as a thermo-responsive flocculant. The SNR particles could be completely separated to form high concentrated latex as cream phase within only 5 hours. Almost 100 % of SNR was recovered when using HPMC 0. 7 %w/w. Quality of SNR obtained from this technique was higher {{and color of}} it was lighter than SNR obtained from the conventional method. HPMC could be easily precipitated from the serum phase by heating the serum phase at about 70 °C.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of a spaceborne precipitation radar in measuring vertical Doppler velocity of rainfall. As far as a downward <b>pointing</b> <b>precipitation</b> radar is concerned, one of the major problems affecting Doppler measurement at the nadir direction arises from the Non-Uniform Beam-Filling effect (NUBF). That is, when significant variation in rain rate is present within the radar IFOV (Instrument Field of View) in the along track direction. the Doppler shift caused by the radial component of the horizontal speed of the satellite is weighted differently among the portions of IFOV. The effects of this non-uniform weighting may dominate any other contribution. Under this condition, shape, average value and width of the Doppler spectrum may not be directly correlated with the vertical velocity of the precipitating particles. However, by using an inversion technique which over-samples the radar measurements in the along track direction, we show that the shift due to NUBF can be evaluated, and that the NUBF induced errors on average fall speed can be reduced...|$|R

Five years of relative online search volumes for these terms were obtained for the 50 most populous cities in the contiguous United States, along with corresponding local weather data for temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and precipitation. Methods from the climate econometrics literature were used to assess the casual impact of these meteorological variables on the relative volumes of searches for pain.

Data from three projects are consid-ered: the Intermountain Precipitation Experiment (IPEX) and the California Land-falling Jets Experiment (CALJET), both in the United States, and the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP) in the European Alps. As a prototype physical model, a new linear theory including airflow dynamics, condensed water advection, and leeside evaporation was employed. Theoretical considerations using the linear model showed sensitivity of point measurements across an ideal hill. To assist in model evaluation with real data, a new measure of “goodness of fit ” was defined. This measure, “location sensitivity skill ” (LSS), rewards detail as well as accuracy. For real data comparison, the linear model predictions show skill using traditional methods and the new LSS measure.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} meteorological droughts and assign return periods to these droughts. Moreover, the relation between meteorological and hydrological droughts is explored. This has been done for the River Meuse basin in Western Europe at different spatial and temporal scales to enable comparison between different data sources (e. g. stations and climate models). Meteorological drought is assessed in two ways: using annual minimum precipitation amounts as a function of return period, and using troughs under threshold as a function of return period. The Weibull extreme value type 3 distribution has been fitted to both sources of information. Results show that the trough-under-threshold precipitation is larger than the annual minimum precipitation for a specific return period. Annual minimum precipitation values increase with spatial scale, being most pronounced for small temporal scales.

40|$|The {{performance}} of glaciohydrological models which simulate catchment response to climate variability depends {{to a large}} degree on the data used to force the models. The forcing data become increasingly important in high-elevation, glacierized catchments where the interplay between extreme topography, climate, and the cryosphere is complex. It is challenging to generate a reliable forcing data set that captures this spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we analyze the results of a 1 year field campaign focusing on air temperature and precipitation observations in the Langtang valley in the Nepalese Himalayas. We use the observed time series to characterize both temperature lapse rates (LRs) and precipitation gradients (PGs). We study their spatial and temporal variability, and we attempt to identify possible controlling factors. We show that very clear LRs exist in the valley and that there are strong seasonal differences related to the water vapor content in the atmosphere. Results also show that the LRs are generally shallower than the commonly used environmental lapse rates. The analysis of the precipitation observations reveals that there is great variability in precipitation over short horizontal distances. A uniform valley wide PG cannot be established, and several scale-dependent mechanisms may explain our observations. We complete our analysis by showing the impact of the observed LRs and PGs on the outputs of the TOPKAPI-ETH glaciohydrological model. We conclude that LRs and PGs have a very large impact on the water balance composition and that short-term monitoring campaigns have the potential to improve model quality considerably.

It is thus necessary to optimize the number of rainfall stations and estimate <b>point</b> <b>precipitation</b> at unrecorded locations from existing data. This paper serves 2 objectives: i) to establish a spatial representative rainfall stations from the entire existing network {{in the study area}} (i. e., rainfall-data optimization); and ii) to use of multivariate geostatistical algorithm for incorporating relatively cheaper hydrological data into the spatial prediction of rainfall. The technique was illustrated using annual and monthly rainfall observations measured at 326 rainfall stations covering Yom river basin and its vicinity in Thailand. Optimal rain gauge network was designed based on the station redundancy and the homogeneity of the rainfall distribution. Digital elevation, humidity, and temperature models were incorporated into the spatial rainfall prediction using multivariate geostatistical algorithms. The results revealed that the multivariate geostatistical algorithm outperform the linear regression, stressing the importance of accounting for spatially dependent rainfall observations in addition to the collocated elevation.

The SOMs approach derives a transfer function between large-scale mean atmospheric states and local meteorological variables (daily <b>point</b> <b>precipitation</b> values) of interest. First, the SOM was trained using seven coarsely resolved atmospheric variables from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis dataset to model observed daily precipitation data from 17 stations across Pennsylvania for the period 1979 – 2005. Employing the same coarsely resolved variables from nine general circulation model (GCM) simulations taken from the historical analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (CMIP 3), the trained SOM was subsequently applied to simulate daily precipitation at the same 17 sites for the period 1961 – 2000. The SOM analysis indicates that the nine model simulations exhibit similar synoptic-scale features to the (NCEP) observations over the 1979 – 2007 training interval.
