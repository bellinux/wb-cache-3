50|$|Dobbs Ferry {{had had a}} {{post office}} under its earlier names of Wickquaequeeck and Greenburgh prior to its {{incorporation}} in 1872 and change to its current name a decade later. In 1915 the U.S. Post Office, then {{under the auspices of}} the Treasury Department, began to standardize its local branches across the country. This trend reached Dobbs Ferry when it became one of 136 new <b>post</b> offices <b>authorized</b> for New York State under an amendment to the Public Buildings Act of 1931.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the unit {{can be traced to}} the early days of the Marine Corps. In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{military}} musicians ("field musics") provided a means of passing commands to Marines in battle. The sound of various drum beats and bugle calls that could be heard over the noise of the battlefield signaled Marines to attack the enemy or retreat. Through the 1930s, Marine Corps <b>posts</b> still <b>authorized</b> a number of buglers and drummers to play the traditional calls and to ring a ship's bell to signal the time.|$|R
50|$|There {{are simple}} yellow light shunt signals on signal <b>posts</b> which <b>authorize</b> {{movements}} {{to the next}} obstruction (vehicle) or signal. An accident occurred at Hines Hill in 1996 where a train entered the mainline from the East at high speed on a slow speed shunt signal indication and due to the driver not maintaining control of the train it collided with an Eastbound Westrail (see Hines Hill train collision) freight train after it had passed Departure Signal at Danger. The driver of the National Rail train had not reduced the speed of his train and the train controller unusually called the slow speed shunt signal, not meant for mainline operations.|$|R

50|$|California was {{admitted}} to the United States in 1850, the first state on the Pacific coast. Major efforts ensued to integrate California with the other states, including sea and overland mail and passenger service. Proposals for the subsidy of a telegraph line to California were made in Congress throughout the 1850s, and in 1860 the U.S. <b>Post</b> Office was <b>authorized</b> to spend $40,000 per year to build and maintain an overland line. The year before, the California State Legislature had authorized a similar subsidy of $6,000 per year.|$|R
2500|$|The name Papakating, {{and several}} variant spellings, had been {{recorded}} for the creek consistently since the American colonial period. Maps and documents {{at the time}} of the American Revolution often render the name as Pepocottin or Pepper-Cotton. The name was used for both the creek and its valley, and subsequently during the nineteenth century for a small hamlet that later gave its name to a post office and train depot. The <b>post</b> office was <b>authorized</b> as [...] "Pepokating" [...] on August 26, 1851 and the name revised to the more common spelling of Papakating in 1862. Service to this post office was discontinued in 1923.|$|R

As the newer settlement had become known as [...] "Grand Traverse City", Lay proposed this name for its post office, but the Post Office Department clerk suggested dropping the [...] "Grand" [...] from the name, as to limit confusion between this new office and the one at nearby Old Mission. Mr. Lay agreed to the name [...] "Traverse City" [...] for the post office, and the village took on this name.|$|R
5000|$|Dating to 1857, Desdemona {{was one of}} {{the first}} Texas towns {{established}} west of the Brazos River. Settlers constructed a small fort on land owned by C.C. Blair for protection from Comanche Indian attacks. In 1873, Rockdale Baptist Church, the first organization of any kind in Eastland County, was constructed. Two years later, the brothers William and Ben Funderburg acquired the former Fort Blair land and proceeded to develop the community, then called Hogtown on Hog Creek. A <b>post</b> office was <b>authorized</b> in 1877 under the name [...] "Desdemona", a reference not to the character from Shakespeare, but the daughter of an area justice of the peace. During the 1890s, agriculture was important in Desdemona, particularly peanuts. The population reached 340 in 1904.|$|R
25|$|Functions of {{the state}} and federal attorneys-general include the {{administration}} of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial <b>posts,</b> and <b>authorizing</b> prosecutions. In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff; however, the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The Attorney-General also has the power to issue a nolle prosequi with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.|$|R

50|$|Gold Center was {{a mining}} town in Nye County, Nevada.

The Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, the Las Vegas & Tonopah Railroad and the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad all ran through Gold Center. Gold Center also had the first brewery in the area which was built underground to maintain a cool temperature.|$|R

50|$|Eureka is {{situated}} on the south bank of the Fox River. Mr. Lester Rounds moved his stock of goods from Waukau {{to the site of}} Eureka in 1850, where he was joined by Mr. Walton C. Dickerson, who moved over from Nepeuskun, and they became the first settlers and founders of Eureka, a plot of which was recorded July 24, 1850, of which Rounds, Dickerson & Starr were proprietors. A ferry was established across the Fox River at this point, during the same season, and four years later a bridge constructed. The <b>post</b> office was <b>authorized</b> July 16, 1850, and Lester Rounds appointed postmaster. A steamboat landing and warehouse was built by Mr. Walton C. Dickerson for the accommodation of the daily line of steamboats on the river, running between Oshkosh and Berlin. The sawmills along the river at Eureka, Delhi, Omro and Berlin were supplied with pine logs from the Wolf River, which were towed up the Fox river at first by horsepower boats or tugs.|$|R
5000|$|The SGVTA was {{notable for}} {{having had a}} transit police force {{consisting}} primarily of volunteer commissioners and auxiliaries. Although the SGVTA's [...] "police agency" [...] was not a participating agency in the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST) program, the agency was recognized by <b>POST</b> as an <b>authorized</b> law enforcement agency established in California. Eriksson was a businessman who was found with SGVTA business cards purportedly from its [...] "police agency" [...] after being involved in a high profile traffic accident. During a subsequent court proceeding in Alhambra, California, {{it was determined that}} the SGVTA police agency was issued an official ORI number by the California State Department of Justice, and its sworn police officers each possessed Peace Officer Standards in Training (POST) certificates issued by the Rio Hondo Police Academy as well as the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Academy. Therefore, the court determined that the SGVTA's sworn officers met minimum standards as peace officers in the State of California.|$|R
