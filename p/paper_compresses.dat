40|$|A time-domain analog spatial {{compressed}} sensing encoder for neural recording applications is proposed. Owing to {{the advantage}} of MEMS technologies, the number of channels on a silicon neural probe array has doubled in 7. 4 years, and therefore, a greater number of recording channels and higher density of front-end circuitry is required. Since neural signals such as action potential (AP) have wider signal bandwidth than that of an image sensor, a data compression technique is essentially required for arrayed neural recording systems. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>compressed</b> sensing (CS) is employed for data reduction, and a novel time-domain analog CS encoder is proposed. A simpler and lower power circuit than conventional analog or digital CS encoders can be realized by using the proposed CS encoder.

40|$|Cognitive {{radio is}} a system to utilize {{spectrum}} holes efficiently as a solution of spectrum scarcity. The availability of channels for secondary users is determined in the spectrum sensing phase by energy detection. Energy levels of sampled primary user's (PU's) signal can be measured by wavelet transform with more accuracy compared with Fourier-based methods. Wavelet packet-based spectrum sensing measures the energy level at each subcarrier and sets the decision threshold. However, at {{the first step of}} energy detection for wideband spectrum sensing, high-rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling requires a large dynamic range and high-speed signal processors. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>compressed</b> sampling for PU's signal acquisition is proposed to reduce the rate of sampling and solve the implementation complexity of ADC.

40|$|In this <b>paper,</b> <b>compressed</b> sensing {{techniques}} are proposed to linearize commercial power amplifiers driven by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals. The nonlinear distortion is {{considered as a}} sparse phenomenon in the time-domain, and three compressed sensing based algorithms are presented to estimate and compensate for these distortions at the receiver using a few and, at times, even no frequency-domain free carriers (i. e. pilot carriers). The first technique is a conventional compressed sensing approach, while the second incorporates a priori information about the distortions to enhance the estimation. Finally, the third technique involves an iterative data-aided algorithm that does not require any pilot carriers and hence allows the system to work at maximum bandwidth efficiency. The performances of all the proposed {{techniques are}} evaluated on a commercial power amplifier and compared. The error vector magnitude and symbol error rate results show the ability of compressed sensing {{to compensate for the}} amplifier's nonlinear distortions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In this <b>paper,</b> <b>compressed</b> sensing (CS) {{theory is}} {{utilized}} in a medium-access control (MAC) scheme for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). We propose a new, cross-layer compressed sensing medium-access control (CL CS-MAC) scheme, combining the physical layer and data link layer, where the wireless transmission in physical layer is considered as a compress process of requested packets in a data link layer according to compressed sensing (CS) theory. We first introduced using compressive complex requests to identify the exact active sensor nodes, which makes the scheme more efficient. Moreover, because the reconstruction process is executed in a complex field of a physical layer, where no bit and frame synchronizations are needed, the asynchronous and random requests scheme can be implemented without synchronization payload. We set up a testbed based on software-defined radio (SDR) to implement the proposed CL CS-MAC scheme practically and to demonstrate the validation. For large-scale WSNs, the simulation {{results show that the}} proposed CL CS-MAC scheme provides higher throughput and robustness than the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) and compressed sensing medium-access control (CS-MAC) schemes...|$|R
