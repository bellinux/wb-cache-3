The building's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone.

40|$|Synopsis: Experimental {{study has}} been {{performed}} in order to investigate the behavior of RC beams strengthened with externally <b>post-tensioning</b> CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) strips. A total of 11 specimens have been manufactured of which specimens strengthened with bonded or unbonded CFRP strips considering the level of <b>post-tensioning</b> as experimental variable, and a specimen with simply bonded CFRP strips. The following phenomena have been observed through the experimental results. The specimen with simply bonded CFRP strips failed below 50 % of its tensile strength due to premature debonding. On the other hand, all the specimens strengthened with <b>post-tensioning</b> CFRP strips showed sufficient strengthening performance up to the ultimate rupture load of the CFRP strips. Also, {{it was observed that}} the cracking loads and yield loads of the strengthened beams were increased proportionally to the <b>post-tensioning</b> level, but the ultimate loads were nearly equal regardless of the <b>post-tensioning</b> level and bonded or unbonded system. In addition, the yield loads and cracking loads of the beams with bonded <b>post-tensioning</b> systems were increased about 20 % compared with those of the unbonded <b>post-tensioning</b> systems. However, the beams strengthened with unbonded <b>post-tensioning</b> CFRP strips showed ductile behaviour with large deflections resulting from the reduced member stiffness...|$|R

25|$|Many car {{parks are}} {{independent}} buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often {{less than the}} office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55–60 feet that permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between.

25|$|The {{first step}} is to {{construct}} foundations of the large columns that will support the elevated roadway of the YBITS. Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by formwork and concrete is poured. After curing, the formwork is then removed. The next step is to build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with <b>post-tensioned</b> cable tendons. The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E

City crews were quickly sent to close off lanes of traffic to begin an inspection of the structure, which is a late 1960s <b>post-tensioned</b> design built by the province while it was still part of the QEW.

25|$|The {{segments}} {{of each of}} the two deck spans will be retained in compression during a severe earthquake by <b>post-tensioned</b> internal tendons joining the extreme end caps, carried internally in cable trays. These tendons are required since the eastern end support is both much lighter than the western counterweight and the soil conditions are radically different at each end, the western end being founded in bedrock shale while the eastern end, with vertical supports driven to bedrock, is mostly contained within softer mud deposits, which respond much more actively to seismic shocks than does the shale. The intent is that the combination of the tensioned tendons and the compressive roadbed box structure will keep the two end caps in the same relative position.|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: External <b>post-tensioning</b> can be {{considered}} an effective strengthening method for bridge members, which are deteriorating due to extreme loading conditions and progressive structural aging. The effects of existing shear cracks in bent caps strengthened by external <b>post-tensioning</b> were experimentally investigated using model specimens. Initial investigation revealed that the shear capacity of a bent cap is not enhanced by external <b>post-tensioning</b> only, when shear cracks exist. Moreover, {{it was found that}} the repair of existing cracks using epoxy injection substantially increases the shear capacity of the bent cap. The Tenthill Creek Bridge in South East Queensland, Australia provides a case study where the bent caps have been strengthened by external <b>post-tensioning.</b> The model tests of the bridge bent caps confirmed the initial findings on the effects of existing shear cracks on the shear capacity. The experimental results emphasize the need for appropriate repair of existing shear cracks prior to strengthening by external <b>post-tensioning</b> to enhance the shear capacity of bent caps...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} program {{was conducted to}} evaluate the design recommendations for transverse <b>post-tensioning</b> of bridge decks developed in the FHWA/IN/JTRP/ 2002 - 26 (SPR- 2409) report. The test specimen consisted of a 40 x 18 ft cast-in-place concrete deck on precast pretensioned girders. Thirty-two tests were carried out by applying different distributions of transverse <b>post-tensioning</b> force, in combination with a changing number of diaphragms, and two conditions of end-restraint at the supports. The transverse <b>post-tensioning</b> stress ranged from 400 to 1 200 psi {{and the number of}} diaphragms was reduced from five to zero. The main findings support the notion that the presence of diaphragms affects the distribution of transverse strains. However, their influence is not as important as analytical models showed. The influence of end-restraint supports on the distribution of transverse strains appeared to be less significant than estimated by Ramirez and Smith-Pardo (2002). Field-work is recommended to further evaluate the effect of this parameter. The use of elastic theory resulted in good agreement between calculated transverse stresses in the concrete deck obtained from the transverse steel reinforcement and those calculated from strains in the <b>post-tensioning</b> bars. In the range of <b>post-tensioning</b> estimated to maintain uncracked condition under service loads, the use of uniform transverse <b>post-tensioning</b> was deemed appropriate...|$|R

The lack of a retractable roof made it open to the elements, provided better views, and reduced the total cost of the project. The roof, at 200,000sqft(19,000m2), covers 70% of the seats but leaves the field open. The roof spans [...] between concrete pylon supports at the north and south ends of the stadium. Its two expansive sections are held from below by trusses.

To minimize damage in the event of an earthquake, the roof has a friction pendulum damper system. This disconnects the roof from the support pylons so that it can move independently of the structure.

500|$|The {{floating}} portion is then retracted {{under the}} O'ahu {{side of the}} fixed bridge {{at a rate of}} 14 inches per second to create a 650ft navigation channel. [...] The entire process takes 25 minutes to complete. [...] Retraction of the movable span is accomplished by two hydraulic winches located on the control pier on the southeast side of the bridge. Two-inch steel cables are used to connect each winch to the pontoon: one is connected to the far and the other to the near end of the pontoon. [...] The opening sequence consists of activating the warning lights and bells, lowering the warning gates and barriers, lifting the transition spans on both sides, and operating the winches. [...] During the opening, winch connected to the west end pulls while the winch on the east end pays out. [...] As the span nears fully open, the winch speeds are slowed to allow the pontoon to stop without snapping a cable. [...] This entire operation is operated from a control room on the east section of the bridge at the highest point and monitored from wireless cameras.

40|$|External <b>post-tensioning</b> {{is defined}} as a system in which the {{pre-stressing}} tendons or bars are located outside the concrete section. The pre-stressing force is transferred to the member section through the end anchorages, deviators or saddles.

Two software are used in the analysis of the T-shaped cantilever structure and anchor beam. The first is Dr. Bridge software Ver. 3. 1, and the second is Ansys software Ver. 10. The results of analysis before and after laying the leveling layer of the bridge deck pavement show that the section of T-shaped cantilever structure can satisfy the demand of vehicle- 20 grade and vehicle- 50 grade grade.

Since the design of stress ribbon {{pedestrian bridge}}s should be conducted by assuming the cross-section of deck, the area of bearing cables and <b>post-tensioning</b> cables, and the prestressed force of <b>post-tensioning</b> cables, it requires much more iterative processes than the design of general bridges.

40|$|<b>Post-tensioning</b> {{rehabilitation}} technique {{is often used}} to improve the static and dynamic stability of concrete gravity dams. The required <b>post-tensioning</b> force has often been estimated from the gravity method using simple static rigid body equilibrium. However, the application of linear and nonlinear (fracture) analysis techniques using the finite element method could be advantageous to optimize the design of <b>post-tensioning</b> strengthening schemes, specially under seismic loads where controlled damage is an acceptable performance criterion. In this study, the flood and seismic safety evaluations of prestressed dams were carried out using the gravity method, and linear and fracture finite element methods. Two typical concrete gravity dam models, 35 m and 90 m in heights, were examined. The performance of different <b>post-tensioning</b> modelling techniques such as the equivalent force method, and bonded/unbonded cable elements was examined in finite element analyses. A new nonlinear analysis methodology using displacement control was studied to determine the required amount of <b>post-tensioning</b> forces under flood condition. Sliding stability (local and global), overstressing, and controlled damage requirements were considered to develop <b>post-tensioning</b> design criteria in rehabilitation of concrete gravity dams. Various schemes of <b>post-tensioning</b> cable layouts were examined in seismic analyses. The different prestressing modelling techniques present almost identical static and seismic structural behaviours. The material properties of the horizontal joint at the dam-foundation interface, and the tendon layouts were found the key prestressing design parameters.
