5000|$|The {{unofficial}} {{nature of}} poster stamps {{has led to}} debate about exactly {{what is and is}} not a <b>poster</b> <b>stamp.</b> One definition has been [...] "labels without postage stamp values, not good for postal service; advertising labels or charity labels." ...|$|E
50|$|Where no {{denomination}} is shown, it may {{be because}} the stamp is deliberately non-denominated to pay the cost of a particular service, or because the stamp is not a postage stamp. It might be a cinderella stamp of some kind such as a <b>poster</b> <b>stamp</b> or charity label.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{artist to}} produce an [...] "artist’s stamp" [...] is open to interpretation. Fine artists were {{certainly}} commissioned to create <b>poster</b> <b>stamps</b> (advertising <b>posters</b> in collectible <b>stamp</b> form) from the late 1800s, but none appear to have worked with the format outside the commercial or advertising context.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>poster</b> <b>stamps</b> were {{inspired}} by {{the invention of the}} postage stamp. A perforated label was produced in England in 1864 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth and in Italy a label was produced in 1860 to celebrate Garibaldi's expedition to Sicily during the campaign to unify Italy. Commercial interests soon realised the publicity potential of the stamps and they were quickly adopted for the promotion of every type of product and cause. <b>Poster</b> <b>stamps</b> were also widely used by both sides during World War One as political propaganda.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} use of {{the term}} vignette in philately is to describe publicity labels or <b>poster</b> <b>stamps</b> which do not have postal validity, such as those produced in France during World War One by Delandre.|$|R
50|$|The <b>poster</b> <b>stamp</b> was an {{advertising}} label, a little larger than most postage stamps, that {{originated in the}} mid-19th century and quickly became a collecting craze, growing in popularity until World War One and then declining by World War Two until they are now almost forgotten except by collectors of cinderella stamps.|$|E
50|$|One of Delandre's many schemes was the {{invention}} of the Delandre vignette which was a popular form of label or <b>poster</b> <b>stamp</b> during World War I. He started by reproducing Italian regimental vignettes when the supply of originals proved insufficient for his needs. From there he expanded to include French army stamps and ultimately he produced over 4000 different patriotic stamps which have become a popular collecting area in cinderella philately. Delandre responded to claims of forgery of the Italian vignettes by claiming that they were 're-impressions'. He explained in a 1916 letter that he sold three types, real ones, re-impressions and new stamps that he created himself. He also stated that he had produced successful facsimiles. Detailed catalogues of Delandre's oeuvre have been produced by Charles Kiddle and Walter Schmidt.|$|E

50|$|As cinderella stamps {{are defined}} by what they are not, there are many {{different}} types and the term is usually construed fairly loosely.

Revenue stamps are sometime considered cinderellas, but as they are normally issued by an official government agency, they tend to be classed separately from other cinderella stamps. Some telegraph, railway and other stamps may also be issued by government agencies but still fall under the cinderella umbrella as not being for postal purposes.|$|R
