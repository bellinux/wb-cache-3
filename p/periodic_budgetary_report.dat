40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} current <b>budgetary</b> financial <b>reporting</b> practices in the Navy, and provide a comprehensive overview of <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting</b> in that department. This thesis reviewed and discussed appropriation life cycles, along with the organizations, accounting systems and reports involved in Navy <b>budgetary</b> financial <b>reporting.</b> Each appropriation enacted and allotted down the financial chain of command is accounted for through <b>budgetary</b> financial <b>reporting.</b> The organizations involved in <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting</b> are categorized into two groups; field level and service level. Five reports are currently in use: Trial Balance Report, Expense Element Report, Fund Status Report, Report on Budget Execution and Appropriation Status Report. The Navy is streamlining its current budgetary financial and accounting reporting use of 37 systems down to two primary budgetary accounting systems; the Standard Accounting and Reporting System and the Naval Headquarters Financial System. A comparison of <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting</b> with private sector financial reporting illuminated similarities in the basic accounting model underlying the financial reports, but differences in reporting objectives and practices. <b>Budgetary</b> financial <b>reporting</b> serves the objective of reporting budget execution status well but is limited {{in its ability to}} communicate financial position.

The broad theme of the workshop—“New challenges for public-sector accounting: IPSASs, <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Reporting,</b> and National Accounts”—was chosen to promote the discussion on topics that are currently {{at the very heart}} of the worldwide debate concerning public-sector accounting (PSA) reforms, namely: Fiscal Policy and <b>Budgetary</b> <b>Reporting,</b> International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) and Harmonization in PSA, Governmental Accounting and National Accounts, EPSASs and PSA in Europe, Accountability, and Consolidation. Indeed, nowadays an important debate exists within the EU about the adoption or adaptation of IPSASs (namely through European Public Sector Accounting Standards— EPSASs) by member states in order to get high-quality financial reporting by governments (European Commission, 2013; Manes Rossi, Aversano, & Christiaens, 2014). Given that the macroaccounting information (national accounts—NA), whose outputs are used to control and assess the Maastricht Treaty criteria, is derived from microaccounting (governmental accounting—GA), good-quality reporting systems for accounting at microlevel are demanded to assure debt and deficit data, among other, at accrual-based macroaccounting level (Jesus & Jorge, 2015) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGovernment {{accounting}} (GA) and National accounts (NA) are two {{reporting systems}} that, although aiming different purposes, are linked – public administrations’ financial {{information for the}} latter {{is provided by the}} former. Therefore, the alignment between the two systems is an issue for the reliability of the public sector aggregates finally obtained by the National Accounts. In the EU context, this is a critical issue, inasmuch as these aggregates are the reference for monitoring the fiscal policy underlying the Euro currency. However, while reporting in NA is accrual-based and harmonised under the European System of Regional and National Accounts, the GA each country still has its own reporting system, often mixing cash basis in <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting</b> with accrual basis in financial reporting, hence requiring accounting basis adjustments when translating data from GA into NA. Starting by conceptually analysing the accounting basis differences between GA and NA and the adjustments to be made when translating data from the former into the latter, this paper uses evidence from three southern European countries – Portugal, Spain and Italy, representing the southern Continental European accounting perspective, with cash-based <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting,</b> and where <b>budgetary</b> deficits have been particularly significant in the latest years – to show how diversity and materiality of these adjustments may question the reliability of the <b>budgetary</b> deficits finally <b>reported</b> in NA. The main findings point to the need for standardised procedures to convert cash-based (GA) into accrual-based (NA) data as a crucial step, preventing accounting manipulation, thus increasing reliability of informative outputs for both micro and macro purposes...|$|R

Stakeholders are of keen interest on the positive performance of the business enterprise they have interest in.

This research dealt {{with the impact of}} employee participation in budgeting as well as the adoption of effective budgetary control in the improvement of organizational performance of medium and large scale enterprises in Nigeria. The data used for this research was collected through the administration of research questionnaire to employees of medium and large scale enterprises in Nigeria. The research hypotheses were tested using regression analysis and correlation. At the end of the research, it was found out that employee participation and in budgeting as well as effective budgetary control are essential tools for the enhancement of organizational performance. The research therefore recommends that medium and large scale companies should adopt the bottom up budgeting system by allowing employees participate in budget formation, as well as the use of <b>periodic</b> <b>budgetary</b> control method. ...|$|R

40|$|U. S. Navy surface {{combatant}} requirements progressively dropped from 238 in 1988 to 116 in 1998. This reduction {{was part of}} the U. S. military transformation in the post-Cold War period. This thesis examined the major factors that influenced the change in {{surface combatant}} planning since 1990, i. e. budget agreements, naval doctrine, OPNAV reorganization, and Defense reviews. Data sources included books, periodicals, major force structure reviews, naval strategy papers, <b>budgetary</b> <b>reports,</b> and interviews. The major conclusion is that constrained fiscal resources had the most dramatic effect on the surface combatant fleet. To adapt to the drop in O&M and procurement funding, the Navy has reduced costs by decommissioning older ships, slowing shipbuilding rates, shifting to multiyear contracts, and focusing on life cycle expenses. The next scheduled surface combatant program, DD- 21, will compete against other shipbuilding programs due to projections of relatively flat Defense budgets. The shift to littoral warfare has also shaped the surface combatant force, changing doctrine and weapon system emphasis. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|In {{a context}} where governments {{around the world}} {{acknowledge}} {{a need for more}} informative governmental financial reporting to improve financial sustainability, the European Council is proposing that EU member states adopt International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs) —which are recognized as also allowing improved reliability of government finance statistics—in all subsectors of the General Government Sector (GGS). Consequently, the Governmental Accounting (GA) role of running and reporting on governments’ budgets for purposes of decisionmaking and accountability is changing to include being part of the EU budgetary and monetary policy, specifically within the Euro zone. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, it aims to start a debate in the literature about the ability of GA as it stands across Europe to meet the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA) requirements concerning GGS data. This assumes particular relevance in a context where the two systems have to coexist, but given that <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting</b> (GA) is the main input to ESA reporting (NA), reconciliation between the two systems is required. The second objective is of a more technical nature—empirically demonstrating the diversity and materiality of the main adjustments to be made when converting GGS data from GA into NA. This is done by using evidence for Portugal and Spain, focusing on Central Government data for the period 2006 – 2009 and measuring their quantitative impact on the public (budgetary) deficit. We conclude that GA systems as they are across EU do not meet ESA requirements, and further alignment is therefore needed to reduce adjustments as much as possible when translating data from GA into NA. Additionally, in the case of Portugal and Spain, the main findings show that the adjustments from GA into NA present great diversity for both of these Iberian countries. As for materiality, their impact is greater in Spain, but still significant in Portugal. Therefore, both the reliability and comparability of final <b>budgetary</b> balances <b>reported</b> by EU member states within the Excessive Deficit Procedures (EDP) requirements may be questionable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{splits the}} ex post {{error in the}} budget balance, defined as the final budget figure minus the planned figure, into {{implementation}} and revision errors, and investigates the determinants of these errors. The implementation error {{is the difference between}} the nowcast, published {{toward the end of the}} year of budget implementation, and the planned budget, while the revision error is the difference between the final figure and the nowcast. The split takes account of differences in reporting incentives at the different budgeting stages. The predictive content of fiscal plans is important, because it determines the reliability of the budget, while that of the nowcasts is important also because these figures are an input for the next budget and may contain important signals about the fiscal stance. Implementation and revision errors may arise for political and strategic reasons. Our results suggest that an improvement in the quality of institutions, whether measured by the tightness of national fiscal rules, the medium-term budgetary framework or budgetary transparency, increases the quality of <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting</b> at both the planning and the nowcast stage. This supports the recently adopted requirements on national fiscal frameworks. It also strengthens the case for a close monitoring by the European Commission of national budgetin...|$|R

The Republic of Moldova has developed and continues to promote rigorous reforms in the area of public finance management. In this article we have analyzed the main reforms and achievements in the field of public finance management in the Republic of Moldova, their importance by reference to good European practices, but also the need to continue them in the context of signing the Association Agreement. The authors argue that until now, the public finance management reform had been focused mainly on the planning and execution phases of National Public Budget, nonetheless the main problems lay in poor <b>budgetary</b> <b>reporting</b> and control.

Such scandals have raised concerns as {{to the ability of}} internal control systems within the organizations to restrict such occurrences. Although, no such scandals have been reported for Islamic organizations, to date (particularly mosques), there is concern as to whether these organizations experience the same deficiencies as the Western church institutions. As such, the study examines the existing financial management practices of state mosques in Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the areas of budgeting, receipts of income, disbursement of funds and reporting. A questionnaire survey and face-to-face interviews were employed in collecting the data. The results of the study indicate that state mosques in Peninsular Malaysia have a strong internal control system pertaining to the receipt of income and disbursements of funds.

A definitive version was subsequently published in Critical Perspectives on Accounting, 2011, 22 (7), pp. 632 - 643. DOI: [URL] paper seeks to connect two literatures: that on workplace bullying and that on the behavioural aspects of budgeting. It proposes to do so by suggesting extensions to both literatures. Arising from prescriptive concerns to recommend effective managerial approaches to the budgetary process, the general tendency in the literature of behavioural accounting has been to treat the matter of target-setting and the manner of acting on <b>budgetary</b> <b>reports</b> as independent variables, both of which are taken to influence performance as the dependent variable. Reasonable in its own terms, the unintended consequence has been a neglect of the capacity of budgetary controls to highlight variations in the cost-effectiveness with which individuals perform their work and so present opportunities for managerial bullying. The literature on workplace bullying (aka incivility, aggression, social undermining or mobbing) has been similarly inflected by its prescriptive origins. The need to enlist allies in the fight against workplace bullying has led to its depiction as a de-contextualised pathology, rather than a tendency to which managers are particularly prone. Similarly the need to detach bullying from the ‘normal’ pressures of management-by-exception has led to definitions which incorporate notions of individual victimisation and of its repetition over long periods of time. Using case material on a medium-sized shoe and slipper factory dating from 1978, this paper suggests that a comprehensive approach to workplace bullying needs to challenge these definitions. In particular it is important to recognise {{that there may be a}} collective dimension to bullying in the sense that an entire workforce can become its subject. In this scenario, sporadic and single-incident acts of aggression which fall outside the orthodox definitions of bullying have the effect of building up a kind of ‘fear capital’ (c. f. Bourdieu, 1984) such that the mere presence of the manager concerned, or even the prospect of that presence is accompanied by all the signs of psychological distress associated with more persistent forms of bullying. The paper further suggests that budgetary targets and information offer a highly effective means of achieving and maintaining the psychological ascendancy of the bullying manager over the bullied workforce: this because of their apparent mechanical connection with the employer’s interest in the employment relationship. In the case study company that interest translated into the question of survival in the face of imports from the ‘Third Italy’ and from South East Asia, thereby lending force to the practice of budget-based bullying. In this last respect, the increasingly globalized product markets which have characterised the last three decades have rendered the thirty-year old fieldwork on which the paper is based only too relevant.

40|$|Chinese {{cities have}} been {{experiencing}} significant growth and profound socioeconomic transition since late 1970 ’s. Reform and development on institution arrangement for land, {{which is one}} of the basic production elements, have been the core issue for the strategies of establishing market economy and urbanization. Land banking was a mechanism initiated in western European cities for directing urban development in early 1900 ’s. Under this mechanism land is resumed by public authorized organizations and will be held for future use to implement public land use policies. Some Chinese cities began their own land banking operation in the 1990 ’s. After nearly 20 years of introduction of land banking mechanism to China most of the cities and counties are now practicing this mechanism in their land management and supply framework. This study attempts to explore land banking mechanism and its effects on urban development comprehensively in lights of theories of new institutional economics and urban spatial structure applying the diachronic public policy analytical framework. Guangzhou, the third largest city and the first city to practice land banking mechanism, is taken as the study area. Spatial data for land supply records since introduction of land banking mechanism are collected and processed with GIS software. Archives in Guangzhou Construction Archive covering the land development and planning administration in Guangzhou were studied to facilitate in-depth understanding of the mechanism. Related statistics data, regulations, planning proposals, internal reports and were obtained to facilitate this study. Review on evolution of land banking mechanism in China and comparison of related regulations at state and local levels argue that the introduction of land banking mechanism into China has lead to institutional changes in the land development process by integrating western experience and local characteristics. Applying empirical transaction costs analysis on institutional models of major land supply mechanisms in China, this research illustrated that land banking mechanism has resulted in re-distribution of transaction costs of the land supply process, which reduces the transaction costs from the perspective land use right (LUR) users. However, for a specific case of land supply, overall transaction costs would increase under land banking mechanism compared to other land supply mechanisms. Exploration on data collected through GIS analysis illustrated that land banking mechanism strengthens city government’s capacity to instruct changes in both macro level urban form and micro level built environment. Analysis on statistics data and <b>budgetary</b> <b>reports</b> of Guangzhou Municipal Government demonstrates that with land banking mechanism gains of LUR conveyance are providing supplement income for the city government, which is approximately 30 % of the traditional tax-based fiscal income. Financing values of Guangzhou city’s land bank are developed by land banking loans and establishment of the urban development financing platform. Supplement fiscal income and financing values of land banking greatly improve local governments’ leading role in urbanization process mainly through investment on urban infrastructures. Case study on evolution of Liede village under land banking mechanism illustrates that different land development process and changes of urban form have also lead to rearrangement of socio spatial structure such as significant changes in residential spatial changes. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
