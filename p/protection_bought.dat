50|$|An unfunded credit {{derivative}} is {{one where}} credit <b>protection</b> is <b>bought</b> and sold between bilateral counterparties without the protection seller having to put up money upfront or {{at any given time}} during the life of the deal unless an event of default occurs.

Other species include white-tailed eagle, black kite and lesser spotted eagle. On passage there are numerous flocks of geese, waterfowl, cranes and waders. The other forms of wildlife include wild boar and occasionally otter. The site is frequented by birders and is placed ideally for those driving to Poland via Germany.|$|R
40|$|Young {{children}} have a natural curiosity and have not yet learned to avoid and get away from danger. It is often necessary to take measures {{to protect children from}} hazards. Parents buy protective products to avoid or decrease risks in their own and their children’s lives. Different kinds of protective products, including finger protection, are also common in nurseries, hospitals and other institutions. When a finger <b>protection</b> is <b>bought</b> and installed this gives the consumer a greater sense of security. It is vital that reality agrees with this sense. Otherwise the risk of injury may in fact increase, since a sense of security in the parent/supervisor often implies less supervision. It is therefore important to make sure that protective products on the market are safe and that they give the protection they were designed to give. This report presents a background study including injury statistics and discusses the hazards as well as methods of prevention/protection. Finger protection devices are divided into categories based on their protection method. Reasonable requirements, based on children’s characteristics and abilities, and ways to test these are discussed. Finally, suggestions of requirements and test methods are presented in the form of complete product standards for the different kinds of finger protection. ‘Finger protection’ in this report refers to protective devices designed to prevent crushing injuries between door leaf and door frame. This report deals only with non-integrated finger protection for inner doors, i. e. devices which are mounted onto an existing inner door. Currently there is no European standard regulating this kind of products...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{estimated}} 4 % {{of global}} child deaths (approximately 300, 000 deaths) {{were attributed to}} rotavirus in 2010. About a third of these deaths occurred in India and Ethiopia. Public finance of rotavirus vaccination in these two countries could substantially decrease child mortality and also reduce rotavirus-related hospitalizations, prevent health-related impoverishment and bring significant cost savings to households. METHODS: We use a methodology of 'extended cost-effectiveness analysis' (ECEA) to evaluate a hypothetical publicly financed program for rotavirus vaccination in India and Ethiopia. We measure program impact along four dimensions: 1) rotavirus deaths averted; 2) household expenditures averted; 3) financial risk protection afforded; 4) distributional consequences across the wealth strata of the country populations. RESULTS: In India and Ethiopia, the program {{would lead to a}} substantial decrease in rotavirus deaths, mainly among the poorer; it would reduce household expenditures across all income groups and it would effectively provide financial risk protection, mostly concentrated among the poorest. Potential indirect benefits of vaccination (herd immunity) would increase program benefits among all income groups, whereas potentially decreased vaccine efficacy among poorer households would reduce the equity benefits of the program. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach incorporates financial risk protection and distributional consequences into the systematic economic evaluation of vaccine policy, illustrated here with the case study of public finance for rotavirus vaccination. This enables selection of vaccine packages based on the quantitative inclusion of information on equity and on how much financial risk <b>protection</b> is being <b>bought</b> per dollar expenditure on vaccine policy, in addition to how much health is being bought...|$|R

In 1924, Bill Dwyer and Owney Madden purchased the Phoenix Cereal Beverage Company to begin brewing beer, while Larry Fay purchased a number of popular nightclubs and speakeasies that would become their primary outlets for the beer they manufactured and the bootlegged rum, scotch, vodka and champagne they smuggled into the country. Partner Danny Walsh controlled the Combine's liquor smuggling and distribution operations along the Rhode Island coast.

40|$|Whether it {{concerns}} a private individual, a corporate, {{a financial institution}} or even a government, we all obey the rule that he who lends money to a counterparty is exposed {{to the risk of}} financial loss, in case the borrower fails to honor the terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement. One speaks of default by the obligor and, broadly, refers to the associated risk as credit risk. As in the traditional life and non-life insurance industry,bilateral contracts are developed, by financial institutions, that allow for a risk-transfer between the lender (the protection buyer) and a third party (the protection seller). The protection seller agrees to cover(part of) the loss suffered by the lender in the (uncertain) event of adefault by the borrower (the reference entity). In return for this assurance, the protection buyer pays a periodic premium to the protection seller. Like insurance products, the value of these so-called credit derivatives depends entirely on the underlying (credit) risk. Moreover, thesecontracts can generally be entered into cost-free. No initial payment is required by either of the parties in order to close the deal. Such instruments are called unfunded. However, unlike traditional insurance contracts, credit derivatives can be traded. The corresponding market has seen an exponential growth over the last fifteenyears. From almost nothing in 1995, the total market notional now exceeds 30 trillion (1012) U. S. dollar, according to recent estimates (mid 2009). Moreover, by now this market is well-established, strictly-regulated and (highly) liquid. No doubt, the major catalyst for this immense succes is that, by mitigating risk exposures, credit derivatives can be used to offset and reduce the regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Basel II Capital Accord (2004). The latter agreement provides a unified framework for minimal capital requirements, supervisory review and market discipline, but fails to adopt a standardized approach with regard to assessing credit risk. On the contrary, under the internal ratings-based approach institutions are encouraged to usetheir own internal measures for the key drivers of credit risk, powering the demand for models to price credit derivatives. As key drivers, Basel II identifies the reference entity's default probability and the loss-given-default, i. e. the percentage of the exposure-at-default that willnot be recovered following default. However, with regard to funded credit derivatives and securitization in general, a third driver comes to play, namely the prepayment risk, i. e. the potential loss due to the full or partial early redemption of the outstandingdebt by borrowers. In case of funded derivatives, <b>protection</b> is <b>bought</b> by a so-called special purpose vehicle and payments under the credit derivative are funded using securitization techniques. Securitization is a transaction where the cash flows from an underlying pool of exposures (e. g. loans) are used to service at least two different series (tranches) of bonds (called securities). These tranches reflect different degrees of credit risk. This allows investors to select those securities that match their personal risk appetite. In this dissertation, building on the extensive literature on structural models for credit risk, we develop an integrated mathematical framework for default risk, loss-given-default and prepayment risk; with a focus towards securitization and a clear preference for Lévy processes as the stochastic mechanism to describe the underlying price dynamics. In the last decade, research departments of major banks started to accept jump processes as avaluable tool in modeling day-to-day market fluctuations. This increasing interest in Lévy models in finance {{can be attributed to the}} flexibility of the underlying probability distributions and to the presence of jumps in the sample paths. The distributions allow for skewness and excesskurtosis, granting a sufficiently high probability to the risk of extreme price movements over short time intervals. Moreover, the sample pathscan adequately represent the sudden jumps in the observed prices. It isof key importance to deal with these shocks if the market risk is to bemeasured and managed correctly. The text is structured as follows. Chapter 1 is intended as an accessible introduction to credit risk and securitization. We introduce the former concept based on several real-life examples. Next, we elaborate on credit derivatives. We explain the notion of a derivative instrument, look at the development of the market, discuss the different counterparties involved in the contract and overview the most important products. Subsequently, we clarify the idea of securitization. We show how this originally as a financing transaction intended technique can also be used to mitigate credit risk. We end the chapter with a preamble on credit risk modeling. Chapter 2 provides the necessary mathematical background. We introduce the basics of probability theory from a measure-theoretic point of view. Subsequently, we define the important concepts of a probability space, a random variable and a stochastic process. A second part is devoted to mathematical finance in continuous time. We discuss filtrations and clarify the important no-arbitrage theory and the relatedrisk-neutral valuation principle. The chapter ends with a remark about homogeneous portfolios. Chapter 3 is dedicatedto Lévy processes. In this dissertation, the latter are the elected tool to describe the price mechanism of the reference asset and the corresponding derivative instrument. We formally define a Lévy process and debate its structure and properties. Next, we discuss a technique that allows to generate sample paths of almost any Lévy process. Then, we provide several examples of Lévy processes that will be used in the subsequent chapters. Thereafter, we introduce the so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. We grant special attention to the particular case of the Gamma-OU process, that will appear later on. A justification as to why use Lévy processes in finance concludes the chapter. Chapter 4 deals with modeling the risks of default and prepayment within a securitization framework. We review the two most popular approachesto assess credit risk, i. e. the firm-value and the reduced-form approach. With regard to the probability of default, we discuss several well-acknowledged, several recently developed and some new (Lévy-based) models under both approaches. We examine how these can be adjusted and tailoredto fit within the securitization frame. All models are either based on the Normal distribution or on the Gamma distribution. Next, we focus on describing the risk of prepayment. Thereby, we enlist on the default risk models and extend the latter to be able to cope with prepayment. A major challenge, in this respect, is taking the correlation between these two risks into account. At the end of the chapter we discuss a case studywhere the developed models are used in an algorithm to determine the rating of two tranches of loan-backed securities. In Chapter 5 we discuss a generic framework to obtain stochastic loss-given-default in an arbitrary firm-value model for credit risk. We implement the technique into the Normal one-factor and the Gamma one-factor models. Next, we examine how stochastic loss-given-default influences thecapital charges under the Basel II Accord (2004). We also compare our approach to two models recently developed in the banking industry. Finally, we look at the impact of stochastic loss-given-default on the rating of the securities in the case study of the previous chapter. Chapter 6 is a stand-alone chapter. Here, we investigate the practical implementation of a particular member of a new ten-parameter family of Lévy processes, referred to as the Beta-family, introduced by Kuznetsov (2009). The process that we concentrate on is parameterizedin order to resemble the popular Variance-Gamma process due to Carr, Chang and Madan (1998). We therefore have baptized the new model as the Beta-Variance Gamma model. We discuss and examine its applications in pricing equity derivatives and credit derivatives. A summary of the main results and an outlook to future research conclude the study. nrpages: 260 status: publishe...|$|R
