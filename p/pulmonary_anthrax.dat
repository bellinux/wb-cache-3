However, the contribution of anthrax toxin proteins to dissemination, disease progression, and subsequent immunity after aerosol infection with spores has not been clearly elucidated. To better understand the role of anthrax toxins in pathogenesis in vivo and to investigate the contribution of antibody to toxin proteins in protection, we completed a series of in vivo experiments using a murine aerosol challenge model {{and a collection of}} in-frame deletion mutants lacking toxin components. Our data show that after aerosol exposure to Bacillus anthracis spores, anthrax lethal toxin was required for outgrowth of bacilli in the draining lymph nodes and subsequent progression of infection beyond the lymph nodes to establish disseminated disease. After <b>pulmonary</b> exposure to <b>anthrax</b> spores, toxin expression was required for the development of protective immunity to a subsequent lethal challenge. However, immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G) titers to toxin proteins, prior to secondary challenge, did not correlate with the protection observed upon secondary challenge with wild-type spores. A correlation was observed between survival after secondary challenge and rapid anamnestic responses directed against toxin proteins. Taken together, these studies indicate that anthrax toxins are required for dissemination of bacteria beyond the draining lymphoid tissue, leading to full virulence in the mouse aerosol challenge model, and that primary and anamnestic immune responses to toxin proteins provide protection against subsequent lethal challenge. These results provide support for the utility of the mouse aerosol challenge model for the study of inhalational anthrax...|$|R

50|$|Respiratory {{infection}} in humans is relatively rare and presents as two stages. It infects {{the lymph nodes}} in the chest first, rather than the lungs themselves, a condition called hemorrhagic mediastinitis, causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity, therefore causing shortness of breath. The first stage causes cold and flu-like symptoms. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, and chills. This can last hours to days. Often many fatalities from inhalational anthrax are when the first stage is mistaken for the cold or flu and the victim doesn't seek treatment until the second stage, which is 90% fatal. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly after hours or days of the first stage. Symptoms include high fever, extreme shortness of breath, shock, and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases. Historical mortality rates were over 85%, but, when treated early (seen in the 2001 anthrax attacks), observed case fatality rate dropped to 45%.

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} Bacillus anthracis {{is one of}} biological agents which {{may be used in}} bioterrorism attacks. The aim of this study a review of the new treatment possibilities of anthrax, with particular emphasis on the treatment of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Abbreviated description of the state of knowledge <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax,</b> as the most dangerous clinical form of the disease, is also extremely difficult to treat. Recently, considerable progress in finding new drugs and suitable therapy for anthrax has been achieved, for example, new antibiotics worth to mentioning, levofloxacin, daptomycin, gatifloxacin and dalbavancin. However, alternative therapeutic options should also be considered, among them the antimicrobial peptides, characterized by lack of inducible mechanisms of pathogen resistance. Very promising research considers bacteriophages lytic enzymes against selected bacteria species, including antibiotic-resistant strains. Results Interesting results were obtained using monoclonal antibodies: raxibacumab, cAb 29 or cocktails of antibodies. The application of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides to boost the immune response elicited by Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed and CMG 2 protein complexes, also produced satisfying therapy results. Furthermore, the IFN-α and IFN-β, PA-dominant negative mutant, human inter-alpha inhibitor proteins and LF inhibitors in combination with ciprofloxacin, also showed very promising results. Conclusions Recently, progress has been achieved in inhalation anthrax treatment. The most promising new possibilities include: new antibiotics, peptides and bacteriophages enzymes, monoclonal antibodies, antigen PA mutants, and inter alpha inhibitors applications.

40|$|Bacillus anthracis is {{surrounded}} by a polypeptide capsule composed of poly-gamma-d-glutamic acid (γDPGA). In a previous study, we reported that a monoclonal antibody (MAb F 26 G 3) reactive with the capsular polypeptide is protective in a murine model of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> The present study examined a library of six MAbs generated from mice immunized with γDPGA. Evaluation of MAb binding to the capsule by a capsular “quellung” type reaction showed a striking diversity in capsular effects. Most MAbs produced a rim type reaction that was characterized by a sharp increase followed directly by a decrease in refractive index at the capsular edge. Some MAbs produced a second capsular reaction well beneath the capsular edge, suggesting complexity in capsular architecture. Binding of MAbs to soluble γDPGA was assessed by a fluorescence perturbation assay in which a change in the MAb intrinsic fluorescence produced by ligand binding was used as a reporter for antigen-antibody interaction. The MAbs differed considerably in the complexity of the binding curves. MAbs producing rim type capsule reactions typically produced the more complex binding isotherms. Finally, the protective activity of the MAbs was compared in a murine model of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> One MAb was markedly less protective than the remaining five MAbs. Characteristics of the more protective MAbs included a relatively high affinity, an immunoglobulin G 3 isotype, and a complex binding isotherm in the fluorescence perturbation assay.

40|$|Mechanisms {{underlying}} {{susceptibility to}} anthrax infection are unknown. Using a phylogenetically diverse panel of inbred mice and spores of Bacillus anthracis Ames, we investigated host susceptibility to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Susceptibility profiles for survival time and organ pathogen load differed across strains, indicating distinct genetic controls. Tissue infection kinetics analysis showed greater systemic dissemination in susceptible DBA/ 2 J (D) mice but a higher terminal bacterial load in resistant BALB/cJ (C) mice. Interestingly, {{the most resistant}} strains, C and C 57 BL/ 6 J (B), demonstrated a sex bias for susceptibility. For example, BALB/cJ females had a significantly higher survival time and required 4 -fold more spores for 100 % mortality compared to BALB/cJ males. To identify genetic regions associated with differential susceptibility, survival time and extent of organ infection were assessed using mice derived from two susceptibility models: (i) BXD advanced recombinant inbred strains and (ii) F 2 offspring generated from polar responding C and D strains. Genome-wide analysis of BXD strain survival identified linkage on chromosomes 5, 6, 9, 11, and 14. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the C×DF 2 population revealed a significant QTL (designated Rpai 1 for resistance to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax</b> infection, locus 1) for survival time on chromosome 17 and also identified a chromosome 11 locus for lung pathogen burden. The striking difference between genome-wide linkage profiles for these two mouse models of anthrax susceptibility supports our hypothesis that these are multigenic traits. Our data provide the first evidence for a differential sex response to anthrax resistance and further highlight the unlikelihood of a single common genetic contribution for this response across strains...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Since the 2001 anthrax attacks, an {{extensive}} {{body of literature}} has evolved, {{but there has been}} a limited focus on the management of pediatric-specific issues. We looked at the symptom complexes of all pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department of our hospital during this period and examined whether their presentations would likely allow cur-rent guidelines to be used as potential screening criteria to identify children infected with anthrax. Methods: We retrospec-tively reviewed emergency department records of all adult and pediatric patients (up to the age of 21 years) at Inova Fairfax Hospital during this time, when a large, and at the time ill-defined, group in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area was at risk for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Two cases of anthrax infection were identified at this hospital in exposed adult postal workers. Screening algorithms (described by Mayer et al. and Hupert et al.) were applied to adult and pediatric patients with the pres-ence of fever (38 °C), tachycardia, or other symptoms compatible with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Specifically, the usefulness of these guidelines as potential screening tools to identify possibly infected children was examined. Results: Of 767 pediatric patients seen in the emergency department during the study period, 312 met criteria for review (41 %; 95 % CI: 37 – 44 %). Four adult patients (0. 4 %; 95 % CI: 0. 1 – 0. 9 %) had at least five clinical symptoms, fever, and tachycardia; two of them had inhalational anthrax. No pediatric patient presented with five or more clinical symptoms. Twelve children (3. 9 %; 95 % CI: 2 – 6. 6 %) presented with four clinical symptoms; five of the 12 had neither fever nor tachycardia. Children, particularly in-fants and toddlers, presented with nonspecific symptom complexes primarily limited to fever, vomiting, cough, and trouble breathing.

40|$|Perhaps {{no other}} {{microorganism}} has received {{as much attention}} for its use as a potential agent for bioterrorism as Bacillus anthracis.

Anthrax is actually a disease of herbivorous animals with humans getting infected by spores due to accidental entry into the body by contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, insect bites, inhalation or ingestion.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{examined}} the regulatory interactions of a serine/threonine phosphatase (BA-Stp 1), serine/threonine kinase (BA-Stk 1) pair in Bacillus anthracis. B. anthracis STPK 101, a null mutant lacking BA-Stp 1 and BA-Stk 1, was impaired {{in its ability to}} survive within macrophages, and this correlated with an observed reduction in virulence in a mouse model of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> Biochemical analyses confirmed that BA-Stp 1 is a PP 2 C phosphatase and dephosphorylates phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. Treatment of BA-Stk 1 with BA-Stp 1 altered BA-Stk 1 kinase activity, indicating that the enzymatic function of BA-Stk 1 can be influenced by BA-Stp 1 dephosphorylation. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and mutagenesis approaches, three phosphorylated residues, T 165, S 173, and S 214, in BA-Stk 1 were identified as putative regulatory targets of BA-Stp 1. Further analysis found that T 165 and S 173 were necessary for optimal substrate phosphorylation, while S 214 was necessary for complete ATP hydrolysis, autophosphorylation, and substrate phosphorylation.

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that the peptidoglycan component of B. anthracis may {{play a critical role}} in morbidity and mortality associated with inhalation anthrax. To explore this issue, we purified the peptidoglycan component of the bacterial cell wall and studied the response of human peripheral blood cells. The purified B. anthracis peptidoglycan was free of noncovalently bound protein but contained a complex set of amino acids probably arising from the stem peptide. The peptidoglycan contained a polysaccharide that was removed by mild acid treatment, and the biological activity remained with the peptidoglycan and not the polysaccharide. The biological activity of the peptidoglycan was sensitive to lysozyme but not other hydrolytic enzymes, showing that the activity resides in the peptidoglycan component and not bacterial DNA, RNA or protein. B. anthracis peptidoglycan stimulated monocytes to produce primarily TNFa; neutrophils and lymphocytes did not respond. Peptidoglycan stimulated monocyte p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and p 38 activity was required for TNFa production by the cells. We conclude that peptidoglycan in B. anthracis is biologically active, that it stimulates a proinflammatory response in monocytes, and uses the p 38 kinase signal transduction pathway to do so. Given the high bacterial burden in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax,</b> these findings suggest that the inflammatory events associated with peptidoglyca...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus anthracis is {{surrounded}} by a capsular polypeptide composed of poly-γ-d-glutamic acid (PGA).

Although the tissue and cellular depots have been identified, there is little known about the uptake and intracellular fate of PGA. As a consequence, we examined the cellular uptake and organelle localization of PGA in the murine macrophage-like cell line J 774. 2. We found that PGA binds to and is internalized by J 774. 2 cells and accumulates in CD 71 transferrin receptor-positive endosomes. The receptor-mediated endocytosis inhibitors amantadine and phenylarsine oxide inhibited the binding and uptake of PGA in these cells. Cytochalasin D and vinblastine, actin and microtubule inhibitors, respectively, failed to completely inhibit binding and uptake. Finally, we found that PGA is degraded in J 774. 2 cells starting 4 h after uptake, with continued degradation occurring for at least 24 h. This degradation of PGA may explain the rapid clearance of PGA that is observed in vivo compared to the slow clearance noted with capsular polysaccharides...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus anthracis is the causative {{agent of}} anthrax, a {{bacterial}} infection {{with a high}} mortality rate [1 - 3]. Although anthrax infection can be cutaneous, gastrointestinal or pulmonary, the pulmonary form is the most deadly [2, 3]. Thus, the release of Bacillus anthracis spores that can be inhaled represents a potent bioterrorism threat; the capacity of B. anthracis spores {{to act as a}} bioterrorism weapon was demonstrated in 2001, with the intentional infection of 22 persons in the U. S. A. [2, 4]. Until recently, the available vaccines were developed to confer protection against cutaneous infection; despite this, these vaccines demonstrated experimental efficacy against pulmonary infection in multiple animal models [1, 2]. Nevertheless, there are many limitations for these vaccines to be considered successful and effective vaccine, including the intensity of the required vaccination schedule, the administration route and the presence of local adverse effects experienced after vaccination [1, 3, 5, 6]. To develop more efficient vaccines against <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax,</b> intranasal formulations with adjuvant have been studied.

40|$|Bacillus anthracis, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} anthrax, is a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium. Infection with this pathogen results in multisystem dysfunction and death. The pathogenicity of B. anthracis {{is due to}} the production of virulence factors, including edema toxin (ET). Recently, we established the protective role of type-IIA secreted phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2 -IIA) against B. anthracis. A component of innate immunity produced by alveolar macrophages (AMs), sPLA 2 -IIA is found in human and animal bronchoalveolar lavages at sufficient levels to kill B. anthracis. However, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax</b> is almost always fatal, suggesting the potential impairment of sPLA 2 -IIA synthesis and/or action by B. anthracis factors. We investigated the effect of purified ET and ET-deficient B. anthracis strains on sPLA 2 -IIA expression in primary guinea pig AMs. We report that ET inhibits sPLA 2 -IIA expression in AMs at the transcriptional level via a cAMP/protein kinase A–dependent process. Moreover, we show that live B. anthracis strains expressing functional ET inhibit sPLA 2 -IIA expression, whereas ET-deficient strains induced this expression. This stimulatory effect, mediated partly by the cell wall peptidoglycan, can be counterbalanced by ET. We conclude that B. anthracis down-regulates sPLA 2 -IIA expression in AMs through a process involving ET. Our study, therefore, describes a new molecular mechanism implemented by B. anthracis to escape innate host defense. These pioneering data wil...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBacillus anthracis, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} anthrax, is a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium. Infection with this pathogen results in multisystem dysfunction and death. The pathogenicity of B. anthracis {{is due to}} the production of virulence factors, including edema toxin (ET). Recently, we established the protective role of type-IIA secreted phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2 -IIA) against B. anthracis. A component of innate immunity produced by alveolar macrophages (AMs), sPLA 2 -IIA is found in human and animal bronchoalveolar lavages at sufficient levels to kill B. anthracis. However, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax</b> is almost always fatal, suggesting the potential impairment of sPLA 2 -IIA synthesis and/or action by B. anthracis factors. We investigated the effect of purified ET and ET-deficient B. anthracis strains on sPLA 2 -IIA expression in primary guinea pig AMs. We report that ET inhibits sPLA 2 -IIA expression in AMs at the transcriptional level via a cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent process. Moreover, we show that live B. anthracis strains expressing functional ET inhibit sPLA 2 -IIA expression, whereas ET-deficient strains induced this expression. This stimulatory effect, mediated partly by the cell wall peptidoglycan, can be counterbalanced by ET. We conclude that B. anthracis down-regulates sPLA 2 -IIA expression in AMs through a process involving ET. Our study, therefore, describes a new molecular mechanism implemented by B. anthracis to escape innate host defense. These pioneering data will provide new molecular targets for future intervention against this deadly pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Subunit {{vaccines}} against anthrax {{based on}} recombinant protective antigen (PA) potentially offer more consistent and less reac-togenic anthrax vaccines but require adjuvants to achieve optimal immunogenicity. This {{study sought to}} determine in a murine model of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax</b> infection whether the polysaccharide adjuvant Advax or the innate immune adjuvant murabutide alone or together could enhance PA immunogenicity by comparison to an alum adjuvant. A single immunization with PA plus Advax adjuvant afforded significantly greater protection against aerosolized Bacillus anthracis Sterne strain 7702 than three immunizations with PA alone. Murabutide had a weaker adjuvant effect than Advax when used alone, but whenmurabutide was formulated together with Advax, an additive effect on immunogenicity and protection was observed, with complete protection after just two doses. The combined adjuvant formulation stimulated a robust, long-lasting B-cell memory response that pro-tected mice against an aerosol challenge 18 months postimmunization with acceleration of the kinetics of the anamnestic IgG response to B. anthracis as reflected by 4 -fold-higher anti-PA IgG titers by day 2 postchallenge versus mice that received PA with Alhydrogel. In addition, the combination of Advax plus murabutide induced approximately 3 -fold-less inflammation than Alhydrogel as measured by in vivo imaging of cathepsin cleavage resulting from injection of ProSense 750. Thus, the combina-tion of Advax andmurabutide provided enhanced protection against inhalational anthrax with reduced localized inflammation, making this a promising next-generation anthrax vaccine adjuvanting strategy.

40|$|Bacterial {{capsules}} {{are common}} targets for antibody-mediated immunity. The capsule of Bacillus anthracis is unusual among capsules {{because it is}} composed of a polymer of poly-c-D-glutamic acid (cDPGA). We previously generated murine IgG 3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to cDPGA that were protective in a murine model of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>anthrax.</b> IgG 3 antibodies are characteristic of the murine response to polysaccharide antigens. The goal {{of the present study}} was to produce subclass switch variants of the cDPGA mAbs (IgG 3 RIgG 1 RIgG 2 bRIgG 2 a) and assess the contribution of subclass to antibody affinity and protection. Subclass switch antibodies had identical variable regions but differed in their heavy chains. The results showed that a switch from the protective IgG 3 to IgG 1, IgG 2 b or IgG 2 a was accompanied by i) a loss of protective activity ii) a change in mAb binding to the capsular matrix, and iii) a loss of affinity. These results identify a role for the heavy chain constant region in mAb binding. Hybrid mAbs were constructed in which the CH 1, CH 2 or CH 3 heavy chain constant domains from a non-protective, low binding IgG 2 b mAb were swapped into the protective IgG 3 mAb. The IgG 3 mAb that contained the CH 1 domain from IgG 2 b showed no loss of affinity or protection. In contrast, swapping the CH 2 or CH 3 domains from IgG 2 b into IgG 3 produced a reduction in affinity and a loss of protection. These studies identify a role for th...|$|E
