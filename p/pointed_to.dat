5|$|Among more {{obviously}} serious matters, Roberts <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the Herbert board's {{imposition of}} a rule that shop-floor employees, mostly if not all male, must wear pink uniforms as being typical of its distance from reality, fad-ism and tendency to make mountains of molehills.|$|E

5|$|Critics also <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact}} that in some cases {{competitors}} are the students of members of the jury.

Schundler came to Baltimore to campaign for Tufaro.|$|E

5|$|From 1921 to 1924, William Seiter {{directed}} a half-dozen FBO releases, some produced directly for the studio, others independently. Between 1922 and 1926, Emory Johnson produced and {{directed a}}t least eight films for FBO. Historian William K.

5|$|Historians have <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the {{deliberate}} {{parallels between the}} entrance of the rebel army into the Austrian Netherlands in 1789 and Louis of Nassau's invasion of Frisia in 1566 which acted as the trigger for the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule.|$|E

5|$|In the {{investigation}} that followed, the evidence quickly <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Jereboam O. Beauchamp, 23, who had married the much older Anna Cooke in 1824. (She was a contemporary of Sharp). On November 11, 1825, a four-man posse arrested Beauchamp {{at his home}} in Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{radiocarbon}} dating techniques date {{an object of}} popular interest, for example the Shroud of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988; the results <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud's authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.|$|E
5|$|Schneiderman {{described}} Trump University as a bait-and-switch {{scheme and}} <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that}} the organization was not a university. He accused Trump of misleading more than 5,000 people to pay up to $35,000 to learn his real estate investment techniques.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{research}} and debate has <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Overton as a scapegoat for an informal policy of US pilots regularly violating the Yalu River border into China, {{and that the}} US military discredited Overton {{as a way to}} prevent an international incident. Overton was finally given the medals he had earned in the war—including a Distinguished Service Cross and four Silver Stars—in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E
5|$|After {{hostilities}} ended, {{a survey}} {{team from the}} Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T.

Later calculations based on charring <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as 13 kilotons. This figure became the official yield.|$|E

5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E
5|$|Besides Gešovski, {{there were}} no fatalities, but several JNA {{soldiers}} were wounded. Gešovski's death sparked demonstrations in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuđman of being responsible for the murder.

5|$|Brolgas are monogamous {{and usually}} bond for life, though new pairings may follow a {{fatality}} of one individual. A feature of a bonded couple is the synchronous calling which the female usually initiates. She stands with her wings folded and beak <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the sky and}} emits a series of trumpeting calls. The male stands alongside in a similar posture but with his wings flared and primaries drooping. He emits one longer call for every two emitted by the female.|$|E
