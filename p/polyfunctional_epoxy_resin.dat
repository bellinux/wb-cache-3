A presença de um amino acelerador, baseado numa poliaminoamida comercial, mostrou-se imprescindível para a ocorrência de reticulação das cadeias do PVC. Resultados de grau de reticulação mostraram que só houve formação de gel nas amostras onde o amino acelerador foi utilizado concomitantemente com a resina epóxi, evidenciando uma sinergia entre ambos. Apesar dos resultados de módulo de Young sugerirem a formação de uma rede {{tridimensional}} entre as moléculas do PVC e a resina epóxi, a comprovação de uma reação química de reticulação entre o PVC e a resina epóxi não foi possível, devido ao grande numero de moléculas presentes na formulação final.

40|$|This work {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} feasibility of curing <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> layers using microwaves for physical models and prototypes. Investigations {{have been carried out}} to use <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> or a combination of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> mixed with a different material in powder form followed by a curing process using microwave radiation. The microwave radiation supports the polarisation of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> through heating based on the effect of the dielectric property. The curing process of the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> using microwave radiation takes place more rapidly and supports the temperature rise, as the dielectric value of the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> rises with an increase in temperature, primarily through changes in frequency. The maximum increase in temperature takes place at a critical frequency. The penetration of the microwaves through the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> is controlled by the wavelength of microwave radiation {{as a function of the}} frequency. Reducing the operational frequency of microwave radiation compensates an increase in thickness of the layer.

40|$|<b>Epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} thermosetting polymers with diverse applications. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> are mainly produced from the reaction of bisphenol-A (BPA) and epichlorohydrin. The consumption of bisphenol-A is facing growing concerns over its carcinogenic effects and its sustainability. Lignin can be a promising renewable substitute of bisphenol-A in the synthesis of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> In this thesis work, a novel method has been developed for the synthesis of bio-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> with reduced side reactions, employing de-polymerized lignin from organosolv lignin (DOL), kraft lignin (DKL) and hydrolysis lignin (DHL) under alkaline condition in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). The preliminary results showed that the reaction temperature, reaction time, NaOH/lignin molar ratio and epichlorohydrin/lignin molar ratio influenced the reaction yield and the molecular weights of the final products. The synthesis process has been optimized by using response surface methodology to produce bio-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> with a higher epoxy content and greater yield. Under the optimum conditions using DOL, DOL-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> with an <b>epoxy</b> content as high as ~ 8 was produced at 99 % yield. The synthesis using DKL at the optimum conditions led to a DKL-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> with an <b>epoxy</b> content of 5. 6 at 97 % yield. In addition, bio-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> derived from hydrolysis lignin (HL) have also been synthesized with lower amount of catalyst using DHL. The DHL-epoxy resin obtained at the optimum conditions has an epoxy content of ~ 5 and 95 % yield. The curing kinetics of admixtures of the synthesized lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and a conventional BPA-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> at various blending ratios were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with two kinds of curing agents, i. e. diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM), diethylenetriamine (DETA). The kinetic parameters were evaluated by the model-free kinetics and the activation energy for the curing reaction was calculated as a function of conversion. The activation energy changed with the progress of curing process and it revealed that the curing of a lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> is a complex process with several reactions occurring at the same time. The fluctuation of activation energy depended on the content of the lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> in the blended mixture, type of lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> and the type of curing agent used. The synthesized lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> were blended with a conventional BPA-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> at a blending ratio of 0 - 100 wt. % and used as polymer matrixes for manufacturing fiber reinforced plastics (FRPs). The thermal stability of the obtained lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> was also characterized using TGA-FTIR analysis. The mechanical/thermal characterization results indicated that the lignin-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> have excellent mechanical/thermal properties and can be used as a substitute for conventional BPA-based <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> at a ratio up to 75 wt% in FRPs without compromising their properties...|$|R

40|$|Interphase {{reactions}} between cured <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> and isocyanates are investigated. The <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> contain secondary hydroxyl {{groups as}} reactive groups only or secondary hydroxyl plus amine. The isocyanate diffuses into the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> forming an interphase with a thickness of some micrometers. Depending on the functional groups {{available in the}} <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin,</b> urethane and urea groups are formed in the interphase.

If the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> react with bifunctional isocyanates, a crosslinked interphase is formed. Due to the higher reactivity between amine and isocyanate compared to hydroxyl and isocyanate, the urea is formed first.

The basic goal in toughening cross-linked <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> that are normally brittle at room temperature is to improve crack resistance and toughness without significantly decreasing other important inherent properties, such as the flexural modulus and the thermomechanical properties of the original <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> In the present study, thermally stable <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> modified urea-formaldehyde/silicon blends have been prepared by in situ polymerization technique.

Our results show that in both reactive and additive modes, MP is effective in increasing limiting oxide index (LOI) and the char yields of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> at lower phosphorous content. We observed that flame retardation by MP in its reactive mode is better than in its additive mode; the same phenomenon was found also for the glass-transition temperature (Tg). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> containing MP decompose at relatively lower temperatures than those lacking MP; this decomposition results in a protective layer forming that prevents the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> from decomposing further by combustion...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} made to {{determine}} {{the advantages of the}} use of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> in the industrial arts laboratory. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the feasibility of using <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> as a wood adhesive. Data was gathered from texts, periodicals, and unpublished data. Tests were conducted using epoxy samples acquired from three epoxy manufacturers on three different woods and joints. The study discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> as a wood adhesive and the material and equipment necessary for the use of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> Strength tests were performed on the joints adhered with epoxy and on joints adhered with white glue. A hand operated high tensile strength machine was used to conduct the tests. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>Resins</b> were found, in most cases, to give a more durable bond than white glue. Further studies should be made using <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> as adhesives for metal, glass, plastic, and other materials used in the industrial arts laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Siliconized <b>epoxy</b> matrix <b>resin</b> was {{developed}} by reacting diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A (DGEBA) type <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> with hydroxyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (silicone) modiWer, using -aminopropyltriethoxysilane crosslinker and dibutyltindilaurate catalyst. The siliconized <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> was cured with 4, 4 -diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM), 1, 6 -hexanediamine (HDA), and bis (4 -aminophenyl) phenylphosphate (BAPP). The BAPP cured epoxy and siliconized <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> exhibit better Xame-retardant behaviour than DDM and HDA cured resins. The thermal stability and Xame-retardant property of the cured <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> were studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and limiting oxygen index (LOI). The glass transition temperatures (Tg) were measured by diVerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the surface morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The heat deXection temperature (HDT) and moisture absorption {{studies were carried out}} as per standard testing procedure. The thermal stability and Xame-retardant properties of the cured <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> were improved by the incorporation of both silicone and phosphorus moieties. The synergistic eVect of silicone and phosphorus enhanced the limiting oxygen index values, which was observed for siliconized <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> cured with phosphorus containing diamine compound...|$|R
