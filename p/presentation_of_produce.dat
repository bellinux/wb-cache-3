It comprises: (1) a Diagnostic Expert System (DES) for {{the identification of the}} principal pests, diseases and nutritional disorders of six common vegetable crops (aubergine, bean, cucumber, lettuce, pepper and tomato) and provides guidance for their control, (2) a Control Expert System (CES) for the irrigation, fertilisation and aeration of one of these crops (tomato) based on its known physiological requirements and local climatic conditions, (3) an information presentation package to provide decision support for the grower in respect of cultivation practices such as soil sterilisation, plant propagation, planting dates, harvest etc., and (4) a market presentation module, incorporating the quality requirements of the European Union, to provide decision support for the packaging and market <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>produce.</b> In its present form the CES assists the grower to make critical decisions for the cultivation of his crops, while the DES aids the diagnosis and treatment of pests, diseases and disorders. Produce quality is thus improved and economy in fertiliser and water usage achieved. 1...|$|E

The present study investigated the effects of changes in task information reliability on the performance of multi-cue judgment across conditions where the reliability of stimulus information was presented as a feedforward information source to enhance performance. Significant decrements in judgment performance were found across discrete changes in the reliability of source information.

We consider information items that contain required disclosures separately from those that contain mainly voluntary disclosures, since most previous work that identifies factors affecting financial disclosures have focused on discretionary information. To test our hypotheses, we employ a sample of companies rated by the AIMR. We use the AIMR’s disclosure quality rating as an independent variable to investigate whether companies have disclosure profiles that carry over to their Web dissemination practices. Our results confirm that they do, although mainly with respect to the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> voluntarily <b>produced</b> financial data. Consistent with extant literature on voluntary disclosure, our evidence suggests that firms develop a Web-based dissemination policy based on their size, need to access the capital markets, need to reduce information asymmetry, and their non-Web-based disclosure personality. Of particular interest, these results indicate that some of the incentives thought to motivate initial voluntary disclosure also explain subsequent voluntary dissemination...|$|R
40|$|The author {{reflects}} {{on the issue of}} epistemological limitations in the process of media imaginings of political reality. Using reference theory and description theory the author tries to answer the question of what makes up the image of political reality as verbalized in media coverage. His conclusion is that attempts to reflect the factual image in the media <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> politics <b>produce</b> a specific politico-journalistic construction of this reality, the apparent re- ality. Therefore, the category of truth in media communications concerning the field of poli- tics usually fails. One should thus expect that this traditional realism, which is expressed on the one hand by the factual nature of the media, and on the other by the morality of the media, will constitute a pillar that supports the image of political reality that is presented, interpreted and commented on in the media. In principle, this should not be a naïve realism, giving prior- ity to individual cognitive spontaneity rather than to reflection, analysis and experience, or a spiritual realism seeking the truth about reality through human spirituality...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{literature}} review is to examine whether Pavlovian eye blink conditioning in the rabbit consists solely of a specific motor reflex or involves other extracerebellar control systems. Castiglioni et al. (2009) utilized a transfer design in which retention of learning in different environments and {{the expression of the}} original learning was not limited to a single motor reflex measure. Subjects were trained in a traditional Pavlovian stock to differentiate between an S+ signal of a brief tone paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US) of cutaneous shock. Then, subjects were tested for what they had learned in a different environment. The results showed that the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> the S+ <b>produced</b> completely different behavior in the open environment as compared to the Pavlovian stock. In the restricted environment of the Pavlovian stock, <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> the S+ <b>produced</b> eye blink responses without any additional motor or emotional reactions. In the transfer environment, reaction to the S+ produced: (a) a prolonged disruption of ongoing behavior, (b) a wide range of complex emotional responses, and (c) a complete absence of eye blink response. Reaction to the S- in the Pavlovian stock or in the open environment, did not elicit an eye blink response. These findings provide strong evidence that Pavlovian conditioning is not just a specific motor reflex, but instead involves a difference in meaning and significance of the S+ for the subjects when presented in two discrete environments. This is observed in the subjects? different response patterns which unmasked a significant emotional component of the conditioning. This lead to the conclusion that nictitating membrane (NM) conditioning consists of more than an invariant, discrete cerebellar oculomotor reflex. The clear emotional component to the conditioning indicates the involvement of extracerebellar control mechanisms, potentially a widespread cerebral network in addition to the microcerebellar control of the specific motor reflex, a contradiction to current neuromodels...|$|R

40|$|The thymus is {{believed}} to {{play a central role}} in the pathogenesis of Myasthenia gravis (MG). According to a previous hypothesis, MG is initiated within the thymus by immunogenic <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> locally <b>produced</b> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) to potentially autoimmune T cells. Data of 10 consecutive MG patients demonstrate two critical features of MG thymuses that support the concept of intrathymic activation of autoreactive, AChR-specific lymphocytes. Morphologically, the thymuses showed lympho-follicular hyperplasia in nine cases and benign thymoma in one case. The paramount feature revealed by immunohistological double marker analyses was the intimate association of myoid cells (antigen producing) with interdigitating reticulum cells (potentially antigen presenting cells), both of which were surrounded by T 3 + lymphocytes in thymus medulla. All 10 thymuses contained T lymphocytes reactive with AChR. This was in contrast to the peripheral immune compartment (blood) where in only 3 of 10 patients, significant T cell responses to AChR were observed. AChR-specific T cell lines could be established from 8 of 10 thymuses, all members of the helper/inducer subset as indicated by the expression of markers T 3 and T 4...|$|R
40|$|While rats were {{responding}} in a single-lever apparatus to avoid electric shock, a signal was presented {{and followed by}} a 5 -min timeout period when all shocks were omitted. For the response-dependent member of each yoked pair, the first response 60 sec after onset of the pre-timeout signal terminated the signal and initiated timeout. The other, yoked animal was exposed to the same sequence except that signal termination and timeout onset were response independent. Under the response-dependent condition, response rates {{in the presence of}} the signal increased relative to baseline rates. Rate increases also occurred when timeout was response independent, but were of lesser magnitude and reliability. Subsequent reversal of the yoking arrangement produced stable and equivalent rate increases under both conditions. Other findings were that increased rates {{in the presence of the}} signal diminished when timeout was omitted but were maintained for a time on an avoidance-extinction baseline. In general, the results supported the conclusion of previous experiments that timeout from avoidance can serve as a positive reinforcer. The finding that response-independent <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> timeout <b>produced</b> rate increases, particularly after a history with response-dependent timeout, was interpreted in terms of adventitious reinforcement of previously established behavior...|$|R

This explanation was tested by exposing 41 Ss with spider phobia (mean age 32 yrs) to spider words, general threat words, and neutral words instead of pictures. Words were presented both masked and unmasked while electrodermal activity was measured. Under unmasked conditions, SCRs were largest for spider words followed by general threat words, then neutral words. When masked, the difference between spider words and general threat words disappeared but SCRs remained significantly smaller for neutral words.

In contrast, negative picture presentation did not slow down judgments in subsequent perceptual processing (e. g., color judgments about words, size judgments about objects). The subjective arousal level of negative pictures did not modulate the interference effects on semantic or perceptual processing.

Although the optokinetic reflex generates following eye movements similar to pursuit, it cannot be used to mediate suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex {{in the absence of an}} intact pursuit system. The findings strengthen the view that the optokinetic reflex evolved to act in synergy with the vestibulo-ocular reflex in generating compensatory eye movements...|$|R

(3) Does the <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> a book <b>produced</b> as a slide-tape program, television program, or in a story hour, affect the interest of three- and four-year-old children in books other than the specific book produced and presented?Using an experimental design, the three treatments, slide-tape, television (videotape), and story hour were randomly assigned to three groups of three- and four-year-old children enrolled in the Early Childhood Research Laboratory at Northern Illinois University, Department of Curriculum and Instruction, College of Education. A fourth group was used as a control and received no treatment. Each group was comprised of ten children. A time sampling checklist was designed on which was recorded the children's use of books. Book use was divided into three categories: use of the presented book, use of other books, and the combined use of total available books. Data were gathered for the study over an eight-month period. Data were collected two days per week, 25 minutes per day over a four-week period for each group. For the three experimental groups, the treatment intervened between the second and third day of data recording. The study was approved as "not at risk" to the children by the review committee for use of human subjects in research. The raw data on the checksheets were converted to means of book usage for each group for each day. Mean book usage was computed in three categories, use of total books available in the research setting, use of the book used in the three treatments, use of books other than the treatment book. The means of the four groups were compared using an analysis of variance. Significance of these analyses was established at the. 05 level at minimum. Means were compared for the four groups for the two pretests and for each of the six posttests, and of the sum of the posttests. The findings of the study indicated there were no significant differences in the means of the sums of the posttests of the three experimental groups in any of the three categories of book use: (1) total books available, (2) the presented book, or (3) other books. The research findings of this study do not warrant the rejection of any of the null hypotheses. The conclusion is: there is no significant difference in the interest of three- and four-year-old children in books whether or not they are presented with a story hour, television or slide-tape production.

Unfortunately, research on what produces the most effective feedback is mixed, {{and the relationship between}} these factors and resulting evaluative and behavioral outcomes in less clear. Four studies explored the relationship between feedback frame and frequency by addressing whether overall task feedback framed positively and receiving more frequent trial outcome feedback led to more positive performance evaluations and improvements in subsequent task performance (Studies 1 A and 1 B), how these evaluative and behavioral outcomes varied across different trial feedback frequency intervals (Study 2 A), and whether more relevant trial feedback influenced the pattern of these results (Study 2 B). Across the four studies, it was noted that the frequency of trial feedback was more influential for task performance outcomes, while the overall task feedback frame was more influential for performance evaluation outcomes. In addition, more relevant outcome feedback was seen to influence the relationship of feedback variables more for performance evaluations than task performance. Taken together, these studies provide some clarity as to how different types and <b>presentations</b> <b>of</b> feedback <b>produce</b> different evaluative and behavioral outcomes and show initial direction as to when framing task feedback and providing trial feedback more frequently can lead to better, more normatively correct decision making.

However, combining differences in gating and ear <b>of</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>produced</b> thresholds that were indistinguishable from those obtained when gating differences alone were employed.

Three LED headlamps were tested (with correlated color temperatures of 4000, 4800, and 6600 K), as well as a tungsten-halogen headlamp and an HID headlamp. Subjects, seated in a stationary vehicle, rated discomfort from brief <b>presentations</b> <b>of</b> stimuli that <b>produced</b> illuminances <b>of</b> 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1 lux. As predicted in our previous analytical study, we found that—when they appear bluer than current tungsten-halogen or HID headlamps—LED headlamps tend to produce more discomfort glare. The effect is probably due to the color appearance of the LED lamps used in this study rather than to any inherent characteristic of LED sources, and it could probably be altered or reversed with different sources. For the data reported here, ratings of discomfort glare were linearly related to the amount of blue content in the light output as weighted by the spectral sensitivity of the short-wavelength (blue) cone photoreceptors. Therefore, if this relationship is replicated and extended in future studies, it may provide an index of blue content that could be used heuristically to select colors of headlamps to minimize driver complaints about glare...|$|R

The analysis draws upon participant observation, ethnography, and an archive of correspondence, to unpack the building of the Dashboard and the emergent politics of data and design. Our findings reveal four main observations. First, a dashboard is a complex socio-technical assemblage of actors and actants that work materially and discursively within a set of social and economic constraints, existing technologies and systems, and power geometries to assemble, produce and maintain the website. Second, the production and maintenance of a dashboard unfolds contextually, contingently and relationally through transduction. Third, the praxis and politics of creating a dashboard has wider recursive effects: just as building the dashboard was shaped by the wider institutional landscape, producing the system inflected that landscape. Fourth, the data, configuration, tools, and modes <b>of</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>of</b> a dashboard <b>produce</b> a particularised set of spatial knowledges about the city. We conclude that rather than frame dashboard development in purely technical terms, it is important to openly recognize their contested and negotiated politics and praxis...|$|R
