Handmade chain stitch embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric. For this reason the stitch is an effective surface embellishment near seams on finished fabric. Because chain stitches can form flowing, curved lines, they are used in many surface embroidery styles that mimic [...] "drawing" [...] in thread.|$|E

40|$|In Geographic {{information}} system (GIS) identification of elevation detail pertaining to a contour in a reference map or topological map {{plays an important}} role while creating digital elevation model or digital surface model of a terrain. Traditional technique involving manual identification of elevation demands greater effort and time where in one needs to tediously identify and enter the elevation value. These identified elevations can be later used for creating digital elevation model. In order to reduce the complexity involved in same, effective and efficient automated technique can be devised that identifies the elevation associated with a contour. In addition the automated technique should also ensure correctness and reliability of the elevation details identified. The alignment of elevation details in the feature space adds to the complexity of the problem.

40|$|The basic {{principle}} of motivic pattern extraction consists of detecting repeated motives, i. e. identifying several short extracts or subsequences as instances, or occurrences, of a same series of description called pattern. The approach is focused here on monodic sequences: music is {{considered as a}} series of notes without superpositions. Patterns are formalised as chains of states – called pattern chains. As patterns can accept multiple alternative continuations, patterns chains can be extended by multiple branches. Hence, patterns are aggregated into one single tree, called pattern tree, and each <b>pattern</b> <b>chain</b> is as a branch of the tree. Similarly, each pattern occurrence can accept multiple alternative continuations. Hence, the set of all pattern occurrences that are initiated by one note forms a tree, called pattern occurrence tree. 1. 2.

40|$|Properdin binds to {{proximal}} tubular {{epithelial cells}} (PTEC) and activates the complement system via the alternative pathway in vitro. Cellular ligands for properdin in the kidney {{have not yet}} been identified. Because properdin interacts with solid-phase heparin, we investigated whether heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) could be the physiological ligands of properdin. Kidneys from proteinuric rats showed colocalization of syndecan- 1, a major epithelial HSPG, and properdin in the apical membranes of PTEC, which was not seen in control renal tissue. In vitro, PTEC did not constitutively express properdin. However, exogenous properdin binds to these cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Properdin binding was prevented by heparitinase pretreatment of the cells and was dose-dependently inhibited by exogenous heparin. ELISA and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore) showed a strong dose-dependent interaction between heparan sulfate (HS) and properdin (Kd = 128 nm). Pretreatment of HSPG with heparitinase abolished this interaction in ELISA. Competition assays, using a library of HS-like polysaccharides, showed that sulfation <b>pattern,</b> <b>chain</b> length, and backbone composition determine the interaction of properdin with glycosaminoglycans. Interestingly, two nonanticoagulant heparin derivatives inhibited properdin-HS interaction in ELISA and BIAcore. Incubation of PTEC with human serum as complement source led to complement activation and deposition of C 3 on the cells. This C 3 deposition is dependent on the binding of properdin to HS as shown by heparitinase pretreatment of the cells. Our data identify tubular HS as a novel docking platform for alternative pathway activation via properdin, which might play a role in proteinuric renal damage. Our study also suggests nonanticoagulant heparinoids may provide renoprotection in complement-dependent renal diseases...|$|E

The relationship between these two aspects of travel behavior is represented in this paper by considering three different causal structures: one structure in which the trip <b>chaining</b> <b>pattern</b> is determined first and influences mode choice, another structure in which mode choice is determined first and influences the complexity of the trip <b>chaining</b> <b>pattern,</b> and a third structure in which neither is predetermined but both are determined simultaneously. The first two structures are estimated within a recursive bivariate probit modeling framework that accommodates error covariance. The simultaneous logit model is estimated for the third structure that allows a bidirectional simultaneous causality. The analysis and model estimation are performed separately for work tour and non-work tour samples drawn from the 2000 Swiss Microcensus travel survey. Model estimation results show that the causal structure in which trip chain complexity precedes mode choice performs best for both work and non-work tour samples. The structure in which mode choice precedes trip <b>chaining</b> <b>pattern</b> choice was found to give significantly inferior goodness-of-fit measures. These findings have important implications for the development of activity-based and tour-based modeling systems and for the design and planning of public transport systems. ...|$|R
