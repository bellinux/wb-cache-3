40|$|This {{paper is}} a study of a distinctively {{chemical}} notion of <b>possibility.</b> This {{is the notion of}} <b>possibility</b> that occurs in chemical discourses when chemists speak of the <b>possibility</b> or impossibility of achieving a given result through chemical means. This notion pertains to the <b>possibility</b> of processes, not of compounds, so it differs from the kind of chemical <b>possibility</b> mentioned in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations or the kinds discussed in the literature on Putnam's Twin Earth argument. I argue that this process-oriented notion of <b>possibility</b> cannot be reduced in a simple way to physical <b>possibility,</b> and that standard possible worlds semantics does not allow a natural analysis of this notion. I suggest an extension of possible worlds semantics that may overcome this limitation. I finish by pointing out some open questions about chemical <b>possibility.</b> Versio...|$|R

5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of <b>possibilities</b> was enormous, since there are many <b>possibilities</b> for each component of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which <b>possibilities</b> to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E

40|$|There are two {{readings}} of a <b>possibility</b> distribution, a representation format which {{is useful for}} encoding uncertain knowledge or preferences. The negative information reading, based on <b>possibility</b> and necessity measures, emphasizes {{the fact that some}} interpretations are impossible, or at least have an upper-bounded <b>possibility</b> level. The positive information reading points out that <b>possibility</b> degrees are lower bounded, and thus that some interpretations have non-zero (guaranteed) <b>possibility</b> degrees. This paper provides technical results for the positive view, showing how sets of absolute, or relative, constraints expressed in terms of guaranteed <b>possibility</b> measures can be represented in terms of a <b>possibility</b> distribution. Using previously obtained results for the “negative interpretation side”, it enables us to jointly handle upper and lower logical specifications of a <b>possibility</b> distribution on partitions of the set of interpretations, as pointed out in the conclusion...|$|R

We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between <b>possibility</b> measures (supremum preserving normed measures) and p-boxes (pairs of cumulative distribution functions) on totally preordered spaces, extending earlier work in this direction by De Cooman and Aeyels, among others. We start by demonstrating that only those p-boxes who have 0 – 1 -valued lower or upper cumulative distribution function can be <b>possibility</b> measures, and we derive expressions for their natural extension in this case. Next, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a p-box to be a <b>possibility</b> measure. Finally, we show that almost every <b>possibility</b> measure can be modelled by a p-box, simply by ordering elements by increasing <b>possibility.</b> Whence, any techniques for p-boxes can be readily applied to <b>possibility</b> measures. We demonstrate this by deriving joint <b>possibility</b> measures from marginals, under varying assumptions of independence, using a technique known for p-boxes. Doing so, we arrive at a new rule of combination for <b>possibility</b> measures, for the independent case. 1...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{develops}} a unified correspondence {{treatment of the}} Sahlqvist theory for <b>possibility</b> semantics, extending the results in Ya 16 from Sahlqvist formulas to the strictly larger class of inductive formulas, and from the full <b>possibility</b> frames to filter-descriptive <b>possibility</b> frames. Specifically, we define the <b>possibility</b> semantics version of the algorithm ALBA, and an adapted interpretation of the expanded modal language used in the algorithm. We prove the soundness of the algorithm with respect to both (the dual algebras of) full <b>possibility</b> frames and (the dual algebras of) filter-descriptive <b>possibility</b> frames. We make some comparisons among different semantic settings {{in the design of}} the algorithms, and fit <b>possibility</b> semantics into this broader picture. One notable feature of the adaptation of ALBA to <b>possibility</b> frames setting is that the so-called nominal variables, which are interpreted as complete join-irreducibles in the standard setting, are interpreted as regular open closures of "singletons" in the present setting.

40|$|In this paper, I {{provide the}} basis for a measure- and integral-theoretic {{formulation}} of <b>possibility</b> theory. It is shown that, using a general definition of <b>possibility</b> measures, and a generalization of Sugeno's fuzzy integral [...] the seminormed fuzzy integral, or <b>possibility</b> integral [...] , a unified and consistent account can be given of many of the possibilistic results extant in the literature. The striking formal analogy between this treatment of <b>possibility</b> theory, using <b>possibility</b> integrals, and Kolmogorov's measure-theoretic formulation of probability theory, using Lebesgue integrals, is explored and exploited. I introduce and study possibilistic and fuzzy variables as possibilistic counterparts of stochastic and real stochastic variables respectively, and develop the notion of a <b>possibility</b> distribution for these variables. The almost everywhere equality and dominance of fuzzy variables is defined and studied. The proof is given for a Radon-Nikodym-like theorem in <b>possibility</b> theory. Following the example set by the classical theory of integration, product <b>possibility</b> measures and multiple <b>possibility</b> integrals are introduced, and a Fubini-like theorem is proven.
