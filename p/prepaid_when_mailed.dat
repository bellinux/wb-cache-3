50|$|Mailsort codes were {{sometimes}} prefixed by a letter (A-P) which corresponded to sixteen regional {{divisions of the}} country, although the letter did not form a part the mailsort code. The letter prefix {{was used by the}} sender to ensure that <b>when</b> <b>mail</b> was presented to Royal Mail those items with the furthest to travel were given and processed first while those in the same region as the sender were dealt with last. <b>When</b> <b>mail</b> was presented to Royal Mail it was therefore not given in strict mailsort sequence and furthermore the sequence used would differ from one location in the country to another.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the probabilities of prepayment or default for Fixed Rate Mortgages (FRMs) and Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs). Using {{data from the}} period 1985 - 1992, the analysis indicates that the likelihood of prepayment of thirty year FRMs was determined primarily by house price appreciation and personal income growth {{and the likelihood of}} prepayment of fifteen year FRMs was determined primarily by interest rate changes. ARMs were prepaid less frequently than FRMs, {{were less likely to be}} <b>prepaid</b> <b>when</b> interest rates declined and defaulted more often than FRMs. The analysis provides evidence that ARM holders are less mobile than FRM holders.
