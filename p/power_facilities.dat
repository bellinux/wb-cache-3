5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and <b>power</b> <b>facilities).</b> Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E
5|$|With over 100 {{transmission}} lines paralyzed by the ice, Quebec {{fell into a}} massive power outage in the cold Canadian winter. Even though power restoration initiated after the first blackouts, large numbers of Quebecers were in the dark. At {{the height of the}} blackout, some 1.4–1.5 million homes and customers, housing three to more than four million people, were in the dark. Private companies and other utilities from other parts of Canada and the United States were sent in to help Hydro-Québec undertake this massive restoration task, but these efforts were complicated by the widespread damage of the power grid. Blackouts in some areas lasted for 33 days, and 90% of those affected by the blackout had no power for more than seven days. Although power was fully restored to all locations in Quebec by February 8, 1998, it wasn't until mid-March that the <b>power</b> <b>facilities</b> were back in service. By then, much social and economic damage had occurred, such as ruined food and deaths resulting from lack of electric heating.|$|E
5|$|On March20, the {{government}} of Madagascar appealed {{to the international community}} for assistance, due to the heavy damage from the cyclone. In response to the request, various governments and international organizations provided assistance to Madagascar, including $490,000 from the European Economic Community for food and blankets, as well as $125,000 from UNICEF for medicine and building supplies. Catholic Relief Services donated clothing, rice, and milk from Caritas Madagascar. Countries that provided assistance included China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, West Germany, Holy See, Mauritius, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Soviet Union, and Switzerland. Collectively, the international community provided $3.37million worth of aid to Madagascar. The United States Pacific Command flew from the Philippines to Madagascar to deliver medicine. The nation had earlier helped Madagascar recover from Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 with housing rebuilding projects, and transferred materials due to the impacts from Honorinina to the Toamasina area. The Malagasy government also set up a National Relief Committee to facilitate relief efforts, including an initial inspection of the affected area to determine needs. Workers delivered about 19tons of material to Toamasina and nearby Brickaville, including milk, blankets, and clothing. The World Bank estimated the cost for repairing commercial areas would be over $27million (1986USD). The agency also allocated funds toward repairing damaged <b>power</b> <b>facilities,</b> ports, roads, and airports. The International Monetary Fund also approved a $37.8million loan to the country in 1986, half of which for emergency aid. Many houses and buildings had to be closed for repairs due to flood damage, including hotels, churches, and schools.|$|E

This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate (NO3−). A factory based on the process was built in Rjukan and Notodden in Norway, combined with the building of large hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

Although solar power technology {{has the potential}} to supply energy to large numbers of people, and has been used to generate power on a large scale in developed nations, its greatest potential in Africa may be to provide power on a smaller scale and to use this energy to help with day-to-day needs such as small-scale electrification, desalination, water pumping, and water purification.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{combustion}} {{is particularly}} popular {{in countries such}} as Japan where land is a scarce resource. Denmark and Sweden have been leaders in using the energy generated from incineration for more than a century, in localised combined heat and <b>power</b> <b>facilities</b> supporting district heating schemes. In 2005, waste incineration produced 4.8% of the electricity consumption and 13.7% of the total domestic heat consumption in Denmark. A number of other European countries rely heavily on incineration for handling municipal waste, in particular Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, and France.|$|E

Electricity is provided by SaskPower, a provincial Crown corporation which maintains a province-wide grid with power generated from coal-fired base load, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric and wind <b>power</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E
