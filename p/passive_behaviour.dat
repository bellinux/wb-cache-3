5000|$|Assertion theory {{proposes that}} {{everyone}} has fundamental human rights, and can avoid violating their integrity by compromising between each other's needs {{in a way that}} leaves everyone feeling that they have been [...] "heard". There are many different types of behaviour: <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> assertive behaviour, aggressive behaviour, manipulative behaviour, and a mixture between them all. Assertiveness can be found in verbal and non-verbal communication, throughout society. Assertive behaviour consists of making sure that one's own needs are heard and respected, rather than disregarded. Examples can include confronting an employer or partner). Not every person is assertive, though assertion theory posits that assertiveness positively contributes to one's quality of life.|$|E

Tao Te Ching translates into the classic of the way and its virtue [...] The writings of the Tao Te Ching support <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> and promote natural harmony with nature. The main underlying theme to the writings is the value of wu-wei, (non-striving) “by which one returns to a primitive state closer to the Tao”. (Duyvendak, Chan, Lau, Mitchell, & Mair, 2005).

Generally speaking, a differentiation is made between a narrow view of active ageing (i. e. focusing on labour, care and other “traditional ” activities) and a broad perspective.

40|$|Causally {{uncertain}} (CU) people {{struggle to}} understand the causes of events in their social world. This struggle creates difficulties in their social interactions with others, as well as driving them to seek out social information {{in order to reduce}} their uncertainty (Boucher & Jacobson, 2012; Weary & Edwards, 1996). Social Network Sites (SNSs) provide ideal platforms for acquiring social information, as well as new ways to communicate with others. People generally engage in either <b>passive</b> or interactive <b>behaviours</b> on these sites. Engaging in interactive behaviours is generally beneficial for people, whereas engaging in <b>passive</b> <b>behaviours</b> is usually detrimental (Burke, 2011; Doodson et al., 2013). Given these differences, this paper was interested in what determines people’s SNS behaviours. It was predicted that due to the difficulties CU people have in their social interactions, that causal uncertainty would be associated with fewer interactive behaviours. Furthermore, {{as a result of these}} difficulties, it was predicted that CU people would prefer <b>passive</b> SNS <b>behaviours</b> and therefore engage in more of them. Two survey studies were conducted using Facebook as the SNS. Study 1 was correlational in design and examined the effect that trait causal uncertainty had on participants’ general Facebook use and attitudes. Study 2 was an experiment and was interested in people’s passive and interactive information seeking behaviours on Facebook and whether causal uncertainty would influence them. Study 2 primed participants with causal uncertainty, presented them with four hypothetical uncertain Facebook scenarios, and then asked participants to indicate the Facebook <b>behaviours</b> (<b>passive</b> or interactive) they would use to respond to these scenarios. Both studies hypotheses were unsupported, with Study 1 finding nothing and the primes failing to have an effect on participants’ behaviours in Study 2. However, Study 2 also included a measure of trait CU, which was found to be associated with more <b>passive</b> and interactive <b>behaviours.</b> Therefore, the paper still provides support found for the notion that causal uncertainty influences people’s SNS behaviours. The findings and their implications are discussed...|$|R

Ruge replaced the 65-year-old General Kristian Laake as Commanding General, the latter having been heavily criticized for what was considered to be <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> during the initial hours of the invasion. Elements in the Norwegian cabinet considered General Laake to be a defeatist. Following the appointment of Ruge the Norwegian attitude became clear, with orders to stop the German advance being issued. With the Germans in control of the largest cities, ports and airfields, as well as most of the arms depots and communication networks, repulsing them outright would be impossible. Ruge instead decided that his only chance lay in playing for time, stalling the Germans until reinforcements from the United Kingdom and France could arrive.|$|E

The case of the Costa Concordia provides an opportunity to discuss organizational zemblanity. Active as well as <b>passive</b> <b>behaviours</b> by the Costa Concordia’s Captain created a vicious circle of inappropriate decision-making with traumatic effects. These were complemented by structural elements to be found both in the individual behaviours of others (mainly, the vessel’s first line of command) and the lack of other effective organizational controls, both in terms of structures and routines.

5000|$|Doomlord {{set himself}} {{up as an}} [...] "open figure" [...] and granted audiences with anyone who {{requested}} one, in order to best influence humanity. A powerful theme in {{this phase of the}} strip is Vek's inherent <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the face of bungled attempts at assassination, coercement, and propaganda by the British Government, combined with his simple message of cosmic judgement - [...] "mature as a species, or I (or another Doomlord, if you kill me) will euthanise you to protect the other life on Earth". At times, he was almost portrayed as a Gandhi-like figure - albeit one who would disintegrate timewasters. As a demonstration of his power he even created a virus to destroy a small town, Prattlewell. Eventually, Vek was tranquillised whilst in human form, and was kept imprisoned underground, where, as he required ultraviolet light for sustenance, he starved to death and his corpse was triumphantly paraded as a trophy. However, he had transferred his life-force to a sympathetic scientist named Denby, and upon becoming Vek once more, lost patience with humanity and decided to carry out the death sentence. However, before he could do so, another servitor, Zom, arrived with the task of destroying humanity AND Vek. Vek accepted his fate but while Zom was on the way to create a man-destroying virus, humanity once more decided to abandon nuclear weapons and Vek was forced to kill Zom to save humanity. He explained to humanity what had happened and set himself up as humanity's protector, knowing that more Noxians would follow to slaughter humanity and that {{he was the only one}} who had a chance of defending them although his own life was now in danger for disobeying the Dread Council and, worse still, killing a fellow servitor.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} the concept of {{combining}} <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> with an active control strategy using Pleated Pneumatic Artificial Muscles. These actuators have a very high power to weight ratio and an inherent adaptable compliance which makes them extremely suitable for legged machines. Lucy, our Bipedal robot, is equipped with these muscles in order to walk in a dynamically stable way while the adaptable compliance will be used to alter the natural dynamics of the system. The paper presents the concept of the Pleated Pneumatic Artificial Muscle and its characteristics. It shows the implementation of these muscles to actuate a rotative joint and discusses briefly the low-level controller designed to settle the pressures in each muscle. For the high-level controller the philosophy of combining <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> with an active control strategy will be considered while explaining in detail the adaptability of the compliance. The different concepts of our design for Lucy will be discussed. Special attention will be given to the flexibility of the mechanical construction and the elaborate control hardware hereby focussing on the modularity for both mechanical and electronic design. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of UV illumination on the <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> of Cu 37 Zn in pH 9. 2 and 13. 0 chloride-containing electrolytes was studied using potentiodynamic polarisation tests, cyclic voltammetry and complex impedance spectroscopy. It {{was found that}} UV illumination exerted a slight activating effect on the <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the alkaline pH 13. 0 solution, with slightly higher passive current densities being recorded under conditions of illumination. A more pronounced UV illumination effect was observed in the pH 9. 2 solution. This was characterised by a 4 -fold increase in the passive current density, {{a shift in the}} breakdown potential by 250 mV in the active direction, a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and an increase in the double layer capacitance. These results are explained in terms {{of the nature of the}} passive film on CuZn, which consists of a complex layer involving ZnO · xH 2 O and Cu 2 O/CuO. On illumination, photo-decomposition of the n-type ZnO phase occurs leading to a modification of the passive layer rendering it more susceptible to pitting attack in the chloride environments...|$|E
40|$|Alien crayfishes {{represent}} a common threat to aquatic ecosystems. Their spread in Europe {{is leading to}} more frequent contacts between different invasive species populations. Shelter {{can be an important}} factor in the resulting interactions. A laboratory experiment was designed to analyse the competition for shelter in similarly sized males of two species that show an invasive behaviour in Spain, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. We carried out 24 heterospecific, six-hour trials, with 30 min behavioural observations per hour. Most often, red swamp crayfish were both the first (70. 8 %) and the long-term winner (62. 5 %). Usually, the long-term winner was the first winner. Whenever shelter was occupied, a <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> by unsheltered individuals was more frequent in signal crayfish than in red swamp crayfish. When both were unsheltered, signal crayfish displayed more often a <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Although the observed behaviour might be explained as the result of dominance by the red swamp crayfish over the signal crayfish, shelter availability and class, as well as different growth patterns and population size structures, could change the intensity and the outcome of the encounters in the wild, where signal crayfish usually reach larger sizes than red swamp crayfish...|$|E
40|$|In current practice, {{changes in}} the cyclically-adjusted budget balance (CAB) are {{interpreted}} as reflecting the effort of discretionary fiscal policy. This paper shows that such an interpretation is not a sufficiently accurate description of the behaviour of fiscal policy, as, in some cases, it may conceal an important deficit bias. Specifically, as growth projections are an important building block of budgetary plans, systematic optimism in forecasting growth, coupled with pervasive lags and inertia in the implementation phase of the budget, {{will result in a}} fiscal expansion compared to plans, {{even in the absence of}} discretionary measures. In order to track down this kind of <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the light of growth surprises or sanguine growth assumptions the traditional reading of the CAB needs to be adjusted. This is achieved by relaxing the benchmark assumption according to which, under unchanged fiscal policy, the deficit-to-GDP ratio is invariant to growth. An empirical application to public finance data of four large EU countries shows that <b>passive</b> <b>behaviour</b> is an important element in practice, as forecast errors are significant in explaining {{changes in the}} CAB. Moreover, in some cases official growth forecasts appear to have a clear upward bias. ...|$|E

However, {{little is known about the}} effects of RF-EMR exposure on NMDA receptor signaling pathway including activation of protein kinases, notably Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of acute and chronic 900 MHz RF-EMR exposure on both <b>passive</b> avoidance <b>behaviour</b> and hippocampal levels of CaMKIIα and its phosphorylated form (pCaMKIIα). Rats were divided into the following groups: Sham rats, and rats exposed to 900 MHz RF-EMR for 2 h/day for 1 week (acute group) or 10 weeks (chronic group), respectively. Passive avoidance task was used as a behavioural method. The hippocampal levels of selected kinases were measured using Western Blotting technique. The results of passive avoidance task showed that both acute and chronic exposure to 900 MHz RF-EMR can impair <b>passive</b> avoidance <b>behaviour</b> with minor effects on chronic group of rats. The analysis of western blot data of selected protein kinases demonstrated that hippocampal levels of CaMKIIα and pCaMKIIα were significantly higher in chronic group of rats as compared to acute groups.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{attention}} and hyperactivity regulation {{of children in}} band playing and mobile music making. The study aims at finding the musical and social elements that help children to regulate their attention, and lead to positive social interaction. Within the mobile music making, stand-alone playing and pair work scenarios are analysed. Within the band playing, instructed and improvised playing are compared. This research is a multiple case study with four participants: two children with ADHD and two comparison children without ADHD. Non-participatory observation is applied as the main data collection method. The data, {{in the form of}} video recordings, is analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Attention regulation of the children is labelled with the following four categories: on- task behaviour, selective on-task <b>behaviour,</b> <b>passive</b> off-task <b>behaviour,</b> and hyperactive off-task behaviour. Essential elements contributing to improvement of attention regulation and reduction of inattentiveness and hyperactivity found to be sitting independently, far from other musical instruments. Another element improving attention regulation was clear (and repeated) instruction that was preferably given before the children were at close physical proximity to the devices or band instruments. Clarity of the instruction {{played a key role in}} all the musical activities, and lack of it reflected in hyperactive off-task behaviour. Role of the music making session instructors was found to be significant. The overall result is that all the children had mostly good attention regulation in all of the musical contexts. The quantitative time-course analysis shows that with ADHD children 94 %, and with non- ADHD children 93 % of the total time of the analysed excerpts consisted of on-task or selective on-task behaviour. In the band playing there was slightly more hyperactivity by the children with ADHD than by the children without ADHD. There was slightly more selective on-task and <b>passive</b> off-task <b>behaviour</b> by the non-ADHD children than by the ADHD children in the mobile music making situations. When comparing the different musical contexts, hyperactive off-task behaviour was seen slightly more in the band playing than mobile music making context, while <b>passive</b> off-task <b>behaviour</b> was more prominent in the mobile music making than in band playing.
