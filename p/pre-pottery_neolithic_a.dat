5|$|Evidence {{for human}} {{occupation}} of the Zagros reaches back into the Lower Palaeolithic, {{as evidenced by the}} discovery of many cave-sites dating to that period in the Iranian part of the mountain range. Middle Palaeolithic stone tool assemblages are known from Barda Balka, a cave-site south of the Little Zab; and from the Iranian Zagros. A Mousterian stone tool assemblage – produced by either Neanderthals or anatomically modern humans – was recently excavated in Arbil. Neanderthals also occupied the site of Shanidar. This cave-site, located in the Sapna Valley, has yielded a settlement sequence stretching from the Middle Palaeolithic up to the Epipalaeolithic period. The site is particularly well known for its Neanderthal burials. The Epipalaeolithic occupation of Shanidar, contemporary {{with the use of the}} Kebaran stone tool assemblage, is the oldest evidence for anatomically modern human {{occupation of the}} Great Zab basin. The following Protoneolithic, or Natufian, occupation is contemporary with the oldest occupation of the nearby open-air site Zawi Chemi Shanidar. M'lefaat on the Khazir River (a tributary to the Great Zab) was a small village of hunter-gatherers dating to the 10th millennium BCE that was contemporary with the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>A</b> in the Levant. An archaeological survey of the Citadel of Arbil, in the plain south of the lower course of the Great Zab, has shown that this site was continuously occupied at least from the 6th millennium BCE upward.|$|E
25|$|By 8500–7500 BC, the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>A</b> (PPNA) culture {{developed}} out of {{the earlier}} local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at Jericho (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500 BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.|$|E
25|$|The early Neolithic human {{occupation}} of Mesopotamia is, like the previous Epipaleolithic period, {{confined to the}} foothill zones of the Taurus and Zagros Mountains and {{the upper reaches of}} the Tigris and Euphrates valleys. The <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>A</b> (PPNA) period (10,000–8700 BC) saw the introduction of agriculture, while the oldest evidence for animal domestication dates to the transition from the PPNA to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, 8700–6800 BC) at the end of the 9th millennium BC. This transition has been documented at sites like Abu Hureyra and Mureybet, which continued to be occupied from the Natufian well into the PPNB. The so-far earliest monumental sculptures and circular stone buildings from Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey date to the PPNA/Early PPNB and represent, according to the excavator, the communal efforts of a large community of hunter-gatherers.|$|E
40|$|The archaeological assemblages of the Levantine Neolithic changed {{dramatically}} from the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> to the Pottery <b>Neolithic.</b> The <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> inhabitants produced well-planned, well-built, well-maintained architecture {{on a consistent}} basis, both within sites and across the region. In contrast, the architecture at Pottery <b>Neolithic</b> settlements exhibited <b>a</b> variety of forms ranging from pit dwellings, to round, rectangular, and apsidal buildings, to courtyard buildings, to no architecture at all. The end of the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> coincided with <b>a</b> global climatic event, the 8. 2 ka cold event, a 300 - 400 year dip in global temperatures, accompanied by increased aridity. The drop in temperature likely changed the environmental conditions in the Levant, affecting the economic systems of the inhabitants. Late <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> inhabitants no longer relied on hunting for their primary meat source, as domesticated goat quickly became the dominant faunal assemblage at late <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> sites. This thesis argues {{that the lack of}} cohesion observed in the Pottery Neolithic archaeological assemblages {{is a reflection of the}} different responses and adaptive strategies used by different settlements to cope with the change in environmental conditions...|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlement was}} {{located at the}} present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both Arabic and Hebrew, tell means [...] "mound" [...] - consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and Anatolia. Jericho is the type site for the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>A</b> (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) periods.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>A</b> phase at Tell es-Sultan (c. 8350–7370 BC) is {{sometimes}} called Sultanian. The site is a [...] settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over [...] high and [...] wide at the base (see Wall of Jericho), inside of which stood a stone tower (see Tower of Jericho), over [...] high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps {{and placed in the}} centre of {{the west side of the}} tell. This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria are the oldest ever to be discovered. The wall may have served as a defence against flood-water, with the tower used for ceremonial purposes. The wall and tower were built during the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>A</b> (PPNA) period around 8000BCE. For the tower, carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BC and stayed in use until c. 7800 BC. The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. The identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2,000–3,000, and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals.|$|E
2500|$|Mureybet (...) is a tell, or ancient {{settlement}} mound, {{located on}} {{the west bank of the}} Euphrates in Raqqa Governorate, northern Syria. The site was excavated between 1964 and 1974 and has since disappeared under the rising waters of Lake Assad. Mureybet was occupied between 10,200 and 8,000 BC and is the eponymous type site for the Mureybetian culture, a subdivision of the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>A</b> (PPNA). In its early stages, Mureybet was a small village occupied by hunter-gatherers. Hunting was important and crops were first gathered and later cultivated, but they remained wild. During its final stages, domesticated animals were also present at the site.|$|E

Mureybet is the only site where Khiamian deposits are associated with architectural remains. The oldest of these remains date to phase IB and consist of a round semi-subterranean structure with a diameter of [...] In the subsequent phases, slightly smaller round houses built at ground level also appeared, at least some of which were used simultaneously. The walls were built from compacted earth, sometimes reinforced with stones. Hearths and cooking pits were located outside the buildings. Harvested crops included barley, rye and Polygonum. Sickle blades and grinding stones are more common and show more use-wear, indicating that cereals became a more important component in the diet. The fauna at Mureybet changed significantly during phase IIB. Gazelle makes up 70% of the assemblage and small animals decrease in importance, although fish remained important. Toward the end of the Khiamian, equid hunting gained importance at the expense of gazelle.|$|E
