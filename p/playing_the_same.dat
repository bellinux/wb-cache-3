5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Fat Tony & Co. was {{confirmed}} on 3 August 2013, with series production beginning on 5 August 2013. It was not branded as Underbelly due {{to changes in}} funding with Screen Australia, but chronologically acts as a direct sequel to the first series of the show, {{with most of the}} same cast <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> characters with only one or two exceptions. Based on Tony Mokbel, the series covers the manhunt for Mokbel that lasted 18 months, and dismantled his drug empire. It was filmed in Greece. It first aired on 23 February at 8.40pm on Channel 9.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, trying to determine if they were still <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E

He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's Cash on Demand, <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter {{is added to the}} player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{actors in}} total have portrayed Bond on film. Following Connery's portrayal, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig have assumed the role. These screen {{versions}} have retained many traits from Fleming's depiction, {{although some of}} Bond's less fashionable attitudes have been dropped, such as racism, homophobia, retaining {{the services of a}} maid, and in the more recent films, smoking. Despite <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> character, there have been notable differences among the portrayals. Daniel Craig is the incumbent Bond in the long-running Eon series, and played the part for a fourth time in the latest film, Spectre, released in October 2015. Daniel Craig will return as Bond in the 25th instalment of the series. The film is expected to release in 2019.|$|E

The series is generally unpredictable: each book is different in terms of pace, plot, theme, etc.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E
25|$|IGN's Peer Schneider {{claimed that}} the {{decision}} to star Zelda in The Wand of Gamelon was {{based on the fact that}} the CD-i's library was directed at females. However, he felt that they failed at this due to Zelda <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as Link.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinguishing}} form of African {{music is}} its call-and-response nature: one voice or instrument plays a short melodic phrase, and that phrase is echoed by another voice or instrument.

25|$|In acoustics, comb {{filtering}} {{can arise}} in some unwanted ways. For instance, when two loudspeakers are <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> signal at different distances from the listener, {{there is a}} comb filtering effect on the signal. In any enclosed space, listeners hear a mixture of direct sound and reflected sound. Because the reflected sound takes a longer path, it constitutes a delayed version of the direct sound and a comb filter is created where the two combine at the listener.|$|E

25|$|There {{are seven}} public {{holidays}} in Russia, except those always celebrated on Sunday. Russian New Year traditions {{resemble those of}} the Western Christmas, with New Year Trees and gifts, and Ded Moroz (Father Frost) <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> role as Santa Claus. Orthodox Christmas falls on January 7, because the Russian Orthodox Church still follows the Julian calendar, and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Two other major Christian holidays are Easter and Trinity Sunday. Kurban Bayram and Uraza Bayram are celebrated by Russian Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are anti-coordination games, {{in which}} it is {{mutually}} beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it {{can be thought of as}} the opposite of a coordination game, where <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> strategy Pareto dominates playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing comes at a cost (or negative externality).|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} of kulintang ensemble music itself is regional, predating {{the establishment of}} present-day Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.

It is distantly related to the gamelan ensembles of Java and Bali, {{as well as the}} musical forms in Mainland Southeast Asia, mainly because of the usage for the same bossed racked gong chimes that play both melodic and percussive.|$|E
