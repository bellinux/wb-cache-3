5|$|The BBC Sports <b>Personality</b> <b>of</b> the Year is an awards {{ceremony}} {{that takes place}} annually in December. Devised by Paul Fox in 1954, it originally consisted of just one, the BBC Sports <b>Personality</b> <b>of</b> the Year Award. Several new awards have been introduced, and currently eight awards are presented. The first awards to be added were the Team of the Year and Overseas Personality awards, which were introduced in 1960. A Lifetime Achievement Award was first given in 1995 and again in 1996, and has been presented annually since 2001. In 1999, three more awards were introduced: the Helen Rollason Award, the Coach Award, and the Newcomer Award, which was renamed to Young Sports <b>Personality</b> <b>of</b> the Year in 2001. The newest is the Unsung Hero Award, first presented in 2003. In 2003, the 50th anniversary of the show was marked by a five-part series on BBC One called Simply The Best â€“ Sports Personality. It was presented by Gary Lineker and formed part of a public vote to determine a special Golden Sports <b>Personality</b> <b>of</b> the Year. That year Steve Rider and Martyn Smith wrote a book reflecting on the 50-year history of the award and the programme. The event was held outside London {{for the first time}} in 2006, when tickets were made available to the public.|$|E
