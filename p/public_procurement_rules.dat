40|$|The {{recently}} adopted UK National Health Service (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) (No. 2) Regulations 2013 {{include an}} interesting (and somehow unsettling) provision authorising anti-competitive behaviour in the commissioning {{of health care}} services by the National Health Service (NHS), if {{that is in the}} (best) interest of health care users. Generally, it seems that under the new <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> and competition <b>rules</b> applicable to the NHS, whatever is considered in the “interest of patients” could trump pro-competitive requirements and allow the commissioning entity to engage in distortions of competition (either directly, or by facilitating anti-competitive behaviour by tenderers and service providers) — as long as a sort of qualitative cost-benefit analysis shows that net advantages derived from the anti-competitive procurement activity. The apparent oddity of such general “authorisation” for public buyers to engage in anti-competitive procurement of health care services deserves some careful analysis, which this paper carries out. The paper assesses Regulation 10 of the NHS Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition Regulations 2013 and the substantive guidance published by the UK's health care sector regulator (Monitor) from the perspective of EU economic law (and, more specifically, in connection to <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> and competition <b>rules).</b> The paper claims that there is a prima facie potential incompatibility between Regulation 10 of the 2013 NHS Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition Regulations and both EU competition law and <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law — which are, in principle, opposed to any anti-competitive or competition restrictive behaviour in the conduct of <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> activities. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} an EU law compliant, restrictive interpretation and enforcement of the provision — at least where there is a cross border effect on competition and/or a cross border interest in tendering for the health care contracts, which triggers the application of both EU competition law and <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overview of the development of <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> (PP) <b>rules</b> in the EU and in selected international organisations.

Over time, and in particular {{in the context of the}} "EU 2020 " strategy, PP rules have been extended to address not only economic objectives, but also social and environmental goals as well as innovation aspects. As a result, such "strategic" elements of PP have in 2014 been legalised by the new EU Procurement Directives. However, as long as strategic PP remains an isolated policy, it will have only limited ramifications on Community-wide sustainability. Strategic PP should rather complement sustainability policies in their respective areas and should thus become an integral part of overall EU policies...|$|R

However, unreliable domestic systems contribute to the motivation of donors who usually require beneficiary countries to apply <b>procurement</b> <b>rules</b> and procedures set out by the donor {{for the implementation of}} development projects funded by the donor. Different rules of donors are applicable to procurement in addition to existing rules under the domestic regime, which results in the application of multiple <b>procurement</b> <b>rules.</b> Adopting a doctrinal approach, this thesis examines the issues of multiple procurement regimes using Ghana as a case study. It seeks to analyse the manner of interaction between the rules of the different regimes and to identify and elaborate the policy issues arising from the application and interaction of the different sets of rules. The thesis concludes that policies of the multiple <b>procurement</b> <b>rules</b> are almost the same but rather expressed in different terminologies. However, implementation of the multiple rules may have negative implications not only for the achievement of domestic policies such as value for money and simplification of procedures, but also for policies of the development partners that seek to promote domestic development on issues such as corruption and local capacity development.

40|$|Professor Albert Sanchez Graells of the University of Hull (UK) {{recently}} published a vitally important book on <b>procurement</b> law, <b>Public</b> <b>Procurement</b> and the EU Competition Rules (Hart Publishing 2011). In his study, Sanchez Graells asked {{what seems like}} a simple question: Shouldn’t regulators, when writing procurement regulations, consider the likely impact of those regulations on competitive markets? Sanchez Graells pointed out that far too little {{attention has been paid to}} the anticompetitive impact of <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> regulation. This article assesses Sanchez Graells’ thesis from a U. S. perspective. In many ways the U. S. federal procurement system stands at one end of a spectrum: Even when squarely addressing the intersection of procurement regulation and the commercial market, U. S. procurement regulators have not considered their rules’ likely effects on competitive commercial markets. The article points out that this is in sharp contrast to the European Union’s strong emphasis on using <b>procurement</b> <b>rules</b> to integrate a broader European market. The article notes that there is substantial legal authority in the United States for assessing, as part of the rulemaking process, the likely competitive impact of proposed <b>procurement</b> <b>rules</b> [...] and that doing so could integrate the $ 500 billion federal procurement system much more efficiently into the commercial marketplace...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} analyses the <b>procurement</b> <b>rules</b> {{of international}} organisations or agencies performing collaborative defence procurement in the European Union (EU). In collaborative defence procurement, States agree to procure equipment or services for their {{armed forces in}} common, thereby sharing development costs and looking for economies of scale. The management of collaborative defence procurement programmes is often entrusted to an international organisation or agency {{acting on behalf of}} the participating States. After setting out the political, economic and legal context of collaborative defence procurement in the EU, we analyse the applicability of domestic and EU law to international organisations, in particular <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> law in the field of defence. The conclusion of this first part is that, whilst domestic and EU law apply in general terms to international organisations or agencies, this is subject to the substantive provisions of the relevant laws and to international law, such as the privileges and immunities of the organisations. Specifically, international organisations or agencies in the EU most likely would not have to comply with domestic procurement law or with the EU <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> directives, but they would still have to comply with the procurement principles flowing from the EU Treaties, except if non-EU Member States control their decision-making. We then move on to an analysis of the <b>procurement</b> <b>rules</b> of three international organisations or agencies performing collaborative defence procurement in the EU: the Joint Organisation for Armaments Cooperation (OCCAR), the NATO Maintenance and Supply Organisation (NAMSO) and the European Defence Agency (EDA). For these organisations we analyse to what extent their <b>procurement</b> <b>rules</b> should comply with EU law, to what extent they are an efficient set of rules, and what measures could be taken to remedy any detrimental issue or incoherence identified.

The subject of the work, branding in <b>public</b> <b>procurement,</b> is unexplored and may be of interest to a larger market. The study approaches an inductive, explorative, single case study. Literature studies forms a theoretical framework that is combined with interviews with representatives from both public authorities and a company. The study finds that a company can use the part of Brand Identity named Image. To be successful, a company’s image expresses what is important and desired from an authority: security, trust, long-term focus and stability. This reduces the authority’s perceived risk and increases its security, and makes the company a more attractive choice. The study also finds {{that it is impossible to}} directly influence an ongoing procurement process. The study is limited to the defense market and procurement of large technical advanced systems, not commodity products. The study focuses on the direct relations between the procuring authority and the tendering industry. It will not discuss the involvement of political forces and their actions, e. g. counter-trade. Possible future research is the following suggestions: Investigation of how political forces have impact on international/ intergovernmental business. This could include the correlation between the size and magnitude of the procurement and political involvement. Investigation of the relationship between the compliance of international <b>procurement</b> <b>rules,</b> the favoring of domestic suppliers, and a nation’s position on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.

Besides improving the limited {{results of the}} Mediterranean agreements concluded in the 1970 s, the renewed effort is aimed at counterbalancing EU engagement in East European recovery and integration. The broad aims of the Barcelona Process are to promote political stability in this turbulent area, establish a free-trade area by 2010 and promote social and cultural interactions. These, in turn, imply a number of themes that are common to all the agreements with MPCs: the institutionalisation of political dialogue and programmes for improving the {{respect for human rights}} and democracy; economic cooperation {{in a wide range of}} sectors; the definition of provisions relating to intellectual property, services, <b>public</b> <b>procurement,</b> competition <b>rules,</b> state aids and monopolies; and cooperation relating to social affairs and migration. The prime instruments for achieving these objectives are the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements (EMAAs) and a financial support programme (MEDA). The aims of this study are to provide a broad assessment of the EMAAs and to identify key issues for analysis relating to the EMAAs, with particular reference to the agricultural sector. Much research has been done on the impact of the EMAAs, by institutes participating in ENARPRI, as well as by other research networks (FEMISE and MDF) and individual institutes.
