5|$|Cain {{featured}} {{a mix of}} mostly four pitches: a four-seam fastball (90–93mph), a cutter (84–87), a curveball (76–79), and a changeup (83–86). Increasingly, he also threw a two-seam fastball at 89–91mph. Cain led with his four-seamer, throwing it over half the time in his career. His changeup was his secondary <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> left-handed hitters, while he threw cutters as a secondary <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> right-handed hitters. Cain threw curveballs in roughly equal proportions to righties and lefties.|$|E

5|$|Adam {{was created}} during {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies original <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> the BBC {{as part of}} his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel. Though established early in the series' planning, Adam was always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted negatively to the character, Adam's role as a foil to the stock companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final and it {{was their}} local rivals who had {{taken the lead in}} the 14th minute. Patrick Vieira {{equalised}} just after Tottenham captain Sol Campbell was taken off the <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> receive treatment.

5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a no ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{when the}} Cubs won the NL East division, the club named Banks an honorary team member. At the 1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, {{the first one}} held at Wrigley Field since Banks' playing days, he threw out the {{ceremonial}} first <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> starting catcher Mike Scioscia.

5|$|In {{previous}} years, the Oval {{was used}} to host {{the final of the}} Irish Cup as one of Northern Ireland's biggest stadiums along with Windsor Park, with the location of the final often being decided on a coin toss. During the 1985 Irish Cup final, Glentoran supporters released a cockerel and a pig that had been painted blue onto the <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> antagonize Linfield supporters. The Oval {{was used to}} host the final of the County Antrim Shield in 2012. The Oval has also been used to host the Setanta Cup final. It hosted the 2012 final between Belfast's Crusaders representing the IFA Premiership, and County Londonderry based Derry City, representing the League of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} two outs and the bases loaded.

On the very next <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> Molina, he hit it 387 feet into the left field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{released}} Ramírez in March 2004, {{without being}} promoted beyond the Class A level. Disappointed, Ramírez considered retiring from baseball. With {{the advice of}} his father, Ramírez decided that as Major League Baseball pitchers often relied on a slider or curveball as a complimentary <b>pitch</b> <b>to</b> their fastball, he would develop a different pitch. Ramírez spent his time that year learning a changeup on baseball fields in Miami, Florida, and did not pitch professionally during the 2004 season. Working with Maximo Soto, a fellow minor league pitcher released by the Angels, Ramírez developed his changeup to provide him with a new weapon in his pitching arsenal.|$|E
