5|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{inscriptions}} and fragments, texts {{written by}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated {{as late as the}} 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.|$|E

We wanted to give the player control of a hero who would adapt to the way they played, who would age, become scarred in battle, who could get tattoos, wear dreadlocks and a dress if the player was so inclined.

500|$|Felix Bohatsch of Broken Rules {{reported}} in May 2009 that {{sales of the}} PC version were [...] "not at a level we were expecting". No digital rights management (DRM) protection {{was placed on the}} game because [...] "we ... believe that any game will be cracked, no matter how we try to protect it, so our philosophy is that adding DRM or anything similar only annoys the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> pay for it." [...] The bootlegging rate was approximately 95.5%, meaning [...] "for every game [...] there are 22 cracked version [...] being played". Bohatsch speculated that the poor sales were partly caused by the levels demonstrated in the free game demo, which did not focus enough on the game's puzzles. More than 370,000 units of the game were sold as part of the third Humble Indie Bundle.|$|E

Francesca McCaffery of BlackBook {{commented that the}} film [...] "highlights the creative challenges of making art {{in a way that}} many documentaries often aspire to, but rarely achieve." [...] She also praised Leto's direction. Film critic Mike McGranaghan awarded the film three and a half out of four stars and wrote, [...] "Artifact is a fascinating documentary because it pulls back the curtain on the music business." [...] He said that the film works both as an [...] "accounting of a good band making an album during a bad time" [...] and as an [...] "indictment of a business practice that screws the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> make the product." [...] Natalie Robehmed from Forbes stated that the film [...] "vitriolically breaks down what Leto considers to be grave imbalances, showing in one infographic how label contracts can result in bands accumulating debt with every release thanks to promotional costs, recording bills and advances record labels recoup." [...] Isabel Cupryn from Criticize This! gave the film four stars out of five and called it the Super Size Me of the music industry.|$|E

2500|$|On Thursday, October 10, 1985, NBC didn't {{come on the}} air for Game 2 of the NLCS until 8:30p.m. ET {{to avoid}} disrupting The Cosby Show at 8.

2500|$|Said Johnson in 1988, [...] "For voluntarism to {{take hold}} {{as part of a}} company's culture, there must be a key {{executive}} who sets the example by personal involvement.... I spend a good twenty to thirty percent of my time, or about two days of every seven, on what I call ‘not-for-profit’ activities.... Raising money is only one part of voluntarism; indeed it is not the most important.

2500|$|A {{number of}} studies report a {{positive}} relationship between bullying, intention to leave and high turnover. In some cases, the number <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> leave is a “tip of the iceberg”. Many more who remain have considered leaving. [...] In O’Connell et al.’s (2007) Irish study, 60% of respondents considered leaving whilst 15% actually left the organisation. In a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered leaving the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had “got away with it” previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.|$|E

2500|$|Historians group Methodists {{together}} with other Protestant groups as [...] "Nonconformists" [...] or Dissenters, standing {{in opposition to the}} established Church of England. In the 19th century the Dissenters who went to chapel comprised half the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> attended services on Sunday. The [...] "Nonconformist conscience" [...] was their moral sensibility which they tried to implement in British politics. The two categories of Dissenters, or Nonconformists, were in addition to the evangelicals or [...] "Low Church" [...] element in the Church of England. [...] "Old Dissenters", dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, included Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers, Unitarians and Presbyterians outside Scotland. [...] "New Dissenters" [...] emerged in the 18th century and were mainly Methodists, especially the Wesleyan Methodists.|$|E
2500|$|Honorary authorship is {{sometimes}} granted {{to those who}} played no {{significant role in the}} work, for a variety of reasons. Until recently, it was standard to list the head of a German department or institution as an author on a paper regardless of input. The United States National Academy of Sciences, however, warns that such practices [...] "dilute the credit due the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> did the work, inflate the credentials of those so 'honored,' and make the proper attribution of credit more difficult." [...] The extent to which honorary authorship still occurs is not empirically known. However, it is plausible to expect that it is still widespread, because senior scientists leading large research groups can receive much of their reputation from a long publication list and thus have little motivation to give up honorary authorships.|$|E
2500|$|The defense {{provided}} {{a series of}} witness, described as [...] "brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts {{of each other and}} the defendants," [...] to provide alibis for the accused. [...] Due to the conflicting testimony provided by various witnesses, the defense took five hours for their closing arguments. [...] Smith used this time to play upon the biases and prejudices of the jury. [...] He argued that the robbers had dressed {{in a manner similar to}} his clients in order to misdirect suspicion upon them and that the robbers had fled to Mexico immediately after the robbery. [...] Then he pointed out that U.S. Marshal Meade had failed to go to the scene of the attack to look for any trail left by the attackers. [...] Smith also claimed the government officials who arrested his clients were more interested in the reward money for capturing the robbers than in finding the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> committed the crime. [...] When Smith began to question the integrity of the Court, Judge Sloan threatened him with a $500 fine for contempt.|$|E

2500|$|Social sharing {{behaviors}} incite a socio-affective dynamic {{between the}} involved persons {{and according to}} several studies, may produce interpersonal benefits, and this can result in further social integration. Humans have long been aware of such processes, and have been using and even exploiting {{them for a long}} time. [...] A particularly prominent example of such purposeful collective social sharing is the celebration or commemoration of collective events (such as war victories and defeats or natural disasters), ceremonies, symbols, symbolic characters or stories, etc. [...] According to Frijda, such collective instances of social sharing are created for similar reasons to those for individual instances; the event has not been fully integrated into the lives of the participants. For collective social sharing, this may mean that the emotions elicited by the event are reactivated in the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> experienced the event, or that the emotional event is being reproduced for successive generations who did not actually experience the event because the event represents an important memory of the group. Following this idea, the collective rituals and symbols are linkened to conventional social sharing situations, which both cause a reactivation of the emotions that were lived or relived.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{election}} to Parliament, Hanson's book, Pauline Hanson – the truth : on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate {{and the future}} of Australia, was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to [...] "demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society". David Ettridge, the One Nation party director, said that the book's claims were intended to correct [...] "misconceptions" [...] about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that [...] "the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of whether you can feel sympathy for people who eat their babies". The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was [...] "written by some other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>actually</b> put my name to it" [...] and that while she held the copyright over The Truth, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.|$|E
