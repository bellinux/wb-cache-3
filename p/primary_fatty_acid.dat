40|$|In this study, {{fatty acid}} composition, {{antioxidant}} activity, total phenolic compounds (TPC) and oxidative stability of cherry seed (SCO), sweet cherry seed (SCSO), mulberry seed (MSO) and plum seed oil (PSO) were determined. Oleic acid was determined as <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (42. 9 - 67. 3 %), {{and followed by}} linoleic acid (23. 4 - 41. 8 %) for SCO, SCSO and PSO. Linoleic acid was determined as <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in MSO. γ-tocopherol was determined the main and highest tocopherol isomers varied from 579. 9 to 605 mg/kg oil in SCO, SCSO and PSO, whereas δ-tocopherol was determined main tocopherol isomer with 1354 mg/kg oil value in MSO. Plum seed oil (PSO) was the highest antioxidant activity values in both 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 '-azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays. There was {{no significant differences in}} lipid hydroperoxide and TBARS (2 -thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance) formation among SCO, SCSO and MSO. PSO had the highest induction period (15. 1 h), followed by MSO (1. 4 h), SCSO (1. 5 h), SCO(1. 3 h). PSO was oxidatively more stable than the other oil samples. This research shows that these waste seed oils have high antioxidant capacity and tocopherol content, so they could be used in food industry...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus nidulans {{contains}} two functionally distinct fatty acid synthases (FASs) : one required for <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism (FAS) {{and the other}} required for secondary metabolism (sFAS). FAS mutants require long-chain fatty acids for growth, whereas sFAS mutants grow normally but cannot synthesize sterigmatocystin (ST), a carcinogenic secondary metabolite structurally and biosynthetically related to aflatoxin. sFAS mutants regain the ability to synthesize ST when provided with hexanoic acid, supporting the model that the ST polyketide synthase uses this short-chain fatty acid as a starter unit. The characterization of both the polyketide synthase and FAS may provide novel means for modifying secondary metabolites...|$|E

Many details regarding {{fatty acid amide}} metabolism remain unclear.

Growth of D. melanogaster on media supplemented with [1 - 13 C]-palmitate lead to a family of 13 C-palmitate-labeled fatty acid amides in the fly heads.

The shea butter produced in the Mossi plateau region of Burkina Faso has higher average stearic acid percentage and is thus harder than the shea butter from other West African regions; this is due to scientific inference that the phenolic content in shea kernels varies from region to region.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPeptidyglycine α-amidating monooxygenase is a copper- and zinc-dependent, bifunctional {{enzyme that}} catalyzes the {{cleavage}} of glycine-extended peptides or N-acylglycines to the corresponding amides and glyoxylate. This reaction {{is a key}} step in the biosynthesis of bioactive α-amidated peptides and, perhaps, the <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> amides also. Two clinically useful N-acylglycines are thiorphan and tiopronin, each with a thiol moiety attached to the acyl group. We report here that thiorphan and tiopronin are substrates for PAM, exhibiting relatively low KM,app and VMAX,app values. The low VMAX,app values result, most likely, from a decrease in active PAM· 2 Cu(II) as the enzyme competes ineffectively with thiorphan and tiopronin for free copper...|$|R
40|$|Body fat {{deposition}} {{and excess}} {{free fatty acid}} (FFA) metabolism contribute to dyslipidemia and the adverse health consequences of obesity. Individuals with upper body obesity have impaired functioning of adipocytes, the <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> storage site. Excess visceral fat is strongly associated with impaired suppression of FFA release in response to insulin, {{as well as with}} hypertriglyceridemia and low concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. High FFA concentrations can induce insulin resistance in muscle and liver. Furthermore, failure of hyperinsulinemia to normally suppress FFA is associated with impaired carbohydrate oxidation and muscle glucose storage, reduced hepatic insulin clearance and elevated triglycerides. Understanding the impact of body fat distribution on FFA metabolism and dyslipidemia is critical for determining the link between overweight and obesity and cardiovascular disease risk. In the current review, we will explore the relationship between adipose tissue, body fat depots, and FFA metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Several {{members of}} the genus Legionella cause Legionnaires' disease, a {{potentially}} debilitating form of pneumonia. Studies frequently focus on the abundant number of virulence factors present in this genus. However, what is often overlooked {{is the role of}} secondary metabolites from Legionella. Following whole genome sequencing, we assembled and annotated the Legionella parisiensis DSM 19216 genome. Together with 14 other {{members of the}} Legionella, we performed comparative genomics and analysed the secondary metabolite potential of each strain. We found that Legionella contains a huge variety of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that are potentially making a significant number of novel natural products with undefined function. Surprisingly, only a single Sfp-like phosphopantetheinyl transferase is found in all Legionella strains analyzed that might be responsible for the activation of all carrier proteins in <b>primary</b> (<b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis) and secondary metabolism (polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis). Using conserved active site motifs, we predict some novel compounds that are probably involved in cell-cell communication, differing to known communication systems. We identify several gene clusters, which may represent novel signaling mechanisms and demonstrate the natural product potential of Legionella...|$|E
40|$|Native {{beta-lactoglobulin}} (Blg) binds 1 mole of {{palmitic acid}} per mole of protein with a dissociation constant of 0. 6 microM for the <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> binding site. Chemical modification of Cys 121, which {{lies at the}} external putative hydrophobic binding site of Blg, does not affect retinol or 4, 4 '-bis 1 -(phenylamino) - 8 -naphthalenesulfonate (bis-ANS) binding to the protein, indicating that the incorporated appendages do not perturb the internal hydrophobic site within the beta-barrel of Blg (i. e., the retinoid site is unaffected). On the other hand, methylation of Cys 121, reduces the affinity of Blg for palmitic acid by 10 -fold as monitored by intrinsic fluorescence. Modification of the Cys 121 with methylmethanethiosulfonate or a thiol-specific spin label appears to either further weaken or totally eliminate fatty acid binding, respectively, due to steric hindrance. Furthermore, this binding pattern has been independently verified using a spin labeled fatty acid analog and monitoring ESR {{as well as by}} bis-ANS fluorescence when bound to the protein. These results suggest that fatty acids bind at the "external site" of beta-lactoglobulin, between the sole alpha-helix and the beta-barrel. In addition, structural stability studies of native and chemically modified Blg appear to confirm this observation as well...|$|E
40|$|To get insight in the {{biodegradation}} {{and potential}} read-across of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides, N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] cocoamide and N-(1 -ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide {{were used as}} model compounds. Two bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PK 1 and Pseudomonas putida PK 2 were isolated with N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] cocoamide and its hydrolysis product N,N-dimethyl- 1, 3 -propanediamine, respectively. In mixed culture, both strains accomplished complete mineralization of N-[3 -(dimethylamino) propyl] cocoamide. Aeromonashydrophila PK 3 was enriched with N-(1 -ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide and subsequently isolated using agar plates containing dodecanoate. N-(2 -Aminoethyl) piperazine, the hydrolysis product of N-(1 -ethylpiperazine) tall oil amide, was not degraded. The aerobic biodegradation pathway for <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides of P. aeruginosa and A. hydrophila involved initial hydrolysis of the amide bond producing ammonium, or amines, where the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> formed were immediately metabolized. Complete mineralization of secondary <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides depended on the biodegradability of the released amine. Tertiary <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides were not transformed by P. aeruginosa or A. hydrophila. These strains were able to utilize all tested <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides independent of the amine structure and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> Read-across of previous reported ready biodegradability results of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides is justified based on the broad substrate specificity and the initial hydrolytic attack of the two isolates PK 1 and PK 3...|$|R

40|$|The psychrotolerant {{foodborne}} pathogen Listeria monocytogenes withstands {{the stress}} of low temperatures and can proliferate in refrigerated food. Bacteria adapt to growth at low temperatures by increasing the production of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> that increase membrane fluidity. The mechanism of homeoviscous increases in unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amounts in bacteria that predominantly contain straight-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is relatively well understood. By contrast the analogous mechanism in branched-chain fatty acid-containing bacteria, such as L. monocytogenes, is poorly understood. L. monocytogenes grows at low temperatures by altering its membrane composition to increase membrane fluidity, primarily by decreasing the length of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> chains and increasing the anteiso to iso <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> ratio. FabH, the initiator of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis, {{has been identified as}} the primary determinant of membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition, but the extent of this effect has not been quantified. In this study, previously determined FabH steady-state parameters and substrate concentrations were used to calculate expected <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> compositions at 30 oC and 10 oC. FabH substrates 2 -methylbutyryl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, and isovaleryl-CoA produce the <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in L. monocytogenes, i. e., anteiso-odd, iso-even, and iso-odd <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively. In vivo concentrations of CoA derivatives were measured, but not all were resolved completely. In this case, estimates were calculated from overall <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition and FabH steady-state parameters. These relative substrate concentrations were used to calculate the expected <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> compositions at 10 oC. Our model predicted a higher level of anteiso lipids at 10 oC than was observed, indicative of an additional step beyond FabH influencing <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition at low temperatures. The potential for control of low temperature growth by feeding compounds that result in the production of butyryl-CoA, the precursor of SCFAs that rigidify the membrane and are incompatible with growth at low temperatures, is recognized...|$|R
40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of branched-chain fatty acids, such as isobutyric and isovaleric acids, develop during the ripening of hard cheeses {{and contribute to}} the beneficial flavor profile. Catabolism of amino acids, such as branched-chain amino acids, by bacteria via aminotransferase reactions and α-keto acids is one mechanism to generate these flavorful compounds; however, metabolism of α-keto acids to flavor-associated compounds is controversial. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the ability of Brevibacterium linens BL 2 to produce fatty acids from amino acids and α-keto acids and determine the occurrence of the likely genes in the draft genome sequence. BL 2 catabolized amino acids to fatty acids only under carbohydrate starvation conditions. The <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> end products from leucine were isovaleric acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid. In contrast, logarithmic-phase cells of BL 2 produced fatty acids from α-keto acids only. BL 2 also converted α-keto acids to branched-chain fatty acids after carbohydrate starvation was achieved. At least 100 genes are potentially involved in five different metabolic pathways. The genome of B. linens ATCC 9174 contained these genes for production and degradation of fatty acids. These data indicate that brevibacteria have the ability to produce fatty acids from amino and α-keto acids and that carbon metabolism is important in regulating this event...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the prevalence of LPIN 1 mutations in patients exhibiting severe episodes of rhabdomyolysis in infancy. After exclusion of <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation disorders, LPIN 1 coding sequence was determined in genomic DNA and cDNA. Among the 29 patients studied, 17 (59 %) carried recessive nonsense or frameshift mutations, or a large scale intragenic deletion. In these 17 patients, episodes of rhabdomyolysis occurred at a mean age of 21 months. Secondary defect of mitochondrial fatty oxidation or respiratory chain was found in skeletal muscle of two patients. The intragenic deletion, c. 2295 - 866 _ 2410 - 30 del, was identified in 8 / 17 patients (47 %), all Caucasians, and occurred on the background of a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. This deleted human LPIN 1 form was unable to complement Delta pah 1 yeast for growth on glycerol, in contrast to normal LPIN 1. Since more than 50 % of our series harboured LPIN 1 mutations, LPIN 1 should be regarded as a major cause of severe myoglobinuria in early childhood. The high frequency of the intragenic LPIN 1 deletion should provide a valuable criterion for fast diagnosis, prior to muscle biops...|$|E

In order to analyze and identify the substances present in mosses, two types of extrahents (chloroform, ethanol) and the GC/MS and LC-TOF-MS methods were used.

40|$|Bovine, {{human and}} rat serum albumins were {{defatted}} and palmitic acid, oleic acid and lauric acid added in various molar ratios. The binding of L-tryptophan to these albumins was measured at 20 degrees C in a 0. 138 M salt solution at pH 7. 4, {{by using an}} ultrafiltration technique, and analysed in terms of n, the number of available tryptophan-binding sites per albumin molecule, with apparent association constant, k. 2. n and k were 0. 90 and 2. 3 x 10 (- 4) M(minus- 1) respectively for defatted bovine serum albumin and 0. 87 and 9. 7 x 10 (- 3) M(-minus- 1) for human albumin. Addition of palmitic acid did not decrease n until the molar ratio, fatty acid/bovine albumin, approached and exceeded 2. The decrease in k was small and progressive. In contrast, lauric caused a marked decrease in n and k at ratios as low as 0. 5. A similar distinction between the effects on n of palmitic acid and oleic acid and those of lauric acid was seen for human albumin. k for human albumin was not significantly affected by <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> under the conditions studied. 3. It is concluded that <b>primary</b> long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> sites interact only weakly with the tryptophan site on albumin and that inhibition of tryptophan binding occurs when secondary long-chain sites are occupied. <b>Primary</b> medium-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> sites are distinct from primary long-chain sites but may be grouped with secondary long-chain sites. 4.

40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of breast milk secreted by Mediterranean women is still under-investigated. Due {{to the specific}} Mediterranean diet, the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile of such milk could be distinctive. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the relationship between maternal diet and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile of the mature milk obtained from 83 breastfeeding women residing in the coastal Croatia, lactating for 5 – 25  weeks. Their diet was evaluated using two consecutive 24 -h recalls, while the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> milk content was determined using gas chromatography. Among the dietary intake of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated dietary <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> the most represented were palmitic (21. 70  g. day− 1), oleic (29. 20  g. day− 1) and linoleic acid (13. 81  g. day− 1), with the ratio of total dietary n− 6 /n− 3 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of 12. 01. In milk, the most represented <b>primary</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> was oleic acid (39. 63 %), while the most represented saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> was palmitic acid (20. 65 %). The share of linoleic, α-linolenic and docosahexaenoic <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> was 17. 28 %, 1. 41 % and 0. 21 %, respectively. The correlation between dietary <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and their breast milk concentrations was established for docosahexaenoic (r[*]=[*] 0. 54, P[*]<[*] 0. 001), linoleic (r[*]=[*] 0. 24, P[*]=[*] 0. 032), palmitic (r[*]=[*] 0. 18, P[*]=[*] 0. 021) and oleic acid (r[*]=[*] 0. 21, P[*]=[*] 0. 024). In conclusion, the issue of concern is the sub-optimal dietary intake of n− 3 long-chain polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> resulting in their low breast milk concentrations, especially that of docosahexaenoic acid.

40|$|N-Acylethanolamines (NAEs) are a {{class of}} fatty acid amides that act as {{important}} mammalian signaling molecules. N-Arachidonoylethanolamine is the best-studied representative {{and is one of}} the endogenous ligands for endocannabinoid receptors. NAEs play a role in the regulation of appetite, act as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents, and are thought to have a neuroprotective function as well. They have been proposed to also serve as precursors to N-acylglycines (NAGs). N-Acylglycinals are likely to be intermediates between the NAEs and the NAGs. The sequential actions of a putative fatty alcohol dehydrogenase and a putative fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase are thought to affect the NAD+-dependent oxidation of the NAEs to the NAGs. NAGs, in turn, serve as precursor in the biosynthesis of <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides (PFAMs), another class of mammalian regulatory molecules. Alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (ADH 3), an enzyme known to oxidize mid- and long-chain alcohols to aldehydes, was evaluated for its potential in oxidation of NAEs to N-acylglycinals. In order to evaluate the possibility of ADH 3 involvement in NAE metabolism, variable chain length NAEs were synthesized and evaluated as substrates for bovine liver ADH 3. NAEs were oxidized by ADH 3 in the presence of NAD+, yielding the corresponding N-acylglycinals. V[subfield Max]/K[subfield M] values for assayed NAEs were low relative to cinnamyl alcohol, one of the preferred substrates for ADH 3. Our data suggest that the ADH-mediated oxidation of NAEs could occur in vivo, but that ADH 3 is unlikely to be the in vivo catalyst...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In the {{diagnosis}} of complex diseases such as neurological pathologies, a wealth of clinical and molecular information is often available to help the interpretation. Yet, the pieces of information are usually considered in isolation and rarely integrated {{due to the lack}} of a sound statistical framework. This lack of integration results in the loss of valuable information about how disease associated factors act synergistically to cause the complex phenotype. Results Here, we investigated complex psychiatric diseases as networks. The networks were used to integrate data originating from different profiling platforms. The weighted links in these networks capture the association between the analyzed factors and allow the quantification of their relevance for the pathology. The heterogeneity of the patient population was analyzed by clustering and graph theoretical procedures. We provided an estimate of the heterogeneity of the population of schizophrenia and detected a subgroup of patients featuring remarkable abnormalities in a network of serum <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides. We compared the stability of this molecular network in an extended dataset between schizophrenia and affective disorder patients and found more stable structures in the latter. Conclusion We quantified robust associations between analytes measured with different profiling platforms as networks. The methodology allows the quantitative evaluation of the complexity of the disease. The identified disease patterns can then be further investigated with regards to their diagnostic utility or help in the prediction of novel therapeutic targets. The applied framework is able to enhance the understanding of complex psychiatric diseases, and may give novel insights into drug development and personalized medicine approaches. </p...|$|E
40|$|The vast {{variety of}} {{long-chain}} fatty acid amides identified in biological systems is intriguing. The general {{structure of a}} fatty acid amide is R-CO-NH-X, where R is an alkyl group and X is derived from an immense variety of biogenic amines. Although structurally simple, the bioactivities of these molecules as signaling lipids are very diverse and have just recently begun {{to emerge in the}} literature. Interest in the long-chain fatty acid amides dramatically increased following the identification and characterization of one specific N-acylethanolamine, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), as the endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptors in the mammalian brain. Since this discovery, the details of N-acylethanolamine metabolism have been elucidated. However, a lesser extent of {{progress has been made in}} the last twenty years to identify and study the non-N-acylethanolamine long-chain fatty acid amides. The focus of this dissertation is the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways for long-chain fatty acid amides, including N-acylglycines, <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides, N-acylarylalkylamides, and N-acylethanolamines.

Different concentrations of N 6 -benzyladenine (BA) or thidiazuron (TDZ) {{alone or in}} combination with α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) were tested in order to stimulate multiple shoot production. Ideal shoot induction (100 %) and maximized shoot numbers (36. 4) were obtained on explants cultured on media incorporated with 2 μM BA and 1 μM NAA combinations. The in vitro-developed shoots rooted best on half-strength MS media incorporated with 2 μM indole 3 -butyric acid. Plantlets were effectively acclimatized in the greenhouse with 100 % survival rate. The composition and contents of bioactive compounds such as carotenoids, tocopherol and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in shoot tissues of S. dasyphyllum were investigated using HPLC and GC-MS. The most abundant carotenoid in the shoot tissue was all-E-lutein (40. 3 – 70. 5 μg g− 1 FW) followed by 9 ′-Z-neoxanthin (5. 3 – 9. 9 μg g− 1 FW), all-E-violaxanthin (4. 4 – 8. 2 μg g− 1 FW), and all-E-β-carotene (1. 6 – 3. 6 μg g− 1 FW). The α-tocopherol contents of in vitro-raised shoots was 6. 5 -fold higher than shoots of greenhouse-grown plants.

30|$|The {{value of}} {{cholesterol}} {{obtained in the}} present study is similar to that reported earlier (Campbell 2012). Nevertheless, lower values of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in group consumed diet containing GC as compared to those fed diet without GC could be an indication of its hypocholestrolemic properties. This finding agreed with the result reported by Amawi and Aljamal (2012) who observed decreased glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides and low density lipoprotein in hypercolestrolemic and diabetic rats after the administration of GC extract (20  mg/kg) for 4  weeks. Likewise, research result revealed that the level of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-c and VLDL-c levels decreased when hypercholesterolemic rats were treated daily with either drug (Gemfiibrazil capsule 9  mg), GC extract (5  %) or GC powder (10  %) (Al Hamedan 2010). Youssef et al. (2014) also confirmed serum cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-c lowering properties of GC oil (25, 50 and 75  %) in albino rats. This could in part be due to the high copper content of GC (Zia-Ul-Haq et al. 2012) as it was known to have a blood cholesterol lowering effect. The other possible reason for the observed decrease in blood sugar level in the GC containing diet is due to the presence of linolenic acids. Bryan et al. (2009) noted that the <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in GC oil are oleic (30.6  %) and linolenic acids (29.3  %). Lower serum cholesterol indicates better cardiac function.

The first 3 mol of oleic acid added to intact albumin generated three distinct NMR resonances as a result of simultaneous binding of oleic acid to three heterogeneous sites (primary sites). Two of these resonances were seen upon addition of 1 or 2 mol of oleic acid to fragments representing either the carboxyl-terminal half (residues 307 - 582) or the carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 377 - 582); the third resonance was seen upon addition of 1 mol of oleic acid to the fragment representing the amino-terminal half (residues 1 - 306). The resonance patterns for the fourth and fifth moles of oleic acid added to albumin (secondary sites) could not be duplicated by addition of more oleic acid to individual fragments. These resonance patterns were generated, however, when the two complementary fragments were mixed in equimolar proportions to form an albumin-like complex with a reconstituted middle domain. Thus, two <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> binding sites are assigned to the carboxyl-terminal domain, one primary site is assigned to the amino-terminal half, and the secondary sites are assigned to the middle domain. This distribution suggests albumin to be a less symmetrical binding molecule than theoretical models predict. This work also demonstrates the power of NMR for the study of microenvironments of individual fatty acid binding sites in specific domains...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, main organs (digestive gland, cephalopedal, gonad and mantle) and lipid classes (total, neutral and phospholipid) of land snails Assyriella escheriana and Assyriella guttata from southeastern Anatolia were {{examined}} for their fatty acids. The major components detected {{in both of}} the species were C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 18 : 1 ω 9, C 18 : 2 ω 6, C 18 : 3 ω 3, C 20 : 2 ω 6 and C 20 : 4 ω 6. C 18 : 2 ω 6 was identified as the <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> ranging from 17. 07 % to 28. 12 % in A. guttata and 18. 02 % to 27. 43 % in A. escheriana. The proportions of C 20 : 4 ω 6 modified to form prostaglandins that are directly involved in regulation of reproduction, ranged from 10. 01 % to 20. 30 % in A. escheriana and 11. 05 % to 16. 58 % in A. guttata. Taking into consideration that ΣPUFA levels were always higher than ΣSFA and ΣMUFA levels in all treatments of both species. This was an expected finding for the snails collected during the breeding season because PUFA {{plays an important role}} as precursors for signal-transduction involved in the regulation of mating and reproduction. A significant amount of C 20 : 2 ω 6 was concentrated in the cephalopedal of A. guttata (13. 42 %) and A. escheriana (14. 93 %). Probably, cephalopedal serves as a storage organ of this component. Consequently, the findings revealed that the snail’s fatty acid profiles were qualitatively similar, but quantitatively there were some differences. Most important of all, tissues of the snails were good source of essential fatty acids (C 18 : 2 ω 6 and C 18 : 3 ω 3) and PUFA, particularly omega 6 fatty acids. </p...|$|E

The Turkish hazelnuts contained over 65 % total oil while the Oregon roasted variety contained 43. 8 %. The <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in both was oleic acid (18 : 1 n- 9) comprising 76. 7 g/ 100 g oil in the Oregon variety and 83. 3 g/ 100 g oil in the Turkish variety. The TPC were 91. 4 and 102. 16 g gallic acid equivalents/g sample for the Turkish roasted hazelnut skin and Oregon roasted hazelnut skin respectively, at least 30 -folds {{as high as the}} hazelnut without skin.

African catfish (22 ? 7 g/fish), Clarias gariepinus Burchell, juveniles were stocked (sixteen aquaria, twenty-five fish per aquarium) and fed for a maximum of 74 d. Dietary lysine had a clear effect on growth performance and feed conversion ratios, but dietary carnitine supplements had no effect. High-carnitine supplements increased total carnitine content (P< 0 ? 0004) and reduced tissue free carnitine: acyl-carnitine ratio (P< 0 ? 05) compared with low-carnitine supplements. High-fat supplements decreased liver carnitine concentrations. Clear effects on liver <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations were observed in high-carnitine-fed fish compared with low-carnitine-fed fish. The <b>primary</b> liver <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> affected were 18 : 2 n- 6 (linoleic acid), 20 : 5 n- 3 (eicosapentanoic acid) and 22 : 6 n- 3 (docosahexanoic <b>acid).</b> The whole-body <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> balance suggested that 20 : 5 n- 3 disappeared (apparently by -oxidation) more readily than 18 : 2 n- 6 and/or 22 : 6 n- 3. From 774 mg 20 : 5 n- 3 eaten by high-lysine–high-fat–low-carnitine fish, 58 % was not assimilated into body tissues. High-carnitine-fed fish showed an increase in 20 : 5 n- 3 oxidation by 7 % compared with low-carnitine fish. Although dietary carnitine did not improve body growth, these results support the hypothesis that carnitine can enhance the mobilisation of long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> towards oxidation...|$|R

As such, migratory birds offer an intriguing model for studying the implications of lipid metabolism and obesity on exercise performance. We conclude with a discussion of the energetic costs of migratory flight and stopover in birds, and its implications for bird migration strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acid amides are an {{emerging}} family of bioactive lipids {{that consists of}} N-acylethanolamines, N-acylarylalkylamides, N-acylglycines, N-acyl amino acids, N-monoacylpolyamides, and <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides. Short chain fatty acid amides are products of inactivated biogenic amines such as dopamine, histamine, octopamine, and serotonin, whereas long chain fatty acid amides have been implicated {{in a number of}} physiological process such as the perception and inhibition of chronic pain through binding to their specific receptors. The most famous; therefore, the most studied long chain fatty acid amide is anandamide or also known as N-arachidonylethanolamine. The biosynthesis of anandamide is well defined; however, other long-chain fatty acid amides, such as the N-acyldopamines, N-acylserotonins, N-acylglycines, N-acyl amino acids, and <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides have remained elusive to date. Understanding the complete biosynthetic pathway for these cell signaling lipids, may yield new exciting molecular targets for human health and disease. Discovery of the long-chain fatty acid amide biosynthetic enzymes has proven to be challenging due to the low biologic abundance of the respective metabolites found in organisms, the interconnection of the pathways, and expense of using mammalian cells and/or organisms. This led to the transition of studying these metabolites and their respective biosynthetic enzymes in Drosophila melanogaster. D. melanogaster is an ideal system to study fatty acid amide biosynthesis because the respective metabolites have been identified, the cost of maintaining the organism is relatively low, and genetic manipulation (RNAi) is universally available. This dissertation is dedicated to defining enzymes involved in D. melanogaster N-acylarylalkyamide biosynthesis. The biologically relevant long-chain N-acylarylalkylamides are comprised of long-chain N-acyldopamines and N-acylserotonins. Very little is known for how these potent cell signaling lipids are biosynthesized in the cell. One possible route is the N -acylation of the respective biogenic amine by an N-acyltransferase enzyme. An enzyme known to catalyze this chemistry is arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), which catalyzes the formation of N-acetylarylalkylamides from acetyl CoA and the corresponding arylalkylamide. The N-acetylation of biogenic amines is a critical step in Drosophila melanogaster for the inactivation of amine neurotransmitters, sclerotization of the cuticle, and to serve as the penultimate intermediate in the biosynthesis of melatonin. Two AANAT(L) enzymes has been previously evaluated in D. melanogaster and six other putative AANATL enzymes have identified in the fly genome. One AANAT is expressed as two biologically relevant isoforms, AANAT variant A (AANATA) and AANAT variant B (AANATB), where AANATA differs from AANATB by the truncation of 35 amino acids on the N-terminus. The other AANATL enzyme to be previously studied is AANATL 2, which was found to catalyze the formation of N-acetyltryptamine from acetyl CoA and tryptamine. Herein, we expressed six AANAT(L) enzymes (AANATA and AANATB, AANATL 2, AANATL 3, AANATL 7, and AANATL 8) and sought to define the acyl-CoA and amine substrates for each enzyme. To accomplish this, we developed an activity based screening assay to define acyl-CoA and amine substrates for AANATL 2, AANATL 3, AANATL 7, and AANATL 8. Following this work, we defined the acyl-CoA and amine substrate specificity for AANATA, AANATL 2, AANATL 3, and AANATL 7. We have identified acetyl CoA and arylalkylamines as substrates for AANATA, AANATL 2, and AANATL 3; whereas AANATL 7 acetylates histamine and arylalkylamines. AANATL 2 was additionally shown to catalyze the formation of long-chain N-acyldopamines and N-acylserotonins. Following these important set of results, we solved the kinetic mechanism for AANATA, AANATL 2, and AANATL 7 in which these enzymes were shown to catalyze the formation of N-acylarylalkylamides by an ordered sequential mechanism where the acyl-CoA substrate binds first followed by the corresponding amine substrate. Finally, we evaluated the function of structural amino acids on regulating catalysis, structural features of substrates that effect binding and/or catalysis, and generated data leading to a proposed chemical mechanism by means of pH-activity profiles and site-directed mutagenesis of prospective catalytic residues...|$|E
40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides (PFAMs) and N-acylglycines (NAGs) are {{important}} signaling molecules in the mammalian nervous system, binding to many drug receptors and demonstrating control over sleep, locomotor activity, angiogenesis, vasodilatation, gap junction communication, {{and many other}} processes. Oleamide is the best-studied of the PFAMs, while the in vivo activity of the others is largely unstudied. Even less {{is known about the}} NAGs, as their discovery as novel compounds is much more recent due to low endogenous levels. Herein is described extraction and quantification techniques for PFAMs and NAGs in cultured cells and media using solvent extraction combined with solid phase extraction (PFAM) or thin layer chromatography (NAG), followed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy to isolate and quantify these lipid metabolites. The assays were used to examine the endogenous amounts of a panel of PFAMs as well as the conversion of corresponding free fatty acids (FFAs) to PFAMs over time in several cell lines. The cell lines demonstrated the ability to convert all FFAs, including a non-natural FFA, and an ethanolamine to the corresponding PFAM. Different patterns of relative amounts of endogenous and FFA-derived PFAMs were observed in the cell lines tested. Essential to identifying therapeutic targets for the many disorders associated with PFAM signaling is understanding the mechanism(s) of PFAM and NAG biosynthesis. Enzyme expression studies were conducted to determine potential metabolic enzymes in the model cell lines in an attempt to understand the mechanism(s) of PFAM biosynthesis. It was found that two of the cell lines which show distinct metabolisms of PFAMs also demonstrate unique enzyme expression patterns, and candidate enzymes proposed to perform PFAM and NAG metabolism are described. RNAi knockdown studies revealed further information about the metabolism of PFAMs and calls into question the recently proposed involvement of cytochrome c. Isotopic labeling studies showed there are two pathways for PFAM formation. A novel enzyme is likely to be involved in formation of NAGs from acyl-CoA intermediates...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneity {{exists in}} the {{phospholipid}} bilayer of cells. One plausible role of this phospholipid heterogeneity is to regulate the distribution of drug molecules at both the cellular and tissue levels. In order to model the complex process of drug distribution among the endogenous lipid pools competing to sequester a drug molecule, pure lipid membrane surfaces, i. e. immobilized artificial membranes (IAMs), were used to develop a database of the membrane phospholipid affinities of approximately 300 commercially available drugs. This in vitro membrane binding model correlated phospholipid binding affinities with the in vivo activity of the drugs. Compounds within the same therapeutic class (e. g. anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anxiolytic, etc.) and compounds with the same molecular target (e. g. dopamine receptor, serotonin receptor, GABA receptor, etc.) exhibited membrane affinity fingerprints (MAFs) distinct from compounds in all other classes and mechanisms. The unique MAFs suggest that compounds comprising a therapeutic class or molecular target exhibit similar tendencies to distribute into tissue lipid pools where activity is then elicited. ^ In addition to developing the in vitro membrane binding model, a new mechanism of action for the sleep inducing lipid oleamide was identified: inhibition of anandamide transport. Several analogs of oleamide were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of anandamide transport in order to explore the structure-activity relationship (SAR) with regard to fatty acid chain and carboxamide modifications. Of the <b>primary</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> amides examined, 14 : 19 was the most potent monounsaturated inhibitor (IC 50 = 5. 6 μM) and 20 : 55, 8, 11, 14, 17 was the most potent polyunsaturated inhibitor (IC 50 = 7. 5 μM). Of the carboxamide modified oleamide derivatives, N-methyloleamide was the most potent inhibitor (IC 50 = 5. 40 μM). Several of the oleamide derivatives exhibited sedative behavior in vivo, with N,N-dimethyloleamide exhibiting a duration of sedation (40 min) {{twice as long as}} the endogenous oleamide. In addition, in vivo studies revealed that the sedative effects of oleamide and several analogs are potentiated two-fold {{in the presence of the}} cannabinoid (CB 1) selective antagonist SR 141716 A. This potentiation taken together with the ability of oleamide to inhibit anandamide transport suggests that the cannabinoid system plays a crucial role in the physiological effects of oleamide. ...|$|E

Methods: Different classes of leukocytes were isolated from human blood and their membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profiles were analysed and compared. After culturing in vitro immortalised and <b>primary</b> leukocytes, membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were analysed and compared. Finally, different lipid formulations were developed and used for supplementing leukocytes in vitro in an effort to maintain the in vivo <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile. Descriptive and analytical tests were performed to compare the obtained <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profiles. Results: Membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profiles of <b>primary</b> human CD 4 + T-lymphocytes, CD 8 + T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and monocytes differed. Moreover, there were differences among Jurkat, Raji and THP- 1 cell lines and the corresponding primary leukocyte classes, as well as between freshly prepared and in vitro cultured primary lymphocytes. A lipid supplement was able to maintain cultured Jurkat cells with a membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile almost identical to that of the primary CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. Finally, variations in the lipid supplement composition enabled the development of Jurkat cells with different membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profiles characterising different physiological or pathological human conditions.

Cultured primary leukocytes and immortalized leukocytic cells display different membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profiles when compared to their respective in vivo counterparts. The membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of cultured cells can be restored to reflect that of the corresponding in vivo condition through use of optimised lipid supplementation.
