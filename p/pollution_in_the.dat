5|$|DDT <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{environment}} {{was a major}} cause of decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E

The club responded by pointing to initiatives by its Ladies team to organise competitions at local grounds.

5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act. The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks and pollution in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{vulnerability}} of groundwater to <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nescopeck Creek watershed has been measured using the DRASTIC system.

Values of 91 to 104 occur {{in the northern part}} of the watershed, as well as in scattered patches in the western part. Values of 105 to 115 occur in the southern, southwestern, and part of the central part of the watershed. Some areas with values 116 and higher are scattered throughout the watershed except near the headwaters.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008.

5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around the bay also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bay is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in the bay reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{also created}} or reorganized several {{government}} agencies. In cooperation with Pennsylvania governor James H. Duff, {{he created the}} Ohio River Sanitation Commission (ORANSCO) to combat <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River and its tributaries. He curbed fraud in the insurance industry by reorganizing the state Insurance Commission and hiring a national prominent expert to rewrite the state's entire insurance code. To assist the General Assembly in writing more effective and efficient legislation, Clements created the non-partisan Legislative Research Commission, stocked with professionals from various disciplines, to conduct governmental research. He created the Kentucky Agriculture and Industrial Board (the predecessor of the current Kentucky Department of Commerce), which attracted 250 new industries {{to the state and}} created 40,000 new jobs during its first three years. He also created the Kentucky Building Commission to manage and plan all new state buildings. Among the commission's first projects were a new $6million capitol annex and {{the construction of a new}} state fairgrounds. To retain the most qualified government employees, he supported a constitutional amendment that quadrupled the minimum annual salary for state employees from $5,000 to $20,000.|$|E

5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead <b>pollution</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
5|$|Many {{overlapping}} entities including city, county, state, {{and federal}} governments share jurisdiction for parts of the watershed.
