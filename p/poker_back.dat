50|$|In April 2011, online poker {{was shut}} down in the USA. Somerville was mostly absent from online tournament poker until 2013 when Ultimate Poker brought legalized and {{regulated}} online <b>poker</b> <b>back</b> to America, having chosen not to relocate out of the country. Jason played on Ultimate Poker until it {{was shut down}} in 2014 because the Nevada-based site's revenues fell far short of projected expectations.|$|E
6000|$|True to his word, O'Riley {{sat down}} by the dog-kennel, and gave vent to a howl which his [...] "owld grandmother," [...] he said, [...] "used to sing to the pig," [...] and {{whether it was the}} effects of this lullaby, or of the cold, it is {{impossible}} to say, but O'Riley at length succeeded in slipping away and regaining the ship, unobserved by his canine friends. Half an hour later he went on deck to take a mouthful of fresh air before supper, and on looking over the side he saw the whole pack of dogs lying in a circle close to the ship, with Dumps comfortably asleep in the middle, and using <b>Poker's</b> <b>back</b> for a pillow.|$|R
50|$|The Paradise <b>Poker</b> website <b>backed</b> Gerasimov in the World Poker Tour season 1 $25,000 {{championship}} event, {{where he}} finished runner-up to Alan Goehring {{to take home}} a $506,625 prize. Since he became a noted player for this runner-up finish, many people have noted he has similar facial characteristics to actor Matt Damon, who played the lead role in the 1998 poker film Rounders.|$|R
50|$|Horseshoe {{is home to}} {{the largest}} poker room in the Midwest, {{featuring}} 34 tables at all limits, and including a private <b>poker</b> area, Bennyâ€™s <b>Back</b> Room, named for the founder of the original Horseshoe in downtown Las Vegas, Benny Binion.|$|R
50|$|In the Rex Stout {{corpus of}} Nero Wolfe stories, heavy use is made {{at times of}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship between Nero Wolfe and a fictional New York newspaper, the Gazette. Archie Goodwin, Wolfe's right-hand man, and {{a senior editor at}} the paper, Lon Cohen, are long-time <b>poker</b> buddies, stretching <b>back</b> to the earliest Wolfe stories. However, none of Stout's stories involve the inner structure of the Gazette.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2007, Negreanu {{signed with}} PokerStars, joining Chris Moneymaker {{and many other}} {{professional}} poker players {{as a member of}} Team PokerStars. His Full Contact Poker site has since returned to being a forum and informational site. After [...] "Black Friday" [...] (the 2011 US government crackdown on online <b>poker),</b> Negreanu moved <b>back</b> to Canada in order to continue playing online poker on Poker Stars.|$|R
5000|$|When Dare is late returning, Tom tells Judy {{the cost}} was worth every penny to show her Dare's true nature. She pleads for him to save Dare [...] "You're smart about these things, smarter than any man I know." [...] He arrives in time to take over playing and catches their trick. Fillmore hands have already left, so the bad guys shoot Tom in the {{shoulder}} and pursue the trio. Dink diverts some and catches up to bring the hands back, while the cousins hole up, Dare admitting Tom is the best <b>poker</b> player. <b>Back</b> home after winning the gunfight, Tom tells Judy where Dare is riding out of town, and {{that he wants to}} offer him a partnership, so Judy brings the Montana-bound buddies back.|$|R
50|$|Further renovations {{occurred}} in 2015 and 2016. The large rock formation/waterfall near the main boardwalk entrance was removed {{along with the}} animatronic gold miner; this space now features a large area for bands to perform, {{as well as some}} live table games. The only slot machines besides those in Coyote Kate's Slot Parlor are located near the new stage. The area between the stage and the far <b>back</b> <b>poker</b> rooms remains vacant but plans may still be in the works for more to be added.|$|R
50|$|Open-face Chinese poker is {{typically}} played as a two- to three-person game, {{though it can}} also be played with four people. Each player must use thirteen cards consisting of 3 cards in the front hand, 5 cards in the middle hand, and 5 cards in the back hand. Play is in clockwise order and starts with the player left of the dealer. Same as in standard Chinese <b>poker</b> the <b>back</b> hand must be stronger than or equal to the middle hand and the middle hand must be stronger than or equal to the front hand. The strength of the hand is determined by poker hand rankings. The middle and back can make the best five-card poker hand while the front hand can only make the best three-card hand. The best front hand is AAA. Straights, flushes, and straight flushes are not legal front hands.|$|R
50|$|Rast {{was born}} November 8, 1981 in Denver, Colorado {{where he lived}} until 1990 {{when he moved to}} Poway, California. There he {{attended}} Poway High School where he became the Class of 2000 valedictorian, earning his way to Stanford University. Brian always loved strategic games, and although being familiar with <b>poker</b> dating <b>back</b> to high school, Brian started playing weekly at the Stanford Poker Club (founded by his friend Mike Asmar) in the spring of 2003. That summer Brian went home to Poway determined to learn poker and make some money. He started buying and reading as many poker books as he could. He took a temp job and used that money to fund his poker habit, playing online and live at Barona Casino. Within five weeks, he had quit the temp job to focus full time on poker {{for the remainder of the}} summer. After making $20,000 his first summer playing, Brian was hooked and never looked back. By 2004, he had dropped out of school to pursue a career in poker.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Cardigan's wife Helen (Marjorie Reynolds) and his {{personal}} manager Gerald Hobson (Carleton G. Young) show up. She had gone to Reno to get a divorce, not really intending {{to go through with}} it, as she is still fond of her husband. Hobson also thinks it is a poor idea because Cardigan's film contract is expiring and the bad publicity would make it hard to get a new one. With her own plans ruined, Lenore confesses to Milner that she is really just a singer looking to hook a wealthy spouse. Milner shows his softer side when he helps unhappy newlywed Jennie Stone (Leslie Banning) by cheating at <b>poker</b> to win <b>back</b> her husband's gambling losses from investment broker Myron Winton (Jim Backus).|$|R
60|$|The game began, with Wade {{standing}} up, looking on. These {{boys did}} not know what a vast store of <b>poker</b> knowledge lay <b>back</b> of Wade's inscrutable eyes. As a boy he had learned the intricacies of poker in the country where it originated; and as a man he had played it with piles of yellow coins and guns on the table. His eagerness to look on here, as far as the cowboys were concerned, was mere pretense. In Belllounds's case, however, he had a profound interest. Rumors had drifted to him from time to time, since his advent at White Slides, regarding Belllounds's weakness for gambling. It might have been cowboy gossip. Wade held that {{there was nothing in the}} West as well calculated to test a boy, to prove his real character, as a game of poker.|$|R
50|$|After {{taking a}} small break from <b>poker,</b> Viktor came <b>back</b> strong. He {{deposited}} 10,000 SEK {{and decided to}} stick to heads-up no limit Hold'em. After just two weeks of play, he went from playing 1/2 SEK to 50/100 SEK. After Viktor turned 17, he deposited $2,500 on PartyPoker. He discussed his plans with a friend and off he went. Two days later, the friend asked him how much he had on PartyPoker, expecting him to say he had busted out or had at most $30,000. He was wrong. Blom had actually won over $200,000 in just two days of play. After another hot streak on iPoker, he managed to win over $1.7 million in two weeks. As time passed, however, Blom90 stopped getting action, {{so he had to}} find a new site with a new name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Schultz {{called for}} two cards. Another German was dealing, Schultz's friend at that. Lyte {{knew then that}} he was up against three of a kind. Now what did he do? What would you have done? Drawn three cards and held up the kings, of course. Not Lyte. He was playing optimism. He threw the kings away, held up the three little clubs, and drew two cards. He never looked at them. He looked across at Schultz to bet, and Schultz did bet, big. Since he himself held three aces {{he knew he had}} Lyte, because he played Lyte for threes, and, necessarily, they would have to be smaller threes. Poor Schultz! He was {{perfectly}} correct under the premises. His mistake was that he thought Lyte was playing <b>poker.</b> They bet <b>back</b> and forth for five minutes, until Schultz's certainty began to ooze out. And all the time Lyte had never looked at his two cards, and Schultz knew it. I could see Schultz think, and revive, and splurge with his bets again. But the strain was too much for him." ...|$|R
