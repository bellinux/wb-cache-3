Fifty participants completed the four week study within three experimental groups: automated feedback with monetary incentive (n= 20), automated feedback without incentive (n= 20), and control (n= 10). Results indicated little connection between self-reported and observed speeding behaviors, despite high correlation between self-reported and observed driving patterns overall. Associations were found between sensation-seeking personalities and speeding behavior. Few differences were found between sexes. Results highlight the relationship between personality and driving behavior, and suggest a closing gap between male and female driving behaviors...|$|R

While inappropriate antimicrobial consumption contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance, other complex political, social, economic and biomedical factors are equally important. Tackling the menace therefore should go beyond the conventional sensitization of members of the public and occasional press releases to include a multi-sectoral intervention involving the formation of various alliances and partnerships.

40|$|Influenza {{is a major}} {{respiratory}} pathogen, which exerts a huge {{human and}} economic <b>toll</b> on <b>society.</b> Influenza is a vaccine preventable disease, however, the vaccine strains must be annually updated due to the continuous antigenic changes in the virus. Inactivated influenza vaccines {{have been used for}} over 50 years and have an excellent safety record. Annual vaccination is therefore recommended for all individuals with serious medical conditions, like COPD, and protects the vaccinee against influenza illness and also against hospitalization and death. In COPD patients, influenza infection can lead to exacerbations resulting in reduced quality of life, hospitalization and death in the most severe cases. Although there is only limited literature on the use of influenza vaccination solely in COPD patients, there is clearly enough evidence to recommend annual vaccination in this group. This review will focus on influenza virus and prophylaxis with inactivated influenza vaccines in COPD patients and other “at risk” groups to reduce morbidity, save lives, and reduce health care costs...|$|R

Twenty five individuals with treatment-refractory MDD underwent a 4 -week course of dmPFC-rTMS. Before and after treatment, subjects received resting state functional MRI scans and assessments of depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Depresssion Rating Scale (HAMD 17). We found that higher baseline cortico-cortical connectivity (dmPFC-subgenual cingulate and subgenual cingulate to dorsolateral PFC) and lower cortico-thalamic, cortico-striatal and cortico-limbic connectivity were associated with better treatment outcomes. We also investigated how changes in connectivity over the course of treatment related to improvements in HAMD 17 scores.

Despite the growing awareness of the problem, the obesity epidemic, along with its asso-ciated complications, continues to ex-pand {{at an alarming rate}} (1). The current nomenclature used to measure an indi-viduals degree of obesity is BMI, which is calculated by dividing weight (in kilo-grams) by the square of height (in meters) (Table 1). Based on these criteria, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reports a doubling of the obese population (BMI 30 kg/m 2) in the period between 1976 – 1980 and 2001 – 2002 to reach an estimated number of 63 million obese people. Currently in the U. S., nearly two-thirds of adults are over-weight (BMI 25 kg/m 2), nearly one-third are considered obese (BMI 30 kg/ m 2), and 4. 7 % are extremely obese (BMI 40 kg/m 2) (2). The financial cost of obe-sity in the U. S. is estimated to be in excess of $ 100 billion/year (3). In addition to increased risk of diabetes and other co-morbid diseases, obese individuals may expect significant decreases in life expect-ancy (4) (Table 2).

Crises can take an enormous <b>toll</b> on <b>society.</b> Mexico's 1994 crisis cost almost 10 % of GDP. Chile's 1983 crisis was even worse, with the ¯nal cost amounting to a stunning 30 % of GDP. Moreover, the economy can experience a traumatic recovery process that in some cases lasts several years. The most common explanation of banking crises focuses on the anticipation of government bail out. This mechanism takes place when investors expect that the government will help them cover their losses in case they face a generalized adverse shock. The paper shows how an insurance scheme eliminates the externality generated by the above government bail out policy. As an example, the paper analyzes the case of liquidity risk, de¯ned as an unexpected cash withdrawal, and it presents a scheme to deal with this risk. This scheme works as an insurance where each bank pays a premium depending on the bank's risk. The scheme used in Argentina where the Central Bank charges to each bank a premium to insurance their liquidity risk, for an insurance which the Central Bank acquires in the international markets is an empirical example. In addition, a new procedure is developed to estimate the social cost of a bank crisis which is di®erent from the net transfer from the government to the banking sector and independent of the existence of the crisis. 1...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol {{and drug}} abuse take a large <b>toll</b> on <b>society</b> and {{affected}} individuals. However, very few effective treatments are currently available to treat alcohol and drug addiction. Basic and clinical research has begun to provide some insights into the underlying neurobiological systems involved in the addiction process. Several neurotransmitter pathways have been implicated and distinct reward neurocircuitry have been proposed – including the mesocorticolimbic (MCL) dopamine system and the extended amygdala. The serotonin (5 -HT) neurotransmitter system {{is of particular interest}} and multiple 5 -HT receptors are thought to play significant roles in alcohol and drug self-administration and the development of drug dependence. Among the 5 -HT receptors, the 5 -HT- 7 receptor is currently undergoing characterization as a potential target for the treatment of several psychiatric disorders. Although this receptor has received only limited research regarding addictive behaviors, aspects of its neuroanatomical, biochemical, physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral profiles suggest that it could {{play a key role in}} the addiction process. For instance, genomic studies in humans have suggested a link between variants in the gene encoding the 5 -HT- 7 receptor and alcoholism. Recent behavioral testing using high-affinity antagonists in mice and preliminary tests with alcohol-preferring rats suggest that this receptor could mediate alcohol consumption and/or reinforcement and play a role in seeking/craving behavior. Interest in the development of new and more selective pharmacological agents for this receptor will aid in examining the 5 -HT- 7 receptor as a novel target for treating addiction...|$|R
40|$|Pathological {{aggression}} {{and the inability}} to control aggressive impulses takes a tremendous <b>toll</b> on <b>society.</b> Yet aggression is a normal component of the innate behavior repertoire of most vertebrate animal species {{as well as of}} many invertebrates. Progress in understanding the etiology of disorders of aggressive behavior, whether genetic or environmental in nature, therefore requires an understanding of the brain circuitry that controls normal aggression. Efforts to understand this circuitry at the level of specific neuronal populations have been constrained by the limited resolution of classical methodologies, such as electrical stimulation and electrolytic lesion. The availability of new, genetically based tools for mapping and manipulating neural circuits at the level of specific, genetically defined neuronal subtypes provides an opportunity to investigate the functional organization of aggression circuitry with cellular resolution. However, these technologies are optimally applied in the mouse, where there has been surprisingly little traditional work on the functional neuroanatomy of aggression. Here we discuss recent, initial efforts to apply optogenetics and other state-of-the-art methods to the dissection of aggression circuitry in the mouse. We find, surprisingly, that neurons necessary and sufficient for inter-male aggression are located within the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, a structure traditionally associated with reproductive behavior. These neurons are intermingled with neurons activated during male–female mating, with approximately 20 % overlap between the populations. We discuss the significance of these findings with respect to neuroethological and neuroanatomical perspectives on the functional organization of innate behaviors and their potential implications for psychiatry...|$|R

That same year a magnitude 7. 6 earthquake in central Taiwan generated around 10, 000 landslides, killing hundreds, damming major rivers, and severely damaging towns and villages in valleys (Sitar, Bardet et al., 2001). Our research is motivated by the clear need for {{a better understanding of}} landslide processes and triggering mechanisms, and the hazard landslides pose to society. We are evaluating airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetry (AIRSAR and TOPSAR) for the rapid assessment of landslide disasters. Our work with TOPSAR data over the landslides generated by the 1999 Mw 7. 6 Chi Chi earthquake in central Taiwan indicates that polarimetric SAR might provide the means for rapid landslide disaster assessment in humid, seismically active mountain belts. The fully polarimetric L- and P-band SAR data were acquired about a year after the landslide event, capturing the two major slides, Tsaoling and Mt. Juo-feng-err, and numerous smaller slides. The initial focus of research is the L-band data for the Tsaoling area, a slide area of several km 2 about 40 km south of the epicenter.

Although researchers have identified a number of interventions that prevent or reduce youth antisocial behavior in the short term, only recently has evidence of long-term intervention effects become available. In addition, historical divisions between prevention and therapy have impeded cooperation among researchers and intervention providers alike, thereby limiting progress in addressing an important social concern. The present study used meta-analysis to (1) summarize evidence that youth interventions influence long-term patterns of antisocial behavior, (2) identify factors that moderate long-term outcomes of interventions, and (3) facilitate integration of findings across prevention and therapy outcome studies. Results from 66 intervention trials (i. e., 34 prevention trials, 32 therapy trials) indicated that many interventions delivered during childhood and adolescence can produce lasting reductions in antisocial behavior (mean d =. 31, 95 % confidence interval =. 23 -. 39) relative to control conditions. In addition, moderator analyses revealed specific characteristics of participants, interventions, and study methods that influenced the size of those reductions. The results of this meta-analysis have important implications for selecting effective interventions to address antisocial behavior during childhood and adolescence. Moreover, the findings imply that youth service systems (e. g., education, mental health, juvenile justice, child welfare) and researchers who evaluate intervention effects should increase integration of prevention and therapy practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Increasing our {{understanding}} of the factors affecting the severity of the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic in different regions of the world could lead to improved clinical practice and mitigation strategies for future influenza pandemics. Even though {{a number of studies have}} shed light into the risk factors associated with severe outcomes of 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza infections in different populations (e. g., [1 - 5]), analyses of the determinants of mortality risk spanning multiple pandemic waves and geographic regions are scarce. Between-country differences in the mortality burden of the 2009 pandemic could be linked to differences in influenza case management, underlying population health, or intrinsic differences in disease transmission [6]. Additional studies elucidating the determinants of disease severity globally are warranted to guide prevention efforts in future influenza pandemics. In Mexico, the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic was characterized by a three-wave pattern occurring in the spring, summer, and fall of 2009 with substantial geographical heterogeneity [7]. A recent study suggests that Mexico experienced high excess mortality burden during the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic relative to other countries [6]. However, an assessment of potential factors that contributed to the relatively high <b>pandemic</b> death <b>toll</b> in Mexico are lacking. Here, we fill this gap by analyzing a large series of laboratory-confirmed A/H 1 N 1 influenza cases, hospitalizations, and deaths monitored by the Mexican Social Security medical system during April 1 through December 31, 2009 in Mexico. In particular, we quantify the association between disease severity, hospital admission delays, and neuraminidase inhibitor use by demographic characteristics, pandemic wave, and geographic regions of Mexico. Methods We analyzed a large series of laboratory-confirmed pandemic A/H 1 N 1 influenza cases from a prospective surveillance system maintained by the Mexican Social Security system, April-December 2009. We considered a spectrum of disease severity encompassing outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths, and recorded demographic and geographic information on individual patients. We assessed the impact of neuraminidase inhibitor treatment and hospital admission delay (≤ > 2 days after disease onset) on the risk of death by multivariate logistic regression. Results Approximately 50 % of all A/H 1 N 1 -positive patients received antiviral medication during the Spring and Summer 2009 pandemic waves in Mexico while only 9 % of A/H 1 N 1 cases received antiviral medications during the fall wave (P[*] Conclusions Our findings underscore the potential impact of decreasing admission delays and increasing antiviral use to mitigate the mortality burden of future influenza pandemics. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} {{associated with the use of}} alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD) extract a significant health, social, and economic <b>toll</b> on American <b>society.</b> While the field of substance abuse prevention has made great strides during the past decade, two major challenges remain. First, the field has been disorganized and fragmented with respect to its research and prevention practices; that is, there are often separate ATOD prevention “specialists. ” Second, both the prevention researchers who test the efficacy of specific prevention strategies and the practitioners who implement prevention efforts often lack an overall perspective to guide strategy selection. To address these limitations, we present an ATOD causal model that seeks to identify those variables (Domains) that are theoretically salient and empirically connected across alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. For the researcher, the model demonstrates important commonalities, as well as gaps, in the literature. For the practitioner, the model is a means to recognize both the complexity of the community system that produces ATOD problems and the multiple intervention points that are possible within this system. Researchers and practitioners are thus challenged to work synergistically to find effective and cost-effective approaches to change or reduce ATOD use and associated problems...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{addiction}} takes {{a massive}} <b>toll</b> on <b>society.</b> Novel animal models {{are needed to}} test new treatments and understand the basic mechanisms underlying addiction. Rodent models have identified the neurocircuitry involved in addictive behavior and indicate that rodents possess {{some of the same}} neurobiologic mechanisms that mediate addiction in humans. Recent studies indicate that addiction is mechanistically and phylogenetically ancient and many mechanisms that underlie human addiction are also present in invertebrates. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has conserved neurobiologic systems with powerful molecular and genetic tools and a rapid rate of development that enables cost-effective translational discovery. Emerging evidence suggests that C. elegans is an excellent model to identify molecular mechanisms that mediate drug-induced behavior and potential targets for medications development for various addictive compounds. C. elegans emit many behaviors that can be easily quantitated including some that involve interactions with the environment. Ethanol (EtOH) is the best-studied drug-of-abuse in C. elegans and at least 50 different genes/targets have been identified as mediating EtOH's effects and polymorphisms in some orthologs in humans are associated with alcohol use disorders. C. elegans has also been shown to display dopamine and cholinergic system-dependent attraction to nicotine and demonstrate preference for cues previously associated with nicotine. Cocaine and methamphetamine have been found to produce dopamine-dependent reward-like behaviors in C. elegans. These behavioral tests in combination with genetic/molecular manipulations have led to the identification of dozens of target genes/systems in C. elegans that mediate drug effects. The one target/gene identified as essential for drug-induced behavioral responses across all drugs of abuse was the cat- 2 gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, which is consistent with the role of dopamine neurotransmission in human addiction. Overall, C. elegans can be used to model aspects of drug addiction and identify systems and molecular mechanisms that mediate drug effects. The findings are surprisingly consistent with analogous findings in higher-level organisms. Further, model refinement is warranted to improve model validity and increase utility for medications development...|$|R
40|$|Thank you, Chairman McDermott {{and members}} of the {{subcommittee}} for this opportunity to testify. I’d like to begin by thanking you for holding this hearing and addressing the important issue of how we measure poverty. My name is Nancy Cauthen, and I am the Deputy Director of the National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP). NCCP is a policy research organization at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. Our mission is to promote the health, economic security, and well-being of America’s most vulnerable children and families. NCCP uses research to identify problems and find solutions at the state and national levels. My testimony will address the following points: Child and family poverty exact a high <b>toll</b> on our <b>society,</b> so it is critical that we measure {{it in a way that}} allows us to best identify who needs assistance and what kinds of assistance. Although the National Academy of Sciences 1995 recommendations and subsequent refinements for updating the official poverty measure offer the most promising approach, the thresholds would still be too low to identify all those who need help. To improve child and family well-being, we must address not only income poverty but also material hardship. Family budgeting approaches provide an alternative way to understand what it takes for families to meet their basic needs and to achieve a reasonable standard of living...|$|R
