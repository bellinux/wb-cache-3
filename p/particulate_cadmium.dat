40|$|In {{an attempt}} to clarify the release of trace {{elements}} from the seasonal coastal sea ice, samples were periodically collected in a nearshore station inside the Gerlache Inlet (Terra Nova Bay, Western Ross Sea), during the summer 2000 / 01 and analysed for dissolved and <b>particulate</b> <b>cadmium,</b> copper, iron, manganese and lead, as well as salinity, suspended particulate matter, nutrients and phytoplankton pigments. In order to provide insight on the metal association with the particles included in the sea ice, the metal solid speciation was also investigated. Both vertical distributions within the ice cores and temporal variations at the seawater interface were studied, {{in an effort to}} fully characterize the system and correlation among the considered parameters. Concentrations and speciation patterns clearly indicate metal incorporation within the annual sea ice due to resuspension of sediments, followed by release of particulate metals during melting as a primary process affecting trace metal availability in the Antarctic coastal waters...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of {{dissolved}} and <b>particulate</b> <b>cadmium</b> {{were measured}} in {{the water of the}} Bahía Blanca Estuary, one of the most highly industrialised regions in Argentina. Simultaneously, Cd contents were also determined in samples of phytoplankton. Thus, the estuary was characterised from the viewpoint of Cd occurrence. Additionally, a microscale environment was selected within the estuary in order to carry out an ecotoxicological study. Thus, environmental parameters (i. e. temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a) were measured weekly at Puerto Cuatreros (in the inner estuary) during winter, when the phytoplankton bloom occurs; during the other seasons sampling was done twice a week. In addition, cells of the diatom Thalassiosira curviseriata - the dominant species in the phytoplankton bloom - were isolated and cultivated in the laboratory. The monoclonal cultures obtained were exposed to increasing concentrations of Cd under controlled environmental conditions and the growth rate inhibition was measured. As a preliminary conclusion it was found that Cd levels in the Bahía Blanca Estuary are significantly lower than the EC 50 value for T. curviseriata...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we report the {{distributions}} of total dissolvable cadmium and <b>particulate</b> <b>cadmium</b> from 27 stations in southern Moroccan coastal waters (22 - 30 °N) {{which is part of}} the North-West African upwelling system. These distributions were predominantly controlled by upwelling of the North Atlantic Central Waters (NACW) and uptake by primary production. Atmospheric inputs and phosphogypsum slurry inputs from the phosphate industry at Jorf Lasfar (33 °N), recently estimated as an important source of dissolved cadmium (240 tCd year− 1), are at best of minor importance for the studied waters. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms fractionating cadmium from phosphate. In the upper 30 m, the anomalies observed in terms of Cd:P ratios in both the particulate and total dissolvable fractions were related to an overall preferential uptake of phosphate. We show that the type of phytoplanktonic assemblage (diatoms vs dinoflagellates) is also a determinant of the fractionation intensity. In sub-surface waters (30 - 60 m), a clear preferential release of P (vs Cd) was observed indicating that remineralization in oxygen minimum zones is a key process in sequestering Cd.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{environmentally}} friendly, {{cost effective}} {{technology has been}} developed and demonstrated {{by a team of}} Naval Air Warfare Center and Lockheed Martin personnel to dispose of Shillelagh solid rocket motor propellants. The Shillelagh is a surface to surface anti-tank weapon approaching the end of its service life. The current demilitarization process employs open detonation, but the presence of lead stearate in the N 5 propellant grain motivated the need for the development of an environmentally friendly disposal method. Contained burning of the propellant followed by propellant exhaust processing was chosen as the disposal methodology. The developmental test bed, completed in February 1998, is inexpensive and transportable. Contained burning of Shillelagh propellants posed two technical hurdles: 1) removal of the sub micron lead and <b>cadmium</b> <b>particulate</b> generated during combustion, and 2) secondary combustion of the significant quantifies of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. A firing chamber with a stepped nozzle, air injection, and active ignition was developed to combust the carbon monoxide and hydrogen in real time. The hot gases and particulates from the combustion process are completely contained within a gas holder. The gases are subsequently cooled and routed through a treatment facility to remove the heavy metal particulate. Results indicate that the lead and <b>cadmium</b> <b>particulates</b> are removed below their respective detection limits (2 micro-g/cu m & 0. 2 micro-g/cu m) of the analytical procedures employed and that the carbon monoxide and hydrogen levels have been reduced well below the lower flammability limits. Organic concentrations, principally benzene, are I ppm or less. A semi-automated machine has been developed which can rapidly prepare Shillelagh missiles for the contained burn facility. This machine allows the contained burn technology to be more competitive with current open bum open detonation disposal rates...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium zinc {{telluride}} (CdZnTe) is {{a leading}} sensor material for spectroscopic X/-ray imaging {{in the fields of}} homeland security, medical imaging, industrial analysis and astrophysics. The metal-semiconductor interface formed during contact deposition is of fundamental importance to the spectroscopic performance of the detector and is primarily determined by the deposition method. A multi-technique analysis of the metalsemiconductor interface formed by sputter and electroless deposition of gold onto (111) aligned CdZnTe is presented. Focused ion beam (FIB) cross section imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling and current-voltage (IV) analysis have been applied to determine the structural, chemical and electronic properties of the gold contacts. In a novel approach, principal component analysis has been employed on the XPS depth profiles to extract detailed chemical state information from different depths within the profile. It was found that electroless deposition forms a complicated, graded interface comprised of tellurium oxide, gold/gold telluride <b>particulates,</b> and <b>cadmium</b> chloride. This compared with a sharp transition from surface gold to bulk CdZnTe observed for the interface formed by sputter deposition. The electronic (IV) response for the detector with electroless deposited contacts was symmetric, but was asymmetric for the detector with sputtered gold contacts. This is due to the electroless deposition degrading the difference between the Cd- and Te-faces of the CdZnTe (111) crystal, whilst these differences are maintained for the sputter deposited gold contacts. This work represents an important step in the optimisation of the metal-semiconductor interface which currently is a limiting factor in the development of high resolution CdZnTe detectors...|$|R
40|$|In {{the near}} {{pristine}} environment of a silled fjord {{on the west}} coast of Scotland samples were taken for the determination of dissolved and particulatetracemetals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Zn and Pb), together with nutrient and hydrographic data, during 19 surveys carried out over a year. An indication of the pristine nature of the environment are the low concentrations of dissolved silicon, phosphate and nitrate which are considerably lower than those of coastal waters which are subject to larger anthropogenic burdens. Distributions of dissolved Cu, Ni and Cd were found to broadly reflect conservative mixing of freshwater and seawater with both end members having similar concentrations. The concentration of dissolved Cu and Ni in seawater entering upper Loch Linnhe (Cu 0. 28 μg l− 1; Ni 0. 26 μg l− 1) was consistent with the 1 : 1 conservative mix of Irish Sea water and North Atlantic surface water predicted from radio-caesium tracer experiments (Mackay & Baxter, 1985). Atmospheric input of tracemetals to upper Loch Linnhe appeared to be a relatively minor term in the mass balance relative to fluvial inputs. Values of distribution coefficients Kd were similar to those previously reported for the coastal environment. Iron showed the strongest affinity for the suspended sediments; with particulate percentages of the total load usually greater than 80 %. Lead and Mn showed a similar strong affinity to the particle phase. For Cu, Ni and Zn the mass of the element in the dissolved phase was generally greater than that in the <b>particulate</b> fraction. <b>Cadmium,</b> was least associated with the particles, with typically greater than 90 % existing in the dissolved phase...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a field study, in {{productive}} waters off California, of the factors that control the <b>particulate</b> <b>cadmium</b> (Cd) : phosphorus (P) composition of natural assemblages of marine phytoplankton, the dominant vector of both elements to the deep ocean. Controlled shipboard incubation experiments (; 2 – 4 d) demonstrated that while manipulation of pCO 2 and dissolved zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) concentrations had little effect on the species composition or C: nitrogen (N) : P ratios of natural, diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblages, their Cd: P ratio was negatively correlated to each of these variables. The particulate Cd: P ratios of phytoplankton were two to five times higher for cells grown at low pCO 2 than for cells acclimated to growth at pCO 2 at or above atmospheric equilibrium values. Addition of Zn to incubations at five- to 20 -fold above background concentrations decreased Cd uptake and phytoplankton Cd: P ratios across pCO 2 and Mn treatments and suppressed short term Cd uptake rates by a factor of approximately two to four, compared to controls. A broad pattern of Mn suppression of Cd uptake was also evident in our incubations. We propose that natural variability in surface water pCO 2 and dissolved Zn and Mn, related to water mass history and biological drawdown, likely govern the degree of Cd uptake and, therefore, the evolution of the dissolved Cd: PO 4 ratio in recently upwelled, high-productivity surface waters. The vertical and horizontal distribution of cadmium (Cd...|$|E
40|$|Organic carbon, {{lead and}} cadmium {{contents}} of 20 sediments were determined and {{compared with the}} colony counts of anaerobic heterotrophic, anaerobic nitrogen fixing, chitinoclastic and cellulolytic bacteria. Organic carbon content, which {{is dependent on the}} sediment type, was positively correlated with lead and cadmium as well as with colony counts of all 4 physiological groups of bacteria. Even the sediments with the highest concentrations of 251. 7 ppm Pb and 3. 1 ppm Cd showed no reduction in their colony counts. From 2 different sediment sampIes with lead contents of 140 ppm and 21 ppm lead tolerance of the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria was investigated. However, no significant difference in lead tolerance of the 2 heterotrophic populations was found. Water from 6 stations was analysed for dissolved and particulate organic carbon, lead and cadmium. Dissolved lead concentrations were in the range of 0. 2 - 0. 5 µg/l and the particulate lead contents were between 0. 05 and 4. 3 µg/l. The concentrations of total lead for the stations off-shore were only one order of magnitude from the concentrations of the near-shore stations. The same phenomenon was observed for dissolved cadmium (0. 02 - 0. 25 µg/l) and <b>particulate</b> <b>cadmium</b> (0. 003 - 0. 15 µg/I) concentrations. Correlations between dissolved (1. 6 - 10. 8 mg/I) and particulate organic carbon (0. 25 - 1. 53 mg/I) with dissolved and particulate lead or cadmium were not found...|$|E
40|$|Biogeochemistry {{of metals}} in aquatic sediments is {{strongly}} influenced by bioturbation. To {{determine the effects of}} biological transport on cadmium distribution in freshwater sediments, a bioturbation model is explored that describes the conveyor-belt feeding of tubificid oligochaetes. A stepwise modelling strategy was adopted to constrain the many parameters of the model: (i) the tubificid transport model was first calibrated on four sets of microspheres (inert solid tracer) profiles to constrain tubificid transport; (ii) the resulting transport coefficients were subsequently applied to simulate the distribution of both <b>particulate</b> and dissolved <b>cadmium.</b> Firstly, these simulations provide quantitative insight into the mechanism of tubificid bioturbation. Values of transport coefficients compare very well with the literature, and based on this, a generic model of tubificid bioturbation is proposed. Secondly, the application of the model to cadmium dataset sheds a light on the behaviour of cadmium under tubificid bioturbation. Cadmium enters the sediment in two ways. In one pathway, cadmium enters the sediment in the dissolved phase, is rapidly absorbed onto solid particles, which are then rapidly transported to depth by the tubificids. In the other pathway, cadmium is adsorbed to particles in suspension in the overlying water, which then settle on the sediment surface, and are transported downwards by bioturbation. In a final step, we assessed the optimal model complexity for the present dataset. To this end, the two-phase conveyor-belt model was compared to two simplified versions. A solid phase-only conveyor-belt model also provides good results: the dissolved phase should not be explicitly incorporated because cadmium adsorption is fast and bioirrigation is weak. Yet, a solid phase-only biodiffusive model does not perform adequately, as it does not mechanistically capture the conveyor-belt transport at short time-scales. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe study {{reported}} here {{was carried out in}} the macrotidal estuary of Penzé (Brittany, Western Channel, France). Ten field stations along the freshwater–seawater mixing zone were sampled each month in order to examine the speciation of dissolved and <b>particulate</b> <b>cadmium.</b> Different biogeochemical parameters (suspended particulate matter, Chlorophyll-a, pH and dissolved organic carbon) were also measured. Levels of total dissolved and total particulate metal ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 46 nM and from 0. 4 to 2. 4 μg g− 1, respectively. Our data showed a non-conservative behaviour for cadmium as a result of desorption from particles. The rise in total dissolved cadmium in the salinity range 0 – 20 was about 0. 2 nM. Incidentally, a decrease of total particulate concentrations of about 0. 5 μg g− 1, which corresponds approximately to 0. 2 nM, was observed. The study of the various cadmium species led us to identify desorption of cadmium occurred from the iron/manganese oxide-associated fraction. This desorption process leads to the formation of labile complexes, i. e. chlorocomplexes in spring and summer. However, in winter and autumn, {{a large part of the}} dissolved fraction was constituted by organic complexes. These complexes can be formed from suspended particles desorption or could be a released from sediment. Analysis of flux indicated that most of the metal inputs to the estuary (usually more than 80 %) corresponded to organic cadmium. Spring and summer outputs were mainly constituted of chlorocomplexes whereas cadmium organic complexes were predominant in winter and autumn output fluxes...|$|E
40|$|Routine {{measurements}} of river discharge and total suspended sediment concentration (TSS) are combined with regular analyses for particulate and dissolved cadmium {{to produce a}} box model {{that allows us to}} propose a cad-mium mass balance for the Lot-Garonne man-influenced river system (8400 km 2). Nearly half the cadmium in the Garonne river is supplied by the tributary Lot river. Cadmium input onto the Lot river comprises wet deposition from the atmosphere, molecular diffusion at the sediment-water interface, surface-water runoff and discharge from the leaching of waste at a zinc refining plant. Approximately 85 % of the cadmium in the Lot river is derived from anthropogenic origin. Cadmium in the industrial discharge is 80 % dissolved and 20 % in the particulate phase (4. 2 and 1. 1 t yr 1, respectively). Total inputs are estimated at 4. 81 t yr 1 and 1. 54 t yr 1 for the dissolved cadmium and for the particulate phase, respectively. Budgeting estimates an output onto the Garonne river of 0. 54 t yr 1 for the dissolved cadmium (about 8 %) and 6. 13 t yr 1 for the <b>particulate</b> <b>cadmium</b> (about 92 %) indicating that downstream sediment-associated cadmium fluxes are enhanced by the 4. 27 t yr 1 removed from solution and the 0. 32 t yr 1 remobilized by the erosion of sediment blanketing the Lot river bed. These figures are found to be comparable with those generated by a dilution model which suggests that 97 % of dissolved cadmium is taken up by the particulate phase over 0. 5 km downstream from the primary anthropogenic source...|$|E
