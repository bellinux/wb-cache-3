5|$|Alligator and {{crocodile}} farming began {{because of}} demand for their hides, but now nearly {{all parts of the}} animal are <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> The side and belly skin make the best leather, the meat is eaten, the gall bladders are valued in East Asia, and the heads are sometimes made into ornaments. In traditional Chinese medicine, alligator meat is said to cure the common cold and prevent cancer, while various internal organs are believed to have medicinal properties.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E
5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms, and have been <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases, and as such are the target of hygiene measures.|$|E
5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.|$|E

5|$|Since {{microbes}} {{were not}} known until the Early Modern period, {{they appear in}} earlier literature indirectly, through descriptions of baking and brewing. Only with {{the invention of the}} microscope, as used by Robert Hooke in his 1665 book Micrographia, and by Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s, the germ theory of disease, and progress in microbiology in the 19th century were microbes observed directly, identified as living organisms, and <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> on a scientific basis. The same knowledge also allowed microbes to appear explicitly in literature and the arts.|$|E
5|$|The KJRM {{inherited}} four river monitors {{from the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, each {{from a different}} class. In April 1941, one was sunk, and the rest were scuttled. One of the scuttled ships was raised and scrapped. The other two were raised and <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and were lost late in the war, with one being raised {{after the war and}} put into service until 1962.|$|E
5|$|Toads {{have a more}} {{sinister}} reputation. It was believed in European folklore that they were associated with witches as their familiar spirits and had magical powers.

50|$|Mews {{lost their}} equestrian {{function}} in the early 20th century when motor cars were introduced. At the same time, after World War I and especially after World War II, {{the number of people}} who could afford to live in the type of houses which had a mews attached fell sharply. One place where a mews may still be found <b>put</b> <b>to</b> equestrian <b>use</b> is Bathurst Mews in Westminster, near Hyde Park, London, where several private horses are kept. Nearby, the mews' stables have been <b>put</b> <b>to</b> commercial <b>use.</b> Some mews were demolished or <b>put</b> <b>to</b> commercial <b>use,</b> but the majority were converted into homes.|$|R
5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured.|$|E
5|$|Where {{he did not}} {{overwrite}} Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the Circus Maximus was redeveloped so {{that its}} total seating capacity was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on the Via Appia. Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (equites singulares) were disbanded. The tombstones of the Imperial Horse Guard were ground up and <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in a basilica on the Via Labicana. On November 9, 312AD, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base of the Imperial Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the Lateran Basilica. The Legio II Parthica was removed from Alba (Albano Laziale), and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game demo {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E

5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E
