5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. Bitterns tend to be shorter-necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a curve.|$|E
5|$|For females, {{short hair}} must be neat {{and may not}} extend past {{the bottom of the}} collar, while long hair must be <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a tight bun, and may be {{contained}} by a hairnet. Very long hair may be braided or worn as a bun. Hair elastics, bobby pins and hairnets should be the same colour as the cadet's hair. When braided the cadets hair may be worn in either double or single French braids and in both cases the braids must fall behind the shoulders and not extend past the bottom of the armpit.|$|E
5|$|The first {{company of}} the 7th Parachute Battalion, {{commanded}} by Major Nigel Taylor, arrived at the bridges. Howard directed them to defensive positions west of the canal in Bénouville and Le Port. When Pine-Coffin arrived at the bridges, he was briefed by Howard, and crossed into Bénouville and set up his headquarters beside the church. Pine-Coffin had about 200 men in his three companies. He positioned 'A' and 'C' Companies in Bénouville facing south towards Caen and 'B' Company in Le Port facing Ouistreham. 'D' Company was now <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the area between the two bridges and held in reserve. A further sweep of the trenches and bunkers was conducted, and resulted in the capture {{of a number of}} Germans.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional {{scheduled}} bus services use general traffic lanes, {{which can}} be slow due to traffic congestion, and the speed of bus services is further reduced by the time spent at bus stops for passengers to board the vehicle, pay the fare, and to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> traffic.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} segment, Williams wanted {{to address the}} [...] "illusion of escape", by moving to the natural, verdant greens of the Filipino jungle, only to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a machine-filled factory, which he {{found to be a}} [...] "very strange" [...] and [...] "very digital place".|$|R

25|$|MacDonald {{came to an}} {{understanding}} with Graz's Austrian commander. According to the terms, the Austrians evacuated Graz and <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the citadel, allowing the French to occupy the city. If the French wished to attack the fortress, they would do so from outside the city. On the city side of the fortress, a truce prevailed.|$|E
25|$|At 10:15 on 2 May Companies E and G 2/3 Marines {{assaulted}} Hill 881N {{from the}} south and east. Company G encountered a PAVN position and pulled back to allow for artillery support. Company E almost reached the summit of the hill when it was hit by an intense rainstorm and the Battalion was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> night defensive positions.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1825, Larkins, {{which had}} sailed from Calcutta for England, {{had to return}} as she was leaky. The {{expectation}} was {{that she would have}} to go into dock. After Larkins was pulled out of the dock and had taken on part of her cargo, it was discovered that she was still taking on water. She therefore was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the dock to be coppered and sheathed.|$|E
50|$|Alshain {{set sail}} for Guam on 26 January 1950. She arrived back at San Diego on 27 March. After {{operations}} along the California coast, the cargo ship shaped {{a course for}} Japan on 26 April. She visited Yokosuka and Yokohama in May and touched at Naha, Okinawa, and Guam before <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> port at San Francisco on 26 June.|$|R
50|$|In April the 1st Army under Géza Lakatos {{was sent}} to the front in East Galicia, in order to prevent the Soviets seizing the Carpathian passes. With the help of a newly {{established}} line of defence it was able to hold here until July 1944, before it had to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Carpathians {{in the face of the}} Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive.|$|R
50|$|As events developed, {{no formal}} order to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the fortifications ever emerged above corps level. Beginning {{the night of}} 16 March, commanders facing the U.S. XV Corps simply did the obvious, {{ordering}} their units to seek refuge in the Siegfried Line whenever American pressure grew so great that withdrawal or annihilation became the only alternatives. The next day, commanders facing the U.S. VI Corps adopted the same procedure.|$|R
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Packers regained the lead as Favre {{completed}} a 13-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings {{for the only}} score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Kansas City regained the lead with QB Damon Huard completing a 30-yard TD pass to Johnson. Green Bay replied with Crosby kicking a 32-yard field goal, yet the Chiefs answered with Huard completing a 17-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez (with RB Priest Holmes getting the 2-point conversion run). The Packers <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the lead as Favre and Jennings hooked up again on a 60-yard TD pass. Afterwards, Crosby made a 45-yard field goal, and CB Charles Woodson returned an interception 46yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|With just {{eighteen}} {{days until}} the fleet (large enough {{to wipe out the}} liberation force even if the fleet were a quarter its current size) arrives, Gaunt is given one last chance to redeem himself by the arrogant and pompous Lord-General Lugo: recover the Saint's remains and holy relics from the Shrinehold in the Sacred Hills for evacuation. The Ghosts are appointed as the honour guard of these relics, and together with units from the Pardus armoured regiments they form a convoy and journey into the mountains. However, much of Sin's Infardi horde has <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the hills; leaving the Ghosts with no choice but to fight the heretics {{while at the same time}} fighting the elements and navigating the unfamiliar terrain.|$|E
25|$|Later that afternoon, the company's 2nd Platoon was ambushed {{by a large}} NVA unit, {{suffering}} heavy casualties, while conducting reconnaissance near Nui Yon Hill. As airstrikes were attacking nearby NVA, McCloughan {{entered a}} trench and saw two unarmed American soldiers huddling near a bush. He handed his gun to another soldier, jumped over the trench's berm, and ran {{close to the ground}} towards the two soldiers, whom he <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the trench despite being hit with shrapnel from the explosion of a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). Ignoring an order to remain in the trench, he rescued wounded soldiers from the kill zone four more times during a NVA assault. Bleeding heavily, McCloughan treated the wounded and prepared them for evacuation, refusing evacuation even though the NVA heavily outnumbered the American troops.|$|E
50|$|After four hours, the Confederate attack lost momentum, {{and their}} forces began to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Fort Stedman. An {{overwhelming}} Union counterattack eventually recaptured the fort. The 29th {{took part in}} the counterattack, re-capturing Battery 11. Color-bearer Conrad Homan of the 29th was the first to re-enter Battery 11 and was later awarded the Medal of Honor. The regiment lost 10 killed and an unknown number of captured in this engagement.|$|R
50|$|Benefits include {{preventing}} buses {{from being}} delayed {{by having to}} <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> traffic, reducing risk of traffic collisions, reducing pedestrian exposure in crosswalks (if provided at the same location), reducing sidewalk congestion, providing space for bus patron amenities including bus shelters, and traffic calming. The protrusion also facilitates easier full length alignment of a bus entrance with a raised kerb stop, especially to allow level boarding {{in the case of}} low-floor buses.|$|R
50|$|P. {{crucifer}} inhabits {{the sandy}} bottoms of the Caribbean Sea {{and can be}} found across the West Indies. The main part (column) of the anemone is usually buried in the sand, anchored to a rock below the surface, so that when disturbed the anemone can <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the substrate. Documented as a species often associated with coral reefs and rocky ledges, P. crucifer is able to withdraw into crevices and holes if agitated.|$|R
25|$|While {{historian}} Francis Loraine Petre {{notes that}} Pletz was the rear guard commander, he credits Yorck with the tactical {{control of the}} battle. Under Yorck's direction were three fusilier battalions, six jäger companies, and 20 squadrons of hussars. General of Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary arrived with a task force consisting of the 1st Hussar and 7th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments, giving the French a total of eight cavalry regiments. Savary detected Oswald's rear guard at Sommerstorf northwest of Waren and prepared to attack, but Bernadotte recalled him to Jabel. The two sides exchanged artillery fire at Jabel for an hour before Yorck <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the woods toward Nossentin. Spearheaded by the 9th Light Infantry Regiment of General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Etang's division, the French pressed ahead into the woods to be met by vigorous resistance from the Prussian jägers and fusiliers.|$|E
25|$|After the gruelling combat, the {{battalion}} was {{pulled out of}} the line {{along with the rest of}} the 1st Infantry Division to refit and reconstitute. However, it was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the vicinity of Hergenrath, Belgium, directly in the path of the attacking Germans when they launched their Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) on 16 December. Here, the 745th had a rare encounter with concentrated German armor supported with troops and showed their own combat experience in helping the 1st Infantry Division hold the northern shoulder of the Bulge and prevent the Germans from exploiting the road network behind them. Both the division and the tank battalion stayed in the line until the first week of February 1945 and restored the front to near its original position. The battalion finally received a much needed three-day rest on 10 February, before preparing for the final assault into Germany.|$|E
25|$|Lehr {{was still}} moving forward towards the {{demarcation}} line between German and Soviet-owned Poland on 22 June 1941 when Operation Barbarossa began and it {{missed the first}} few days of the campaign. By the beginning of July it was under the command of the 9th Army of Army Group Center, where it participated in the later stages of the Battle of Białystok–Minsk. By 19 July it was part of the northern wing encircling the Smolensk Pocket, but it quickly moved north-east to rebuff relief efforts by the Soviet 16th and 30th Armies of the Western Front. It was pulled off the front line into tactical reserve on 7 August 1941 and remained there for ten days until renewed Soviet attacks caused it to send it back into combat. It was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> reserve on 26 August and remained there until the opening stages of Operation Typhoon. It stayed in reserve until 6 October when it was released to follow 1st Panzer Division's in its drive to Kalinin. The Soviets forced the Germans to retreat from Kalinin after a month of heavy fighting and Lehr was placed in reserve on 12 November, where it remained until the Soviet Winter Counter-Offensive of 5 December forced the Germans to retreat en masse.|$|E
50|$|The main {{drawback}} is for cyclists. The narrowing {{of the road}} can create danger for cyclists if the design does not take their needs into account. Where more than one lane exists in one direction, modelling has shown {{that there is no}} additional delay overall for following drivers, since the buses have shorter dwell times (there is less time spent <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> traffic) and since following vehicles may use the second lane for passing.|$|R

500|$|Prior to the attack, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) dropped {{leaflets}} {{telling the}} Jordanian army that Israel {{had no intention}} to hurt them, {{and that they should}} not intervene; the leaflets went unheeded. Time magazine reported the fedayeen had been warned in advance by Egyptian intelligence, and most of the 2,000 Arab commandos who used Karameh as a training base had <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the surrounding hills to snipe at the Israelis. Some 200 guerrillas stayed inside to defend the town.

500|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or [...] "cow bird" [...] is seen amongst flocks of cattle, for instance in ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even {{the head of the}} animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a curve.|$|E

50|$|A plasmodiocarp is {{a special}} form of fruit bodies of slime moulds. It is {{produced}} if the plasmodium concentrates during the fructification and <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the venetion of the plasmodium, from which the fruit body is created. The fruit body traces {{the process of the}} venetion, whereby the structure of its subsurface becomes plainly strand-shaped, branched, net or ring-shaped. The production of plasmodiocarps can be generic, or can be also caused by the deranged development of sporocarps or aethalia.|$|R
500|$|The gut of a starfish {{occupies}} most of {{the disc}} and extends into the arms. The mouth {{is located in the}} centre of the oral surface, where it is surrounded by a tough [...] membrane and closed with a sphincter. The mouth opens through a short oesophagus into a stomach divided by a constriction into a larger, [...] cardiac portion and a smaller pyloric portion. The cardiac stomach is glandular and pouched, and is supported by ligaments attached to ossicles in the arms so it can be <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> position after it has been everted. The pyloric stomach has two extensions into each arm: the pyloric caeca. These are elongated, branched hollow tubes that are lined by a series of glands, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. A short intestine and rectum run from the pyloric stomach to open at a small anus at the apex of the aboral surface of the disc.|$|E
500|$|A second Portal patch {{released}} on March 3 altered the game's ending sequence to show Chell being <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the Aperture facility.

During the following week, Gabe Newell's speech accepting the Pioneer Award at the Game Developers Conference 2010 ended with a fake blue screen of death appearing on a screen behind him with a message purported to be from GLaDOS which hinted of further Portal 2 news at the upcoming E3 2010. Two weeks before the E3, game journalists received a cryptic e-mail, worded as a press release from Aperture Science, hinting that the presentation on Portal 2 would be replaced with [...] "a surprise" [...] jointly hosted by Aperture Science and Valve.

500|$|... 27th Brigade was {{replaced}} by the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade and Brigadier George Taylor took over command of the new formation on 26 April. With the Chinese offensive losing momentum, the new Commonwealth formation was subsequently <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> IX Corps reserve to the southwest of Kapyong, near the junction of the Pukhan and Chojon rivers. 3 RAR was transferred to 28th Brigade, while the 1st Battalion, The King's Own Scottish Borderers and the 1st Battalion, The King's Shropshire Light Infantry replaced the Argylls and Middlesex regiments. Later, the Patricias were transferred to the newly arrived 25th Canadian Brigade on 27 May. After protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced by the various Commonwealth contingents. The 1st Commonwealth Division was formed on 28 July 1951, with the division including the 25th Canadian, 28th British Commonwealth and 29th British Infantry Brigades under the command of Major General James Cassels, and was part of US I Corps. For many of the Australians Kapyong was to be their last major battle before completing their period of duty and being replaced, having endured much hard fighting, appalling weather and the chaos and confusion of a campaign that had ranged up and {{down the length of the}} Korean Peninsula. Most had served in the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) during the Second World War and this combat experience had proven vital. Regardless, casualties had been heavy, and since the battalion's arrival from Japan in September 1950 the Australians had lost 87 killed, 291 wounded and five captured.|$|E
