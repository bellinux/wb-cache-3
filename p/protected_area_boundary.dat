This paper uses temporal MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field (MODIS-VCF) to monitor the tree cover change in the Indian region over a period of 6  years (2000 – 2005). Pixel-based linear regression model is developed to identify rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level. The regression parameters viz., slope, offset and variance are used to identify threshold between forest and non-forest classes. The classification algorithm resulted into change area, no change area, positive change and negative changes. MODIS-VCF raw product of 2005 was validated using the field data and showed a coefficient of determination (R 2  =  0. 85) between percent tree cover and individual plot wise canopy cover information. The results were overlaid with UNEP <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundary.</b> On a long-term basis, the forest cover change was monitored using medium spatial resolution (Landsat and IRS) satellite data to identify the rate of deforestation and fragmentation at landscape level.

This approach reduces potential and real conflicts among various stakeholders potentially creating win–win solutions for all. It is particularly applicable in areas where insufficient land for agriculture and settlements is resulting in high rates of conversion of natural forest and grasslands. We quantified and mapped multiple ecosystem services, including habitat provision {{as a proxy for}} biodiversity, carbon storage and sequestration, and water balance and supply in the Sarvelat and Javaherdasht region of the globally-significant Hyrcanian (Caspian) forests in northern Iran using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs tool. This region is experiencing a rapidly increasing rate of forest conversion and as a result, the protected area located within the study landscape is threatened by human encroachment. Plausible future landscapes were modeled under three scenarios: (i) business as usual; (ii) protection-based zoning which reflects an expansion of the <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundary</b> to prevent land use changes; and (iii) collaborative zoning through redefining the protection boundary simultaneously with an adjustment to meet local stakeholders’ objective of expansion of anthropogenic cover. The results showed that the collaborative zoning scenario would best contribute to effective policy because it presents a more rational spatial configuration of the landscape maintaining the provision of ecosystem services. This scenario may lead to reduced environmental impacts while achieving less conflict between the government and local communities.

Understanding how land-use change may impact future water use and where existing protected areas may {{be threatened by}} land-use conversion will be important if effective, sustainable management approaches are to be implemented. We used a state-and-transition simulation modeling (STSM) framework to simulate spatially-explicit (1 km 2) historical (1992 ‒ 2010) and future (2011 ‒ 2060) land-use change for 52 California counties within Mediterranean California ecoregions. Historical land use and land cover (LULC) change estimates were derived from the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program dataset and attributed with county-level agricultural water-use data from the California Department of Water Resources. Five future alternative land-use scenarios were developed and modeled using the historical land-use change estimates and land-use projections based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Emission Scenarios A 2 and B 1 scenarios. Spatial land-use transition outputs across scenarios were combined to reveal scenario agreement and a land conversion threat index was developed to evaluate vulnerability of existing protected areas to proximal land conversion. By 2060, highest LULC conversion threats were projected to impact nearly 10, 500 km 2 of land area within 10 km of a <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundary</b> and over 18, 000 km 2 of land area within essential habitat connectivity areas. Agricultural water use declined across all scenarios perpetuating historical drought-related land use from 2008 ‒ 2010 and trends of annual cropland conversion into perennial woody crops. STSM is useful in analyzing land-use related impacts on water resource use as well as potential threats to existing protected land.

40|$|Large {{carnivores}} {{are particularly}} susceptible to negative anthropogenic effects. As human populations continue to encroach on wildlife habitats, protected areas may {{become increasingly important}} for large carnivore conservation. The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) occurs at low densities and ranges over wide areas where anthropogenic activities account for {{a large proportion of}} mortalities. However, conserving wild dogs within protected areas presents several challenges that conservation managers need to address. In particular, wild dog populations occurring within the relative safety of protected areas are prone to sources of mortality associated with edge effects, intra- and interspecific competition, while fragmentation threatens population viability. Land use along protected area boundaries is often characterised by an abrupt transition. Within the boundaries carnivores are protected and valued, but outside are regarded as a threat to humans their domestic animals, leading to their persecution. In addition, these transitional zones are associated with other threats such as accidental deaths inflicted by motor vehicles, contraction of disease from domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), and wire snares set by bush meat hunters. Edge effects are a major problem in the conservation of wild dogs, yet limiting their ranging behaviour poses a seemingly insurmountable challenge. However, wild dogs are territorial and the scent marks of neighbouring packs directly influence their ranging behaviour as neighbouring packs are avoided since encounters can be potentially fatal. We found that targeted deployments of translocated foreign scent marks influenced the ranging behaviour of an otherwise free-ranging wild dog pack. When exploring unfamiliar areas near or outside the <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundary,</b> exposure to foreign scent marks resulted in the pack covering significantly greater distances and moving in the direction of their frequented range inside the protected area. Unlike wire fences, scent marks present a biologically relevant cue which, once detected, elicits a behavioural response. With further experimentation and a greater understanding of wild dog territoriality operates, this technique has the potential to reduce wild dog ranging into conflict-prone landscapes alongside wildlife reserves. For the scent mark technique to be an effective management tool, wild dog packs should ideally be repelled by the presence of foreign scent marks. Scent marks are used to communicate territorial boundaries yet all studies of wild dog territoriality have to date reported that the degree of territorial overlap between neighbouring packs varies hugely. Attempting to maximize the effectiveness of managing wild dog ranging behaviour using foreign scent marks would necessitate an understanding of why, in certain instances, wild dog territorial boundaries are apparently ignored resulting in extensive transgression. We found that inter-pack relatedness was extremely important; unrelated packs had very low levels of overlap and these were restricted to the peripheral parts of territories. In contrast, related dyads overlap significantly more and even intensively utilized parts of the range, where the probability of encountering a neighbouring pack is far higher, were found to overlap. Pack size had little effect between related neighbours, but in unrelated dyads there was a tendency for larger packs to overlap more onto the territories of smaller packs. While Intraspecific competition can result in mortality, all available evidence suggests that aggression is greatly reduced between related packs. Establishing a territory alongside close relatives may therefore extend exclusive fitness benefits from the intra-pack to inter-pack level. The natural spacing system thus has the potential to affect the number of packs a given protected area can accommodate, as well as well as survival parameters through variations in the intensity of intraspecific competition. The findings are therefore important for the management of the species, specifically in intensively managed populations. For the purposes of using translocated scent marks to create a biological barrier, it is therefore important to use foreign scent marks from unrelated individuals as scent marks from related packs may not illicit the desired behavioural response. The effects of interspecific competition on wild dog populations are, however, usually far greater than intraspecific competition. Lions (Panthera leo) and, to a lesser degree, spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) can have major effects on wild dog populations and in combination account for more than 50 % of wild dog deaths. As the dominant carnivore, lion densities are positively correlated with prey availability. Spatial variations in lion densities are therefore associated with specific landscape types and low lion density habitats are exploited by wild dogs, facilitating coexistence. Lions do not prefer hilly, mountainous and other forms of rugged terrain. With their decreased risk of lion encounter, we found than wild dogs actively selected rugged terrain when denning. Since wild dogs only reproduce once per year, the success of the annual event has a large influence on pack and population viability. Den site selection thus forms a primary defense strategy against predation. Wild dogs are also vulnerable to interspecific competition outside of the denning period when ranging widely across their territory. Habitat selection should therefore attempt to minimize the probability of risky encounters with lions and hyenas. As case in point is the reported local extinction of a studied population of wild dogs in the Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania. Both disease and interspecific competition were identified as contributing factors, yet the ultimate cause of the extinction has never been identified. Over a twenty-five year period the population declined before finally disappearing entirely. Although not well documented, the wild dog population did persist in the eastern parts of the ecosystem. Since the habitat characteristics are very different in these parts, we hypothesized that certain ecological features affected the distribution and availability of competition refuges. Given the dramatic increase in lion and spotted hyena populations during the wild dog population decline, competition refuges may have become increasing important to limit costly interspecific competition. A species distribution model was derived using occurrence records from the extant population within the ecosystem. We then used global positioning system (GPS) collar data from two wild dog packs recently reintroduced into SNP and overlaid the data onto the habitat suitability model. Habitat intensively utilized by wild dogs corresponded closely to habitat predicted as highly suitable, which was characteristically rugged. An analysis of movement data revealed that this habitat acted as competition refuges, the distribution of which was very limited within the SNP. However, habitat with an ability to provide wild dogs with respite from competition was abundant in the eastern parts of the ecosystem, where the population has managed to persist. The reported local extinction appears therefore to have instead been a range contraction; as lion and hyena populations increased, wild dogs were only able to survive in areas where they were not permanently exposed to high levels of competition. Topographic heterogeneity, and in particularly patches of rugged terrain, are therefore important should wild dogs successfully coexist in the presence of lion and hyena populations. While edge effects, intraspecific and interspecific competition are associated with protected areas and their immediate surroundings, many populations of wild dogs are located in geographically isolated populations. Population viability is greatly reduced in such instances. Wild dogs are, however, capable of dispersing long distances in the search of mates. In South Africa, the majority of wild dog populations occur in relatively small and geographically isolated populations. Most of these reserves have reached carrying capacity and {{a large proportion of the}} country’s total population occurs outside protected areas. We identified five priority conservation areas where habitat was relatively intact and where wild dogs had been sighted on numerous occasions, inferring some degree of connectivity to a source population. We assessed connectivity using different methodologies and using a dataset of occurrence records for both dispersing and resident packs of wild dogs. Despite the use of potentially subjective cost layer, current flow analysis provided the best connectivity analysis with greater potential to be incorporated into management plans. Our study shows that using habitat selection data from animals in resident populations, connectivity may be underestimated as dispersing individuals are often less habitat specific.

30|$|Such {{opportunities}} {{abound in}} and near conservation landscapes throughout East Africa. In Kenya, {{as in much}} of sub-Saharan Africa, large <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> were established {{over the last century}} in regions previously used by pastoralists as grazing areas (Butt et al. 2009), first as game reserves and then as national parks. More recently, following worldwide conservation shifts, there has been a substantial increase in conservation efforts beyond <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundaries</b> where communities reside, work, and use resources (Bray and Velázquez 2009; King 2009). Given high incidences of wildlife on private land (Kabiri 2010), conservationists have placed special emphasis on rangelands in East Africa outside of <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> traditionally utilized by pastoralists for grazing (Young et al. 2005; Wambuguh 2007). Such conservation efforts frequently take the form of community-based conservation programmes, conservancies, or wildlife sanctuaries in communal lands (Goldman 2003; Igoe and Croucher 2007; Greiner 2012; Noe and Kangalawe 2015), often in or near pastoral group ranches, with many pastoralists seeking opportunities for income generation.

While scholars and practitioners have long contended that pastoralism can be compatible with wildlife, landowners and land users of both private and community group ranches need to be meaningfully incorporated into planning and management for the efforts to be sustainable. Pastoralists’ knowledge and expertise can be instrumental in rangeland management goals but only through a careful and deliberate collective vision.|$|R

Within these forests, <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> are the principle defense against forest loss and species extinctions.

Governments around the world have established national parks and wildlife reserves to help protect biodiversity, but there are few studies on the long-term consequences of this strategy. We use Kenya as a case study to investigate species richness and other attributes of mammal communities in 6 <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> over the past century. Museum records from African expeditions that comprehensively sampled mammals from these same areas in the early 1900 ’s provide a baseline for evaluating changes in species richness and community structure over time. We compare species lists assembled from archived specimens (1896 – 1950) to those of corresponding modern <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> (1950 – 2013). Species richness in Kenya was stable or increased at 5 out of 6 sites from historical to modern times. Beta-diversity, in contrast, decreased across all sites. Potential biases such as variable historical vs. modern collection effort and detection of small-bodied, rare, and low-visibility species do not account for the observed results. We attribute the pattern of decreased beta diversity primarily to increased site occupancy by common species across all body size classes. Despite a decrease in land area available to wildlife, our data do not show the extinctions predicted by species-area relationships. Moreover, the results indicate that species-area curves based solely on <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> could underestimate diversity because they do not account for mammal species whose ranges extend beyond <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundaries.</b> We conclude that the 6 protecte...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire to}} see free ranging large {{carnivores}} in their natural habitat is a driver of tourism in <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> around the globe. However, large carnivores are wide-ranging and subject to human-caused mortality outside <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The impact of harvest (trapping or hunting) on wildlife viewing opportunities {{has been the subject}} of intense debate and speculation, but quantitative analyses have been lacking. We examined the effect of legal harvest of wolves (Canis lupus) along the boundaries of two North American National Parks, Denali (DNPP) and Yellowstone (YNP), on wolf viewing opportunities within the parks during peak tourist season. We used data on wolf sightings, pack sizes, den site locations, and harvest adjacent to DNPP from 1997 - 2013 and YNP from 2008 - 2013 to evaluate the relationship between harvest and wolf viewing opportunities. Although sightings were largely driven by wolf population size and proximity of den sites to roads, sightings in both parks were significantly reduced by harvest. Sightings in YNP increased by 45 % following years with no harvest of a wolf from a pack, and sightings in DNPP were more than twice as likely during a period with a harvest buffer zone than in years without the buffer. These findings show that harvest of wolves adjacent to <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> can reduce sightings within those areas despite minimal impacts on the size of protected wolf populations. Consumptive use of carnivores adjacent to <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> may therefore reduce their potential for non-consumptive use, and these tradeoffs should be considered when developing regional wildlife management policies...|$|R
50|$|The Boin Tano Forest Reserve {{is located}} only five degrees {{north of the}} Equator and around 50 km north of the Gulf of Guinea in Atlantic Ocean, {{therefore}} giving it a warm and humid climate. Grasslands mixed with shrublands and forests dominate the reserve. Hundreds of different species live within this <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> and its <b>boundaries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Bardiya National Park (बर्दिया राष्ट्रिय निकुञ्ज; [...] ), also spelled Bardia, is a <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> in Nepal {{that was}} {{established}} in 1988 as Royal Bardia National Park. Covering an area of 968 km2 {{it is the largest}} and most undisturbed national park in Nepal's Terai, adjoining the eastern bank of the Karnali River and bisected by the Babai River in the Bardiya District. Its northern limits are demarcated by the crest of the Siwalik Hills. The Nepalgunj-Surkhet highway partly forms the southern boundary, but seriously disrupts the <b>protected</b> <b>area.</b> Natural <b>boundaries</b> to human settlements are formed in the west by the Geruwa, a branch of the Karnali River, and in the southeast by the Babai River.|$|R
30|$|It {{is within}} this context we argue that change in the {{political}} (e.g. <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> <b>boundaries),</b> social (e.g. loosening of reciprocal relationships) and ecological (e.g. fluctuations in rainfall timing and intensity) system may have severed the linkage between ecosystem feedback and applied behavioural responses by herders on the land. We have organized the following Results and Discussion with three objectives in mind: (1) employing both existing literature and primary data, we introduce the qualitative indicators used by Maasai herdsman {{as part of their}} evaluation of rangeland health; (2) we aim to evaluate the use of these indicators under the lens of socio-cultural change, offering some hypotheses, what we term obstructions, to explain the perceived disruptions in applying this knowledge to land-management decisions; and (3) we attempt to explore the space between herder knowledge of rangeland monitoring and those of Western-oriented managers who increasingly command land management in contemporary Kenya. In doing so, the third objective attempts to identify points of contact, or hybridization, between methods of rangeland observation used historically versus contemporary, so as to inform shared ideas of rangeland stewardship in a changing environment.|$|R
