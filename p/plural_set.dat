In particular, the aim of this contribution is firstly to study the construction of Manin’s double face: the Frenchified or French republican celebrity and the Italian monarchic icon. Secondly, it highlights the tensions of the transnational media dynamics which involve an appropriation by the French imaginary and a re-discovery by the Italian imaginary, specifically focusing on the revealing episode of the Franco-Italian monument to Manin inaugurated in Turin on March 1861...|$|E
40|$|Similar {{to other}} {{countries}} in the region, South Africa is currently reorienting a loosely structured and highly diverse community care system that evolved around HIV and TB, into a formalized, comprehensive and integrated primary health care outreach programme, based on community health workers (CHWs). While the difficulties of establishing national CHW programmes are well described, the reshaping of disease specific and care oriented community services, based outside the formal health system, poses particular challenges. This paper is an in-depth case study of the challenges of implementing reforms to community based services (CBS) in one province of South Africa. A multi-method situation appraisal of CBS in the Western Cape Province was conducted over eight months in close collaboration with provincial stakeholders. The appraisal mapped the roles and service delivery, human resource, financing and governance arrangements of an extensive non-governmental organisation (NGO) contracted and CHW based service delivery infrastructure that emerged over 15 – 20 years in this province. It also gathered the perspectives {{of a wide range of}} actors – including communities, users, NGOs, PHC providers and managers - on the current state and future visions of CBS. While there was wide support for new approaches to CBS, there are a number of challenges to achieving this. Although largely government funded, the community based delivery platform remains marginal to the formal public primary health care (PHC) and district health systems. CHW roles evolved from a system of home based care and are limited in scope. There is a high turnover of cadres, and support systems (supervision, monitoring, financing, training), coordination between CHWs, NGOs and PHC facilities, and sub-district capacity for planning and management of CBS are all poorly developed. Reorienting community based services that have their origins in care responses to HIV and TB presents an inter-related set of resource mobilisation, system design and governance challenges. These include not only formalising community based teams themselves, but also the forging of new roles, relationships and mind-sets within the primary health care system, and creating greater capacity for contracting and engaging a <b>plural</b> <b>set</b> of actors - government, NGO and community - at district and sub-district level.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{acquisition of}} exhaustivity across four structures: quantifiers, single questions, multiple questions and clefts. Two languages, English and German, are probed. ^ Exhaustivity needs {{some sort of}} <b>plural</b> <b>set</b> to be mentioned without leaving out {{a member of that}} set. This dissertation provides experimental data that children start out non-exhaustively in all four structures, i. e. they start out in a singleton stage. Moreover, I show when children 2 ̆ 7 s transition from a singleton stage to a first exhaustivity stage occurs. I argue that the acquisition of quantification {{is at the heart of}} all of these structures. Children start showing signs of exhaustivity once they start realizing that quantification is required by these four structures. ^ Chapter 1 contains the introduction to the theoretical background underlying the assumptions and guiding the interpretation of the data obtained in the acquisition experiment. Chapter 2 gives an overview of previous acquisition literature on exhaustivity. ^ The results from an experimental task in chapter 3 show that exhaustivity in quantifiers and single questions is acquired significantly earlier than the exhaustivity in multiple questions and clefts in English as well as in German. It is also shown that although exhaustivity is acquired earlier in some of the structures their acquisition process is still connected through a shared feature, quantification. I argue that the delayed acquisition of exhaustivity in multiple questions is due to a difference in semantic calculation. Whereas subset relations need to be calculated for quantifiers and questions, two sets, which are not in a subset relation to each other, need to be calculated and related for multiple questions and possibly also in clefts. This two set relation is what makes exhaustivity in multiple questions harder for English and German children. The delayed acquisition of exhaustivity in clefts is attributed to an array of facts which includes a possible difficulty of a two set calculation and a possible confusion with there constructions which do not have an exhaustivity requirement amongst other potential interfering factors. ^ Chapter 4 contains the cross-linguistic comparison of the acquisition study in chapter 3 as well as a discussion of general implications for the field of language acquisition, speech pathology and linguistic theory. Furthermore possibilities of various acquisition paths and potential trigger relations between developmental stages are discussed. ^ Chapter 5 contains some topics that are connected to the acquisition of exhaustivity but in the interest of keeping earlier chapters clear cut and streamlined their discussion is postponed until the last chapter. One such topic is how children 2 ̆ 7 s mastery of focus factors into their acquiring exhaustivity since questions and clefts contain focus. Another topic which developed during the research for this thesis is whether maximality and exhaustivity differ in acquisition or not. The major thrust of the argument in chapter 5 is that maximality is different from exhaustivity and that their acquisition path differs. However, since this is not the main topic of this thesis only preliminary experimental data can be provided to support this claim. From this preliminary data we can predict that the path of acquisition of maximality may differ greatly from the path of exhaustivity. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to Dean Martha Minow’s 2014 Brennan Center Jorde Symposium Lecture, Forgiveness, Law, and Justice, 103 Calif. L. Rev. 1615 (2015), available here. Can we use legal institutions to cultivate forgiveness after mass violence, genocide, or pervasive group-based injustice? This {{is the question}} Dean Martha Minow asks in her provocative and pathbreaking Jorde Lecture. Yet she also poses a question that is simpler and broader in its reach: Should we attempt to use law in a purposive way to shape or foster human feeling? Both questions, as Minow acknowledges, evoke skepticism from those who see law as a field of objectivity and reason, or those who view law as ineluctably and exclusively bound to norms such as consistency, predictability, and the resolution of discrete controversies. However, as I argue in this Essay, these questions also elicit doubts from a less probable group of critics: scholars {{who have come to}} view law and emotions as deeply intertwined. Although Minow is less focused on this group of critics, their concerns merit close attention; they frame an important set of questions facing this emerging field of scholarship. Most law and emotions scholars agree that we can use a rich, interdisciplinary understanding of human emotions to assess, critique, or revise legal rules and institutions. But there is more ambivalence about whether we can or should use the instrumentalities of the law to encourage or shape emotions in socially ameliorative ways. Although Minow’s primary focus is on probing the instrumentalities of repair following mass violence, her essay provides a clear model of how we might pursue this second possibility as well, using the law’s potential to support, foster, or cultivate pro-social emotions. In Part I, I offer a brief outline of the scholarship on law and emotions, which distinguishes two facets of its effort. The predominant strand of analysis, described in Part I. A, examines emotion’s effects on law, defined as legal doctrine or the work of legal actors. A second body of work, explored in Part I. B, investigates law’s effects on emotions, contemplating purposeful efforts to probe, incentivize, or cultivate emotions through law. This second strand of analysis has proved more controversial among law and emotions scholars, particularly where it envisions using law to mobilize or promote moral or other pro-social emotions. To illuminate this controversy, I examine several works by law and emotions scholars that reflect such skepticism. Though the work is varied, {{and for the most part}} focuses only on specific efforts to encourage or cultivate particular emotions, it reflects several common concerns or assumptions. First, it views purposive efforts to cultivate specific emotions as a novel undertaking: a departure in the deployment of legal institutions, if not indeed a risky turn in law and emotions scholarship. Second, this work does not necessarily interrogate the term “law”; it focuses—as do most of the proposals it considers—on conventional legal settings like criminal trials, hearings, or appellate decision making. Third, this work evinces two distinctive concerns about the larger project of fostering emotion: that it may impinge in a coercive way on litigants or other affected parties, or that it may lead to the performance of “sham” emotions. Fourth, because this work frequently offers a critique without pursuing a normative alternative, it creates ambiguity about whether critics reject the larger project, or simply specific iterations of it, and how they view the larger ends of legal institutions. In Part II, I examine Minow’s treatment of law and forgiveness. Although Minow shares many of the concerns surveyed in Part I. B, her analysis departs in several ways from these efforts to analyze the legal cultivation of emotions, and provides a model for those who might embrace this goal. In contrast to scholars who view the use of law to foster emotion as a departure, she sees emotion as already subject to construction and influence by law, making purposeful cultivation not anomalous but self-aware and responsible. But Minow also conceives of “law” more broadly as a <b>plural</b> <b>set</b> of institutions and processes that work in concert with efforts by private individuals and groups. Law, in this view, often works in a subtle or stagewise fashion to shape a variety of perceptions and attitudes that fuel forgiveness and contribute to repair. These varied and often indirect legal influences also impinge less dramatically on their participants. Finally, unlike many law and emotions scholars, who reflect uncertainty or ambivalence about whether their inquiry into emotions should affect the traditional goals of legal institutions, Minow frankly declares law to be a means, which can serve the ends of “harmony, compassion, and human growth. ” This loosening of the tether between legal instrumentalities and traditional “rule of law” objectives frees efforts to engender emotions from presumptions of illegitimacy. It also makes room for institutional experimentation and empirical appraisal, two features of Minow’s approach that reduce the risk of taking law beyond its traditional domain...|$|E

40|$|Several {{proposals}} {{in the literature}} on conceptual development converge on the claim that information about kinds of things in the world has a privileged status in children’s cognition, insofar as it is acquired, manipulated, and stored with surprising ease. Our goal in the present studies (N 440) was to test a prediction of this claim. Specifically, if the early cognitive system privileges kind (or generic) informa-tion in the proposed ways, then learning new facts about kinds should be so seamless that it is often accompanied by an impression that these facts were known all along. To test this prediction, we presented 4 - to 7 -year-old children with novel kind-wide and individual-specific facts, and we then asked children whether they had prior knowledge of these facts. As predicted, children were under the impression that they had known the kind-wide facts more often than the individual-specific facts, even though in reality they had just learned both (Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 5). Importantly, learning facts about (nongeneric) <b>plural</b> <b>sets</b> of individuals was not similarly accompanied by heightened knew-it-all-along errors (Exper-iment 4), highlighting the privileged status of kind information per se. Finally, we found that young children were able to correctly recognize their previous ignorance of newly learned generic facts when this ignorance was made salient before the learning event (Experiment 6), suggesting that children’s frequent knew-it-all-along impressions about such facts truly stem from metacognitive difficulties rather than being a methodological artifact. In sum, these 6 studies indicate that learning information about kinds is accompanied by heightened knew-it-all-along errors. More broadly, this evidence supports the view that early cognition privileges kind representations...|$|R
40|$|Generic noun phrases are noun {{phrases that}} have been said to pick out a class of {{individuals}} or a species. Syntactically, they can be definite or indefinite, singular or plural. My dissertation {{is concerned with the}} representation of generic NPs. One topic I discuss is the semantics of bare plurals. I argue, contra Carlson (1977), that bare plurals are ambiguous. The indefinite interpretation can be accounted for by a Heim (1982) /Kamp (1981) treatment of indefinite NPs as variables that receive their quantificational force from other quantifiers in the sentence. If there is no adverb of quantification or other quantifier that can bind the indefinite, it gets existential force. I also propose that there is a sentential generic operator, similar to the adverbs usually and generally that binds indefinites in its scope, and bare plurals may be bound by such an operator. This accounts for the generic interpretation of a bare plural with an individual-level predicate. A number of issues are raised by such a theory, for example, the treatment of aspect, anaphoric processes and the difference between definite and indefinite generic noun phrases. ^ I also give an analysis of NPs that contain common nouns such as kind, sort, and type. Such NPs act according to the established tests of definiteness as if they were indefinite even when they contain a definite determiner. I show that the indefinite behavior of 2 ̆ 7 kind 2 ̆ 7 NPs is a result of a structural ambiguity in the NP. ^ NPs containing kind, unlike kind-denoting bare plurals, may denote <b>plural</b> (<b>sets</b> of) kinds. Link (1983) has shown that plural entities can be part of the domain of individuals, if the domain is given the structure of a lattice. I attempt to unify such a theory of plurals with a theory of generic noun phrases. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Most {{research}} on the English plural has concentrated on children's acquisition of morphological rules and on the phonological properties that support generalization of those rules. This paper presents new evidence {{on the role of}} meaning in children’s acquisition of the plural. Three aspects of meaning relevant to the plural are considered [...] the number of objects, their similarity to each other, and their status as individuals. Young children initially appear to use the plural first when describing sets that present the ideal of these meaning components – many identical and spatially segregated instances. For example, sets of four identical and spatially distinct dogs {{are more likely to be}} described by the <b>plural</b> than <b>sets</b> of two similar dogs not spatially separated. Whereas children’s productions of the plural suggest that some instances of the plural are better than others, adults do not.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relation between morphosyntactic and semantic number of both NPs and VPs. Its main claim, based {{on a range of}} data involving different kinds of distributive inferences in various languages, is that we need a semantic theory of number that allows both morphosyntactically singular NPs to be associated with semantically <b>plural</b> individuals (<b>sets),</b> and morphosyntactically <b>plural</b> NPs to be associated with semantically singular individuals (atoms). Whether a given NP is associated with an atom or a set is determined by both formal and lexical-conceptual factors: specifically, the need to avoid type-mismatches between dubject and predicate, and the degree of animacy of te NP's referent. This study is of interest to researchers working on the semantics of number and number-related phenomena (in particular distributivity), as well as the influence of animacy on grammar.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{experimental}} methods demonstrated as non-verbal numerical representations {{are based on}} two different systems: one for representing large approximate numerical magnitudes (Analog Magnitude System, AMS) and another for representing small numerical values (Object File System, OFS). The latter shows a set-size limit whereby it is unable to represent sets larger than 3 elements. Furthermore some evidences suggest the OFS is the only system infants use for representing small numbers. When month-old infants were required to choose between two quantities of crackers placed in opaque containers, they chose the larger in the 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3 and 2 vs. 3 comparisons but failed in the 1 vs. 4 (Feigenson, Carey, Hauser, 2002). Nevertheless more recent research suggests that children and rhesus monkeys could also represent small numbers via AMS (Cantlon, Stafford, Brannon, 2010). Even an avian species seems to do that. Day-old chicks are able to process subsequent additions and subtractions of events to identify the larger group of imprinting objects, such as the (4 - 1) vs. (1 + 1) comparison (Rugani et al., 2009). To solve this task, an initial computation of 4 elements was required: a number usually not considered within {{the domain of the}} OFS. Two are the possible explanations of this data. First that the OFS of chicks has a larger storage capacity. Second that a continuity is there in representing small and large numerousness in this species. In order to understand the upper limit of chick’s OFS, in Experiment 1 we employed the 4 vs. 1 comparison. Newly-hatched domestic chicks were reared with 5 identical imprinting objects. On day 3, they underwent free choice tests between sets of 4 vs. 1 objects disappeared, one by one, each behind one of two identical opaque screens. At test, chicks spontaneously inspected the screen occluding the larger set, t(7) = 7. 638; p< 0. 001. This result could suggest that chicks’ OFS could store more than 4 elements per set. Therefore in Experiment 2, using the same methodology, we investigated a larger comparison (5 vs. 1), at test chicks preferentially approached the larger set, t(7) = 6. 333; p< 0. 001). This could indicate that chicks’ OFS is able to keep in memory up to 5 elements for each set. An alternative explanation could be that the discrimination is based on the distinction between singular vs. <b>plural</b> <b>sets.</b> To check for this second explanation, in Experiment 3 we investigated a 2 vs. 4 comparison. Again, chicks preferentially chose the larger set: one-sample t-test: t(7) = 9. 024; p< 0. 001. On the basis of such data, the hypothesis of a discrimination based on a distinction between singularity vs. plurality is not defensible. These findings support the hypothesis that for day-old chicks a continuity is there in the processing of small and large numerousness...|$|R

Using a mixed methods approach this study examined enabling factors –individual, social and structural – that enhance utilization of and adherence to PMTCT services in a <b>plural</b> urban <b>setting</b> in Kenya. The study was conducted from October-December of 2012 at St. Mary’s Mission Hospital, Lang’ata. HIV-positive birthmothers whose infants were HIV-negative {{at the time of the}} study were purposively selected to participate. All informants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire (n = 55) and a subset (n = 15) participated in in-depth interviews. Contrary to the assertions of multiple studies that failures of PMTCT programs are a result of inadequate knowledge of mother-to-child transmission and PMTCT interventions, lack of support and acceptance by family and community, as well as poor quality of services, this study found these factors to be statistically insignificant in explaining PMTCT achievements. The study further found that HIV/AIDS related stigma and gender imbalances create many missed opportunities for HIV-positive mothers to apply acquired knowledge on mother-to-child transmission and PMTCT interventions, mobilize support from family and community, and access more affordable care. Factors found to influence women’s decisions to utilize and adhere to PMTCT services include supportive counseling, striving for motherhood, maternal attachment and concern for the child’s wellbeing, assurance of confidentiality and testimonials of other successful mothers.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} investigates {{support by}} economists {{for the global}} policy shift away from unfunded public pension schemes towards funded private pension schemes. Influential economists and institutions, including the World Bank, present a suite of economic arguments that suggest that this shift will have positive effects on national economies, particularly {{in the context of}} aging. The arguments may be categorised according to their relation to the operation of three sets of institutions: capital markets, labour markets and political systems. In capital markets, the transition is purported to increase private and national saving, increase {{the quantity and quality of}} investment, and provide more efficient private administration. In labour markets, it is claimed that the shift will reduce labour market distortions associated with public pensions, which inhibit competitiveness, produce unemployment and encourage early retirement. According to the World Bank, public pensions systems cause these distortions without achieving their stated objective of reducing inequality. In the political sphere, the shift is purported to insulate the pension system from political pressures, which otherwise inevitably lead to crisis. The thesis provides evidence which refutes these claims. The best research, including studies by orthodox economists, indicate that the shift does not increase savings or investment, or improve the quality of financial investment. The main effect of tax concessions associated with private pension systems is to divert to private pension funds savings that would occur in any case via other mechanisms. The tax concessions are also regressive, even in systems with compulsory elements. Private administration of pensions, particularly in a <b>plural</b> consumer market <b>setting,</b> is highly inefficient, with customers at a disadvantage in dealing with providers due to the complexity and opacity of products and pricing. A negative relationship is found between public pension spending and levels of elderly poverty, suggesting that reducing public pension spending increases levels of elderly inequality. Public pensions are found not to explain differences in economic growth between regions. Elements of system design which distort labour markets, such as by encouraging early retirement, can easily be adjusted. However, such elements are explicit government policy in several countries. A review of public and private pensions finds that examples of public system crisis are associated with instances of economic and political collapse, rather than system design. Private funded systems are found to be more vulnerable, not less, to the same external influences. Relatively generous universal public pension systems are found to be financially sustainable despite demographic change, assuming modest levels of economic growth...|$|R
