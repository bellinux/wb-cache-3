40|$|AbstractThe paper {{concerns}} eigenvalue {{problems for}} elastic bodies <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> in contact <b>with</b> massive rigid plane punches. The linear theory of elastic materials <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> {{according to the}} Cowin–Nunziato model is used. A variational principle is constructed which has the properties of minimality, similar to the well-known variational principle for problems with pure elastic media. The discreteness of the spectrum and completeness of the eigenfunctions are proved. As a consequence of variational principles, the properties of an increase or {{a decrease in the}} natural frequencies, when the mechanical and “porous” boundary conditions and the modulus of elastic solid <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> change, are established. A finite element method is proposed for numerical solution of eigenvalue problems for elastic media <b>with</b> <b>voids.</b> Some effective block algorithms for finite element eigenvalue problems with partial coupling are described. Numerical experiments are presented for determining the first eigenfrequencies of an axisymmetric elastic body <b>with</b> <b>voids...</b>|$|R

We give finite element systems of equations for piezoelectric, viscoelastic structures and media <b>with</b> <b>voids,</b> as well as complete system of equations for the full structure made of elastic, viscoelastic and piezoelectric components including initial porosity.

The velocity equation has been derived and the results have been discussed. The study reveals that there may be more than one torsional surface wave fronts and one Love wave front in the medium. It is also observed that in the absence of superficial layer, the elastic half space <b>with</b> <b>void</b> pores allows torsional surface waves, to the contrary, that elastic half space without pores does not do so...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to study the {{fundamental}} solution in orthotropic thermoelastic media <b>with</b> <b>voids.</b> <b>With</b> this objective, firstly the two-dimensional general solution in orthotropic thermoelastic media <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> is derived. On the basis of general solution, the fundamental solution for a steady point heat source {{on the surface of}} a semiinfinite orthotropic thermoelastic material <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> is constructed by six newly introduced harmonic functions. The temperature and voids distribution and components of displacement and stress are expressed in terms of elementary functions. From the present investigation, a special case of interest is also deduced and compared with the previous results obtained. Since all the components are expressed in terms of elementary functions, it is convenient to use them...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{upper-bound}} theorem in limit analysis, {{the central}} bursting defect in plane strain drawing and extrusion is analyzed {{by comparing the}} proportional flow with the central bursting flow for the metal <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> at the center. A criterion for the unique conditions that promote this defect has been derived. The metal <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> may flow in the identical manner to that of solid strip <b>with</b> no <b>voids</b> to form a sound flow, deterring central bursting. A solid strip, on the other hand, or a material <b>with</b> <b>voids,</b> may flow in a manner so as to produce central bursting defects. A major conclusion {{of the study is}} that, for a range of combinations of inclined angle of the die, reduction, and friction, central bursting is expected whether or not the material originally had any voids. On the other hand, central bursting can be prevented even if the original rod contains small-size voids. 1...|$|R

The {{change in the}} lattice parameters of the mullite <b>powders</b> <b>with</b> different compositions {{was consistent with the}} phase diagram proposed by Prochazka et al., showing the high purity and homogeneity of the resultant mullite powders prepared in this study. The surface areas of the resultant mullite <b>powders</b> <b>with</b> different compositions decreased with increasing calcination temperatures, depending on the compositions. However, fine mullite <b>powder</b> <b>with</b> a stoichiometric composition maintained high surface area even after high-temperature calcination. The change in the surface area could explain from the crystallization behavior of precursors, which-was affected by the compositions. Precursor <b>powders</b> <b>with</b> SiO_ 2 -rich composition crystallized into mullite at relatively low temperature, resulting in the formation of amorphous SiO_ 2 -rich phase which promoted the grain growth during calcination by the viscous sintering. On the other hand, precursor <b>powders</b> <b>with</b> Al_ 2 O_ 3 -rich composition mullitized, via ultra-fine intermediate spinel and/or alumina, leading to the high surface areas at lower temperatures. However, the surface areas of the Al_ 2 O_ 3 -rich precursor powders abruptly decreased by the calcination above 1100 ℃, due to the grain growth with the aid of the active ultra-fine alumina. As a result, only the precursor <b>powder</b> <b>with</b> a stoichiometric composition showed high surface area after high-temperature calcination...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveVoiding {{dysfunction}} {{in women}} is common, but {{the differential diagnosis}} of the underlying pathophysiology is not easy. This study analyzed lower urinary tract dysfunction in women <b>with</b> <b>voiding</b> dysfunction based on videourodynamic study (VUDS). Patients and MethodsA total of 781 consecutive women with complaints of difficult urination were included. All patients underwent VUDS and a final diagnosis was made. The clinical symptoms and video urodynamic characteristics were analyzed. ResultsDifficult urination was the main symptom in 446 patients and an associated symptom in 335. A normal VUDS tracing was found in 96, detrusor overactivity in 112, bladder oversensitivity in 128, and interstitial cystitis in 40. The other 405 women were classified as having voiding dysfunction, including 178 with detrusor underactivity, 55 with detrusor overactivity and inadequate contractility, 88 <b>with</b> dysfunctional <b>voiding,</b> 20 <b>with</b> bladder neck dysfunction, 10 with urethral stricture, and 54 with poor pelvic floor muscle relaxation. Difficult urination was the main symptom in 62 %, urinary retention in 11. 2 %, and frequency, urgency, or urgency incontinence in 24. 6 % of all patients <b>with</b> <b>voiding</b> dysfunction. A total of 93. 8 % of patients had both storage and empty symptoms, whereas only 6. 2 % had empty symptoms alone. Urodynamic parameters could only differentiate bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor underactivity based on voiding detrusor pressure in all patients <b>with</b> <b>voiding</b> dysfunction. ConclusionStorage and voiding symptoms are common in women <b>with</b> <b>voiding</b> dysfunction. VUDS is the best diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of female voiding dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|To use a new {{computational}} method {{for the problem}} of the flexural vibration of thin, isotropic rectangular plates <b>with</b> arbitrarily positioned <b>voids.</b> In this paper we use static beam functions under point load as admissible functions and Rayleigh-Ritz method for analysis of discontinuous variation of rigidity of the plates. The voids of plate are expressed continuously by using extended Dirac function, which is defined as Dirac function existing continuously in prescribed region. The governing equation for a plate <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> composed of an isotropic material is formulated without modifying the rigidity of the plates, as done in the equivalent plate analogy. The natural frequencies of simply supported and clamped plates <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> are obtained from the governing equation by this energy method.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} theory for porous elastic shells using the model of Cosserat surfaces. We employ the Nunziato–Cowin theory of elastic {{materials}} <b>with</b> <b>voids</b> and introduce two scalar fields to describe the porosity of the shell: one field characterizes the volume fraction variations along the middle surface, while the other accounts for the changes in volume fraction along the shell thickness. Starting from the basic principles, we first deduce the equations of the nonlinear theory of Cosserat shells <b>with</b> <b>voids.</b> Then, {{in the context of}} the linear theory, we prove the uniqueness of solution for the boundary initial value problem. In the case of an isotropic and homogeneous material, we determine the constitutive coefficients for Cosserat shells, by comparison with the results derived from the three-dimensional theory of elastic media <b>with</b> <b>voids.</b> To this aim, we solve two elastostatic problems concerning rectangular plates with voids: the pure bending problem and the extensional deformation under hydrostatic pressure...|$|R
