In the mid-twentieth century, modern medicine and treatment made it possible to decrease the progression of scoliosis within patients and alleviate the pain they experienced. This {{was the result of the}} progression of scoliosis screenings and treatment. New ways were developed to treat scoliosis because the condition was increasingly understood among medical professionals and orthopedic surgeons. These treatments such as bracing and rod insertion into the spine were made possible at the turn of the twentieth century. During this time, many schools subjected their students to physical examinations and posture tests. It was believed that students suffered from negative effects such as poor posture due to hunching over desks for hours in the classroom. Although these screenings were not intended to detect spinal curvature, physicians diagnosed many students with scoliosis. Scoliosis was considered a disease-based condition during the mid-twentieth century caused by tuberculosis or poliomyelitis. These diseases responsible for causing spinal deformities were successfully managed throughout the 1960s due to the distribution of vaccines and antibiotics. Despite the successful management of diseases causing spinal deformity, many patients suffered from scoliosis with no known cause. The unknown cause was eventually determined to be idiopathic scoliosis. Alfred Shands Jr., an orthopedic surgeon, discovered that two percent of patients had non-disease related scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis, also known as the [...] "cancer of orthopedic surgery", was determined to be dangerous because there was no current treatment. The condition needed to be detected in patients promptly so treatment could be developed in time to halt its progression. As a result, schools made it mandatory for students to have screenings for scoliosis. Early on, set symptoms could be recognized among the students being tested from ages five to eighteen, but subsequent studies never confirmed them for this age-range. To begin the screenings, children would have their shoulder height, leg length and spinal curvature measurements taken while partially clothed. This was followed with the forward-bend test and bodily comparisons to wall charts that were printed reproductions of the ideal human posture. Unfortunately, these screenings were not always accurate and many students were misdiagnosed because poor posture could often be mistaken for scoliosis. One of the first treatments designed was the Milwaukee brace, a rigid contraption of metal rods attached to a plastic or leather girdle, designed to straighten the spine. As a result of the constant pressure the brace inflicted on a patients' spine, it was particularly painful and inconvenient to wear due to physical limits it imposed. Wearing the brace was known to cause jaw pain, skin irritation, muscle pain and low self-esteem among patients. The 'Harrington rod' technique was the second major treatment for scoliosis to emerge and became the first significant surgical procedure to manipulate spinal positioning. This treatment was initially developed to treat <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> that resulted from the polio epidemic of the 1950s. The Milwaukee brace was the only nonoperative and noninvasive alternative to surgery at the time to provide postoperative correction to polio patients. A curve exceeding sixty degrees required the Harrington rod technique, otherwise the Milwaukee brace was recommended. However, Canadian physician, Elizabeth Wyne, observed that fifty percent of patients wearing the Milwaukee brace still required surgery later in life. Surgery may straighten the spine however it does not necessarily eradicate a patient of all the pain they suffer from due to scoliosis. Individuals who undergo surgery are left with scars and often have a lack of feeling in their backs to the invasive nature of this treatment. Despite the advancements of scoliosis treatments, yet to be determined is a cure that is reliable, risk-free and that results in few or no consequences for patients.|$|E

40|$|Literature has {{described}} treatment of flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis using different instrumentation; however, only one {{article has been}} published using posterior-only pedicle screw fixation. Complications using pedicle screws in <b>paralytic</b> neuromuscular <b>scoliosis</b> has not been described before. To present results and complications with posterior-only pedicle screws, a retrospective study {{was carried out in}} 27 consecutive patients with flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis (Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy), who were operated between 2002 and 2006 using posterior-only pedicle screw instrumentation. Immediate postoperative and final follow-up results were compared using t test for Cobb angle, pelvic obliquity, thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. Perioperative and postoperative complications were noted from the hospital records of each patient. Complications, not described in literature, were discussed in detail. Average follow-up was 32. 2  months. Preoperative, immediate postoperative and final follow-up Cobb angle were 79. 8 °, 30. 2 ° (63. 3 % correction, p <  0. 0001) and 31. 9 °, respectively; and pelvic obliquity was 18. 3 °, 8. 9 ° (52 % correction, p <  0. 0001) and 8. 9 °. Postoperative thoracic kyphosis remained unchanged from 27. 6 ° to 19. 9 ° (p =  0. 376); while lumbar lordosis improved significantly from + 15. 6 ° to − 22. 4 ° lordosis (p =  0. 0002). Most patients had major to moderate improvement in postoperative functional and ambulatory status compared to the preoperative status. Thirteen (48. 1 %) perioperative complications were noted with five major complications (four respiratory in the form of hemothorax or respiratory failure that required ventilator support and one death) and eight minor complications (three UTI, two atelectasis, two neurological and one ileus). Postoperatively, we noted complications, such as coccygodynia with subluxation in 7, back sore on the convex side in 4 and dislodging of rod distally in 1 patient making a total of 12 (44. 4 %) postoperative complications. Of 12 postoperative complications, 6 (50 %) required secondary procedure. We conclude that although flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis can be well corrected with posterior-only pedicle screw, there is a high rate of associated complications...|$|R
40|$|Little {{work has}} been {{recorded}} in this country on the interesting problem of {{the rate of growth}} of the skeleton in normal children. Most of the published papers have come from America, and of particular note are those of Anderson and Green (1948), who investigated the growth of the lower limb from the age of five years until the date of epiphysial closure, and who later investigated the rate of growth of the femur and tibia after epiphysiodesis for leg discrepancy. The basic purpose of this work is particularly in its application to those difficult orthopaedic problems of leg discrepancy, and <b>paralytic</b> and idiopathic <b>scoliosis,</b> and their attempted correction by growth arrest before epiphysial closure. in addition it is desirable that some figures on the subject of growth of British children should be put on record, as most of the tables of growth prediction are based on observations made on American children. My aim has been to plot the rate of skeletal maturation against growth of the tibia, femur and vertebrae, to determine if and when spurts of growth occur in relation to the child’s skeletal age. Such information would enable the orthopaedic surgeon to determine the best time for epiphysial operation in leg length discrepancy, whether this be by stapling or epiphysiodesis. it may be supposed that if these epiphysial operations are performed a...|$|R
30|$|Children with <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> {{often use}} their curve, {{particularly}} the kyphotic and lordotic elements {{to balance their}} trunks. The great majority of children in non-Western countries sit on the floor. Following straightening of the spine surgically they are inclined to fall over if they sit on the floor. Fortunately, this is usually only temporary. Sitting in a chair corrects the problem but that solution may not be popular in a culture where socialization takes place at carpet level. The parents should be warned accordingly.|$|E

40|$|This {{clinical}} and radiographic {{study of a}} series of patients treated for idiopathic, <b>paralytic</b> and congenital <b>scoliosis</b> was made to determine how far posterior spinal fusion could be relied upon to prevent increasing deformity, and how far it could be depended upon to maintain correction of deformity secured by various types of plaster jacket with or without preliminary operation. In the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital there has been an experience of correction of scoliosis by plaster jackets of the Abbott type over a period of more than thirty years, the late McCrae Aitken making this the greatest of his life endeavours. He tried to derotate the more mobile vertebrae, fixing prominent parts of the chest wall by the plaster jacket and encouraging respiratory excursion of the flattened ribs through windows cut in the plaster. Hour after hour the staff of the hospital applied and reapplied the jackets, instructed the patients day by day in their deep breathing, and encouraged and cajoled them to use that part of the chest wall that would derotate the curve. Figures 1 to 3 show the type of Abbott jacket applied, though {{it must be noted that}} McCrae Aitken would have insisted upon larger windows over the left chest anteriorly and the right chest posteriorly than were used in this particular patient. In many patients excellent correction was achieved and sometimes it was maintained (Figs. 4 and 5). Unfortunately the regime of plaster jacket...|$|R
40|$|This thesis evaluates {{surgical}} correction {{in patients}} with <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> with emphasis on function and activity. The thesis includes four studies of 100 consecutive patients preoperatively evaluated and surgically corrected between 1992 and 1996 at Linköping University Hospital. Eighteen different diagnoses were represented. The postoperative follow-ups were at one year and in average seven years. Six patients dropped out {{during the first year}} and twelve during the long-term follow-up period. The assessments included general information, lung function, and measurements of radiographs, function and activity - seating posture, ADL, pain, care and need for rest. The patients or relatives view on the effects of surgery were evaluated in follow-up questionnaires. The preoperative results of the 100 patients described a heterogeneous group in terms of function and activity. Even when the patients were grouped into subgroups according to the Scoliosis Research Society classification, they remained heterogeneous. In patients who could understand verbal instructions assessments that needed co-operation could be used and in those who could not understand verbal instructions, assessments relied more heavily on measures of function and level of dependence. Preoperative results of weight distribution on the seating surface were explained by thoracolumbar/lumbar spinal imbalance and pelvic obliquity R 2 = 0. 45 (n= 45). The one-year follow-up of 94 patients showed improvements in angle of scoliosis, sitting balance, weight distribution to the seating surface, seating supports in the wheelchair, time needed for rest. The results in subgroups were almost the same as in the whole group. The subjective results for patients or relatives in the follow-up questionnaire showed a positive outcome of surgery. In the comparison between the one-year follow-up and the long-term follow-up there were further improvements in sitting balance, ADL, and care given, but the angle of scoliosis was increased. These results were in line with patients’ and relatives’ assessments in the follow-up questionnaire and in the open-ended questions. Due to the heterogeneity of patients with <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis,</b> irrespective of disorder, it is important to focus on different subgroups with regards to the patients’ total situation. The surgically corrected and stabilised spine resulted in the strength to keep the body upright with improvements in function, activity and possibilities to belong in social activities. Further improvements were shown between the one-year follow-up and the long-term follow-up. It is recommended that patients who have been surgically corrected for <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> are followed for more than one year...|$|E

MethodsWe report {{the case of a}} 16 -year-old male patient who undergoes a surgical correction for a severe <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> (160 °). On account of previous deficits, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring was achieved through TcMEP and H-reflex. ResultsIntraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) showed a transient and simultaneous loss of bilateral TcMEP and H-reflex, coinciding with an abrupt hypotension during pedicle screw placement. After having dismissed mechanical injury and after increasing blood pressure, TcMEP and H-reflex were equivalent to those at baseline.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In thirty-nine {{children}} undergoing spine fusion with Harrington instrumentation, measurement ofthoracic {{compliance and}} elastance was normal {{in all of}} the twenty-nine children with idiopathic scoliosis. Compliance was low in three children with <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> but not in seven children with congenital scoliosis. In adults with scoliosis, both the thoracic cage ‘ and the lungs may be stiff and, therefore, hard to inflate. This makes artificial ventilation during operation difficult. When high pressure is required to inflate the thorax with a given volume of air or gas, thoracic compliance is low and the reciprocal of compliance, thoracic elastance, is high. Caro and DuBois, measuring the elastance of lung and thoracic cage in a small number of children with scoliosis who were to have operations under general anesthesia and myoneural blockade, found that it was either equal to or lower than values obtained in a group of normal children ofcomparable age. In these young patients, the chest wall was easily expanded. We wished to repeat the measurements of Caro and DuBois but on a larger number of patients who were having their scoliosis corrected by Harrington instrumentation, a technique which might well alter the thoracic compliance and increase the elastance...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{years ago}} the late John Cobb first showed me that {{scoliosis}} could be interesting. By the very simplicity of his teaching he changed an obscure, incomprehensible deformity into a disease which has fascinated me ever since. I recall gratefully his ability to make the complex simple. I propose {{to look at this}} deformity in all its forms, to name the questions one must ask and answer if its etiology is to be established. At the end of this you will not know the etiology of scoliosis, for I do not myself, but {{it is my hope that}} you will comprehend the problem better. Although idiopathic scoliosis because of its frequency, its severity and the mystery of its origin is the main problem, it is important to look at scoliosis from all causes. Scoliosis is a deformity that may be caused by many diseases, and though in some the mechanism may be clear-as for example in congenital scoliosis-in most it is wholly beyond our understanding. After poliomyelitis, limb deformity occurs in children left with muscle imbalance while still growing; trunk muscle imbalance likewise causes <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis.</b> Knowing this has singularly failed to help us to understand idiopathic scoliosis; children with idiopathic curves do not have muscle imbalance.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of domiciliary cuirass respirator treatment, using tailor-made shells, in four patients with severe thoracic scoliosis. Three {{of the patients}} had suffered from poliomyelitis. All complained of increasing dyspnoea on exertion, ultimately interfering with almost every activity of daily life; three patients had severe acute respiratory failure necessitating urgent admission to the Respiratory Care Unit. Right heart failure was present in two. Two patients required mechanical treatment via an endotracheal tube. All the patients were discharged home with a cuirass respirator. Standard type shells were used initially with low efficiency due to the poor fit of the cuirass shell to the deformed thoracic cage. Tailor-made shells were constructed from polyester reinforced with glass fibre, modelled on plaster casts of the thoracic cage. Subjectively the patients improved greatly {{and were able to}} resume and increase many activities. One patient committed suicide for reasons unconnected with treatment but the other three patients have been doing well from the time the cuirass respirator treatment was started, respectively, 3, 6, and 10 years ago.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wheelchair sling seat provides {{little or}} no support to the spine {{of a child with}} myopathy or neurogenic muscular weakness. As the spinal muscles become weaker scoliosis may develop with associated deformity, pain and restriction of cardio-respiratory function. If muscle weakness is severe, the resultant fully developed deformity is virtually impossible to treat. Slowing the rate of increase of the deformity is, therefore, the most hopeful avenue of attack. This work addresses the hypothesis that custom moulded seating can increase sitting comfort and slow the rate of progression of spinal curvature in children with <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis,</b> and further, that a range of standard or modular seats can achieve these goals at less cost. Previous work on this problem has ranged from simply padding the armrest, in order to distribute force over the rib cage, through to custom moulded seating. Our initial experience with custom moulding, using the bean bag evacuation and consolidation technique, produced several comfortable seats although the technique was labour intensive and therefore costly. This led us to attempt to develop a method of providing comfortable seating that would help control spinal deformity at reasonable cost. This paper describes the design of a standardized seating system for school age children with myopathy or neurogenic muscular weakness. Preliminary results indicate that this technique may have advantages over alternative methods of treatment. The radiological study is continuing. All comes ondence to be addressed to Dr. B. R...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the validity of}} 3 commercially available at recording thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (TLSO) wearing time of children {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) and to assess each monitor’s function during daily activities. Summary of Background Data. A major limitation to studies assessing the effectiveness of spinal prophylactic bracing is the patient’s compliance with the prescribed wearing time. Although some studies have begun to use objective compliance monitors, there is little documenta-tion of the validity of the monitors during activities of daily life and no comparisons of available monitors. Methods. Fifteen children with SCI who wore a TLSO for <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> were observed for 4 days during their rehabilitation stay. Three compliance monitors (2 tempera-ture and 1 pressure sensitive) were mounted onto each TLSO. Time of brace wear from the monitors was compared with the wear time per day recorded in diaries. Results. Observed versus monitored duration of brace wear found the HOBO (temperature sensitive) to be the most valid compliance monitor. The HOBO had the low-est average of difference and variance of difference scores. The correlation between the recorded daily en-tries and monitored brace wear time was also highest for the HOBO in analysis of dependent and independent scores. Bland-Altman plots showed that the pressure sen-sitive monitor underestimated wear time whereas the temperature monitors overestimated wear time. Conclusion. Compliance to prescribed wearing sched-ule has been a barrier to studying TLSO efficacy. All 3 monitors were found to measure TLSO compliance, but the 2 temperature monitors were more in agreement with the daily diaries. Based on its functional advantages com-pared with the HOBO, the StowAway TidbiT will be used to further investigate the long-term compliance of TLSO bracing in children with SCI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this review, basic {{knowledge}} and recent innovation of surgical treatment for scoliosis will be described. Surgical treatment for scoliosis is indicated, in general, for the curve exceeding 45 or 50 degrees by the Cobb's method {{on the ground}} that: 1) Curves larger than 50 degrees progress even after skeletal maturity. 2) Curves of greater magnitude cause loss of pulmonary function, and much larger curves cause respiratory failure. 3) Larger the curve progress, more difficult to treat with surgery. Posterior fusion with instrumentation has been a standard of the surgical treatment for scoliosis. In modern instrumentation systems, more anchors are used to connect the rod and the spine, resulting in better correction and less frequent implant failures. Segmental pedicle screw constructs or hybrid constructs using pedicle screws, hooks, and wires are the trend of today. Anterior instrumentation surgery had been a choice of treatment for the thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis because better correction can be obtained with shorter fusion levels. Recently, superiority of anterior surgery for the thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis has been lost. Initial enthusiasm for anterior instrumentation for the thoracic curve using video assisted thoracoscopic surgery technique has faded out. Various attempts are being made with use of fusionless surgery. To control growth, epiphysiodesis on the convex side of the deformity with or without instrumentation is a technique to provide gradual progressive correction and to arrest {{the deterioration of the}} curves. To avoid fusion for skeletally immature children with spinal cord injury or myelodysplasia, vertebral wedge ostetomies are performed for the treatment of progressive <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis.</b> For right thoracic curve with idiopathic scoliosis, multiple vertebral wedge osteotomies without fusion are performed. To provide correction and maintain it during the growing years while allowing spinal growth for early onset scoliosis, technique of instrumentation without fusion or with limited fusion using dual rod instrumentation has been developed. To increase the volume of the thorax in thoracic insufficiency syndrome associated with fused ribs and congenital scoliosis, vertical expandable prosthetic titanium ribs has been developed. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{review was}} carried out on 59 {{patients}} (10 males and 49 females) who had anterior interbody fusion performed with femoral ring allograft packed with autograft bone chips with a minimum follow up of 2 years. The average age {{at the time of}} surgery was 49. 1 year old (26 to 75). The total number of levels grafted was 141. The diagnosis consisted of multiple degenerative disease in 6, degenerative change below the long segment of fusion for scoliosis in 9, osteoporosis with collapsed fracture in 3, pseudarthrosis after posterior laminectomy and fusion in 35, congenital scoliosis in 3, scoliosis in 2 and <b>paralytic</b> <b>scoliosis</b> due to multiple sclerosis in one. The distribution of levels fused was T 12 -L 1 in 6, L 1 - 2 in 12, L 2 - 3 in 17, L 3 - 4 in 22, L 4 - 5 in 35 and L 5 -S 1 in 39. The remaining 10 levels were in the lower thoracic areas (T 7 -T 12). The operations were performed as anterior fusion alone in 13 patients, one-stage anterior and posterior fusion in 26 patients and two-stage surgery in 20 patients. Anterior instrumentation was used in all 141 levels. At average follow-up (33. 7 months) there was no significant change in allograft angles (average = 1. 6 degrees). Fusion of the allograft was classified by Bridwell's grading system. At 24 months of the follow up, 97 % of the allografts were in grade I (fully incorporated) and 3 % were in grade II (partially incorporated). Compared to 12 months follow-up only 76. 2 % of the grafts were in grade I, 28 % were in grade II and 0. 8 % were in grade III. Two patients had deep posterior infections which required further surgery (without resorption of the allograft anteriorly). One patient had a screw migration anteriorly which required removal. Three patients had persistence of radiolucent line at one of the vertebral end plates - graft interfaces but no subsidence of the graft or pain. In conclusion, the femoral ring allograft appeared to benefit the anterior interbody fusion in complex spinal surgery...|$|E
