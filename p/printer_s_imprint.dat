40|$|In 2004, Andy Paparozzi of the National Association of Printing Leadership (NAPL) {{reported}} {{that it was a}} good year for the U. S. printing industry, because it was the first year since 2001 in which the industry showed growth. However, this good news cannot appease the complaints from U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> who are concerned about losing their jobs to overseas printers. According to a survey conducted by the Printing Industries of America/Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (PIA/GATF), 40 % of printers think that their customers are seeking global sourcing for their printing needs. Offshoring is the new reality of globalization. Journalists constantly mention the benefits and dangers in offshoring. No one is really sure if offshoring is beneficial or not, or if it is just overwhelming the printing industry. For the following thesis, the researcher conducted two surveys. One targeted U. S. print buyers (buyers, brokers, and book publishers); the other survey targeted Chinese printers. This research discusses the following issues: • How do Chinese <b>printers</b> view U. <b>S.</b> offshore print buying trends? • How are Chinese printers planning to upgrade and to improve their capabilities to acquire and to handle offshore print jobs? • Is there a trend (an increase or a decrease) in offshore print buying from China? • How do U. S. print buyers evaluate the need to send print jobs to China? • What are the obstacles that prevent U. S. print buyers from buying print from China? The research findings will benefit the U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> by clarifying our understanding the print buyer’s behavior and reasons for purchasing their print offshore. With more accurate knowledge in this field, U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> will be in a better position to know what it will take to become more competitive...|$|R

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the {{political}} manifestations {{that can be found}} in the Argentinean film productions made after the dictatorship, since 1983 until nowadays. The proposed path relates the works with their socio-political, historical and cultural context, and allows the understanding of the transformations of the links (both ethic and aesthetic) between the filmed world and its referents This tesis posits that the memory of the violence that took place in this country during the 70 <b>s</b> <b>imprinted</b> a significant mark in the articulation of discursive worlds as well as in any Argentine artistic production. It also considers the memory as a practice that acts in the Argentine collective imaginary, incorporating more extended historical periods that, in terms of causes and consequences, precede the last dictatorship and extend themselves into the present. Thus, the notion of memory is the focus that links the past events with every specific present, and, simultaneously, it is the hermeneutical frame of a research based on a corpus formed by diverse expressive genres. The specific systems of representation of those political events, whose impact manifested itself in the accounted period, are analyzed. We analyze the (fictional and documentary) film figurations of the myths and narrations of the peronismo (a contradictory political movement) and the ways of social irruption revealed in a climate of popular revolt that accompanied profound economical and institutional-political crisis at the dawning of this century.

40|$|This article explores Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s {{views of}} {{judicial}} review of administrative action, as revealed in his writings on public land law, as both a scholar and a Supreme Court justice. It examines and explains why Professor Scalia favored judicial review of public land administration while Justice Scalia seems to abhor it. In a sweeping law review article published in 1970, Professor Scalia argued that the doctrine of sovereign immunity historically did not apply in public lands cases. On the Court he has penned {{two of the most}} significant decisions addressing judicial review of public lands administration, each of them imposing new restrictions (or reviving old ones) on the availability of judicial redress for executive unlawfulness. In Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation (“Lujan I“), Justice Scalia used the law of standing, injected with separation of powers principles, to foreclose programmatic judicial review of public land classification. And last year, in Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (“SUWA“), he used traditional mandamus principles to foreclose judicial review of officials 2 ̆ 7 alleged failure to achieve a plain congressional mandate to maintain the wilderness quality of public lands. Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>imprint</b> on public land law was foretold by his scholarly writings, including his public lands article, which place great emphasis on protecting executive discretion. He favors judicial review for the vindication of traditional private rights while disfavoring it as a means of ensuring the implementation of statutory, public values {{in the face of the}} contrary exercise of executive discretion...|$|R
