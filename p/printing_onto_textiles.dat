Ink jet printed fabrics are an ideal basis for bespoke fabrics to be generated in small-scale productions. To begin with this paper {{will discuss the}} production of ink jet printed fabrics in repeat using textile CAD software. The original design will include all embellishments {{as part of the}} original repeat; as an overlay. Before the application of a devore effect, the ink jet printed fabric will need to be finished conventionally, then the shrinkage which occurs can be taken into consideration and the overlay modified in repeat. To conclude the paper will discuss the extension of this process into other possible methods of embellishment such as overprinting and resist techniques, which can be used with ink jet <b>printing</b> <b>onto</b> <b>textiles.</b> These techniques will display alternative methods for producing high quality customised fabrics...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} an inkjet printed textile antenna realised using a novel fabrication methodology. Conventionally, {{it is very}} difficult to inkjet <b>print</b> <b>onto</b> <b>textiles</b> because of surface roughness. This study demonstrates how this can be overcome by developing an interface coated layer which bonds to a standard polyester cotton fabric, creating a smooth surface. A planar dipole antenna has been fabricated, simulated and measured. This study includes DC resistance, RF reflection coefficient results and antenna radiation patterns. Efficiencies of greater than 60 % have been achieved with only one layer of conducting ink. The study demonstrates that the interface layer saves considerable time and cost in terms of the number of inkjet layers needed whilst also improving the printing resolution...|$|R

Henderson and Paolozzi were registered as the company directors along with Judith Henderson who acted as secretary.

40|$|Keeper of the Patterns' – an {{exploration}} of the use of 3 D Anaglyphs in Textile Design. The primary objective of the work was to explore the possibilities of using 3 d anaglyphs in textile design. Another aim was to extend the methods used for producing imagery for textile design and explore the use of narrative within imagery used for surface pattern design. Stemming from a collaborative project and exhibition with the Calais Lace museum (Crysalis) the body scanner at the Lace Museum was used to generate images which were collaged into designs that were then developed into anaglyphs using digital techniques. The design was digitally <b>printed</b> <b>onto</b> <b>textiles,</b> acetate and paper. These designs were then used {{in a number of ways}} to create a wearable fabric sculpture, a large 3 d backlit image, a sound track and a cut-up poem. Software (P 22 random sound generator) was used to create a cut-up sound track to accompany the poem which created a narrative for the ensemble of works. 3 D glasses were used to view the sculpture and imagery and headphones were used to hear the soundtrack and poem. The wearable sculpture aimed to explore another area of interest which was the interface between set design, costume design, sculpture and performance and music. The sculpture, being restrictive when worn, created certain new dynamic forms when worn by performers interpreting the poem. Oscar Schlemmer's 'Triadisches Ballett' and the Michael Clarke's work with The Fall were both both of interest in this context. Exhibited at the 'Moving textiles:Digital Encounters' exhibition of over 40 textile designers, artists and craftspeople exploring the place of digital technology in contemporary textile practice in the Herbert Read Gallery, UCA Canterbury (catalogue ISBN 9780992733698), this project was supported by the UCA Research Fund and European Interregional Development Fund...|$|R
40|$|In {{comparison}} to weaving or other techniques that are employed to embed conductive tracks in textile fabric structure, the obvious advantages of printing the desired conductive pattern are {{the simplicity of}} the process and the suitability for low volume production runs as well as high volume production runs. However, the generally inferior durability and poorer electrical performance of conductive inks that have been <b>printed</b> <b>onto</b> a <b>textile</b> fabric give rise to challenges. In this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment were used to formulate screen printing inks for use on textiles. On an equal weight basis, electrically conductive grades impart higher electrical conductivity compared to the printing ink grades of carbon black pigment. However, the conductive grades of carbon black are difficult to disperse and stabilise in aqueous media. Therefore in this study, a procedure was devised initially to prepare stable, waterborne dispersions of a number of highly conductive grades of carbon black pigment. The stability of pigment dispersions was characterised by conducting rheological, particle size and accelerated gravitational sedimentation analyses on appropriate formulations. In order to formulate finished inks from the optimised, stable pigment dispersions, various binders were incorporated in the formulations followed by characterisation of the stability and the electrical properties of the finished inks. Films of the formulated inks were deposited <b>onto</b> various <b>textile</b> substrates. This was followed by testing of the washing and creasing performance of these ink films. It was found that the formulated inks performed considerably better than the tested commercial inks. It was shown that following the ink preparation procedure devised in this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment can be used to formulate textile printing inks which not only possess very high electrical conductivity but are also durable to withstand washing and creasing of textiles...|$|R
