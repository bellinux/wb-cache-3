40|$|AbstractIn 2015, the {{population}} of people {{over the age of}} 65 is 25. 0 % in Japan. This means that Japan has already become a super-aging society. In such society, the number of elderly people living alone has been also increased. For such people, a fall accident is serious because it can lead to serious injury or death. Researches and services to monitor behaviours of such people have been proposed. For example, by monitoring the status of use of home appliances, something unusual happened to them can be predicted. However, such systems cannot recognize the detailed behaviours like fall. Surveillance cameras have been introduced only outside the house because of the privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a mobile robot to detect human fall and report it to their observers. The mobile robot consists of a household mobile robot (Yujin Robot's Kobuki), a sensor (Microsoft's Kinect), and a computer (PC) to detect a human and control the robot. For simplicity of the robot and accurate fall detection, the sensor is installed on the robot to follow the target harmoniously. Thus, the sensor can move around with the robot to minimize blind area. The results of our experiments show that improvement of up to 80 % in fall detection rate compared to a conventional monitoring technique using <b>position-fixed</b> sensors. Finally, we discuss the capabilities and future works of the robot...|$|R
40|$|The {{requisites}} for {{the persistence}} of small colonies of self-replicating molecules living in a two-dimensional lattice are investigated analytically in the infinite diffusion or mean-field limit and through Monte Carlo simulations in the <b>position-fixed</b> or contact process limit. The molecules are modeled by hipercyclic replicators A which are capable of replicating via binary fission A + E [...] 2 A with production rates s as well as via catalytically assisted replication 2 A + E [...] 3 A with rate c. In addition, a molecule can degrade into its source materials E with rate γ. In the asymptotic regime the population can be characterized by the presence (active phase) and the absence (empty phase) of replicators in the lattice. In both diffusion regimes, we find that for small values of the ratio c/γ these phases are separated by a second-order phase transition {{which is in the}} universality class of the directed percolation, while for small values s/gamma the phase transition is of first order. Furthermore, we illustrate the suitability of the dynamic Monte Carlo method, which is based on the analysis of the spreading behaviour of a few active cells in the center of an otherwise infinite empty lattice, to adress the problem of emergence of replicators. Rather surprisingly, we show that this method allows an unambiguous identification of the order of the nonequilibrium phase transition...|$|R
40|$|Despite marked {{progress}} {{over the}} past several decades, convective storm nowcasting remains a challenge because most nowcasting systems are based on linear extrapolation of radar reflectivity without much consideration for other meteorological fields. The variational Doppler radar analysis system (VDRAS) is an advanced convective-scale analysis system capable of providing analysis of 3 -D wind, temperature, and humidity by assimilating Doppler radar observations. Although potentially useful, it is still an open question as to how to use these fields to improve nowcasting. In this study, we present results from our first attempt at developing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Box-based nOWcasting (SBOW) method under the machine learning framework using VDRAS analysis data. The key design points of SBOW are as follows: 1) The study domain is divided into many <b>position-fixed</b> small boxes and the nowcasting problem is transformed into one question, i. e., will a radar echo > 35 dBZ appear in a box in 30 minutes? 2) Box-based temporal and spatial features, which include time trends and surrounding environmental information, are elaborately constructed, and 3) The box-based constructed features are used to first train the SVM classifier, and then the trained classifier is used to make predictions. Compared with complicated and expensive expert systems, the above design of SBOW allows the system to be small, compact, straightforward, and easy to maintain and expand at low cost. The experimental results show that, although no complicated tracking algorithm is used, SBOW can predict the storm movement trend and storm growth with reasonable skill.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{grant was}} to conduct the first-ever study of ionospheric {{variability}} on Mars. To do so, we used data from the Radio Science (RS) experiment onboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) satellite. Dr. David Hinson of the RS team at Stanford University was a most helpful and valuable colleague throughout the studies we conducted. For the initial RS datasets available from the MGS mission, there were no severe storms caused by solar wind activity, so we concentrated on day-to-day effects. This {{turned out to be}} a wise approach since understanding "normal variability" had to be done before any claim could be made about "space weather" effects. Our approach was three-fold: (1) select a good dataset for characterization of ionosphere variability at Mars, one for which excellent terrestrial data were also available. This turned out to be the period 9 - 27 March 1999; (2) once the variability at Mars was described, develop and use a new photochemical model of the martian ionosphere to find the extent to which solar variability on those days caused or contributed to the observed patterns; (3) use the results from the above, together with additional datasets from the MGS/RS experiment, to describe some practical consequences that the martian ionosphere would have upon NASA s proposed navigation and communications systems for Mars. The results of these studies showed that: (a) solar variability is the dominant source of ionospheric variability at Mars (during periods of quiet solar wind), (b) that current models do a good job in portraying such effects at the height of the ionospheric peak electron density, and (c) that ionospheric structure on Mars can affect attempts at precise <b>position-fixing</b> at Mars should relatively high (GPS-like) frequencies not be used in a Mars communications and navigation system...|$|R
40|$|The major {{burrowing}} characteristics leading to, {{during and}} after burrow construction are described. Burrow initiation was significantly correlated to crayfish size; smaller individuals beginning construction more quickly. Field burrow morphologies, examined using an optic cable video camera, showed 92 % to be simple with only a single opening (Length range 3. 5 - 79. 0 cm). Significant associations {{were found between the}} clay/sand content of stream bank sediments and crayfish burrow densities. Substrate selection experiments indicated a significant preference for artificial shelter over burrowing in clay for adult crayfish, and a significant preference for clay and artificial shelter over mud or gravel in juveniles. The rate of range extension of P. leniusculus along the Gaddesby Brook shows polynomial expansion i. e. the speed of new habitat colonisation is increasing each year. Juveniles, on the basis of burrow sizes and movements made by adult crayfish, are mainly responsible for this colonisation. Measurements of burrow water O[subscript 2], CO[subscript 2], ammonia and pH were made and showed lightly hypoxic conditions and elevated levels of ammonia in occupied burrows. Burrow irrigation rates were examined with average turnover rates being 14. 8 1 h[superscript - 1] for adults (mass range = 31. 7 - 117 g). Crayfish movements were monitored by means of radio tracking. Results indicated that activity was greatest during and immediately following dusk and that crayfish activity was significantly less in winter than summer. Most individuals were <b>position-fixed</b> at the same burrow/shelter for the duration of radio tracking, a few made occasional large movements between stationary phases of between 2 - 8 days. The maximum distance recorded by any individual in one night was 89. 6 m. During two flood events, all tagged animals maintained their pre-flood positions. Abdominal tags used to measure longer-term movements (over 2 years) gave an overall recapture rate of 19. 0 % (51 from 268) and generally showed that adult P. leniusculus remained in the same vicinity for in excess of 2 years. Hopefully this study will help in the control and management of P. leniusculus. For example, forecasts on preferred sites for population expansion and identification of sites vulnerable to bank damage can be deduced from substrate preferences. Furthermore, information on burrow construction, behaviour and irrigation rates may be relevant in biocide application and assessing the effects on bank stability. A knowledge of crayfish movement and activity is important for predicting time scale of spread and colonisation of new habitats. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|As the {{development}} of microelectronics is still driving towards further miniaturization new materials, processes and technologies are crucial for the realization of future cost effective microsystems and components. Futures ICs and passives will also decrease in size, e. g. for RF-ID applications forecast die sizes are smaller than 250 µm, thicknesses less than 50 µm and pitches way below 100 µm. Passives, if not directly integrated into the system carrier, will be even smaller. Touchless and self-assembly based procedures {{seem to be a}} promising method for handling miniaturized components not directly fabricated at the very place where they are needed. Based on the "electrowetting on dielectrics" effect (EWOD) a contactless handling technology well known from lab-on-chip applications for liquid transport, sorting, mixing and splitting is used as a basis for microelectronics assembly purposes on standard printed circuit boards. Handling shall be feasible for miniaturized components as chiplets, smallest SMDs as well as for nano-scaled building blocks. The physical principle is a change in the droplet contact angle of a droplet when immersed into an electrical field. By applying a moving e-field to the droplet, it can be guided to a defined spot. Using this effect in combination with conventional circuit board technologies might yield a moderate cost approach to exactly place fluid droplets. The process flow under evaluation starts with positioning of a droplet, containing a component, on a hydrophobic surface of the carrier substrate with rough accuracy. Using the mentioned electro wetting effect the droplet will be fast moved until the desired position is reached. The precise placement of the droplet in µm range takes place by means of field gradients and local manipulation of the carrier surface. The assembly is finished with the evaporation of the component containing droplets and the transfer of all components to the final substrate. The experimental work including electrical layout, substrate manufacturing, hydrophobic surface modification and droplet handling is combined with a simulation. The electrowetting conveying system is simulated using the Many Body Dissipative Particle Dynamics method (MDPD), where clusters of fluid molecules are represented by coarse grained particles. Wetting behavior is introduced by <b>position-fixed</b> wall particles: the force between a wall and a fluid particle is adapted such that the required contact angle emerges. The electrowetting model uses the Lippmann equation to find the influence of the applied voltage on the wetting behavior, i. e., the attractive forces between wall and fluid particles are modified to simulate the electrostatic forces on the contact line. The micro parts are also simulated by connected particles with special interaction forces for (almost) rigid body motion. Summarized the paper presents the results of a feasibility study that combines experimental and simulation work to yield a proof of concept for contactless device handling using EWOD...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory disease, affecting predominantly small joints of hands and feet. The current {{gold standard for}} assessment of radiographic progression in RA is the Sharp/van der Heijde scoring method (SvdH), scoring both bone erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN). The SvdH scoring method is observer-dependent, and its scores are on an ordinal scale with skewing {{of the distribution of}} scores towards 0. These aspects limit the sensitivity of SvdH scoring, which is increasingly an issue in the light of limited radiographic progression in early RA nowadays. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to develop an automated system for radiographic hand JSW measurement in early RA, for an objective and potentially more sensitive JSN assessment compared to the conventional scoring methods. Firstly, two methodological differences between conventional and automated methods in JSN assessment were investigated, viz. the difference in the joints to be assessed and the difference in the reading strategies. It was shown that the influence of these differences to JSN (progression) assessment was limited. Subsequently, automated methods for quantification of radiographic joint space width (JSW) of fingers and wrist were presented, respectively, including joint location detection, margin delineation and JSW measurement. Based on the proposed methods, a software package ‘Joint Space Width Quantification’ (JSQ) was developed and evaluated in a sub-group of a treatment strategy trial in early RA, in which no statistical differences in JSN progression were observed using SvdH scoring. Quantified using JSQ, the rate of yearly JSW change of the hands was higher in the group initiating placebo in addition to conventional treatment than in the group initiating prednisone in addition to conventional treatment. Moreover, the effect size was larger when using JSQ than SvdH scoring. This proof of concept study shows that the automated software package JSQ is sensitive to JSW change of the hand in an early RA clinical trial, in which only limited radiographic progression was present. As is known, assessment of radiographic progression is prone to variation due to differences in positioning during radiograph acquisition. Possible benefits of using a hand <b>position-fixing</b> mould during radiograph acquisition were thus investigated, both for the conventional SvdH scoring method and for the automated hand JSW measurement by JSQ. It was shown that using the hand mould resulted in similar reliability and better repeatability of joint damage assessment for SvdH, but not for automated JSW measurement by JSQ. However, {{with the use of the}} hand mould, a slight improvement was observed for the repeatability of the automated JSW measurement of the proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPs). To summarize, an automated system for hand JSW measurement has been developed and its value on the quantification of hand JSN in early RA has been preliminarily validated. It is recommended to incorporate the system into quantitative assessment of radiographic progression of RA in clinical trials...|$|R
