5000|$|Concerning {{business}} travel, [...] "The ease {{of international}} air travel {{and the fact}} that, for most of us, the costs are met by our employers, means that ... globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a <b>perk</b> <b>of</b> the job." [...] However, the perk usually {{is not only the}} business trip itself, but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip, and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel. Thus a conflict of interest is established, whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary. Even when such conflict is not a motivation, the <b>perk</b> <b>of</b> frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to {{gender-related}} characteristics that is congruous with the person’s biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed the <b>perks</b> <b>of</b> androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about sex roles. Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests. This reinforces the idea that gender-typing does result in certain limitations towards the construction of one’s identity.|$|E
25|$|PSV {{was founded}} by Philips {{and in the first}} decades, the club was only open to employees. The club did sign players from elsewhere, however; one of the <b>perks</b> <b>of</b> playing for PSV was that players who were offered a {{football}} contract were always offered a Philips job as well. Philips has been kit sponsor since 1982 and the PSV home ground has included the Philips name since its foundation. The company pays €7.5 million per year for the sponsoring and will remain kit sponsor until 2016. Frits Philips, chairman of the company between 1961 and 1971, became an icon for PSV during his lifetime. At five years of age, he conducted the ceremonial kick-off at the first Philips Elftal match in 1911. Frits Philips would become intertwined with PSV and Eindhoven; his 100th birthday was widely celebrated in the city. Frits Philips had his own spot in the stands until his death and would sometimes provide pep talks to the squad during half-time. PSV was often a way for Philips to introduce its technology to the public. In 1950, a match between PSV and FC Eindhoven was the first televised match in the Netherlands, with Philips supplying the technique. And in 1958, Philips installed four floodlights in the stadium.|$|E

25|$|On December 16, 1996, federal {{election}} overseers announced that Carey had defeated Hoffa, 52 percent to 48 percent. More than 475,000 ballots were {{cast in the}} election. The vote count proceeded very slowly, leading to protests from both candidates the vote-counting rules had been violated. Carey declared victory on December 15, 1996. Hoffa, however, refused to concede, claiming 31,000 challenged ballots remained to be counted. Federal officials overseeing the election confirmed the victory the next day, and certified the election on January 10, 1997. Later analyses showed that Carey drew most of his support from Teamsters locals in the East and Deep South and Canada, Hoffa led in the Midwest, and the two candidates were neck and neck in the West. Despite the victory, many observers noted that Hoffa ran a much stronger campaign than expected. Many union members were attracted by the Hoffa name, while others (particularly in the Midwest) felt Carey had negotiated weak contracts. But federal officials and labor movement insiders pointed out that Carey had undermined the power, income, prestige, and <b>perks</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of local union officials through his anti-corruption drive. Hoffa {{had the support of}} a large majority of these local leaders, and they ensured that the Hoffa message reached the rank and file and the Carey message did not.|$|E

5000|$|A family meal {{or staff}} meal {{is a group}} meal that a {{restaurant}} serves its staff outside of peak business hours.

40|$|Insulin {{synthesis}} {{and cell}} proliferation are under tight regulation in pancreatic β-cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. Dysfunction in either aspect leads to development <b>of</b> diabetes. <b>PERK</b> (EIF 2 AK 3) {{loss of function}} mutations in humans and mice exhibit permanent neonatal diabetes that is characterized by insufficient β-cell mass and reduced proinsulin trafficking and insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, we found that Perk heterozygous mice displayed lower blood glucose levels. Longitudinal studies were conducted to assess serum glucose and insulin, intracellular insulin synthesis and storage, insulin secretion, and β-cell proliferation in Perk heterozygous mice. In addition, modulation <b>of</b> <b>Perk</b> dosage specifically in β-cells showed that the glucose homeostasis phenotype <b>of</b> <b>Perk</b> heterozygous mice is determined by reduced expression <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> in the β-cells. We found that Perk heterozygous mice first exhibited enhanced insulin synthesis and secretion during neonatal and juvenile development followed by enhanced β-cell proliferation and {{a substantial increase in}} β-cell mass at the adult stage. These differences are not likely to entail the well-known function <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> to regulate the ER stress response in cultured cells as several markers for ER stress were not differentially expressed in Perk heterozygous mice. In addition to the essential functions <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> in β-cells as revealed by severely diabetic phenotype in humans and mice completely deficient for PERK, reducing Perk gene expression by half showed that intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> have a profound impact on β-cell functions and glucose homeostasis. These results suggest that an optimal level <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> expression is necessary to balance several parameters of β-cell function and growth in order to achieve normoglycemia...|$|R

500|$|The <b>Perks</b> <b>of</b> Being a Wallflower has {{appeared}} six {{times on the}} American Library Association's list of 10 most-frequently-challenged books for its content. A Wisconsin school board refused to ban the book, angering local parents, and the Glen Ellyn District 41 school board in suburban Chicago unanimously voted to reinstate the novel after it was removed from eighth-grade classrooms at Hadley Junior High School because of a parent's objection to its sexual content. In an interview, Chbosky said that he knew of two school boards which have banned the book (in Massachusetts and on Long Island). Since he [...] "didn't write {{it to be a}} controversial book," [...] he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the bans.|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies have demonstrated that}} the effects of the immune cytokine interferon-c (IFN-c) in immune-mediated demyelinating diseases are mediated, at least in part, by the unfolded protein response (UPR) in oligodendrocytes. Data indicate that some biological effects of IFN-c are elicited through activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kB (NFkB). Interestingly, {{it has been shown that}} activation of the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase (<b>PERK)</b> branch <b>of</b> the UPR triggers NF-kB activation. In this study, we showed that IFN-c-induced NF-kB activation was associated with activation <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> signaling in the oligodendroglial cell line Oli-neu. We further demonstrated that blockage <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> signaling diminished IFN-c-induced NF-kB activation in Oli-neu cells. Importantly, we showed that NF-kB activation in oligodendrocytes correlated with activation <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> signaling in transgenic mice that ectopically express IFN-c in the central nervous system (CNS), and that enhancing IFN-c-induced activation <b>of</b> <b>PERK</b> signaling further increased NF-kB activation in oligodendrocytes. Additionally, we showed that suppression of the NF-kB pathway rendered Oli-neu cells susceptible to the cytotoxicity of IFN-c, reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species. Our results indicate that the UPR is involved in IFN-c-induced NF-kB activation in oligodendrocytes and suggest that NF-kB activation by IFN-c represents one mechanism by which IFN-c exerts its effects on oligodendrocytes in immune-mediated demyelinatin...|$|R
50|$|However, soon {{afterwards}} Shirley {{found himself}} in considerable financial difficulties which eventually swallowed the family fortune. In 1586 Queen Elizabeth I appointed Sir Thomas Treasurer-at-War to the English forces serving in the Netherlands during the Dutch Revolt.
