The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate performance of this revised design of the JSS {{in terms of its}} resistance, propulsion and wake survey characteristics. Revised design featured modifications to bulbous bow and stern region to correct deficiencies observed in the Preliminary Design of the JSS. Appended Resistance: Resistance coefficient is essentially {{the same as that of}} the preliminary design up to ten knots, is slightly higher (about 2 %) at 10 knots and then becomes steadily less at all speeds above 10 knots. Maximum reduction in resistance coefficient is 12. 5 % and occurs at 20 knots (Froude number (Fr) = 0. 244). Full scale effective power shows a similar trend.

40|$|Abstract: Ship {{berthing}} {{has always}} {{considered as a}} {{multiple input multiple output}} phenomenon. And such controlling action becomes even more sophisticated when the ship approaches to a pier especially in low speed. The current and presence of wind also make the task more complicated. But, if a human brain can be replicated by any artificial intelligence technique to perform the same necessary action that human brain does, then automatic operation during complete berthing process is believed to be possible by many researchers. For that purpose as an initial stage of this research, artificial neural network is chosen as one of AI techniques for automatic berthing and to increase its learnability, concentration is given on the consistency of the teaching data provided. To do that, nonlinear programming method is used where ship’s actual behavior is predicted using famous manoeuvring mathematical group model. After successfully training, ANN controller is tested for various known and unknown condition including wind disturbances and found good results. Finally, to verify the simulated successful results, the current research is based on execution of free running experiment with the implementation of automatic ship berthing using the same trained ANN where adequate decisions for command rudder and <b>propeller</b> <b>revolution</b> taken are decided automatically depending on real time multiple input parameters...|$|R

This system can provide a continuous change of <b>propeller</b> <b>revolution</b> even in a lower revolution zone of prime mover. However, it hardy make the decelerating condition, because the slipping clutch itself can not make the negative torque. In this paper, the authors have designed a push-pull control system using two slipping clutches {{in order to improve}} the above disadvantage of the conventional slipping clutch. For the evaluation of this system, the whole propulsion system including prime mover, clutches, propeller and ship are numerically simulated using the precise mathematical model described here. From several accelerating and decelerating simulations, the following results are pointed out. 1) FPP’s revolution can be easily changed in the slipping zone by using this system, although the main engine is governed constant revolution. 2) Astern and ahead maneuvering is also performed by this system. 3) The mathematical model for this simulation including engine, clutch, propeller and ship is useful for the design and evaluation of the whole propulsion system.
