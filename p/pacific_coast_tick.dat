40|$|Rickettsia philipii (type strain "Rickettsia 364 D"), the {{etiologic}} agent of <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> fever (PCTF), is transmitted to {{people by the}} <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>tick,</b> Dermacentor occidentalis. Following the first confirmed human case of PCTF in 2008, 13 additional human cases {{have been reported in}} California, more than half of which were pediatric cases. The most common features of PCTF are the presence of at least one necrotic lesion known as an eschar (100 %), fever (85 %), and headache (79 %); four case-patients required hospitalization and four had multiple eschars. Findings presented here implicate the nymphal or larval stages of D. occidentalis as the primary vectors of R. philipii to people. Peak transmission risk from ticks to people occurs in late summer. Rickettsia philipii DNA was detected in D. occidentalis ticks from 15 of 37 California counties. Similarly, non-pathogenic Rickettsia rhipicephali DNA was detected in D. occidentalis in 29 of 38 counties with an average prevalence of 12. 0 % in adult ticks. In total, 5, 601 ticks tested from 2009 through 2015 yielded an overall R. philipii infection prevalence of 2. 1 % in adults, 0. 9 % in nymphs and a minimum infection prevalence of 0. 4 % in larval pools. Although most human cases of PCTF have been reported from northern California, acarological surveillance suggests that R. philipii may occur throughout the distribution range of D. occidentalis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The role of {{the western}} black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) versus that of other {{potential}} arthropod vectors in the epidemiology of Lyme disease was evaluated by determining the prevalence of anti-arthropod saliva antibodies (AASA) among residents (n � 104) of a community at high-risk (CHR). Salivary gland extracts prepared from I. pacificus, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> (Dermacentor occidentalis), the western cone-nose bug (Triatoma protracta), and the western tree-hole mosquito (Aedes sierrensis) were used as antigens in an ELISA. Sera from 50 residents of the San Francisco Bay region in northern California and 51 residents of Imperial County in southern California served as comparison groups. The prevalence of AASA ranged from 2 % for A. sierrensis to 79 % for I. pacificus in study subjects, 0 % for D. occidentalis to 36 % for I. pacificus among residents of the San Francisco Bay region, and 6 % for I. pacificus to 24 % for A. sierrensis in residents of Imperial County. The associations between AASA and demographic factors, potential risk factors, probable Lyme disease, and seropositivity for Borrelia burgdorferi were assessed for 85 members of the CHR. Seropositivity for I. pacificus and B. burgdorferi were significantly correlated, the relative risk of seropositivity to B. burgdorferi was about 5 (31 % versus 6 %) for subjects who were seroreactive to I. pacificus, nearly every individual who was seropositive for B. burgdorferi had elevated levels of antibodies to I. pacificus, and the mean titer for antibodies to I. pacificus was significantly higher for subjects seropositive versus those seronegative for B. burgdorferi. Together, these findings support the widely held belief that I. pacificus is th...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> <b>tick,</b> Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, {{is found}} {{throughout}} California and can harbor agents that cause human {{diseases such as}} anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and rickettsiosis 364 D. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} nonpathogenic endosymbiotic bacteria can interfere with Rickettsia co-infections in other tick species. We hypothesized that within D. occidentalis ticks, interference may exist between different nonpathogenic endosymbiotic or nonendosymbiotic bacteria and Spotted Fever group Rickettsia (SFGR). Using PCR amplification and sequencing of the rompA gene and intergenic region we identified a cohort of SFGR-infected and non-infected D. occidentalis ticks collected from San Diego County. We then amplified a partial segment of the 16 S rRNA gene and used next-generation sequencing to elucidate the microbiomes and levels of co-infection in the ticks. The SFGR R. philipii str. 364 D and R. rhipicephali were detected in 2. 3 % and 8. 2 % of the ticks, respectively, via rompA sequencing. Interestingly, next generation sequencing revealed an inverse relationship between the number of Francisella-like endosymbiont (FLE) 16 S rRNA sequences and Rickettsia 16 S rRNA sequences within individual ticks that is consistent with partial interference between FLE and SFGR infecting ticks. After excluding the Rickettsia and FLE endosymbionts from the analysis, there was a small but significant difference in microbial community diversity and a pattern of geographic isolation by distance between collection locales. In addition, male ticks had a greater diversity of bacteria than female ticks and ticks that weren’t infected with SFGR had similar microbiomes to canine skin microbiomes. Although experimental studies are required for confirmation, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that FLEs and, to a lesser extent, other bacteria, interfere with the ability of D. occidentalis to be infected with certain SFGR. The results also raise interesting possibilities about the effects of putative vertebrate hosts on the tick microbiome...|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is a {{ubiquitous}} zoonotic protozoan parasite, whose infective {{and environmentally}} resistant oocyst stages can be transported into fresh and marine waters via freshwater runoff, stormwater discharge and sewer systems. The ingestion of these oocysts, either through direct consumption {{or through the}} consumption of filter-feeding marine bivalves, can have a detrimental impact on humans {{and a variety of}} marine mammals including the threatened southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis). Terrestrial vertebrates are also susceptible to T. gondii infection since this parasite has a facultative heteroxenous life cycle that potentially includes all terrestrial vertebrates. Ticks (Acari) are known to serve as vectors for organisms that are pathogenic to humans and other animals, and it is suspected that ticks may serve as vectors for T. gondii and could facilitate transmission to terrestrial vertebrate hosts. This study evaluated the prevalence of T. gondii in populations of <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> hard <b>ticks</b> (Dermacentor spp. and Ixodes spp.) and investigated the distribution and abundance of tick species in coastal terrestrial habitats. All ticks (n = 110) within the greater Morro Bay area, California tested negative for T. gondii. A significant difference was found between the number of flagged ticks at different sites and in different seasons. This study was the first to use DNA based analysis to attempt to detect T. gondii in <b>Pacific</b> <b>coast</b> hard <b>ticks...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of tick species and the microclimate that they inhabit {{is a subject}} that is frequently studied. The known biology of the Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick,</b> Amblyomma maculatum Koch (Acari: Ixodidae), was used to conduct analyses to determine which meteorological factors regulate Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> survivorship {{in an area of}} Texas that is known for reduced occurrence of this <b>tick</b> species. Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> collection records, that indicated the collection of a single tick or multiple ticks from one animal or multiple animals at livestock markets, were obtained from the Texas Animal Health Commission. These records were used as an indicator of adult Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> abundance during each year in the 90 county study area and were used as the dependent variable in linear, quadratic, and cubic regression analyses. Independent variables used in these analyses were precipitation and differing drought thresholds during the peak activity time of the four life stages of the Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> and during combined life stage peak activity times. Linear, quadratic, and cubic regression analyses to measure the effect of precipitation during differing peak activity times of the Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> on adult Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> collection records were not statistically significant.

40|$|The aggregation-attachment-pheromone (AAP) of two {{geographic}} {{strains of}} the Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick,</b> Amblyomma maculatum Koch, was investigated to evaluate practicality of using solid-phase-microextraction (SPME) in an AAP study of Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick.</b> Solid-phase microextraction {{was used to compare}} the AAP production in two strains of fed male Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>tick</b> and demonstrate and confirm the presence of AAP in bioassays. A solid-phase-microextraction (SPME) headspace collection technique was sufficient to capture volatile organic compounds produced by fed and unfed male Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>ticks.</b> Gas chromatography analysis revealed three major volatile organic compounds were produced in significantly greater amounts (p < 0. 05) by fed males than those produced by unfed males. These volatile compounds were produced in significantly higher amount by the third day of feeding by male ticks. However, two of these volatiles remained relatively constant in their production while the primary volatile compound increased in its production until the eighth day of feeding by male Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>ticks.</b> Also, the relative abundances of these three volatile organic compounds were different between Oklahoma and Texas strains of Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>ticks.</b> The activity of AAP from fed male Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>ticks</b> was confirmed using two bioassay techniques. A petri dish bioassay revealed significantly higher numbers of female Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>ticks</b> attracted to fed-males which also produced significantly greater amounts (p < 0. 001) of volatile organic compounds detected by GC analysis. The Ytube olfactometer bioassay revealed that significantly higher numbers of females responded to fed-males or to CO 2 when compared to purified air (p < 0. 001), but the differences in female response to fed-males and CO 2 were not significant (p < 0. 391 in Oklahoma strain and p < 0. 458 in Texas strain).
