5|$|The {{army was}} not ready as of the summer of 1815, delaying the crossing. Given the harsh {{conditions}} on the mountains, the crossing could only {{be done in the}} summer season, when there is less snow. Buenos Aires did not send more provisions after the ousting of Alvear. San Martín proposed to resign and serve under Balcarce, if they would support the campaign. San Martín and Guido wrote a report in the autumn of 1816, detailing to the Supreme Director Antonio González de Balcarce the full military <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

25|$|Late on March 26, as {{it became}} obvious that the Chinese were backing away from the 3d and 25th Divisions, General Ridgway had ordered the I and IX Corps to {{continue}} to line Benton. As originally conceived, the IX Corps advance to Benton was limited to General Hoge's western forces and was intended simply to protect the I Corps' right flank. But Ridgway had since modified his <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> widening the advance to include the entire IX Corps and all other forces to the east.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} at Nalapani so discomforted the British that Lord Hastings so far varied his <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> as to forego the detachment {{of a part}} of this division to occupy Gurhwal. He accordingly instructed Colonel Mawbey to leave a few men in a strong position for the occupation of the Doon and to carry his undivided army against Amar Singh's son, Colonel Ranajor Singh Thapa, who was with about 2300 elite of the Gurkha army, at Nahan. It was further intended to reinforce the division considerably; and the command was handed over to Major-General Martindell. In the mean time Colonel Mawbey had led back the division through the Keree pass, leaving Colonel Carpenter posted at Kalsee, at the north western extremity of the Doon. This station commanded the passes of the Jumna on the main line of communication between the western and eastern portions of the Gurkha territory, and thus was well chosen for procuring intelligence.|$|E
500|$|General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau {{commanded}} a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops {{were available for}} field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. [...] Napoleon Bonaparte offered a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe's corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans. [...] Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray's army, Moreau's forces lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, while portions of Kray's army was still guarding the passes on the other side. [...] Battles at Engen and Stockach were fought on 3 May 1800 between the Moreau's and Kray's armies. [...] The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under the Joseph, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudemont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to retreat north to Messkirch, where his army enjoyed a more favorable defensive position. It also meant, however, that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the Vorarlberg was cut off.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Humphries and Maker {{published}} Germany's Western Front 1914, an edited {{translation of}} the Der Weltkrieg volumes for 1914, covering German grand strategy in 1914 and the military operations on the Western Front to early September. Humphries and Maker wrote that the interpretation of strategy put forward by Delbrück had implications about war planning and began a public debate, in which the German military establishment defended its commitment to Vernichtunsstrategie. The editors wrote that German strategic thinking was concerned with creating the conditions for a decisive (war determining) battle in the west, in which an envelopment of the French army from the north would inflict such a defeat on the French as to end their ability to continue in forty days. Humphries and Maker called this a simple device to fight France and Russia simultaneously and to defeat one of them quickly, in accordance with [...] of German military tradition. Schlieffen {{may or may not}} written the 1905 memorandum as a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> but the thinking in it was the basis for the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> devised by Moltke (the Younger) in 1914.

2500|$|The King's <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> for {{the next}} campaign, which was perhaps {{inspired}} from abroad, was more elaborate than the simple [...] "point" [...] of 1642. The King's army, based on the fortified area around Oxford, was counted sufficient to use up Essex's forces. On either hand, therefore, in Yorkshire and in the west, the Royalist armies were to fight their way inwards towards London. After that, all three armies were to converge in London in due season, and {{to cut off the}} Essex's supplies and its sea-borne revenue, and to starve the rebellion into surrender. The condition of this threefold advance was of course that the enemy should not be able to defeat the armies in detail, i.e., that he should be fixed and held in the Thames valley; this secured, there was no purely military objection against operating in separate armies from the circumference towards the centre.|$|E
