40|$|This {{research}} report aims {{to identify the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil towards economic growth in Malaysia. The increasing demand <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil has contributing to the economic growth in Malaysia. However, <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia has to compete with Indonesia and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans oil that are capable in producing more products. Thus, factors that most influence the economic growth in Malaysia need to be identified. The objectives {{of this study are}} to study the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia, to study the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybean oil in Malaysia and to determine whether capital or labor is the most factors influence the economic growth in Malaysia. The study used descriptive research design. It focused on the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia scope. It involved the selection and analysis of secondary data, journals and related write-up that are relating to <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil in Malaysia that includes the factors that affecting <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil, <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans oil, capital and labor <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil. From the analysis <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil {{it can be seen that}} the total production is increasing year by year. There are constant increase in the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil and thus concluded that there is positive growth in the palm oil industry and the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybean is one factors that have contributed to the increasing the economic growth in Malaysia. On the other hand, the regression analysis clearly shows that the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil has positive relationship with the economic growth in Malaysia, and also positive relationship between <b>production</b> <b>of</b> soybeans oil, capital and labor <b>of</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> palm oil.

5|$|With the expiry of the copyrights, {{companies}} {{around the}} world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years. <b>Productions</b> <b>of</b> Pinafore, both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by Simon Gallaher) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain. Since its original production, H.M.S. Pinafore has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers {{around the world}}. In 2003 alone, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for <b>productions</b> <b>of</b> Pinafore, Pirates and Mikado.

5|$|During {{the years}} when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also {{produced}} operas and plays by other writing teams, {{as well as other}} works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two <b>productions</b> <b>of</b> Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with Patience, two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and <b>productions</b> <b>of</b> Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J.
