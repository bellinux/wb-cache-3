5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and <b>plastic</b> <b>flow</b> becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E
25|$|Glaciers move, or flow, {{downhill}} due {{to gravity}} and the internal deformation of ice. Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50m (160ft). The pressure on ice deeper than 50m causes <b>plastic</b> <b>flow.</b> At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers. When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.|$|E
25|$|Their strength, stiffness, {{and high}} melting points are {{consequences}} of the strength and stiffness of the covalent bonds that hold them together. They are also characteristically brittle because the directional nature of covalent bonds strongly resists the shearing motions associated with <b>plastic</b> <b>flow,</b> and are, in effect, broken when shear occurs. This property results in brittleness for reasons studied {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics. Network covalent solids vary from insulating to semiconducting in their behavior, depending on the band gap of the material.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{uniaxial}} compressive {{mechanical properties}} of nanocrystalline Fe are simulated with a molecular dynamics technique and the analytical embedded-atom method. An asymmetrical mechanical phenomenon between tensile and compressive process is found, and the yield stress and flow stress in compression {{are higher than}} those in tension simulations. The compressive deformation process {{can be described as}} three characteristic regions: quasi-elastic deformation, <b>plastic</b> <b>flowing</b> deformation, and strain strengthening. During the <b>plastic</b> <b>flowing</b> deformation region, the material shows very good compressive ductibility. The plastic deformation is mainly dominated by the grain boundary atom slide...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this work, a {{three-dimensional}} elasto-plastic {{finite element model}} is used to simulate the rail mechanical response to the action of a rolling wheel. <b>Plastic</b> <b>flows</b> in the near-surface layer are computed {{as a function of}} the traction coefficient. The depth and the distortion of the plastically deformed layer are analysed versus this traction coefficient and correlated qualitatively to the microstructural observations of <b>plastic</b> <b>flows</b> in real railheads and existing theoretical studies. The deviations of the numerical results with reality are discussed in terms of the presence of a solid third body layer, neglected in the simulations...|$|R
25|$|There are two tool speeds to be {{considered}} in friction-stir welding; how fast the tool rotates and how quickly it traverses along the interface. These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex but, in general, {{it can be said that}} increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld it is necessary that the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive <b>plastic</b> <b>flow</b> required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.|$|E

40|$|Thermoformed {{plastic parts}} are {{pervasive}} in modern products. Decorating these thermoformed parts {{is a critical}} step in their manufacture. For parts with significant relief, decorating the part after it is formed can be prohibitively expensive. Prior to thermoforming, the plastic which is in flat sheets or rolls can easily be fed through a printer. However, during thermoforming the <b>plastic</b> <b>flows</b> and stretches {{to conform to the}} shape of the mold distorting the original decoration. This paper describes a device called the Image-Based Three-Dimensional Digitizer (IB 3 D) which measures the plastic deformation using vision techniques. Knowing the deformation allows us to pre-distort the graphic printed on the flat sheets such that as the <b>plastic</b> <b>flows</b> into the thermoforming mold the decoration undistorts. ...|$|R
5000|$|Hugh V. Hayes, the inventor, wrote [...] Every {{paper tape}} {{canister}} is unique.

2500|$|The {{relation}} between mechanical stress, deformation, {{and the rate}} of change of deformation can be quite complicated, although a linear approximation may be adequate in practice if the quantities are small enough. [...] Stress that exceeds certain strength limits of the material will result in permanent deformation (such as <b>plastic</b> <b>flow,</b> fracture, cavitation) or even change its crystal structure [...] and chemical composition.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the amount}} of strain (deformation) is {{proportional}} to the stress being applied, ice will act as an elastic solid. Ice will not flow until it has reached a thickness of 30 meters (98ft), but after 50 meters (164ft), small amounts of stress can result in a large amount of strain, causing the deformation to become a <b>plastic</b> <b>flow</b> rather than elastic. At this point the glacier will begin to deform under its own weight and flow across the landscape. According to the Glen–Nye Flow law, the relationship between stress and strain, and thus the rate of internal flow, can be modeled as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} is to burn out each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, [...] it {{is not subject to}} either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the <b>plastic</b> <b>flow</b> of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} plasticity theory no {{length scale}} enters the constitutive law and no size effects are predicted. In order {{to introduce a}} length scale, strain or stress gradient theories of plasticity are often used [1 - 8]. These theories are restricted to small strains.

2500|$|Chain extenders (f=2) {{and cross}} linkers (f≥3) are low {{molecular}} weight hydroxyl and amine terminated compounds that {{play an important role}} in the polymer morphology of polyurethane fibers, [...] elastomers, adhesives, and certain integral skin and microcellular foams. The elastomeric properties of these materials are derived from the phase separation of the hard and soft copolymer segments of the polymer, such that the urethane hard segment domains serve as cross-links between the amorphous polyether (or polyester) soft segment domains. This phase separation occurs because the mainly nonpolar, low melting soft segments are incompatible with the polar, high melting hard segments. The soft segments, which are formed from high molecular weight polyols, are mobile and are normally present in coiled formation, while the hard segments, which are formed from the isocyanate and chain extenders, are stiff and immobile. Because the hard segments are covalently coupled to the soft segments, they inhibit <b>plastic</b> <b>flow</b> of the polymer chains, thus creating elastomeric resiliency. Upon mechanical deformation, a portion of the soft segments are stressed by uncoiling, and the hard segments become aligned in the stress direction. This reorientation of the hard segments and consequent powerful hydrogen bonding contributes to high tensile strength, elongation, and tear resistance values.|$|E

50|$|Defects {{known as}} voids and dry resin (in {{the case of}} resin {{transfer}} molding) are possible in transfer molding and often are exacerbated by high viscosity materials. This is because a high viscosity <b>plastic</b> <b>flowing</b> through a thin mold may miss entire vacated areas, leaving air pockets. When air pockets are left {{in the presence of}} fiber, this creates a “dry” area, which prevents load from being transferred through the fibers in the dry area.|$|R
