40|$|QuestionWhat are {{clinical}} physiotherapists’ {{perceptions about}} delivering two interventions during a randomised trial: the MOBILISE trial?DesignMixed methods study using semi-structured interviews involving closed- and open-ended questions. ParticipantsThirteen physiotherapists involved in delivering the intervention for the trial. ResultsAll thirteen physiotherapists (100 %) had {{a preference for}} their patients {{to get one of}} the interventions, mostly dependent on the individual patient. Most were frustrated if their patients were not allocated to their preferred intervention but 62 % were satisfied with the intervention they delivered and 100 % would be happy to be involved in future research. Two significant themes emerged from the open-ended data: that there were both positive and negative aspects of being involved in the trial. The positive aspects included the trial's value as a way of participating in research and as a way of providing evidence for practice. The negative aspects were that the design of the trial was not always reflective of usual clinical practice and the trial's impact on departments, therapists and patients. ConclusionClinical physiotherapists had both positive and negative perceptions about delivering two different interventions in a clinical trial. However, they were all interested in participating in future research, suggesting that the positive aspects outweighed the negative.

Background Sweating is important in regulating body temperature but can be a source of loss of both fluids and electrolytes. Although the process has been studied in horses, the variation in sweat osmolarity across the body has not. Objectives This work describes an investigation to determine if there is regional variation in the osmolarity of sweat across different anatomical regions of the horse. Animals Ten horses were used in the study and were animals either stabled for riding lessons or had livery on-site. Methods Sweat samples were collected from five regions on each horse following exercise and the osmolarity measurements were made using an Osmomat 030 (Gonotec, Berlin, Germany). Values were analysed by paired t-tests and analysis of variance. Results Samples from the back and ears had statistically (P < 0. 05) lower osmolarity values than those seen for the neck and forelimb, with thigh values intermediate between the other two sets of values. Conclusions and clinical importance Previous studies have used osmolarity values based on the sweat collected from the horse's back. The current work demonstrates that these values are probably an underestimation of electrolyte loss, which may have implications for the composition and administration of rehydration compounds. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{intended}} {{outcomes of}} governance for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are made {{clear in the}} Reef Long Term Sustainability Plan (LTSP). At its broadest level, the vision for future outcomes in the GBR under the LTSP is "to ensure the Great Barrier Reef continues to improve on its Outstanding Universal Value every decade between now and 2050 to be a natural wonder for each successive generation to come" (Commonwealth of Australia, 2015). The Plan goes on to outline a range of quite specific water quality and reef health targets that it intends to achieve by 2050. This vision and associated outcomes are broadly agreed across the Australian and Queensland Governments and among key sectors with GBR interests. These outcomes are also implicitly supported internationally through recent decisions regarding the future status of the GBR taken by the United Nations Educations, Sciences and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2015). This document consists {{of a number of}} rapid assessment tables that examine the risk of systemic failure of key governance domains and subdomains that majorly influence outcomes in the GBR. In doing so, we apply the Governance Systems Analysis (GSA) framework tested in Dale et al. (2013). Table 3 provides a description and summary of the results of all the rapid assessments contained in this document. The rapid assessment tables below are organised based on their alignment with the overarching governance themes of Economic Development, Social Development, and Environmental Management. Within all themes, some governance domains are broken down into more distinct subdomains. Most rapid assessment tables in this document describe and assess the governance systems within domains and subdomains in the Environmental Management Theme. Each rapid assessment table consists of a short description of the domain or subdomain, followed by the identification and explanation of the key structural and functional components of each. Based on this, the likelihood and consequences of the each domain's or subdomain's governance system failing are identified. Each table also consequently contains a score for the likelihood of systemic failure and the consequence of systemic failure. Finally, a cumulative risk rating is then derived from the multiplication of each of the aforementioned scores. The rapid assessment tables conclude with the identification of possible or suggested areas for governance reform. The standardised scores described in Table 1 and Table 2 are used throughout this document to indicate the likelihood and consequences of systemic failure of the governance system. The use of standard criteria enables benchmarking of the target governance system over time and repeatability of the assessment/s. The multiplication of the likelihood and consequence scores provides an indication of the risk of failure of the governance system being analysed. Overview References: Commonwealth of Australia.

40|$|We study {{latching}} {{dynamics in}} the adaptive Potts model network, through numerical simulations with randomly and also weakly correlated patterns, and {{we focus on}} comparing its slowly and fast adapting regimes. A measure, Q, is used to quantify the quality of latching in the phase space spanned {{by the number of}} <b>Potts</b> states <b>S,</b> the number of connections per Potts unit C and the number of stored memory patterns p. We find narrow regions, or bands in phase space, where distinct pattern retrieval and duration of latching combine to yield the highest values of Q. The bands are confined by the storage capacity curve, for large p, and by the onset of finite latching, for low p. Inside the band, in the slowly adapting regime, we observe complex structured dynamics, with transitions at high crossover between correlated memory patterns; while away from the band latching, transitions lose complexity in different ways: below, they are clear-cut but last such few steps as to span a transition matrix between states with few asymmetrical entries and limited entropy; while above, they tend to become random, with large entropy and bi-directional transition frequencies, but indistinguishable from noise. Extrapolating from the simulations, the band appears to scale almost quadratically in the p-S plane, and sublinearly in p-C. In the fast adapting regime, the band scales similarly, and it can be made even wider and more robust, but transitions between anti-correlated patterns dominate latching dynamics. This suggest that slow and fast adaptation have to be integrated in a scenario for viable latching in a cortical system. The results for the slowly adapting regime, obtained with randomly correlated patterns, remain valid also for the case with correlated patterns, with just a simple shift in phase space. © 2017 by the authors...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 90 's, D. Sarason posed conjectures on the {{characterization}} of the boundedness of Toeplitz products on Hardy and Bergman spaces (3). The Hardy space case attracted much attention because of its close relation to the famous two-weight problem for the Hilbert transform in Real Analysis, pointed out by Cruz-Uribe in (1). Unfortunately, the Sarason conjecture for Toeplitz products on Hardy space was shown to be false by F. Nazarov around 2000 [2]. In this talk we will show that Sarason conjecture is also false in the Bergman space. Some aspects of the Bergman space setting are easier, because cancellation plays much less of {{a role in this}} setting, unfortunately the opposite happens when we look for a counterexample. We will also provide a characterization of the boundedness of Toeplitz products in the Bergman space in terms of testing conditions. This is a joint work with A.

Late Palaeozoic foliage from China {{displays}} affinities to Cycadales {{rather than}} to Bennettitales necessitating a re−evaluation of the Palaeozoic Pterophyllum species. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 55 (1) : 157 – 168. The epidermal anatomy of Pseudoctenis samchokense is described revealing non−bennettitalean characters of these leaves from the Permo−Carboniferous of China (and Korea). The specimens were originally described as Pterophyllum samchokense suggesting a bennettitalean affinity. They {{can no longer be}} considered bennettitalean since their cuticles lack the distinctive brachyparacytic stomata of that clade. Pterophyllum was originally erected as a morphogenus for seg− mented leaves from the Mesozoic and has subsequently been clearly assigned to the Bennettitales. The segmented leaves from the Permo−Carboniferous of Shanxi and Hebei, China described herein require a new ordinal and generic assign− ment since the non−bennettitalean cuticular characters documented reinforce the uncertainties in attribution of any foliage older than Late Triassic to the Bennettitales. Based on leaf−architecture and epidermal anatomical characters, the speci− mens are at best assigned to the cycadalean genus Pseudoctenis. This genus was formerly known only from Mesozoic rocks. Consequently, the specimens are highly significant, as they are among the oldest known vegetative remains of cy− cads. Re−evaluation of the affinities of all specimens assigned to Pterophyllum from Palaeozoic rocks is thus essential. Based on a review of other Permian–Carboniferous fossil leaves assigned to Pterophyllum, we conclude that none yet re...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this note, {{we develop}} {{the theory of}} {{characteristic}} function as an invariant for n-tuples of operators. The operator tuple has a certain contractivity condition put on it. This condition and the class of domains in Cn that we consider are intimately related. A typical {{example of such a}} domain is the open Euclidean unit ball. Given a polynomial P in C[z 1,z 2,…,zn] whose constant term is zero, all the coefficients are nonnegative and the coefficients of the linear terms are nonzero, one can naturally associate a Reinhardt domain with it, which we call the P-ball (Definition 1. 1). Using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space HP(C) associated with this Reinhardt domain in Cn, <b>S.</b> <b>Pott</b> constructed the dilation for a polynomially contractive commuting tuple (Definition 1. 2) [S. Pott, Standard models under polynomial positivity conditions, J. Operator Theory 41 (1999) 365 – 389. MR 2000 j: 47019]. Given any polynomially contractive commuting tuple T we define its characteristic function θT which is a multiplier. We construct a functional model using the characteristic function. Exploiting the model, we show that the characteristic function is a complete unitary invariant when the tuple is pure. The characteristic function gives newer and simpler proofs of a couple of known results: {{one of them is the}} invariance of the curvature invariant and the other is a Beurling theorem for the canonical operator tuple on HP(C). It is natural to study the boundary behaviour of θT in the case when the domain is the Euclidean unit ball. We do that and here essential differences with the single operator situation are brought out...|$|R
40|$|Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and dissections are {{two very}} serious disease {{processes}} which entail {{a high risk of}} vessel rupture and death. Their specific treatment strategies have several similarities which have formed a base for this thesis. Ever since its inception, surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta has been associated with paraparesis and paraplegia. Surgical adjuncts, i. e. distal aortic perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid drainage have been developed to minimize neurological injury. For type B aortic dissection, surgery during the acute phase has been abandoned in favor of conservative treatment with rigorous blood-pressure management. Spinal complications after extended cross-clamping of the thoracoabdominal aorta were studied comparing simple cross-clamp technique and the use of surgical adjuncts. Distal aortic perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid drainage decreased the risk of prolonged cross-clamp time during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, particularly for highest risk type II aneurysms. In a canine model the same adjuncts reduced the neurological injury after 60 min of occlusion of the descending thoracic aorta. Retrograde venous spinal cord perfusion did not prevent neurological injury. The usefulness of neurospecific proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of spinal cord injury during and after thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair was evaluated. Multilevel somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) were measured intraoperatively. SSEP accurately detected spinal cord ischemia during surgery but did not identify all patients with a postoperativIy vulnerable spinal cord. The neurospecific proteins GFAp, NFL, NSE, and S 100 B increased in CSF with spinal cord injury but the increases became evident too late to change the surgical procedure. However, GFAp shows promise as a means of identifying patients with a vulnerable spinal cord and increased risk of delayed <b>paraplegia.</b> <b>S</b> 100 B increased in scrum from the surgical trauma alone without any parallel increase in CSF. Survival, aneurysm formation, and rate of rupture were prospectively studied and the quality of life surveyed during the chronic phase in patients given conservative treatment of acute type B aortic dissection. These patients have a survival and quality of life resembling that of the normal population. The relatively low rates of aneurysm formation and aortic rupture support the strategy of reserving surgical intervention to patients with complications of acute type B aortic dissection...|$|R
