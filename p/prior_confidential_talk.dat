6000|$|... "I {{have had}} some <b>confidential</b> <b>talks</b> with Mr. James Wilder, his Grace's secretary. It was he who gave me the {{information}} about Lord Saltire's feelings." ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course there}} was a rapture, {{followed}} {{by one of the}} deliciously <b>confidential</b> <b>talks</b> which bosom friends enjoy, interspersed with tears and kisses, smiles and sighs.|$|R
60|$|After consoling {{his fair}} one, he burst into Grace's {{room in the}} evening, just at the hour when {{they used to have}} their old brotherly and sisterly <b>confidential</b> <b>talks.</b>|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, after dinner, Tadpole and Taper, {{who were}} among the guests of Mr. Ormsby, withdrew to a distant sofa, out of earshot, and indulged in <b>confidential</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|R
60|$|When the {{dangerous}} navigation was past, Mr Jones took Billy Towler apart, and, sitting {{down near the}} weather gangway, entered into a private and <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> with that sprightly youngster.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice had a dim {{perception}} of what he meant, but she would let him explain. His point of view interested her; though {{she knew that she}} ran some risk in leading him into <b>confidential</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|R
60|$|The lady rather {{enjoyed the}} {{impression}} she had made. She was not averse, either, to being seen in so prominent {{a place in}} <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> with a man of Wrayson's appearance. It might not be directly remunerative, but it was likely to do her good.|$|R
60|$|At this {{there was}} a slight sound near the door of the {{apartment}} in which this <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> was held, which induced Branwen to spring up and fling it wide open, thus disclosing the lately humiliated servitor with the blush of guilt upon his brow.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not much}} supper that Nigel Roy ate that night. The {{excitement}} resulting from his supposed discovery reduced his appetite seriously, and the intense desire to open a safety-valve {{in the way of}} <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> with some one induced a nervously absent disposition which at last attracted attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "Charlie Sloane {{will be a}} great comfort, of course," [...] agreed Anne sarcastically; whereupon {{both those}} irresponsible damsels laughed. Diana knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane; but, despite sundry <b>confidential</b> <b>talks,</b> she did not know just what Anne thought of Gilbert Blythe. To be sure, Anne herself did not know that.|$|R
60|$|Several {{men were}} disputing {{in the box}} or {{compartment}} next to them, and as they made a great noise, attracting the attention of all around, North and his friend Sam were enabled the more easily to hold <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> unnoticed, by putting their heads together and chatting low as they ate their frugal meal.|$|R
30|$|From the {{analysis}} results in Section 5, we can infer that breathiness occurring along with lower pitch and being {{closer to a}} whispered quality (as in real feeling expression, surprise/admiration, gentle/tender speaking style, <b>confidential</b> <b>talking,</b> diffidence) is more controlled and attitude-related, while the one occurring along with higher pitch (as in excitement, surprise/unexpectedness) is more spontaneous and emotion-related.|$|R

60|$|Miss Frost {{said very}} little. But she had serious <b>confidential</b> <b>talks</b> with Dr. Fordham. Dr. Fordham didn't approve, {{certainly}} he didn't--but neither {{did he see}} any great harm in it. At {{that time it was}} rather the thing for young ladies to enter the nursing profession, if their hopes had been blighted or checked in another direction! And so, enquiries were made. Enquiries were made.|$|R
60|$|He {{helped her}} to the saddle, and the {{misunderstanding}} was forgotten as they rode in <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> across the shadowy plain until {{the lights of the}} Grange twinkled out ahead. Harding left her at the forking of the trail, but he was thoughtful as he trotted home alone. He must exercise care and tact in future. Beatrice was proud, and he feared that he had not altogether won her yet.|$|R
3000|$|<b>Confidential</b> <b>talking</b> {{is often}} {{characterized}} by whisper or whispery {{voice over the}} whole utterance, being low-powered {{in comparison to the}} normal phonation (all [...] "confidential talking" [...] tokens). This speaking style also appeared when the speaker was thinking, embarrassed, or talking/asking to oneself (e.g., Figure 8 (g)). In 55 % of the tokens whispering occurred over the whole utterance, while in 25 % of the tokens, it occurred at the end portions of the utterances.|$|R
6000|$|Soon after Festing {{started for}} British Columbia Sadie drove {{over to the}} farm; because she {{had heard about the}} fight in the poolroom and {{suspected}} why he had gone. At first she found it difficult to break down Helen's reserve, but the latter could not resist her frank sympathy, and softening by degrees, allowed herself to be led into <b>confidential</b> <b>talk.</b> Sadie waited until she thought she understood the matter, and then remarked: ...|$|R
60|$|And so, {{beyond a}} warm {{grasp of the}} hand, {{on the part of}} Major Harcourt; and two or three words of hearty thanks, on that of his wife, the next time they met; Bob escaped any {{expression}} of gratitude. But the occurrence drew the two families together more closely, and Amy often came round with her father and mother, in the evening; and there were many little <b>confidential</b> <b>talks</b> between Carrie and Mrs. Harcourt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, stop, my fine fellow! Not {{quite so}} fast. If you'll wait till I've {{finished}} my little business here, I'll {{take you to}} where you'll get some warm grub for nothin', and maybe an old coat too." [...] Encouraged by such brilliant prospects, the now jovially-miserable man sat down and waited while North and Sam went to a more retired spot near the door, where they resumed the <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> that had been interrupted.|$|R
60|$|The lurking {{conviction}} {{was that}} one <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> with Ethel would cause the humming-bird to break the toils that were being wound invisibly round her. Ethel and her father knew nothing of the world, and were so unreasonable in their requirements! Meta would consult them all, and all her scruples would awaken, and perhaps Dr. Spencer might be interrogated on Sir Henry's life abroad, where Flora had a suspicion that gossip had best not be raked up.|$|R
60|$|The {{sense of}} empty space and gloom had, however, no effect upon the two elderly men who sat with a cigar box and {{decanter}} {{in front of}} them, engaged in quiet, <b>confidential</b> <b>talk.</b> Challoner was white-haired, straight, and spare, with aquiline features and piercing eyes; Greythorpe broad-shouldered and big, with a heavy-jawed, thoughtful face. They had been fast friends since they had met {{a number of years}} ago when Challoner was giving evidence before a parliamentary commission.|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought to}} myself, [...] "You could have lent him five pounds, and {{got rid of}} his {{invitation}} without the slightest difficulty." [...] If I had returned in reasonable time {{to go out with}} Romayne, we might not have met the captain--or, if we had met him, my presence would have prevented the <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> and the invitation that followed. I felt I was to blame--and yet, how could I help it? It was useless to remonstrate: the mischief was done.|$|R
6000|$|Acting on this resolve {{they pulled}} the boat up the beach, placed the oars within it, and {{returned}} to the woods. As they went they picked up a few shell-fish, and ate them raw. Thus they breakfasted; but although the meal was a poor one it was unusually pleasant, because of the hunger which had previously oppressed them, and which Billy, in a fit of <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> with his father, compared to having his [...] "interior gnawed out by rats!" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{her guests}} went {{home in the}} starlit December dusk, Miss Cornelia walked {{part of the way}} with them and had a long <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> with Mrs. Grant. When she {{returned}} it was to find Hannah groaning in and over the kitchen and the schoolteacher dreamily trying to clean some molasses off his boots with the kitchen hairbrush. Long-suffering Miss Cornelia rescued her property and despatched Mr. Palmer into the woodshed to find the shoe-brush. Then she sat down and laughed.|$|R
60|$|There was a faint flush on {{his pale}} cheeks {{and his eyes}} were {{flashing}} brightly, as he looked at us standing close together. It might have been the result of his recent conversation, of course; but, coupled with his frowning brow and quick, suspicious glance, it looked a great deal more like a sudden fit of anger at seeing us engaged in what appeared like a <b>confidential</b> <b>talk.</b> But there was no trace of it in his tone when he addressed us.|$|R
60|$|The Efficient Baxter bicycled broodingly to Market Blandings for tobacco. He brooded {{for several}} reasons. He {{had just seen}} Aline Peters and George Emerson in <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> on the upper terrace, {{and that was one}} thing which {{exercised}} his mind, for he suspected George Emerson. He suspected him nebulously as a snake in the grass; as an influence working against the orderly progress of events concerning the marriage that had been arranged and would shortly take place between Miss Peters and the Honorable Frederick Threepwood.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was at that}} time, too, {{that she}} {{suggested}} I should take up my quarters in her house in the street of the Consuls. There were certain advantages in that move. In my present abode my sudden absences {{might have been in}} the long run subject to comment. On the other hand, the house in the street of Consuls was a known out-post of Legitimacy. But then it was covered by the occult influence of her who was referred to in <b>confidential</b> <b>talks,</b> secret communications, and discreet whispers of Royalist salons as: âMadame de Lastaola.â ...|$|R
6000|$|That day Gillian had her <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> {{with her}} mother---a talk {{that she never}} forgot, trying to dig {{to the roots of}} her {{failures}} in a manner that only the true mother-confessor of her own child can perhaps have patience and skill for, and that only when she has studied the creature from babyhood. The concatenation, ending (if it was so to end) in the committal to Avoncester Jail, and beginning with the interview over the rails, had to be traced link by link, and was almost as long as 'the house that Jack built.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You!" [...] {{repeated}} McKinstry quietly, reinstalling {{the hand}} Ford {{had attempted to}} withdraw. [...] "I ain't sayin' ye either know'd it or kalkilated on it. But it war so. Ef ye'd hark to me, and meander on a little, I'll tell ye HOW it war. I don't mind walkin' a piece YOUR way, for if we go towards the ranch, and the hounds see me, they'll set up a racket and bring out the old woman, and then good-by to any <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> betwixt you and me. And I'm, somehow, kammer out yer." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{drove down}} to the Ashton depot, and there Sam and Grace said good-bye to the others, who were going on to the home farm at Valley Brook and then to New York City. On the return to the seminary Sam had hoped {{to have a long}} talk and an {{understanding}} with Grace, but unfortunately two girls turned up who wished to get back to Hope, and there was nothing for the Rover boy to do but to invite them to ride along, so that the <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> between them had to be abandoned.|$|R
60|$|Bernard lighted a {{cigar and}} pondered. He was {{satisfied}} and somewhat amused. It {{would not have}} cost him much to banish Jim's difficulties {{and he would have}} liked to earn his gratitude, but was glad the other had refused. It was better that Jim's troubles about money should not be banished yet. He was something of a romantic fool; but Bernard knew Evelyn was not. By and by he led Jim into <b>confidential</b> <b>talk</b> about his investments in Canada and his plans for developing his new estate, and then let him go.|$|R
