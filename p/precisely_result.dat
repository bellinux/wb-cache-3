40|$|XML {{is a new}} {{standard}} for representing and exchanging information on the Internet. An XML data is a data that is tagged by XML elements. Such an XML data can be retrieved not only by a Boolean connection with keywords on the Internet. Keyword-based information retrieval does not <b>precisely</b> <b>result</b> in user requests partly because user requests cannot be properly conveyed. Either too many or too few matches are produced. It is not trivial to formulate what to retrieve for a "good" sized query-result. In conventional approaches, a database schema is useful for users to formulate queries and for query processing. Likewise, this paper proposes a method of schema extraction for XML data collection. Obtaining one single schema {{is not sufficient to}} serve for the good size of information retrieval and adaptively for the various requests from Internet users. To support this, schemas are then levelized with respect to the frequency of topological data structures in a database. The topological structural information of these schemas is used to formulate queries and further to rewrite queries for relaxation and restriction. Without modification, the method proposed in this paper is used not only for multimedia XML data collections but also for general XML databases...|$|E

Using data of nonfinancial firms in Taiwan from 1981 to 2009, this study finds that corporate liquidity is lower when government deficit is higher.

30|$|As is {{seen from}} Figs.  16, 17 and 18, when {{displacement}} {{was less than}} about 50  mm, an approximate consistency agreement with the experimental results was obtained {{through the use of}} the proposed model. The relevant error may be derived mainly from three aspects: first, the assumption that the normal contact stress acts on the whole contact surface but not the real contact surface during the theoretical analysis (Eq.  4), which <b>precisely</b> <b>resulted</b> from the difficulties in determining the real contact surface during the cyclic loading. Therefore, the FE model result can better agree with the test result when the displacement exceeded 50  mm. Second, the dimensional errors in the specimens fabrication and the installation errors induced gap between the mortise and tenon surfaces also contributed to the resulted errors. Third, the ignorance of the cyclic loading induced smooth and slippy of wood surface, led to the overestimation of the simulation result than the experiment result during the whole loading process.|$|R

40|$|A paper {{describes}} attitude-control algorithms {{using the}} combination of magnetic actuators with reaction wheel assemblies (RWAs) or other types of actuators such as thrusters. The combination of magnetic actuators {{with one or two}} RWAs aligned with different body axis expands the two-dimensional control torque to three-dimensional. The algorithms can guarantee the spacecraft attitude and rates to track the commanded attitude precisely. A design example is presented for nadir-pointing, pitch, and yaw maneuvers. The results show that precise attitude tracking can be reached and the attitude- control accuracy is comparable with RWA-based attitude control. When there are only one or two workable RWAs due to RWA failures, the attitude-control system can switch to the control algorithms for the combined magnetic actuators with the RWAs without going to the safe mode, and the control accuracy can be maintained. The attitude-control algorithms of the combined actuators are derived, which can guarantee the spacecraft attitude and rates to track the commanded values <b>precisely.</b> <b>Results</b> show that precise attitude tracking can be reached, and the attitude-control accuracy is comparable with 3 -axis wheel control...|$|R
