40|$|The <b>preplate</b> is a {{transient}} {{layer of the}} developing cerebral cortex which is comprised of the earliest generated cortical neurons. <b>Preplate</b> neurons are a heterogenous population of future Cajal-Retzius neurons and future subplate neurons, which are derived from multiple sources of progenitors.

40|$|In the mutant mouse reeler, the {{tangential}} {{distribution of}} thalamocortical fibers is essentially normal, even though neurons of the cortical plate accumulate below the entire earlyborn <b>preplate</b> population (Caviness et al., 1988). This seems {{incompatible with the}} hypothesis that cells of the subplate (the lower component of the <b>preplate</b> in normal mammals) form an axonal scaffold that guides thalamic fibers and act as temporary targets for them (Blakemore and Molna´ r, 1990, Shatz et al., 1990). We used carbocyanine dyes to trace projections in wild-type and reeler mice between embryonic day 13 and postnatal day 3. <b>Preplate</b> formation and early extension of corticofugal fibers to form a topographic array are indistinguishable in the two phenotypes. So too are the emergence of thalamic axons in topographic order through the primitive internal capsule, their meeting with <b>preplate</b> axons, and their distribution over the <b>preplate</b> scaffold. Distinctive differences appear after the cortical plate begins to accumulate below the <b>preplate</b> of reeler, causing the <b>preplate</b> axons to form oblique fascicles, running through the cortical plate. Thalamic axons then pass through the plate within the same fascicles and accumulate in the “superplate” layer for; 2 – 3 d, before defasciculating and plunging down to terminate deep in the cortical plate, creating the curious “looping” pattern seen in the adult. Thus, thalamocortical innervation in reeler follows the same algorithm of development but {{in relation to the}} misplaced population of early-born neurons.

40|$|The {{secreted}} ligand Reelin {{is thought}} to regulate the translocation and positioning of prospective layer 6 (L 6) neurons into the <b>preplate,</b> a plexus of neurons overlying the ventricular zone. We examined wild type and Reelin-deficient cortices and found that L 6 neurons were equivalently positioned beneath the pia {{during the period of}} <b>preplate</b> splitting and initial cortical plate (CP) formation. The absence of detectable L 6 ectopia in “reeler” cortices at this developmental time point indicates that Reelin-signaling might not regulate L 6 neuron migration or gross positioning during <b>preplate</b> splitting. To explore the acute response of L 6 neurons to Reelin, subpial injections of Reelin were made into Reelin-deficient explants. Reelin injection caused L 6 neurons to orient their nuclei and polarize their Golgi toward the pia while initiating exuberant dendritic (MAP 2 +) outgrowth within 4 h. This rapid Reelin-dependent neuronal orientation and alignment created CP-like histology without any significant change in the mean position of the population of L 6 neurons. Conversely, subplate cells and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan immunoreactivity were found at significantly deeper positions from the pial surface after injection, suggesting that Reelin partially rescues <b>preplate</b> splitting within 4 h.

In the present overview, we propose a novel classification of non-subplate pioneer neurons in rodents into two subtypes. In rats, the neurons of the first subtype are calbindin+ (CB), calretinin+ (CR) and L 1 + and are situated in {{the upper part of}} the <b>preplate</b> before its partition. Neurons of the second subtype are TAG- 1 + and are located slightly deeper to the previous population in the <b>preplate.</b> After the <b>preplate</b> partition, the CB+, CR+ and L 1 + neurons remain in the marginal zone whereas TAG- 1 + neurons become transiently localized in the upper cortical plate.

40|$|The {{development}} of the layered cerebral cortex starts with a process called <b>preplate</b> splitting. <b>Preplate</b> splitting involves the establishment of prospective cortical layer 6 (L 6) neurons within a plexus of pioneer neurons called the <b>preplate.</b> The forming layer 6 splits the <b>preplate</b> into a superficial layer of pioneer neurons called the marginal zone and a deeper layer of pioneer neurons called the subplate. Disruptions of this early developmental event by toxin exposure or mutation are associated with neurological disease including severe intellectual disability. This review explores recent findings that reveal the dynamism of gene expression and morphological differentiation during this early developmental period. Over 1000 genes show expression increases of ≥ 2 fold during this period in differentiating mouse L 6 neurons. Surprisingly, 88 % of previously identified non-syndromic intellectual disability (NS-ID) genes are expressed at this time and show an average expression increase of 1. 6 fold in these differentiating L 6 neurons. This changing genetic program must, in part, support the dramatic cellular reorganizations that occur during <b>preplate</b> splitting. While different models have been proposed {{for the formation of}} a layer of L 6 cortical neurons within the <b>preplate,</b> original histological studies and more recent work exploiting transgenic mice suggest that the process is largely driven by the coordinated polarization and coalescence of L 6 neurons rather than by cellular translocation or migration. The observation that genes associated with forms of NS-ID are expressed during very early cortical development raises the possibility of studying the relevant biological events at a time point when the cortex is small, contains relatively few cell types, and few functional circuits.

By using culture experiments and grafts on organotypic slices, we show that the earliest neurons in the dorsal cortex extend axons before and more rapidly than the earliest neurons in the lateral cortex. In contrast to the lateral cortex, the dorsal cortex differentiates neurons migrating along axons in vitro. These cells express markers of the GABAergic lineage. Early differences between the two regions suggest that the dorsal part of the cortex generates early neurons with particular intrinsic properties that may in turn specifically influence the later development of the cortical plate in this domain...|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} generated {{cells of}} the mammalian cerebral cortex form the <b>preplate</b> layer (PPL). The subsequently born cortical plate (CP) cells split this layer into the superficial layer I (LI) and the deep subplate (SP). The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this event are unclear. To investigate {{the role of the}} cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk 5) and its activator p 35 in <b>preplate</b> splitting, we used Nissl staining, carbocyanine dye tracing, cell birthdating, and immunohistochemistry for calretinin (CalR) in p 35 and Cdk 5 knockout mice. Our data demonstrated changes in early cortical lamination and aberrant thalamic axon trajectories in these mice. Specifically, LI was thicker, and cell-dense and thalamic axons did not accumulate in the SP layer before invading the CP. Instead, they grew past the SP and more superficial cortical layers and coursed obliquely toward the pial surface. This behavior has been previously observed in reeler mice and suggests a defect in PPL splitting. CalR immunohistochemistry and bromo-deoxyuridine birthdating confirmed the abnormality in position of the earliest generated cortical cells of mutants. These observations suggest that the p 35 /Cdk 5 pathway plays a role in <b>preplate</b> splitting in addition to regulating layer formation...|$|R
5000|$|Cerebral organoids also possess {{functional}} cerebral cortical neurons. These neurons must {{form on the}} radially organized cortical plate. The marker TBR1 {{is present}} in the <b>preplate,</b> the precursor to the cortical plate, and is present, along with MAP2, a neuronal marker, in 30-day-old cerebral organoids. These markers are indicative of a basal neural layer similar to a <b>preplate.</b> These cells are also apically adjacent to a neutral zone and are reelin+ positive, which indicates the presence of Cajal-Retzius cells. The Cajal-Retzius cells are important to the generation of cortical plate architecture. [...] The cortical plate is usually generated inside-out such that later born neurons migrate to the top superficial layers. This organization is also present in cerebral organoids based on genetic marker testing. Neurons that are early born have marker CTIP2 and are located adjacent to the TBR1 exhibiting <b>preplate</b> cells. Late born neurons with markers SATB2 and BRN2 are located in a superficial layer, further away from the <b>preplate</b> than the early born neurons suggesting cortical plate layer formation. Additionally, after 75 days of formation, cerebral organoids show a rudimentary marginal zone, a cell-poor region. The formation of layered cortical plate is very basic in cerebral organoids and suggests the organoid lacks the cues and factors to induce formation of layer II-VI organization. The cerebral organoid neurons can, however form axons as shown by GFP staining. GFP labeled axons have been shown to have complex branching and growth cone formation. Additionally calcium dye imaging has shown cerebral organoids to have Ca2+ oscillations and spontaneous calcium surges in individual cells. The calcium signaling can be enhanced through glutamate and inhibited through tetrodotoxin.|$|R
