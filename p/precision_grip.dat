40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that neurophysiological activation during action planning depends on the orientation to initial or final action goals for <b>precision</b> <b>grips.</b> However, the neural signature for a distinct class of grasping, power grips, is still unknown. The aim {{of the present study was}} to differentiate between cerebral activity, by means of event-related potentials (ERPs), and its temporal organization during power grips executed with an emphasis on either the initial or final parts of movement sequences. In a grasp and transportation task, visual cues emphasized either the grip (the immediate goal) or the target location (the final goal). ERPs differed between immediate and final goal-cued conditions, suggesting different means of operation dependent on goal-relatedness. Differences in mean amplitude occurred earlier for power grips than for recently reported <b>precision</b> <b>grips</b> time-locked to grasping over parieto-occipital areas. Time-locked to final object placement, differences occurred within a similar time window for power and <b>precision</b> <b>grips</b> over frontal areas. These results suggest that a parieto-frontal network of activation is of crucial importance for grasp planning and execution. Our results indicate that power grip preparation and execution for goal-related actions are controlled by similar neural mechanisms as have been observed during <b>precision</b> <b>grips,</b> but with a distinct temporal pattern...|$|R
40|$|Functional and {{allometric}} {{analyses of}} {{the hand of the}} late Miocene ape Oreopithecus bambolii (Tuscany, Italy) reveal a series of features that reflect an improved grasping capability including firm pad-to-pad <b>precision</b> <b>gripping</b> that apes are unable to perform. Related features such as hand length, relative thumb length, a deep and large insertion area for the tendon of the long thumb flexor, and the form of the metacarpal 2 /capitate articulation are not present in extant or fossil apes. In these features, the Oreopithecus hand closely matches the pattern of early hominids, presumably as a response to similar functional demands...|$|R
25|$|It is possible, though, that a {{more likely}} {{scenario}} {{may be that the}} specialized <b>precision</b> <b>gripping</b> hand (equipped with opposable thumb) of Homo habilis preceded walking, with the specialized adaptation of the spine, pelvis, and lower extremities preceding a more advanced hand. And, it is logical that a conservative, highly functional adaptation be followed by a series of more complex ones that complement it. With Homo habilis, an advanced grasping-capable hand was accompanied by facultative bipedalism, possibly implying, assuming a co-opted evolutionary relationship exists, that the latter resulted from the former as obligate bipedalism was yet to follow. Walking may have been a by-product of busy hands and not vice versa.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the earlier}} {{significant}} contributors {{to the study of}} hand grips was orthopedic primatologist and paleoanthropologist John Napier, who proposed organizing the movements of the hand by their anatomical basis as opposed to work done earlier that had only used arbitrary classification. Most of this early work on hand grips had a pragmatic basis as it was intended to narrowly define compensable injuries to the hand, which required an understanding of the anatomical basis of hand movement. Napier proposed two primary prehensile grips: the <b>precision</b> <b>grip</b> and the power grip. The precision and power grip are defined by the position of the thumb and fingers where: ...|$|E

Examples of a <b>precision</b> <b>grip</b> are writing with a pencil, opening a jar with the fingertips alone, and gripping a ball (only if the ball is not tight against the palm).|$|E
50|$|The {{primary role}} of the hand itself is {{grasping}} and manipulation; tasks for which the hand has been adapted to two main grips — power grip and <b>precision</b> <b>grip.</b> In a power grip an object is held against the palm and in a <b>precision</b> <b>grip</b> an object is held with the fingers, both grips are performed by intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles together. Most importantly, the relatively strong thenar muscles of the thumb and the thumb's flexible first joint allow the special opposition movement that brings the distal thumb pad {{in direct contact with}} the distal pads of the other four digits. Opposition is a complex combination of thumb flexion and abduction that also requires the thumb to be rotated 90° about its own axis. Without this complex movement, humans {{would not be able to}} perform a <b>precision</b> <b>grip.</b>|$|E
40|$|To perform {{grasping}} movements, {{the hand}} is shaped {{according to the}} form of the target object and the intended manipulation, which in turn depends on the context of the action. The anterior intraparietal cortex (AIP) is strongly involved in the sensorimotor transformation of grasping movements, but {{the extent to which it}} encodes context-specific information for hand grasping is unclear. To explore this issue, we recorded 571 single-units in AIP of two macaques during a delayed grasping task, in which animals were instructed by an external context cue (LED) to perform power or <b>precision</b> <b>grips</b> on a handle that was presented in various orientations. While 55 % of the recorded neurons encoded the object orientation from the cue epoch on, the number of cells encoding the grip type increased from 25 % during the cue epoch to 58 % during movement execution. Furthermore, a classification of cells according to the time of their tuning onset revealed differences in the function and anatomical location of early- versus late-tuned cells. In a cue separation task, when the object was presented first, neurons representing power or <b>precision</b> <b>grips</b> were activated simultaneously until the actual grip type was instructed. In contrast, when the grasp type instruction was presented before the object, type information was only weakly represented in AIP, but was strongly encoded after the grasp target was revealed. We conclude that AIP encodes context specific hand grasping movements to perceived objects, but in the absence of a grasp target, the encoding of context information is weak...|$|R

40|$|Force {{exertion}} {{is critical}} in grasping and holding activities at sub-maximal levels. Exertion misjudgments lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) impairing performance and productivity. Published literatures on grasping have addressed the force balance and endurance issues for non-prehensile movements of hand. However, little information {{is available on the}} force exerted in <b>precision</b> <b>gripping</b> employed in health care. Professionals, especially dental hygienists, when treating patients adopt awkward postures for extended period leading to cumulative trauma. Literatures on cumulative trauma have identified force exertion to be an important risk factor. Lack of information on fatigue with <b>precision</b> <b>gripping</b> motivated this research to establish force-endurance relation for simulated dental task. ^ A preliminary study was performed to estimate the force exerted during sub-maximal three-jaw chuck pinch and maximal three-finger pencil-hold tasks. Exertions were recorded with force sensing resistors (FSR). The tasks were evaluated for four hand conditions: Bare hand, Vinyl, Latex and Nitryl gloves. Results from the preliminary study provided directions to investigate the fundamental research question of how long can dental professional exert and hold using modified pencil-hold before fatiguing. This research question was addressed by developing a mathematical relation between force exertions and time for a simulated dental task. Periodontal scaling was identified as the representative healthcare task and five participants performed the simulated scaling task on a typodont. The average scaling force was found to be 53. 95 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). A limiting exertion level of 40 %MVC was established for the development of force-endurance relation to accommodate the average scaling force exertion. ^ Mathematical prediction equations for endurance times were developed and validated using the data from a total of sixty participants that included 30 experts and 30 novices. Similarly, relation between perceived and actual force exertions were developed and validated. The force-endurance models and the relations between perceived and actual exertions were found to follow a third-order polynomial. This research is first of its kind on precision grasps used in dentistry whose implications and recommendations have been discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} primate {{grasping}} and manipulative behaviours in captivity have highlighted, among others, two human abilities that are generally considered unique {{compared with other}} primates: (1) the use of forceful precision and power squeeze grips involving {{the use of the}} thumb, and (2) a species-wide dominant use of one hand (usually the right hand), known as laterality. However, recent research has highlighted a diversity of <b>precision</b> and power <b>grips</b> in general among many non-human primates, and there is much debate around the potential for population-level or species-wide laterality in non-human primates. The majority of this research to date has been done on captive primates performing specific manipulative tasks, which may bias or confound these species comparisons. Comparatively little research has been done on hand use in wild primates, especially during natural, non-manipulative activities, including locomotion. Here, we investigate hand use during locomotor and non-locomotor behaviours in wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda), wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus, Taï National Park, Cote d’Ivoire) and chimpanzees kept under semi-natural conditions (Pan troglodytes ssp., Chimfunshi Wildlife Trust, Zambia). Preliminary results propose that hand grips are similar between gorillas and chimpanzees during the manipulation of common object types.

40|$|Although {{there is}} a wealth of {{behavioral}} data regarding grasping movements in non-human primates, how posture influences the kinematics of prehensile behavior is not yet clearly understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine and compare kinematic descriptions of grip behaviors while primates (macaque monkeys) were in a sitting posture or when stopping after quadrupedal locomotion (i. e., tripedal stance). Video footage taken while macaques grasped objects was analyzed frame-by-frame using digitalization techniques. Each of the two grip types considered (power and <b>precision</b> <b>grips)</b> was found to be characterized by specific, distinct kinematic signatures for both the reaching and the grasping components when those actions were performed in a sitting position. The grasping component did not differentiate in relation to the type of grip that was needed when, instead, the prehensile action took place in a tripedal stance. Quadrupedal locomotion affected the concomitant organization of prehensile activities determining in fact a similar kinematic patterning for the two grips regardless of the size of the object to be grasped. It is suggested that using a single kinematic grip patterning for all prehensile activities might be both the by-product of planning a grasping action while walking and a way to simplify motor programming during unstable tripedal stance...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the metrics of space, time and other magnitudes relevant for action are coupled through a generalized magnitude system that also contribute to number representation. Several studies capitalized on stimulus- response compatibility effects to show that numbers map onto left-right representations and grasp representations as a func- tion of their magnitude. However, the tasks typically used do not allow disentangling magnitude from serial order process- ing. Here, we devised a working memory (WM) task where participants had to remember random sequences of numbers and perform a precision/whole-hand grip (Experiment 1) or a uni-manual left/right button press (Experiment 2) in response to numbers presented during the retention interval. This task does allow differentiating the interference of number magni- tude and serial order with each set of responses. Experiment 1 showed that <b>precision</b> <b>grips</b> were initiated faster than whole- hand grips in response to small numbers, irrespective of their serial position in WM. In contrast, Experiment 2 revealed an advantage of right over left button presses as serial position increased, without any influence of number magnitude.
