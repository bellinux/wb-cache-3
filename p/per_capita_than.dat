The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated {{a process of}} rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some {{of the largest in}} the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, {{as a result of an}} interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>than</b> any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The state {{forecast}} continued revenue {{declines in}} 2010 {{that would result}} in a $1.7 billion budget shortfall if the state budget grew at its normal rate. Daniels submitted a two-year $27.5 billion spending plan to the General Assembly which would result in a $500 million surplus that would be used to rebuild the state reserve funds to $1 billion. He proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures, including employee furloughing, spending reductions, freezing state hiring, freezing state employee wages, and a host of administrative changes for state agencies. The state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes, and by 2011, Indiana had the fewest state employees <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>than</b> any other state—a figure Daniels touted to say Indiana had the nation's smallest government.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly {{pushed for the}} {{creation}} of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. Mullaly noted that New York City had less parkland <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>than</b> many major European cities, and that the 1853 construction of Central Park had raised property values around the park immediately after construction. His association sent out pamphlets to high-profile New Yorkers, advocating for a new park. However, controversies arose over the proposals for new parks in the Bronx, and so the city did not authorize a commission for the planned new parks. Since the city refused to make a park commission, the New York Park Association appealed to the New York State Legislature instead. On April 19, 1883, the state passed a law authorizing a seven-person commission headed by association member Luther Marsh, which would be responsible for scouting out sites for future parks in the 23rd and 24th wards of New York City (now the portion of the Bronx that is west of the Bronx River). Mullaly was named the secretary, In June 1883, the commission visited the park site, and by January 1884, Marsh had drafted a bill to the New York State Legislature regarding a proposed park system in the Bronx, comprising six parks connected by three parkways.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the major}} port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men {{expelled}} from the military who had decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. By 1969 the Kinsey Institute believed San Francisco had more gay people <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>than</b> any other American city; when the National Institute of Mental Health asked the Institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for Tom O'Horgan, a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of Hair. McKinley was offered {{a job in the}} New York City production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed to Milk so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia, Milk let his hair grow long. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} results {{confirm the}} existence of a joint effect between region-level GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> and worker age on labour market transition rates in Italy. This supports our assumption of different labour market transition probabilities based on the phase of the life cycle and the economic characteristics of the territory, ceteris paribus. For example, we observe that for a young male (20 – 30 years old) with a high school diploma and employed under a fixed-term contract in a small service sector firm, the probability that he remains employed in the next 12 months when residing in a territory with a medium-high GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> (more <b>than</b> 25, 000 euros) is two times higher than that for individuals with the same characteristics but residing in an area with a low GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> (less <b>than</b> 15 – 20, 000 euros). This gap is slightly larger for females. The probability that a female employed at time T is unemployed in the next 12 months when residing in a region with a medium-high GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> (more <b>than</b> 25, 000 euros) is four times lower than that for females residing in an area with a low GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> (less <b>than</b> 15 – 20, 000 euros). Similar gaps were observed for the probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment. For workers of both genders, the probability of transitioning to employment from unemployment at older ages seems to be a cross-cutting issue, independent of the level of regional GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita.</b> A caveat in interpreting the results of our analysis is that we take into account only people who do not migrate to a different area of residence during the two observation periods (for instance, from an area with a low GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> to another area with a high GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita).</b>|$|R
