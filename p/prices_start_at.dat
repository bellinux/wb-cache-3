5000|$|In the 2000s (decade) radio-based [...] "atomic clocks" [...] became {{common in}} retail stores; as of 2010 <b>prices</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> around US$15 in many countries. Clocks may have other {{features}} such as indoor thermometers and weather station functionality. These use signals transmitted by the appropriate transmitter for {{the country in which}} they are to be used. Depending upon signal strength they may require placement in a location with a relatively unobstructed path to the transmitter and need fair to good atmospheric conditions to successfully update the time. Inexpensive clocks keep track of the time between updates, or in their absence, with a non-disciplined quartz-crystal clock, with the accuracy typical of non-radio-controlled quartz timepieces. Some clocks include indicators to alert users to possible inaccuracy when synchronization has not been recently successful.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{takes at least}} a month or month and a half. The boats themselves are 12m long, 1.72m wide (at midship), 95 cm. bow, 75 cm. stern and 60.5 cm. in depth. The total weight of the boat including baton, bench, and hitters have to be 210-230 kg but may not weigh less than 200 kg (excluding oars and equipment). The material used for years was entirely of wood, cedar and beech. Currently, material is carbon fiber and kevlar to make traineras with aeronautical techniques similar to those applied {{in the construction of the}} plane Airbus 380, which amongst other things are fitted with GPS systems, creating better boats but also pushing up the prices for them. The life of a boat at a top club is usually two or three years. In the 1970s a trainera cost around 45,000 pesetas, 2008 <b>prices</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> around €25,000.|$|E

40|$|While {{projected}} milk {{prices are}} a primary determinant {{of the financial}} viability of the representative dairies, the prices of feed crops and cattle prices can also have an impact. Most of the dairies produce hay, silage, and other crops and are often net buyers. Commodity prices {{have a major impact}} on dairy returns because feed represents the number one cost for dairies. With the recent increase in demand for corn, prices are projected to increase, potentially affecting rations and feed costs. Projected milk and livestock prices for FAPRI’s August 2007 Baseline are presented in Table 1. In general, milk prices are projected to decrease each year from 2007 though 2012 after the large increase in price from 2006 to 2007. Cattle prices are expected to decrease with the downturn in the cattle cycle. Specifically, prices for milk and cattle are projected to move as follows: • U. S. All Milk price is expected to decrease from $ 19. 07 /cwt in 2007 to $ 15. 72 /cwt in 2012. • The localized prices for each state move with the U. S. All Milk price. • Feeder cattle prices are projected to decrease from $ 117. 53 /cwt in 2007 to $ 102. 03 /cwt in 2012. • Cull cow <b>prices</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> $ 50. 94 /cwt in 2007, increase to $ 52. 98 /cwt in 2008 and then decrease to $ 47. 14 /cwt by 2012. Projected crop prices for FAPRI’s August 2007 Baseline are also summarized in Table 1. Individual crop prices are projected to move as follows: • The U. S. all hay prices are expected to fall from $ 123. 20 /ton in 2007 to $ 110. 86 /ton in 2009 and then rise to $ 111. 52 /ton in 2012. • Corn <b>prices</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> $ 3. 10 /bu in 2007 and increases in 2008 to $ 3. 38 /bu and then falls to $ 3. 25 /bu by 2012. • Soybean Meal is expected to fall from $ 207. 88 /ton in 2007 to $ 192. 68 /ton by 2012. Projected annual rates of change for variable cash expenses are summarized in Table 2. The rate of change in input prices comes from FAPRI’s August 2007 Baseline. Based on projections from Global Insight, annual interest rates paid for intermediate-term and long-term loans and interest rates earned on savings are also reported in Table 2. Assumed annual rates of change in land values over the 2007 - 2012 period are provided by the FAPRI Baseline and are projected to range between a 3. 51 % and 13. 68 % per year. ...|$|E
40|$|We employ {{laboratory}} {{methods to}} study stability of competitive equilibrium in Scarf's economy (International Economic Review, 1960). Tatonnement theory predicts that prices are globally unstable for this economy, i. e. unless <b>prices</b> <b>start</b> <b>at</b> the competitive equilibrium they oscillate without converging. Anderson et al. (Journal of Economic Theory, 2004) report that in laboratory double auction markets, {{prices in the}} Scarf economy do indeed oscillate with no clear sign of convergence. We replicate their experiments and confirm that tatonnement theory predicts the direction of price changes remarkably well. Prices are globally unstable with adverse effects for the economy's efficiency and the equitable distribution of the gains from trade. We also introduce a novel market mechanism where participants submit demand schedules and prices are computed using Smale's global Newtonian dynamic (American Economic Review, 1976). We show that for the Scarf economy, submitting a competitive schedule, i. e. a set of quantities that maximize utility taking prices as given, is a weakly dominant strategy. The resulting outcome corresponds to the unique competitive equilibrium of the Scarf economy. In experiments that employ the schedule market, prices do not oscillate but instead converge quickly to the competitive equilibrium. Besides stabilizing prices, the schedule market is more efficient and results in highly egalitarian outcomes...|$|E
