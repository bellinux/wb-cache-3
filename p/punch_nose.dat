The most remarkable feature of fine-blanking is the completely smooth edge obtained on the blanked part which can be free of tearing over the whole thickness. However, research on effects of the change of tool geometry on the fine-blanked edges is limited. Therefore, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} investigate how the tool geometry affects the fine-blanked edge quality by varying the <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius. Five punches with various nose radii (Rp), 0. 00 mm, 0. 25 mm, 0. 50 mm, 0. 75 mm and 1. 00 mm were used for fine-blanking parts, whilst the nose radius of the die remained the same throughout the study. Cold-rolled carbon steel sheet (SS 400) with thickness of 5 mm was selected for this study. Features of fine-blanked parts such as the blanked edge finish, burr height and die-roll height were measured and reported. It was found that the increase of <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius would reduce the percentage of shear of blanked edge and increase the amount of burr height.

40|$|An {{excellent}} {{quality of}} shearing edge implies that a smooth cutting edge without tearing will be observed {{on the whole}} edge surface. This {{is one of the}} most significant features of the fine-blanking process. To achieve this good blanking edge quality in fine-blanking, quite a large number of factors need to be considered simultaneously during the operation, such as blanking speed, processing material, product shape, lubrication and tool geometry. Thus, the objective of this paper is mainly to study the influence of tool geometry change in fine-blanking for different materials. This is because the nose radius usually seriously deteriorates with increasing service period in mass production, which eventually causes the entire loss of the specific features of the fine-blanking process. Therefore, a tailor-made experimental study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius and the shearing edge quality, such as the shearing edge surface finish, burr height and die-roll height, during fine-blanking for different types of materials. Consequently, findings show that an increase in the <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius produces a higher percentage of fracture of the blanked edge and increases the amount of burr height.

In {{the present}} study, the finite element {{analysis}} has been conducted to investigate the deformation characteristics of forward and backward can extrusion process using AA 1100 aluminum alloy tubes in terms of maximum forming load and extruded length ratio in a combined material flow. A commercially available code is used to conduct rigid-plastic FEM simulation. Hollow tubes are selected as initial billets and the punch geometries follow the recommendation of ICFG. Selected design parametrs involved in simulation includes <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius, die corner radius, frictional condition, and punch face angle. The investigation is foucused on the analysis of deformation pattern and its characteristics in a forward tube extrusion combined simultaneously with backward tube extrusion process main in terms of force requirements for this operation according to various <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radii and backward tube thickness. The simulation results are summarized in terms of load-stroke relationships for different process parameters such as backward tube thickness, die corner radii, and punch face angle, respectively, and pressure distributions exerted on die, and comparison of die pressure and forming load between combined extrusion and two stage extrusion process in sequencial operation.

40|$|Abstract. Combined {{extrusion}} processes {{generally have}} advantages of forming {{in terms of}} the minimum deformation power since the material is pressed through two or more orifices simultaneously. This paper is concerned with the analysis of forming load characteristics of a forward-backward can extrusion process using thick-walled pipe as an initial billet. The combined tube extrusion process was analyzed by using a commercial finite element code. A thick-walled pipe was selected as an initial billet and the punch geometry has been chosen on the basis of ICFG recommendation. Several tool and process parameters were employed in this analysis and they are <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius, backward tube thickness, punch face angle, and frictional conditions, respectively. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of process parameters on the force requirements in combined extrusion process. The possible extrusion process to form a forward-backward tube parts in different process sequences were also simulated to investigate the force requirements in sequential operations, i. e. separate operations. It was easily concluded from the simulation results that lower forming load was predicted for the combined extrusion, compared to those for separate sequential operations. It was also revealed that the <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius and the punch face angle have little effect on the force requirements and the forming load increases significantly as the frictional condition along tool-workpiece interface becomes severe. The simulation results in this study suggest that the combined extrusion process has strong advantage in terms of force requirements as long as the simultaneous material flow into multiple orifices could be closely controlled...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bending has {{significant}} {{importance in the}} sheet metal product industry. Moreover, the springback of sheet metal {{should be taken into}} consideration in order to produce bent sheet metal parts within acceptable tolerance limits and to solve geometrical variation for the control of manufacturing process. Nowadays, the importance of this problem increases because of the use of sheet-metal parts with high mechanical characteristics (High Strength Low Alloy steel). This work describes robust methods of predicting springback of parts in 3 D modelling subjected to bending and unbending deformations. Also the effects of tool geometry in the final shape after springback are discussed. The first part of this paper presents the laboratory experiments in wiping die bending, in which the influence of process variables, such as die shoulder radius, punch-die clearance, <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius and materials properties were discussed. The second part summarises the finite element analysis by using ABAQUS software and compares these results with some experimental data. It appeared that the final results of the FEM simulation are in good agreement with the experimental ones. An optimisation methodology based on the use of experimental design method and response surface technique is proposed in the third part of this paper. That makes it possible to obtain the optimum values of clearance between the punch and the die and the optimum die radius which can reduce the springback without cracking and damage of product...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the forming}} process {{of a central}} hub by radial-forward {{extrusion}} has been analyzed by the rigid-plastic finite element method. In this process, the material flows in radial direction and then deflects 90 degrees into {{the same direction as}} that of punch movement. Radial extrusion is used to produce parts that generally feature a central hub with radial protrusions. Design factors such as mandrel diameter, <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> radius, deflection corner radius, gap width in annular direction, and frictional conditions are applied to the present study by simulation. AA 6063 aluminum alloy is selected as a model material for analysis in the present study. The influence of these design factors on the force requirement during the forming operation and the pressure exerted on the tooling such as the punch and mandrel is investigated and the simulation results are quantitatively summarized in terms of pressure distribution, force-stroke relationships, and maximum force requirement, respectively. The main goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of those process parameters on the deformation pattern in radial-forward extrusion process, especially the effect of deflection corner radius. It has been concluded from the simulation results that a) the frictional condition between workpiece and tool does not affect the punch load very much, but the load supported by mandrel is more or less significantly influenced by the frictional condition compared to that of punch, b) the deflection corner radius turns out to be a major process parameter in terms of maximum force requirement, and c) a similar trend is found in the punch and mandrel forces during the radial extrusion process...|$|E
40|$|Tailor Welded Blanks (TWB) {{technology}} {{is one of}} the several approaches that have been used to reduce the weight of the automobile body. TWBs are made up of two or more blanks having different/same properties (geometry, material etc.) prior to forming. The formability of these blanks depends on material and geometric parameters like strength ratio and thickness ratio. The study of these blanks can be classified {{on the basis of the}} weld orientation chosen viz. transverse weld or longitudinal weld with respect to the major straining direction. This paper studies the formability issues related to transverse TWB by FE simulation. The formability is assessed by analyzing tensile and Limit Dome Height (LDH) tests. The weld region is assumed to be a line in all the simulations. While modeling the tensile test, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation are monitored, and in LDH testing, pole height and maximum load (in near plane strain condition) are monitored. LDH testing shows that as thickness ratio increases, the load bearing capacity and the pole height decreases. There is a contribution from both the thicker and the thinner blank to the overall deforming volume. Failure location analysis shows that there is an abrupt change in the location of the failure from <b>punch</b> <b>nose</b> region to weld line region as the thickness ratio reaches a critical magnitude (1. 08). The study of material properties shows that as the yield strength ratio (S ratio) and strain hardening exponent ratio (N ratio) between the blanks increases, the maximum load which the blank can sustain without failure (UTS) increases. This becomes constant and comparable to that of single sheet at higher N and S ratios...|$|E
