40|$|To {{the extent}} that calcium {{availability}} is the final common mediator of vasoconstrictor responses, calcium entry blockade might interfere with physiologic responses to adrenergic stimulation. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of calcium entry blockade on pressor responses to norepinephrine in pithed, normal Sprague-Dawley rats in two different ways: (1) by evaluating the effects on pressor responsiveness to exogenous norepinephrine during differential blockade of alpha 1 -(prazosin, 0. 3 mg/kg) and of alpha 2 -receptors (yohimbine, 0. 3 mg/kg) and (2) by comparing the effects of calcium entry blockade with those of prazosin and those of rauwolscine (a specific alpha 2 -antagonist) on pressor responses to infusions of both endogenously released norepinephrine (electrical stimulation of the <b>pithing</b> <b>rod)</b> and exogenous norepinephrine. In the presence of alpha 1 -blockade, both nitrendipine (0. 01 mg/kg) and verapamil (0. 6 mg/kg) shifted the norepinephrine pressor dose-response curve to the right but were ineffective in alpha 2 -blocked animals. Furthermore, nitrendipine (range 0. 01 to 0. 3 mg/kg) {{proved to be more}} effective (p less than. 001) against exogenous norepinephrine than against electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, a behavior opposite that of selective alpha 1 -blockade (prazosin) and directionally comparable to that of selective alpha 2 -antagonism (rauwolscine). These data indicate that calcium entry blockade in vivo preferentially antagonizes the alpha 2 -pressor component of exogenous norepinephrine. In addition, both calcium entry blockers were consistently more active (p less than. 01) than rauwolscine (0. 01 to 1 mg/kg) in antagonizing the pressor response to neural stimulation, suggesting that mechanisms different from "classical" alpha 2 -antagonism may also contribute to the overall effect of calcium entry blockade on the adrenergic control of peripheral vascular tone...|$|E
5000|$|Pithing {{is viewed}} as a humane way of killing an animal {{that is going to be}} {{slaughtered}} or destroyed for disease control or humane reasons, for example an animal which is severely injured in an accident. When animals must be killed humanely on farm for disease control purposes or in an emergency situation, disposable <b>pithing</b> <b>rods</b> allow the slaughterman to adopt best practice. They ensure humane slaughter, seal the stunning hole reducing bleeding and so provide good biosecurity protection and eliminate the need to bleed out the animal. Disposable devices will help to ensure that the rods do not represent a risk of disease spread, and that they remain with the animal when it is disposed. In the case of outbreak of notifiable or epidemic disease, government agencies and welfare organisations may develop contingency plans. [...] "Planned stocking" [...] may be necessary to ensure that rods are available at short notice in the event of a disease outbreak.|$|R
50|$|An {{animal is}} first immobilized through captive bolt stunning. A <b>pithing</b> cane or <b>rod</b> is then {{inserted}} into the stunning hole and pushed to its full length, the rod then remains locked in the hole and is disposed of with the animal. Double pithing destroys the spinal cord, thus killing the animal, and also may reduce the reflex kicking which occurs at stunning, and so contribute {{to the safety of}} the slaughterman. This method is also used when dealing with diseased animals in the case of epidemic or notifiable disease.|$|R
